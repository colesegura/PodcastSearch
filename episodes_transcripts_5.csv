Hello, my sweet, beautiful friends. It is ID Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Spring has come to New York at last and I, my friends, am depressed, which sucks. If you've listened to this podcast for any amount of time, you know that I struggle with depression. Hasn't happened in a lot, hasn't happened in a while for me. But I'm definitely in a nice little patch of depression right now. Depression is a creepy thing. It's creepy for a lot of different reasons. One of the reasons it's a creepy thing is because depression, it kind of has its own personality. And one of the first things it wants you to do is to keep, is to just not, is to be secretive, secretive about it. It's the only form of fucking sick. It's one of the only forms of sickness where you're embarrassed by it. Like, if I get the flu, if I got a cold, whatever, if I broke my leg, it's not like I'm gonna be like, oh, I better hide the fact that I have the flu from the world. I don't want people to judge me for it. But depression, good Christ, man. That's one of the things it does is like, don't tell anybody, put on the fucking smile, everything's fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. And that sucks, you know, because you have to like lie to the world. You have to pretend you haven't been taking depression naps. And man, let me tell you the difference between a depression nap and a healthy life nap. Oh, God, it's such a vast gulf in between those two forms of nap, the depression nap, sticky, vertiginous, just fevery, you kind of like, you don't even really sleep, you just sort of go into this like state of super numbness. And then you kind of come out of it, like, even more tired. So that's a shitty thing that I've been doing. And then this blurry kind of like ignoring like shit that is obviously needs to be, you know, dealt with in your life, that's part of it, it wants you to ignore everything. It wants you to cast aside all your responsibilities, forget about any, anything at all and just sort of sink into a quicksand pit of self loathing and anger and just all the like miserable things that if you're someone out there who is depressed or has dealt with this fucking rotten goddamn state of consciousness, you know what I'm talking about? Depression is the God of procrastination. Depression will tell you to put off letting people know that you feel depressed. Depression will tell you to put off going to the gym. Depression will tell you to put off doing those things on your list that you know that you need to accomplish. It'll tell you to put off every single thing until you don't feel quite so depressed. But the problem is, the more you put things off, the more depressed you become. And so this creates a slippery, spirally slope that the longer you procrastinate in the ridiculous hope that the procrastination in some way or another is going to help the depression, the more powerful the fucking depression becomes. It's demonic. So that's what this is. I'm just letting everybody know who listens to this show. I feel a little depressed right now. And that makes me feel a little better because I don't feel like I'm deceiving you guys. And then I'll report in more about it, or maybe I won't. I don't know, but just talking about it feels good. There's other folks out there depressed. Feel free to say hi. Maybe we can start a club. But the main thing is, here's what I'm going to do. That's it. I want to do articulate, see, I'm all foggy and shit. It's really annoying. I want to articulate what I'm going to do. You know, that's a, that's part of magic. That's part of therapy. So here's what I'm going to do. Even though I feel right now, like a dusty, blind cave bat, a hairy cave bat, a hairy, pale, blind cave bat, I'm going to drag my cave bat ass out of my apartment and I'm going to go work out. Even if on the treadmill, I look like the fucking hunchback of Notre Dame or something that just climbed out of a sewer and is running on that fucking treadmill. I'm going to do it. I don't want to do it. Do you know what I want to do? I want to order fucking grub hub and I want to lay on the couch or lay in my bed, fall asleep after I eat, maybe some porn in there somewhere. That's the game. The depression wants me to play with the universe, but I'm going to go to the gym. I'm not going to play that game and I'll tell you what's going to happen after I run in that stupid treadmill. I don't really think it's stupid. That's the depression. Everything's stupid. The other thing that happens when you have depression is everything that you talk about is stupid. You just accidentally use those words for everything. God, this fucking stupid thing. I got to do a stupid email, stupid fuck. Everything becomes dumb. I'm going to watch my language. I'm going to go to the gym. I'm going to run on the treadmill and I bet I'm going to feel better right away. Then after that, do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to come home and I'm going to stand underneath a Wim Hof level cold shower. That's the third thing I'm going to do. Then I'm going to take care of all this other shit I've been putting off. That's what I'm going to do. My depression doesn't like it. I can already feel myself making excuses, but rather than going back and trying to re-record this thing to make it sound more nuanced or to sound like less of a confessionalist, because I know that this is not a very fashionable proclamation, and I really would much rather be announcing to you that I discovered some new system of meditation or exercise or magic that had reversed my depression and that I felt fucking great, but that's not where I'm at right now. Possibly by doing this, maybe I'll be able to report in and I'll be feeling a little better. I don't know. I'm not going to always come back on every episode moaning about my depression, by the way, so don't worry. It's important to announce it. I feel like if I announce it, maybe that gives some of you permission to announce it, so you don't have to keep hiding this ridiculous form of mental illness, which is so ridiculous. It's ridiculous that you are afraid to say when you're feeling bad to the world that this thing doesn't want you to say that. It's ridiculous. It's very similar to when you're getting conned. I don't know if you guys have ever been conned before, but when you get conned by a con artist, you know you're getting conned because there's certain things you can't talk about around the con artist. If you've ever been to Grateful Dead parking lot, you know what I'm talking about. At least this happened to me. I got conned for like a day or two by this professional con artist, and it was amazing the tricks that were being played on us as a group and how easy it is to succumb to that con and depression as a con artist because depression does all the things a con artist does. It wants you to lie to the world and pretend everything's fine. It wants you to pretend that it's okay, like it's an okay state of consciousness to be in. It's totally normal to take two naps in the afternoon and sleep till one o'clock. Totally normal. I'm just chilling, man. Can I enjoy life? Can I just enjoy life? God, mind, really? You're going to bother me about this? I'm just enjoying my life, man. This is what animals do, dogs. Animals sleep all the time. No. No. Depression. That is not normal. That is depression. So that's the trick it plays. And you got to just tell people you're feeling woozy because that helps. I already feel fractionally better right now. And I know as soon as I go to the gym, I'm going to feel that much better. And look, I'm not saying there's a quick fix to depression. There's a reason people like us get depressed. There's all kinds of external variables in our environment that we have to deal with. You might need therapy. I might need to go back to a therapist. I love therapy, by the way. It's another thing I put off getting. You got to deal with it. That's the point. But the first step, open up about it. Tell people. Second step that has worked for me in the past. Go exercise. Go outside. Go into the world. Get sun on your face. Third step, drink a fuck ton of water. Take cold showers. All these ridiculous things that essentially whatever your depression tells you to do, do the opposite. When it wants you to nap, do push ups. When it wants you to keep it a secret, call someone that you love and tell them that you're not feeling that great right now. When it wants you to eat shitty food, get a salad. And the whole time it will punish you for this. It will make you feel like you're having to force healthy stuff into your mouth, but just do it. And then somewhere through this practice, hopefully it'll get better. And if not, then you got to take it to the next level in this ridiculous war that those of you who deal with depression like I do know and have experienced. I don't know what part of the battle you're in right now, but the unfortunate thing about depression is it comes back. If you've had it, it can come back. It can creep in. It creeps. So, all right, there you go. That was fun. You guys feel better now? Sorry. I had to unload on you, man. If I don't tell you what's going on, I don't even know what the point of doing this fucking podcast is. If I can't just tell you how I feel. If I look, if I get depressed and I don't tell you that I might as well just turn into Jimmy Fallon, you know, no offense to Jimmy Fallon or whatever. I mean, you're doing your job or whoever, Bill O'Reilly or whoever gets in front of the goddamn camera and acts like they're doing great every day. They stay in the character. You know, that's not what podcasting is. That's a different art. Podcasting is a different form than that stuff. And the form is that we say how it's going as much as we can. So that's what's going on with me right now. And I appreciate you listening and allowing me to confess that to you, my sweet friends, because it makes me feel like I'm podcasting again and not bullshitting. All right. All right. Okay, that feels a little better. We do have a great episode for you today. It's about one of my favorite topics, something that perhaps I should be doing to deal with this depression. I don't know. Today's guest, Adam Strauss has a wonderful one person show called The Mushroom Cure about how he treated his OCD, another rotten form of mental illness with mushrooms. And most recently about this ayahuasca retreat, he went on in a night where he had to confront his darkest self in the most intense way. This is a very good podcast. And it's a story of adventure. It's a story of the dark place that psychedelics and plant medicines take you to as part of the healing process. And I'm very grateful to Adam for being so incredibly honest on this episode. And I think that may have inspired me a little bit to also be honest. That's the cool thing about trying to be honest as much as you can as maybe it inspires other people. And Adam certainly inspired me in this episode. So it's a good one. And we're going to jump right into it. But first, some very quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the lovely people over at blueapron.com. Blueapron. It's the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country. Here's what happens. You sign up for Blueapron and these sweet darlings will deliver to your door delicious food from over 150 local farms, fisheries, and ranchers across the United States. Look, if you're like me, some depressed shrub, then you've just been ordering food from Grubhub, right? Because it's easy or you got to eat too much or whatever. You just go down to the store and get some fucking ramen and piss in it and pretend that's a goddamn meal. It's not. One of the primordial joys in life outside of sex and exercise is cooking your own food, cooking your own meal. It's a way to connect you directly to the universe instead of being disconnected or, I don't know, being illiterate when it comes to how to cook. You never forget a good recipe. When you get a good recipe, you've got the good recipe. I have a great simple recipe that I love. I used to call it a poverty platter, but it doesn't matter whether I have money or not. It's very simple, no big deal. Just some rice mixed in with some vegetables, maybe mixed in with some chicken or something like that. Some special sauces in there. It's just a simple thing. Somebody taught me how to cook it. Or like, here's something I'll tell you, man, this is ridiculous. I shouldn't even be proud of this, but I went over to my friend Johnny Pemberton's house and he whipped up this great breakfast, which was just some eggs, some spinach, which he tapped down on the eggs and he mixed that in with some goat cheese. It was delicious. Ever since then, I've got that. I know how to make that. I add things, I take them away, whatever. That's a permanent thing you give yourself when you learn how to cook a meal. So Blue Apron is like a combination food delivery service chef school, if you ask me, because they send you exactly the right amount of ingredients with these wonderful cards that are designed perhaps for people who may, I'm not saying Blue Apron is specifically, whether you're a professional chef or not, you're going to like it. But if you're somebody like me, it's nice to have a laminated card that has step by step instructions. And it's nice to have perfectly measured out ingredients, just like in the cooking shows. And that's what Blue Apron does. And once you learn how to cook one of these things, you know how to cook it forever. And of course, there's a social aspect to cooking food for people. It's social to have somebody come over and fix them some beautiful meal. And it's spiritual too. It really is. It's a true form of love to cook food and give it to somebody else. And also when your house fills with the smell of a home cooked meal, it makes your house feel like a house. It's an ancient smell, the smell of cooking. It's one of the oldest smells, friends.

Also my sweet lovely children of the wind. I'm going to be doing some live shows coming up. I'd love for you to come. I promise I will not break down in tears on stage or take a nap while I'm performing. You can come see me in San Francisco. I'm going to be the independent theater. That's coming right up. That's April 26th. And then I will also be performing at on the April 27th in LA. And that's at the Harmon Castle in Burbank. All these dates are on my website. You can get tickets there. There's lots of great ways. Oh, also I'll be doing a live podcast at the Bell House on May 16th. Friends, there are many ways for you to help this podcast if you feel so inclined. The number one way to listen and to not judge me as you listen. The second way if you're going to buy something from Amazon, why not go through the link located at dunkintrussell.com. If you scroll down and look at the bottom left hand corner of the page, there's a little Amazon link. You click on that, zap through, and voila, you're in Amazon land. And let me tell you, I did take the most satanic leap a person can take. An Orwellian leap, friends. And I know what many of you are going to say. What the fuck are you thinking? Why did you do that? I got an Alexa. Okay. I did it. Maybe it's a sign of the depression. I don't know. Did I want a little robot sitting in my living room where I don't have to get up and turn the lights on and off? I can literally lay in my bed prior to a depression nap, jerk off to some kind of rotten porn. Forgive me, I don't mean to say negative things about porn and then yell to my Alexa to turn off my bedroom lights. I don't even have to get up. I can just lay there a trembling mass of depression meat and the Alexa will turn the lights off in my house. It's a blast. Who wants to switch filthy light switches when you have this beautiful little robot being that you could say to it order toilet paper, you know, Alexa order final exit. Just kidding about that, by the way, but it is incredible. And I highly recommend it as long as you're comfortable with knowing that potentially the CIA is using it to listen to you. It's great. So order an Alexa. I'm telling you, I know it sounds insane, but it's pretty awesome. That's what I, and also once you do that, you like end up, it's probably, maybe you shouldn't order an Alexa. You know, I don't know. Is it good to be able to like come home drunk and slur out some comic book that you want to order so that suddenly bought, Hey, what the fuck is this box? You know, that's what starts happening is boxes start showing up and you're like, Oh, I guess at 4am the other night, I thought I needed some Swiffer wipes. So that's kind of cool. The thing is, if you're going to do this, go through our link, get your, get your Alexa through the Amazon link. They will give us a very small percentage of whatever you buy and it costs you nothing. It's a great way to support this podcast. We also have t shirts, posters and stickers at Duncan trussell.com. They're all there for you. Much thanks to those of you who have set up a subscription service. Some folks have gone that far, which I'm grateful for. They pay a monthly fee to the podcast every month. That's pretty cool. You don't have to do any of this stuff, man. I really mean it. I'm just glad that you listen. You can't imagine how therapeutic it is for me to have this. And I hope you know that I don't take it for granted and I'm incredibly grateful that I get to have this as a job. I love you guys. So there we go. That's all the announcements. We got a really good podcast for you today, everybody. And today's guest, as you heard before, is a comedian. He has a wonderful show called the mushroom cure. It's going to be opening up in San Francisco soon. And he's a psychonaut and a brilliant human and a really smart brave person. And I feel really lucky to have had this conversation with him because I think it is one of the things that it began to push me in the right direction out of the fly pit, that sticky fly pit of depression. And that's one of the other wonderful things about doing this podcast is you get to be around inspirational people. So now, everybody, please welcome a man who has a story of a confrontation that happened in the dark jungles of Peru under the influence of that oily, strange tea, ayahuasca. So send out those tendrils of love. Open your hearts. Open your minds. Let Adam feel the healing blasts coming from those of you who know how to send healing blasts. Please welcome to the DTFH Adam Strauss. It's been Duncan Trussell. Adam, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming here today. Yeah, thanks for having me, Duncan. Man, I just I saw you stand up recently and was blown away by it and how you are really like bringing the psychedelic universe into your stand up in a really beautiful way. I think it's just cool to see somebody translating that into comedy. You just got back from Peru. Yes. Tell me about this trip, please. So Peru, it was, well, I was, as you know, we've talked about it a little bit. I was doing what you might expect a guest on the DTFS to be doing in Peru. I went for primarily an ayahuasca retreat at a place called Niue Rao. And it wasn't a decision I made lightly. My period of sort of heavy psychedelic, I wouldn't say experimentation because I was using it as a means to an end, which arguably is the wrong way to do psychedelics, but we can get to that later. But the period of where I was using fairly regularly, that ended years ago. And I really haven't had much psychedelic experience since then. A little bit of the sort of, what is it? It's the Alan Watts, if you get the message, hang up the phone. Yes. Though, you know, I think there's different perspectives on that. But I felt like I had kind of gotten what I came for years ago. And my trip started to feel a little bit repetitive after that point. So I stepped away from it. But in recent years, you know, there's always, there's always more work to do. There's more integration with self in the world. And, and of course, I'm, you know, I always avidly read about all the research going on with psychedelics. And I started feeling like, yeah, you know, now would be a different phone call, because I'm a different person now. I'm facing different challenges. And so I was interested in kind of delving back into the psychedelic waters. But I didn't, I wanted to do it, when you look at the research that's coming out of like Hopkins and NYU, and the results are phenomenal. I mean, life changing stuff with a variety of conditions, with a small number of uses. But the key thing is they're very carefully controlling the setting there. And the mindset to some extent, as much as you can by preparing people, setting intention, all of that stuff. And so unfortunately, we're not yet in a time where I can, you know, sign up for psilocybin clinic at NYU, unless if you have a certain condition. So I started thinking about it, and it seemed like the closest thing I could get to, I don't want to say controlled experience, because the beauty of this stuff is that with psychedelics, it's never fully controlled. And that's, I think, why there's so much potential for learning and self discovery. But a somewhat structured mediated experience. So I was looking around for them, I realized the closest thing now would be would be ayahuasca. And I'd never had much interest in ayahuasca. I'd actually had this is your first ayahuasca trip. Well, I had a few in New York recently, I'd never done it until until December of this most recent year. So until about four months ago. And I always kind of rejected it because I dislike the idea of having a shaman of having some sort of hierarchy of saying this person is an authority. Because ultimately, I believe, you know, they're my own experience and my own interpretations of that experience are as valid as anyone else's. And here's what's interesting, though, what's because you just articulated. It's really curious. And I really love this. Yeah, there are two clear communities that have developed when it comes to spirituality or advancement of the self. There is the like the Ram Dass Satsang, the meditators, the yoga people, the tantric people, the Buddhists. And what you find there is they like teachers, they like the hierarchy, they like the game of sitting at the feet of the guru. And then in the psychedelic satsang, you hear again and again, I don't want to fucking guru. This is insane. I don't want to play this hierarchical game. But I just think it's interesting that there is a clear cut divide, because both communities, I think, share similar intention in their practices, which is they want to improve themselves and by that improvement, improve the world. They want to heal themselves, heal the world. And yet they have two radically different ideas of how to go about this. And one way is this, like, I, the teacher is the plant medicine and myself. That's it. Not some fucking shaman, not some guy in a blanket. I'm not going to play that game. It's too dangerous. And look at, look, we know that it doesn't work. That's the psychedelic or the staunch. Right. The extreme view. Yeah. But you are reflecting that idea. Yeah. And I think that was my idea. And I think part of it is these experiences, well, experience period, the experience we're undergoing right now, I mean, any experience is so ultimately unknowable, you know, it's an experience. But once you start categorizing it and putting into language, that's not the experience. It's, well, you know, the Buddhist finger pointing at the moon. Sure. But I think psychedelic experiences particularly seem, you know, bizarre and unfathomable. And well, not, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I think we create our own meaning. We decide our own story, our own narrative. And especially with psychedelics, I didn't like the idea of someone else's cosmology sort of impinging on my interpretation. Someone saying, Oh, you saw a snake. Well, that's Mother ayahuasca accepting you. Or you saw a black lotus. That means, you know, whatever, you're, you're going to get male pattern baldness in six months. Right. But the idea of, which now having experienced it, I know it really, it's not that black and white, but that was sort of my idea of what it would be like. And I, and, and yeah, I wanted to be able to make my own meaning free of anyone else's because everyone has their own baggage, everyone has their own history. But this is still okay. So like if we think about this, the psychedelic experience, and what's, I think, really curious about it is there is a subjectivity, but there's also an objective experience that people report regardless of commonalities. You know, yes. And that commonality would, so any place where there's commonalities or any place where there does appear to be some evidence of a terrain. Yeah. If that, if that, if it's pure subjectivity, I get it. Like, I don't need you to tell me what this fucking thing like dream guides. Like I'll have a dream where whatever, you know, like I'll see a, I don't know, like an old lady tied, tied, trapped in a basement, creepy dream. And I'll tell my girlfriend and she'll like go to a dream journal and look up like old ladies. Well, here's what it could mean three things. And you're like, no, mind works. I don't buy this shit. But, but when we're dealing with like DMT, Iowa, apparently, Iowa's guy haven't tried it. I would even say mushrooms, the geometries that you see in MDMA, and the art that you see from, from DMT, which I guess is a Iowa's give basically freebase Iowa Oscar, injected Iowa Oscar, whatever. You do see this commonality of form, which would then imply that if there is a commonality of form, and there's a person who has more experience in that terrain, then sure, there could be a place for a kind of tour guide who at least could be like, you know, for example, when I smoked DMT, I had this fucking, I got healed by DMT. I had this pain in my chest for years and years and years and years, like this never ending dull, stupid ache in my chest. Like heart area, would you say? Yeah, heart area. Gone to the doctor about it, like I'd gotten like scans, like it was, never mind. So I smoked DMT, saw these like tubes coming out of, I don't know where, like beautiful little tubes that went right into the place where I was hurting, some impression of voice saying like, take it, take it, just take it, you know, like, relax, let us do this, let us, you know, it's kind of in a hurry. Let us work on you. Let us work, yeah. And then, and since then, gone. Now this is years of pain. And like, I remember telling the person who was taking me through this about that, and he's like, oh yeah, we call those like the little doctors, I think is what he said, he had a name for it, like he's like, oh yeah, yeah, those things, they, those are the things that heal you. Like that's the appendage that comes from, and it's like, oh, so at least now I know there's commonality. So and now that makes it, that deepens the mystery at least. So it's like, holy fucking shit, you mean I experienced a thing other than something from my subconscious or what was so anyway, so my POV on it is we can have these teachers, it's just you have to be very careful because, you know, you get a bad teacher, you're going to get your entire, especially with something like psychedelics, then you're in danger of a funhouse mirror effect, whatever this terrain is being warped through the teacher's ego to fit some power dynamic he wants to impose upon you. So I see. Or things he's not consciously aware of. I mean, I think that people can have the best intentions and do terrible harm. Absolutely. That's what they say, you know, like that. Well, right, that's not an original thought, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Well, yeah, or don't start like, you know, like if you're going to be a fucking, you know, driver's ed teacher, you better really know how to drive. Yeah, you know, because if you don't, you could really cause car, people could really hurt themselves. If they follow you, if you're going to teach someone how to parachute, you better know how to parachute and parachute it a bunch and be really certain. Well, these things are serious. If you're going to teach a doctor how to do surgery, you better teach him how to do surgery the exact right way. Cause what if he does this operation? So I get it. So we have to be very careful. But anyway, go ahead. I just wanted to point out that there, there isn't, you are a upstanding member of the psychedelic community. And so I think it's interesting to hear that POV because it seems to be one of the repeating POVs in that particular spiritual path. Well, and, and I will say, just to cut to the punchline at this point, I subscribed to your POV after spending time at this retreat center and even before I came there. And I think part of that sort of radical individualism, I mean, you know, and we can talk more about this, but as you know, I, my sort of Western medical diagnosis would be obsessive compulsive disorder. Yes. That's what initially inspired me to do psychedelics. After reading a study out of the University of Arizona where that psilocybin had dramatic effects on treatment resistant OCD. And I am, you know, I've, I'm doing a lot better now. I wouldn't say I'm cured. But I think I retain certain traits that are characteristic of sort of the OCD thinking. And one is kind of a self-reliance to a fault sometimes feeling like, well, no one really knows better than me. Right. I accept the expertise of people in certain domains, but when it comes to stuff like interpreting experience, it's kind of like, well, yeah. And it's also a, yeah, sort of a lack of trust sometimes. Yeah. But as you pointed out, trust is you, you want to be very judicious in who you trust when it comes to this stuff. Yes. Like a parachute instructor or a surgeon, because, yeah, you're in an incredibly on psychedelics, open, vulnerable, malleable state. Certainly in the ayahuasca cosmology, at least the place I studied, there is absolutely a belief in entities and forces that are not necessarily all benevolent. Right. That can, you know, worm their way into your consciousness and into your body and into your spirit if you're not careful, if the space is not well protected. Yeah. So you can get some parasites. Yeah. That's a good way to, good way to put it. Yeah. Yeah. So, so now after this experience in Peru, so you asked what was it like? It was, well, so I hadn't done ayahuasca before, done a bunch of psychedelics, stopped several years ago after the OCD had gotten significantly better, not solely as a result of the psychedelics. I look at them as sort of necessary, but not sufficient. Right. They showed me possibilities. Yeah. Ultimately, I still had to make different choices. Right. But they did, they facilitated an opening that made change possible. OCD is really, really rough on a person. Yeah. It's a motherfucker. It really is. And it's kind of like, I think what's shitty about it. I mean, there's a lot of things that seem shitty about it, but with depression, nobody really makes fun of depression. I don't know if I did this joke when last time we did a show together, but where I talked about, you know, I said, you know, I have obsessive compulsive disorder, you know, which if you have OCD, raise your hand six times. Yeah. And then I go on to how people don't take it seriously. There's a cleaning service in New York called OCD cleaners, which I think I did see. Maybe I'm reflecting that. Yeah. I'm not going to do the whole bit, but absolutely that is you hear all. And when I say that on stage, if anyone has OCD, raise your hand six times, often people will raise their hand and invariably I'll interrogate them. I'll say, what are your symptoms? And sometimes they legitimately do have OCD. Sometimes it can take a little bit of a dark or a sort of intervention type turn, but more often it's like, oh, you know, I just need to have everything really well organized. Well, that's not OCD. That's you like being organized. Yeah. But having said that, I think that does reflect a choice, which is OCD, and I would say most quote unquote mental illnesses, and I can get into why I put it in quotes, but you know, I think there's a number of reasons, but let's go with the phrase mental illnesses exist on a continuum where most people have some degree of tendency. Right. And I think that's especially true of OCD, where, especially in a city like New York, most people have a tendency, at least in some areas of their life, to try to over control. If I, if I'm like on a marijuana bender, if I remember when I was really like eating too much weed and getting like, just all the constantly eating words, I'm not enjoying it anymore. Like it's, it's become like, yeah, we can be addictive psychologically. Absolutely. Or just you're, you're in a, you don't even realize you're just in a constant state of anxiety, because you, you know, you have to take breaks with marijuana. You can't. Yeah. It's good to take breaks. So, but I was in kind of the midst of, you know, like you're walking your dog and you turn a corner and you're jumping. So, but in that, when I was experiencing that, I think I can remember getting a, like correct me if this isn't OCD, but I would leave the house and I would always have to go back to check to make sure I blew a candle out or that the oven wasn't on. I kept thinking like, fuck, I'm almost positive that, and I would be, you know, a mile away like, no, no, oh shit, I know I definitely left the burner on and the fucking stove. I'd have to go back, check it. It's fine. You leave. And then it's like, God, this is OCD. Like this is the thing. Yeah. Being triggered by like consuming massive amounts of marijuana every day, some latent OCD, and it sucks because it like your, your entire, basically for me, it was like, okay, I want this to be the greatest day of all time. I want it to be a great day. And to, for it to be a great day, all the components of- Do you mean you want it to be a great day? This is a general mindset in your life or at this particular time you're really stoned and- You're still, you're like, hey, I'm going to go see a movie. Right. You're trying to perfect everything. I'll get the right degree of stoned. It's the right movie. I like to really enjoy it. I have to make sure my house isn't burning down. Right. And so then, so it's a mind plague because it's just, it's, it's, it's popping up as a blockage or some terrible blockage because you really can't sink into the universe. You're just always trying to spin dials. Yeah. And that's a, that's a really rough spot to be in all the time. Yeah. Yeah. And I, and I really wasn't at all the time. That's what drove me to psychedelics initially. And I'd been on, you know, everything. I'd been on Prozac, Paxol, Zoloft, Xanax, Afexer, Lomikdoll. How long, when did it start? Well, so I always had tendencies towards, I'd say a high baseline level of anxiety, which I'd say is still fairly true. And, but it didn't assume this form of OCD, this form of, let's say, control until actually I had a significant relationship end. And I didn't make the connection until I started talking about this on stage with my, with my solo show. Prior to that, I never really saw the causal relationship, but it was very soon after this relationship ended that this anxiety, this sort of free floating anxiety, assumed this, this behavioral form, which for me, the OCD, and I don't even know if we've ever talked about this before, it was about decision making. Okay. So an example would be, well, I'd make a decision, let me come up with a specific example. I would put on a short. Yeah. And, and then I would find some flaw, you know, the collar spreads too wide. It's not, there's a slight stain, whatever it is. So I'd take it off and put on another shirt. Let me put, let me slow it down a little bit more. I'd feel anxiety about this perceived imperfection. Yeah. My mind would start coming up with scenarios, well, what if, you know, I'm doing a show tonight, what if, what if a manager's in the audience and they notice my sloppy shirt and I don't, these sort of catastrophic scenarios that weren't totally implausible, but, and that would drive my anxiety. And finally, I'd say, all right, I'm going to put on a different shirt. And when I put on a new shirt, I would actually feel relief, the anxiety would go down for a little bit. But then, then I'd start thinking, well, wait a second, but this shirt has this problem, you know, maybe the shirt I had on last time, that actually wasn't that bad. Let me put that one back on. Jesus. And I could spend hours doing this. Wow. Hours. Hours, hours. So you would look up in like two hours. Yeah, it was not, not always, but yes, it consistently, it would, you know, that could be an hour of my day. And then I'd leave the apartment and I'd start walking to work. And, and I'd, this is, these are examples I cite in my show too. I'm walking up one side of the street and then I noticed there's more sun on the other side of the street. But the side of my, his trees and, you know, in New York nature is precious. I love trees. I love the green, but sunlight, that's a physiologic necessity. That's vitamin D. And I would start, so I would walk up, I was living on 8th Avenue at this point. I would walk up 8th Avenue almost every day zigzagging back and forth down the street. I'd say like a crazy person, but it's New York. No one noticed, but, uh, well, it sounds like just an amplification of the human experience. Yes. Where we never know what the right thing is. And that's fucking terrifying. That's why being human is hard, among other reasons. Yeah. And you're always penduluming back and forth to like, you get in this, you think, Oh, that's the sweet spot. Yeah. Go towards that. And oh, shit. I left the sweet spot and not like, why did I leave that? And then, but it's, this is like, you're defining in one walk down the street. You're defining, I think, what's the pattern of most many people's lives, which is that infinite. It's like my, you know, I watch my dog pick a place in the bed. Like it's an arbitrary spot, but then the dog will start doing this primordial, like the spinning and spinning and spinning and kicking and then like go through this whole ritual just to sit in this rather arbitrary, the whole, it seems arbitrary to me, but for the dog or for whatever is inside the dogs, genetic structure is somehow just, this is a very important thing that it has to do. So it's interesting to hear what you're talking about and realize like, Oh, this is the reason that Jack Cornfield teaches mindfulness practice. Choices. It's just so, and I think part of it comes down to evolution. I've been thinking about this because we evolved in a context where choices that we had to make, they had a few features that our choices today often don't have. Yeah. First of all, they were genuinely life or death. If you're deciding whether to go into this cave to forge for food, that may be your last decision. Right. Second of all, they were time limited. You either went into the cave, you didn't go into the cave, you didn't spend weeks thinking about, should I go into that cave or not? You'd starve to death by that point in time. Right. And third of all, there were just fewer choices, many fewer choices. So I feel like there is maybe some evolutionarily adaptive reason why we tend to, at least for me, I have an intellectual awareness that the choice of whether to have a drink of water right now, which I am doing, is minor. I don't even think of it as a choice most of the time, but it's a part of me that if I stop and think of any choice, it really does feel life or death. It does feel high stakes. Wow. Okay. And I think maybe that's one of the things that puts me on an extreme end of that sort of OCD continuum. Gotcha. But I think that's true of other people, maybe not to that degree where I don't think we necessarily evolved to say, all right, this is an unimportant choice. So I'm not going to worry about it. It's more like, I think for a lot of people choices become unimportant only relative to more important choices, right? If, you know, if this desk catches on fire, I'm not going to worry about whether or not I should adjust my cushion because now a more important choice. But I think in the absence of more important choices, any choice can seem important. You're always playing like you're always playing high stakes poker. Yeah. Everything you do is this, if you're, if your mind is somehow attached these everyday actions to this kind of mortal imperative, then you are playing this Russian roulette every time you take it. Your brain thinks every time you take a sip of water, it's Russian roulette. And let me be, yeah, clear. I'm not at that level now. And I wasn't that bad in terms of like a drink of water, even at my worst, but I do think this might be said for the fact that, I mean, what are evolutionary progress? Well, number one is to survive. I'd say number two is reproduced, but number one is survive. Yes. And the tool that we have is agency. We have choice arguably, but it certainly feels like we have choice, like we are free will. Yeah, we could just stay there for now. I mean, I buy free will. A lot of people say it's a trick of the mind to deal with the problem. Yeah, I buy it too, though. I buy it too. Experientially, well, first of all, if you don't buy it, you're kind of in an existential corner. It doesn't seem to give you much freedom or reason for living. Well, it's curious because, you know, even like the free will argument is, it comes up in the Bhagavad Gita. And it's this idea that, you know, like going into battle, should he fight or not? Well, it's this idea of there's these three modes of material nature, the mode of ignorance, the mode of passion and the mode of goodness. And these three, three like, they're called the gunas are the sort of when they're in that picture in the Hare Krishna version of the Bhagavad Gita, it shows a person and above him are these three like deities who are marionetting the person. And these three things are your karmic predilection. So depending on what your balance of these things are, that's what your decision making process is actually stemming from. It's not really stemming from free will. It's just stemming from these habitual predilections. And interestingly enough, if you swap, if you go over to like the Gurdjieff camp, he says the very same thing. It's like, you have never made a free choice. Like whatever you think you're doing is imitation. You humans imitate and then the imitation becomes habit and the habit becomes the different mechanisms that create you the way you react to the world. And so even your decision about which mechanism you're going to use to react to the world, that decision itself is another mechanism that you learned. So we have these gears that are spinning that where none of the gears at all are based on any kind of autonomy. It's all a kind of in the same way, like your heart. It's like, okay, your heart is beating. Thank God, our hearts don't have free will. Thank God, our heart is like, I am just gonna, you know, I don't think I'm going to beat today. Like I'm done. This is, this sucks. Right. Death, instant death, right? And so then if you look, okay, well, the heart certainly doesn't have free will. It's not autonomous. It just beats when it's supposed to be my metabolism certainly doesn't have free will my cellular process hopefully doesn't have free will my brain, you know, my neurochemistry, the crazy whatever's going on up there. It's like, well, where's the free will there? It's not there. I dilation, you know, et cetera, et cetera, physiological functions are not autonomous. And yet somewhere in this field of complete non autonomy, there is some autonomous agent. No, no, not at all. Certainly you can't find a physiological mechanism to justify free will. Right. And then subjectively experiential. That's the only real justification I come back to. Well, that's it. And then, you know, that thing is about that. And again, so the, so why do we want to be why do we want free will we want free will because free will gives you a sense of self, right? If you don't have free will, what the fuck are you? You're just dust in the wind, man. You're just like some kind of like the heart of the universe. You're just another non autonomous organ and an infinite array of phenomena that is, you know, not really that special because you're, you're any more special than it is to be part of an entire living breathing universe, right? So it's like, yeah, anyway, free will for now, for the sake of the game of being human, right? Let's say we're on this level, let's, yeah. Well, I'm making this the right. That's part of the part of what we come here with is this illusion you're saying of a free will, but I'm curious. So then what does with the Bhagavad Gita, what, what is the causal mechanism ultimately? Okay, so we have that. Oh, so the idea is like we have the controller and the controlled, right? So the idea is what is the controlled and what is the controller, right? So, and I think the word for that is Ishwara, the supreme controller, Ishwara. That's God, Krishna, whatever is the supreme controller. And so the universe is springing from the Godhead. And all of us are droplets that have sprung out of this like ultimate, progenitive, super intelligence that is beyond comprehension. But for sake of being human, we have to try to put it words to it. So we use the word Bhagavan, which means like the ultimate of ultimates, the most beautiful, the most well, the most intelligent, the most wealthy, the most famous, the most incredible, superlatives, the ultimate superlatives. So it's like, or a better way to put it is high tech. You could say the, the cutting edge of technology is God. God is the crest of the wave of technology flowing into time. And all technology and all of us are just sort of droplets, springing off of this thing, coming into eternally, infinitely, transforming itself into the present moment. So that's the controller. But because we are all like droplets of the controller, we want to control, right? Because we are like, like a photon, this is the example Prabhupada gives, like you get a photon coming out of the sun. It's not the sun, but it came from the sun. It has qualities of the sun. It has within of it, it's infinitesimally smaller than the sun, but maybe the fractal inside of it is still sunlight. So in the same way, sunlight, right? sunlight. So in the same way, we're Godlike in that book in Genesis, emanation from, from this Godhead. Yes. And so we have the same predilections. We want to control. So this is the human problem is because a human being comes into the world and wants to start functioning like God. So a human being wants to control everything. That's what our predilection is. We want to control. And when you see like examples of it all the time, you will see there are controllers out there. Bosses is what we call them presidents, emperors, kings, controllers, they control. And then there's the controlled. And so the idea of it is that the more you relinquish your idea of being in control personally and then submit that to the idea of there being some kind of supreme authority that's actually controlling things and that you take on the relationship, not of the controller, but of the controlled. You take on the relationship of not of the king, but of the servant to that which is controlling, then your life suddenly hits this kind of harmony because the fundamental nature of a human being, according to this particular style of yoga, bhakti yoga, is to serve. Right. That's what we're here to do. Not to be served, to serve, not to control, but to be controlled and to be controlled by not the wrong things. Because this is the right things to be controlled by nature, you know, to be controlled by the flow of harmony of life and not by some dude in a suit telling you to like go fix the copier or some woman or man who's telling you, like, you can't wear that when you go out or you can't go out or where are you going or what are you doing? No, not like that, but to be in the control of some higher and so anyway, that's the essence of the thing. And so the supreme controller is what's pulling the strings here, but because God is so merciful and wants us to feel, to learn, I guess, God is like, oh, yeah, do it. Take the wheel. Take the wheel. So we do, this is what I'm not clear on. So do we have genuine free will? I mean, and we can then choose to use that in the service of something greater than ourselves or to try to, you know, profit this illusion of control, but do we actually have free will? I think in this equation, it's like we refer to, and it could be a cop out, the concept of simultaneous, oneness and difference. So that's what you kind of have to refer to. It's like, yeah, right now you definitely have control. There's no question about it in this particular moment. There's a famous story in my college. There was a professor there, John Casey, who recently passed away and amazing human. And there's a famous story. I guess there's some kid in one of his philosophy classes who really love to harp on the idea of how no one really has free will. And I think, and again, I'm sorry for anyone who knows John Casey, if this isn't true or I'm fucking up the story, but as I recall, he grabbed a piece of chalk and threw it at the kid. It was like, I just decided to throw that like that is free will, you know, like, shut up, you know, like right now in this thing, yes, it's here, you know, and if you refer to simultaneous oneness and difference, then we are all this like infinitesimally small emanation of some ultimate autonomous super intelligence. Then there's some total of all things. Who's controlling what in that, you know, like which brain cell is making you decide to throw the chalk? Who the fuck knows? Where does the initial electrical impulse starts that begins the cascade that brings your hand to the chalk to throw it at the annoying student? Who fucking knows? In that situation, there's no way to really tell. It's an organismic decision, you know. So if there's a total or perhaps extra organismic, I mean, it could mean because where does that impulse that electrical impulse originate from? And then you get into first causes, which is which is the which is the Godhead. And so so so in the sum total of all things, is there autonomy for the individual? Well, probably not. But in the in the micro frame by frame moment to moment experience of past, present and future that we're all in right now. Yes, I am making decisions. I decided to be kind to someone today. Or I decided to be an asshole. I decided to have the third beer. Or I, you know, I didn't decide that and maybe that decision was like being like warped by addiction or warped by some other thing. But still in the innate fundamental decision is like otherwise we why do we even have a fucking justice system? Why do we have laws? Yeah, why do we have why are we executing serial kill? Why are we executing murders? Why are putting people in jail? They didn't have free will. They were just fucking tidal flows of activity that like shit, man, they shouldn't go to jail. There's no reason to do court to do trials anymore. You know, so anyway, on one level free will on another level, we could say we are part of an infinite decision that's being made in the present moment to be, you know, I am. Yeah, the only certainty, you know, sort of the I think therefore I am. Yeah, right. I exist in this moment. That's the only thing I can know whatever what that I is is, of course, unknowable. What this moment is is unknowable. But something is here we are. Here we are. But then when you and but it's a fun experiment to be like, Oh, okay, well, I'm going to be a servant to the original decision. Instead of I'm going to be making these decisions myself. It really takes a load off of you, man. It's a pain in the ass to imagine that you're doing all this. Yeah. And that was part of my recovery as well was the idea of service to other people who are struggling with similar things. And yeah, and trying to connect to something beyond myself. And you know, I said earlier, psychedelics sort of showed me possibilities. And that was one way they were helpful is giving me an openness to an openness to the idea of being able to connect to something even if I can't grasp what that thing is or even know that that thing is. I mean, ultimately, you know, it's called the leap of faith for a reason. Yeah. So and that thing, you know, that's the thing and that connection is the healer that I would imagine that that's got to be as someone who wants to be in control to just give yourself the idea that just maybe there is something that knows a little bit better than you do what the right thing is. This is why I love like the Lord's prayer, you know, because what is the Lord's prayer? Our Father who ought in heaven, how it would be thy name. Now, of course, when you like read the actual translation, it's way, it's way cool. I was just reading the actual Aramaic translation. But with the things gotten translated into like the Kings English. So it becomes kind of authoritarian and stuff. You end up with like our Father who ought in heaven, how it would be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily. This is like when they ask Jesus, what should you pray? How do you pray? And he said, this is what you should pray. But as he wasn't saying, literally say this prayer, like here's the essence of intention when you're calling out, which is our Father in heaven, how that kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. That's the Lord's prayer. It's really cool. Yeah, I like it. But in the essence of it is thy kingdom come that will be done on earth. So the idea is like, help me serve you. Yes, your will. Let me get out. Let me be, let me, let me get so far out of my way that I have just become a process that is part of your process instead of getting in the fucking way. Like, you know how like, I don't know if you've ever had the experience of, I bet you have because you like to control things. And so as I do too, sometimes a lot too much. And you are with someone who is legitimately not good at something legitimately not good. Like, you know how to do the thing because you've done it a million times before and this person hasn't really done it that much. And yet the person who hasn't done it that much is exerting their will and they want to do the thing. Even though, you know, if I just fucking do it, it's going to get done faster. It's going to get done right. It's going to get done right. If they do it, it's probably not going to be right. It's going to fuck shit up, you know, whatever it may be, right? So that can drive me up the goddamn wall because if I just, if you just sit down, you know, like someone's like, how do you do this on the computer? Classic example, your parents. Yeah. And you're like, give me the fucking goddamn, give me the fucking computer. You know, I don't have to spend nine hours like walking you through this shit, you fucking asshole. Like just fucking punch the thing in, you know. So in the same way, it's like, if the concept is that there's a supreme force in the universe, then like, I bet you're, we're the parents. That's a free force. It's like, come on, man. I'm, I'm make I just let me just move aside for one second. Just it'll take one second instead of 15 years to get rid of this one fucking or 15 lifetimes or six million lifetimes or 15 billion repetitions of the same incarnation. You know, amen. Amen, brother. Yeah. No, it is. And it's, and that's really been a lot of it for me. And, you know, you asked me when I, when I came to your door today, you know, how am I doing? And I said, it's been, we've gotten kind of far afield, but it's the, it's been a month since I got back from Peru, and it hasn't been easy. And I think a lot of it has been, you know, integrating and accepting and making choices based on what I experienced there. But certainly one thing I did experience was the sense somewhat similar to what you were saying about DMT, the sense of something working on you and kind of the best thing you can do at certain points is just lay back, try to relax and, and trust. Don't help the doctor. Yeah. If you're getting brain surgery, for example. Right. You're not like, try the scalpel. Yeah. Oh yeah. Three wrong scalpel. You need to. Yeah. Are you really going to use that scalpel doc? Use the one next to it. Trust me. I saw YouTube. Here, let me show you how. My own brain. You don't want that. You know, you don't want that. So yeah, I love that. And I love the way that the patients of the medicine with humans and its understanding of like their desire to like resist. Yeah. Yeah. Because that was, that was, you know, I was there for, initially I signed up for six ceremonies over 10 nights. I wound up staying for 10 ceremonies. Not one of them was easy. There was, and I think that's somewhat typical, but I think, I think I made it harder than I needed to. There was only one ceremony where I just outright lost my shit, screaming, crying, ruining everyone else's trip. Though amazingly afterwards, when I got up to apologize, everyone was like, what are you apologizing for? This is your process. We're proud of you, which was quite touching. Let's talk about that night. What so if you want to. Yeah, no, no. Absolutely. I'm an open book about this stuff. Okay. So let's talk about the afternoon before that ceremony. What were you doing? Well, so, I mean, there was so many realizations over the course of, I was there total for about two and a half weeks. And well, let me start with this, though, right? So that day, there was often fear the day of ceremonies. For me, you know, is it one day on one day off? No, it was a little more aggressive for like a better term than that. It was, so we would drink on Monday and Tuesdays, Wednesdays off, drink Thursdays and Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays off. So four nights a week. Okay. And it's a lot. It is a lot. It is a lot. And you know, you're at this place, you're never pressured to drink. And people do sometimes skip ceremonies. I went for all of them. Where are you sleeping? It was, I had a fairly comfortable cabin in the woods. Alone? Yeah, I was alone. Cool. Yeah, I lucked out. I got a solo cabin. Cable? Satellite dish. You're in the jungle, man. Are you kidding? No, no, no, nothing. No, it's a fucking mosquito net with bamboo on top of it. It's not five star accommodations. I was about to buy a plane ticket right now. I was going to stop the podcast and head out there. It's the one thing keeping me from doing ayahuasca and brew is no forensic files in the day. This place actually did have Wi-Fi, which was a mixed blessing. Ultimately, that was another form of learning where I saw my sort of addictive tendencies with that, you know, because it's all about OCD for me, man. And it's, it's, it's about avoiding pain and loss. You know, that's really what it's about. It's about there's something I'm experiencing now that I don't want to experience whether it's an obsessive thought or a feeling. And all right, let me go over here and try to control, control, control this thing, optimize, perfect, make things better. And so much of, and I realized this. So I did ayahuasca a few times in New York prior to this. And one of the things I, that became clear, I think my first or second ceremony is I'm just, I'm always trying to figure shit out. And most of the time, I mean, essentially for me, future stuff, I'm always trying to figure out what's going to happen. And certainly in some context, that's necessary and useful. But the vast majority of the time I do it, there's no value. And there's high cost because it takes me out of the present. It creates anxiety because I'm imagining different scenarios, some pleasant, some unpleasant. But our minds, I think we did evolve to focus on negative possibilities because again, number one evolutionary prerogative is survive. You have to pay more attention to the potential threats than the potential upsides. So I realized I'm constantly trying to figure out what's going to happen next. And the number of times I've known what's going to happen next is zero and will always be zero. It's not like sometimes, again, strategizing. I mean, you could guess what's going to happen. Right. Probabilities. And it's useful sometimes. But sometimes, you know, you know, when cars are coming by based on when the light is red, so there is ways to prognosticate like future events with some. Definitely. So I'm not saying it's not, it's not adaptive in some context and some context that's highly adaptive. But for me, and I would wager for many people, it can be stuff like thinking about, Oh, what am I going to say to this person when I see them tonight? Oh, so you're doing scripts. So sometimes it's scripts. You're like living out like all the pot, like it's like you're my the simulator. Let me just first one second, just something I've thought about because it's really, it really like shows how incredible the human mind is that your mind can instantly simulate a future moment and run the simulation over and over and over again with all these different scenarios. Like if this, what if they say that, and then I'll say this, and then I'll say that, and then I'll say that, right? And then they'll say that, and then I'll see your, see your mind is like, okay, that's simulation A. Now let's run simulation B. Right. Okay. Let now see. Now we'll run D and it's doing it with absolutely no effort at all to the point that it is draining you. I was going to say, right, there is effort. It's not a conscious effort, but it is. It's consuming energy. Absolutely. Yeah, it's consuming energy. And it's pulling you out of the present, which it feels to me that that's the place where you can get energy. There's something about being grounded and rooted where it feels like you can actually generate, not just conserve, but generate energy. Sometimes it feels that way to me. Man, this is why I love chanting because chanting, if there ever is a great antidote to this simulate, the simulator, the simulation tendency, chanting is really like, I, breathing meditation is cool and everything, but something about just like falling my breath, it's just not juicy enough for me to hang on to you. But a mantra, I love it because you're just like, you're just focusing on the sound. So when your mind, when my mind is really in a fucking froth and going through all the things, this is Jack Cormfield calls it when he's sitting, he talks about how his mind has, like the radio plays the top 10 hits, like his mind will have the top 10 repeating worries and just play. Well, they can be fantasies too. You know, absolutely. Oh, I'm really, it's going to, I'm really looking forward to breakfast tomorrow. I mean, that's, yeah, but whatever it is running through and then, yeah, and then like, you know, the idea is like, okay, okay, well, I'm just going to watch these things and study the way that the mind is simulating future events or simulating past events because clearly it's a simulation. It's obviously not happening. What's happening is this right now. So when you're watching this incredible light show that your mind's putting on for you or it's grabbing symbols from memory banks and throwing them into some animation, it's animating symbols. It's animating images of your friends right in front of you in a VR style setup, three completely immersive simulation of future events. And then when you get into the practice of like, instead of getting so sucked into that, actually watch it and be like, wow, mind, look at you. Whoa, this is a good one here. Oh, wow, look at this. Uh, at my mom's death bed. Oh, wow, you really are. Damn, look at that. I didn't even really, when I was at my mom's death bed, I don't think I noticed that on the wall. Look at that. Wow. And then you're like, Holy shit, my mind is so super powerful. It's able to summon these things up. But then instead of like being pulled into it, like the son of a bitch wants you to, you can at least like gaze upon it and be well, I think it's appreciation. I think that's a key. And that's something that I've worked on is not seeing the mind as the enemy because the mind, my mind does a great job doing what's designed to do, which is keeping me safe, keeping me protected, trying to ensure comfort. Unfortunately, my mind sometimes doesn't realize that it's, I kind of think of it as it's very short sighted. It doesn't, for example, when I was at my worst years ago, it wouldn't realize that the potential benefit of having a marginally better shirt, however you define better, isn't worth the misery of, you know, missing a show because I couldn't leave the apartment, losing friends because they got tired of that bullshit, the isolation, the loneliness, all because the minds don't understand time because, well, time is a whole, no one understands time. So it's in the moment, every decision, you know, when I was at this point in my life was, was crucial. So my mind, it was, get this decision right, get this decision right. So again, it can cause suffering, but it's aim, I feel like my mind always has my best interest at heart. I never, that's, I do sometimes see it as an enemy, but I try not to because I don't think that's accurate. I think it's trying to protect me. It's just like my dog, when my dog goes out in the fucking steps and is barking, there's two ways to, I can look at that. I can think to myself, the dog is intentionally trying to hurt me right now, which is ridiculous. It's a poodle. It doesn't know that I don't like it's barking. And in fact, I think if I can- I feel like you said it's a poodle, like other breeds could be manipulative. It feels like Jack Russell then. Yeah, right. But it's like, especially, you know, this, it's a tiny little poodle. Yeah. And I think that if I could turn, it's like sentience up enough so that we could actually have a conversation telepathically. And it learned that I didn't like it's barking. I think it would be shocked. I think it would be like, Oh, that's why you were screaming. I thought you were screaming because you are scared of the squirrel too. I didn't know. Yeah. You know, I think that it would not, or it would just be like, man, I was just doing me or it would be like, I didn't know. Yeah, I'm trying to protect both of us. Yeah. This is why you have me, right? I'm guarding the territory. That's it. And so then when you, when, so I think the mind is, that's the mind. Yeah. You're like, you're just doing your thing, man. I don't know what, what, I don't want to like rain on your parade here, mind, because you're, you're really burning a lot of energy for this like incredible show that you're putting on. But man, guess what? It's not like it used to be anymore. Like you're kind of like, right, we're not actually being attacked by saber-toothed tigers. But this is, well, you mentioned a dog. So one of the things that I got from this center, there were, you know, it's a glade carved out of the jungle. They have a bunch of dogs there. And really, I mean, I think it's mostly companionship and there's a lot of property, but ostensibly, part of the reason for having dogs is the only real mortal threat, at least in this part of the Amazon, is poisonous snakes. Very, very rare. Sure. But, but they do exist. So the dog's job in so far as they have one is if a snake comes out of the, out of the jungle, pounce on that thing. Yeah. But the dogs aren't stressed out about this. This was an incredible teaching for me. The dogs, they're just lolling around in the dirt, sleeping, playing, eating, sleeping, a lot of sleeping, a lot of relaxing. They're not sitting there thinking, all right, what am I going to do when a snake comes out? If a snake comes out of that brush, then I'm going to hit them at this angle and I'm going to catch, but if it comes out of that, and if it's a, this type of snake, they're just chilling out. And then when a snake materializes, if a snake materializes, they trust, maybe that's not the right word because it assumes a certain degree of sentience, but let's use it. They trust that they will bring all of their resources to bear in that moment in dealing with that snake. And that's more adaptive because in that moment, and this is true of us too, in the moment, we have all the data we need to make the best possible decision. Thinking about a situation in advance, you don't have all the data. If you're doing a script about a conversation with someone, I don't know what their facial expression is going to be that's going to communicate a certain emotion. I don't know what mood they're going to be in. So that was a real teaching for me, the idea of relax. And when it comes time to take action, when a threat materializes, trust that, you know, you've existed on this planet for a few decades, you're still here. You have certain resources at your disposal, intellectual, emotional, etc. Trust that you'll bring all those to bear. How cool is it that this center is so magical? That the dogs taught you, they gave you a seminar and how to, it's so funny how the dog, I love the way like, because our teachers come to us. It's like, and it's really funny for you, you know, entering into this and being like, I don't want some fucking teacher. And then the dog is, yeah. The dogs are like, they were, we're your guru now. And on an ongoing basis, so what I started doing in ceremony and in life, because when you're drinking this much, it's sort of all blends together, which is part of the idea, is when I'd have a thought, it didn't have to be an overtly threatening thought, but a thought that was a future thought that didn't require me to do anything in this moment. I would say to myself, go snake, go snake, because it's not even a real snake, my mind is creating the ghost of a snake right now. And kind of like what you were saying, just watching it, just labeling it, and then letting it go. And then what can I do in this moment? Well, if there's nothing to do, do what the dogs do, just relax, go into my body and try to release the king that, you know, that's the kingdom of heaven. That's heaven, you know, because if you could, and I love like, I already, I always know I've hit it, because like, when I'm there, as I'm entering the boundary between not being there and there, that imaginary boundary probably. Are we talking about on psychedelics or anytime? Yeah. And you're like, you know what, to entering into something is sort of that, that timeless state we could call it the lawling around in the dirt, yapping, sleeping, not being perturbed by what is perturbing them. What appears to be the majority of our species, the majority of our species is in a state of constant trouble, constant mental dis- anguish. Yeah. For themselves and creating it for others. Yeah. And if someone dares, if you dare to take a nap or just for a second, not be doing anything, like, you know, I'm just not gonna, like when I watch my animals, they don't really do anything. Yeah. They just chill. They relax, they play, they eat, they'll bark sometimes, then they forget they barked. And it's like to fall into that pattern as a human for even four minutes to hit that spot of pure, absolute, tranquil peace in the midst of species. And connection, because it's in that state that you are at that level, at that animal level, which sounds not in a pejorative way, but you're a creature existing on a planet with other creatures. Yeah. And it's right there for you anytime you want it. It's always right there. All you gotta do is just realize that it's just all ghost snakes. Yeah. Almost always. I mean, there are real snakes occasionally, but I think. What a delight. Yeah. Right. And then when that appears, you know, you deal with it, but because those dogs like it, because I guarantee you that when they're laying around and the snake finally fucking appears, that's fun for them. Like that's a moment of they get to run or at least engagement, at least maybe fun isn't the word, but this is, this is their purpose. This is their job. This is, yeah. Yeah. It's glory. Yeah. So in the midst of, so when that happens and they become the defender in that moment, they're, they're engaging in a sacred battle against like an archetypical symbolic enemy of humans, the poisonous snake. Yeah. You don't get much more archetypical. No, they're fighting the dragon. And so in that moment, they get to be the heroes, the savior of men and it's a beautiful thing. And in the same way, when that moment comes for a man or a woman and you find yourself truly met with an actual snake and you get to witness as your body flies into action and suddenly like you hear these stories, this is actually someone who taught Zen, taught me Zen would say that compassion, what is compassion and how, okay, we hear these stories, icy lake bus crashes into icy lake, person dives into water, starts pulling people out of the water, pulling people out of the water, person is interviewed later, person has like frostbite on his hand or her hand or whatever. They're like, you're a hero. And they say, I don't remember doing that. I didn't think about it. I didn't decide. I just did. I wasn't there. I jumped in. I said, I served. I was my purpose. They don't say it like that. But like, I feel like a hero. Right. This was the thing to do in the moment. Clearly. Yeah. And this is what they were called to by, by the moment, by everything that led up to, but yeah, no planning, no seminars, no weekend retreats to prepare for the moment, the bus crashes into the fucking thing, just the, they just were there. And so this is a curious thing. If the idea is that all of our time is spent worrying over these future events, future event comes, and there is an autonomy in the reaction to the future event, because if there were autonomy, then more than likely that would, in a lot of ways, inhibit our ability to survive that are, are like one second of hesitation. As you're yanking someone off of tracks, one moment spent, is this the right thing to do? Yeah. Death. Yeah. And that's where it really becomes interesting because then you realize this thing that you maybe are thinking, oh wait, this is actually, my mind is actually doing some evolutionary beneficial thing and it's never ending planning. You realize, wait, maybe not. Maybe in fact, this is a kind of bad adaptation that wasn't ever supposed to be there anyway. This is a, you know, the expanding neocortex. Maybe we got a little too much of a little too much of something. The point is like, maybe it isn't beneficial in the way that we think it is necessarily, not to say training has been beneficial, because you know, that's what fighting is all about. Learning how to be like a UFC fighter, you can't just like be like, I'm going to jump in the ring and hope my instincts take care of things. But in the training process, I think they learn that if they spend too much time worrying over the fight and not the training and being in the moment of the training, then they're certainly doomed when the fight happens because they were thinking about the fight and not the, the, just committing to muscle memory, all the patterns. I think, I still feel that our minds that the, I mean, because certainly there are split second life or death decisions we're thinking is, is maladaptive, but there are decisions, you know, you're, you're hunting for food, you know, 20 million years ago, there is decision making there in terms of do I go to this, this far or that far. So I, it makes sense, of course, there's no way to know, but it makes sense to me that, that minds do have utility in trying to optimize decisions consciously. This is actually reminds me. So I've been reading this book. And by Steven Kotler called stealing fire. And it's about like, you know, people and it's a great book, but it's about uses of psychedelics and other like flow state technologies to buy like very powerful CEOs and corporations to create a state of God, what's a beautiful name for it in this book? I hope I can remember it. It's called, I think he calls it ecstasy, which is like, so in an interview with like, so he goes to like Google and like the Navy seals and he like talks to them about what is it you're looking for? What is it that you want? And so the Navy's the famous Navy seal, like initiation or when they're picking who's going to be the seals. And we've seen the videos, it's called hell week, or I don't know what they call it before like seven tense sort of initiation, six days of just running and laying in cold water and just getting smacked and punched and just it sucks. And during this, you know, they will kick you out if you're not meeting some standard. And so in this interview, the guy's like, a lot of people think this is about endurance, like we're trying to see if these guys have the endurance to do something or another. But it's like, no, it's not about endurance. We already know these are world class athletes, they've gotten this far along. It's not about endurance. It's, are they able to surrender their identity and merge into the whole with the team? And that state of a seal team, merging together as one organism, they that is a that is exactly what their training is all about is surrendering the surrendering any kind of in the moment, like contemplation or mind stutters, and just becoming a super brain that consists of all these other members of your team. And then that's how you become this deadly, super efficient, incredibly powerful thing. So this is actually it's surrendering that produces something far more effective than, I don't know, planning in the moment, what you're, you know, when you're on stage, you know, you're doomed when you're on stage, and you start thinking about what you're going to do next. You're like, Oh, fuck, this ain't a good set. I'm planning, man, I got to get out of this whole fucking now. I'm like, now you're not sharing that reality with the audience. Now you're in this other reality in your head. And yeah, and you're done. Yeah, you're doomed as soon as you leave that reality. Yeah. So if it's true for stage, it must be true for life, right? Well, the moment that you're like, lost in the stutter, you know, you're, you're, you're going to be less efficient. I think, well, in my experience, I think most of the time, yes, I think there's something to be said for, you know, if I'm, well, so you moved to New York, not that long ago. Yeah, there was a certain amount of planning and logistics that went into that. You didn't just, you know, drive to LAX one day, buy a plane ticket, hop on the plane. So I think when there's sort of concrete specific things that you know you're going to need to do, planning and figuring out how to do them can be helpful. This is the song of the devil. Not that you're singing that song, but it's like, I remember when, when I was reading about Ram Das, and he runs into Bhagavan Das, who is the guy who brought Ram Das to Neen Krali Baba and Bhagavan Das. So he runs into this super hippie out there in India. And so Bhagavan Das takes Ram Das, who was about to like leave India and Ram Das feeling this kind of like, this guy is like, definitely seems to be emanating some, some thing. Like he certainly seems to be in it. He certainly looked the part. He was wearing the right costume. Like he's got the beard and that looks like Jesus. Well, he looks like, but um, so Bhagavan Das starts taking Ram Das, um, around with him and they're just walking. And anytime Ram Das would start saying like, where are we going? Or what are we doing? You're like, it doesn't matter. Just be here. Be here now. Be with me now. Be with me now. Let's just be here together now. And it was always a returning to that. Just always a returning to that. Just here. We're here now. We're here. Oh, you're, and Jack Cornfield talks about this. He had malaria once and Ajahn Chah's teacher came to him when he had malaria and sat with him and said, it hurts. Doesn't, doesn't this hurt? It's hurting. It's hurting just in the moment, in the moment, in the pain, in the moment, like here, here, now, this, this, this. And I know what you mean. We must plan. We must pay bills. We must be in the marketplace. That is part of the game. But there is a way, I think, to do that minus the, um, not being in the moment. Well, Eckhart Tolle, you know, he talks about how you kind of oscillate between the, the state of presence. And then when you need to use your mind, you use it for a few minutes and then you come back to presence that you're constantly sort of dipping into that deep well. Right. Um, and yeah, and, and coming back here again. Yeah. Yeah. Because right. Because I certainly have a tendency to just travel off, you know, into the mind for light years. But this is where the dogs are. Like I, I can feel the dog teachers with you, man. They came with you here. Like I can feel them. Like I could, like it's weird. They really came to you and like I can feel it. And it's like, Oh, the dogs are here. Like they're hanging out here. They're just like in the mud here. Well, even now talking to you, I'm continually, and this is novel for me. I did not do this prior to this retreat. There's a continual, not continuous, but continual coming back to, all right, you know, my ass is on the chair, my feet are on the floor, just feeling the physical sensations in my body. And that is tremendously helpful because OCD is, it's entirely a mind thing. Yeah. So that, that was one of the things I, I learned out there was rather than trying to solve OCD at the level of the mind, it's about presence and presence. I, you know, I meditate, we've talked about this, I think I did Zen meditation for many years while the OCD was really cresting. And, you know, it, it became sort of a, a means to an end. I talk about on stage, you know, how like, you know, I'd be there if I could just attain enlightenment, everything would be perfect. If I could just attain enlightenment, everything would be perfect. If I could just attain enlightenment, everything would be perfect. That's not technically a mantra, but that sort of was my de facto mantra. And God bless my teacher. She was, you know, intelligent enough and insightful enough to kind of realize at a certain point, Hey, you're, this is, this isn't the way to be doing this. But, but meditation for me, I think the reason I didn't get that much out of it, and I did get something is it was largely a mind thing. It was mind trying to master mind. And now what I'm trying, and you know, I'm a baby at this stuff, man, but what I'm trying to do and what, you know, over the last month, as things have not been uniformly easy, coming back to, all right, the mind is doing what it's doing, but that's, you know, that's eight or nine pounds of the 180 pounds of my matter. So what, what's going on with the rest of me? Let me, let me drop out of here, not shut it out, not repress the mind, but just not give it my exclusive identification and attention. And what are my feet doing? Yeah, right now my feet, my toes are slightly cold on your floor. Yeah. And just connecting to that dog, to that animal level. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I mean, that's it. And then I can be present with, with you in a way that I can't because we can share this physical reality and to a greater degree than we can share our minds with each other. Yeah. And it's a beautiful spot. And I love it because like, you know, like, especially in, in New York, where there's such a high population density, many people love to find a place where there's not a lot of people around, especially like in nature. It's really nice, you know, to find a little spot where there's no people. And then when you realize like, you don't have to go to a spot for low population density, all you have to do is get in the present moment because there ain't a lot of people there. Right. Plenty of room to spread out. The whole subway car to yourself during rush hour. Yes, exactly. No one's there. And it's fun. And it's a beautiful spot, you know, and it's like the spot to be, and it's the reason everybody endlessly talks about it. So is ayahuasca going to gentrify the present moment? Is that what's going to be a lot more people crowding in here? A lot of like super expensive bagel shops are going to open up in the present moment, like specialty bagels. But we have to, you know, keep, this is the practices to keep coming back. And you know, I want to, I still, I really need to hear about this night. Oh yeah. But very quickly, like, you know, the funny thing is, man, are you sure those were dogs? Right. Because a lot of those people out there have heard they can turn into animals. Okay, so let's talk about the, let's talk about the, the, so I want to talk, I'm just, I guess I'm really interested in the details of the, I know it sounds mundane, but I just kind of want to hear about the day leading up. Were you in your cabin? So this particular ceremony was, what day was it? It was a, it was a Friday. It was going to be my last ceremony. Okay. It was supposed to be my last ceremony. And so I'd had a ceremony the night before on Thursday. I don't particularly remember what that Thursday night ceremony was like. So, but the day after ceremonies was always so for me in particular, it was largely a physical experience. I didn't get visions at all. I did have some sense of maybe communicating with an entity, but it was, it was largely physical and psychological working through this stuff. And people say, you know, ayahuasca kind of, it works at the levels it needs to work. And so I think maybe for me, if you accept that viewpoint, it would be, yeah, just before it could do anything sort of more ethereal with me, it had to get me connected in the present moment, it had to get me into my body. Right. But I mentioned that because interestingly, we would drink at eight o'clock at night, I would feel the medicine in my body very strongly until one or two PM the next day. Sort of rather pleasant heaviness and surges in my body. Yeah. So up until that point, I'm very, very relaxed the next day. So on this particular day, the day leading up, I probably didn't sleep. Actually, I know I didn't sleep. I slept about an hour the night before. Okay. I also didn't really sleep much during this time. Not unheard of, but somewhat unusual. It wasn't necessarily a problem. But my mind kind of thought it was a problem. Like I was typically sleeping about two and a half hours a night. Right. I just couldn't. It was just too strong in my body. Again, once the initial surge of the ayahuasca would pass the first hour and a half, I'd generally be fairly comfortable, but I just couldn't sleep. So that day, I remembered fairly well that Friday, I felt good. The ayahuasca started wearing off sometime around lunchtime. And then there was, for me, what was always there, this anticipatory anxiety about the ceremony. That was the snake, of course. I'm going in. It's my last ceremony. I was aware I was really, really tired. I only slept an hour that night and about two hours the night before. But I was also aware it was my last ceremony. So yeah, I'm going to do a substantial dose that made that decision. So sort of this fear, eat breakfast, eat lunch. What are you eating? Very, very restrictive diet. And this was a teaching to for me. So basically, fish caught in the Amazon, not it's the tributary of the Amazon that runs by the center. Beans, rice, bananas. That's it. Yeah. How do they serve it? Are you in a cafeteria? Yeah, sort of. I mean, there were typically over the course of time, I was there at very, but generally, 15 to 30 people there total. So yeah, there are set meal times, everyone gathers. Like picnic tables? Yeah, long tables, under mosquito netting. Everything's pretty much under mosquito netting. And you make friends there? Yeah, you do. Well, because after not to jump around too much, but when the ceremony ends, ayahuasca, I know you haven't done that before, but well, it's not dissimilar to mushrooms. For me, after the experience, you feel very euphoric. You're kind of still in it, you know, so the like I look at mushrooms, the first 45 minutes, bumpy ride for me always. Always. One of the reasons I haven't done mushrooms in many, many years, then you settle into something where it can be intense, but it's workable. And then that sort of melts into, for me, this very euphoric, effusive, quite peaceful, but quite talkative state. And that latter part, and I'd say that trajectory, topography, if you will, somewhat similar to ayahuasca, at least for me, early part rough, then workable, then you feel good, you've made it through something. And so in that state, you want to talk to other people and people would talk. So the ceremony would officially, we drink around 8 p.m., maybe 1.30 or 2. The shaman would announce that, you know, la ceremonia, or el ceremonio, I don't know, Spanish, estermanada. And you can go wherever you want, but you can't stay here. Well, no, you can stay there, actually. You can stay as long as you want. And people would stay there and chat for hours. And since I couldn't sleep, I would always be the last person up. So you really bond with people because you're still in the state, you know, you're still very open. And that was a tremendous part of, you know, the whole learning experience for me is hearing about other people's experience. And invariably, whatever someone else had gone through that I was talking to, it would just trigger stuff in me where I'd realize, oh, shit, I do that, or I can learn from that, or I can start doing that. So you asked about, do you make friends? Yeah, you form pretty intense bonds with people. Are you still talking to some folks that you met out there? No, fuck those guys. Yes, I am. Actually, I talked to one of them today. Yeah. Yeah, because you also really care about, you know, how are they doing? Yeah, sure. And it's incredibly bonding. You're out in the middle of nowhere, taking psychedelics with these people. I can't even imagine. Yeah, you're really, and you're going through, you know, of the guests there, they were pretty much all Westerners. So you have to realize a whole another level of the trip is that you're dropped into the middle of the rainforest. And that is, are people hooking up? No, not that I know of. That's strongly discouraged. Though now that I say it, it wasn't overtly addressed. But the idea is that you want to be giving everything you have to the work here. Also, that you're very open energetically when you're drinking this stuff. And you don't necessarily want to mingle your energy with someone else's. Yeah, I get it, man. I could, I mean, I was just, it's curious, like, it just seems like I'm sure it happens. I'm sure it happens. But the shamans aren't like, no humping guys, we got to focus on I'm trying to remember if there was because there was some sort of orientation talks that might have been covered. That might have been covered. But I know at the end, I had, I asked about that, like, basically, oh, this is what I'll disclose this. I may be too much information. I didn't masturbate once the entire time I was there, which was over, which was about three weeks, which is a record for me. And I had no desire to, which actually was was kind of a great blessing to just be freed of this desire that otherwise is, you know, sure. But I can't imagine it, because especially if I wasn't able to sleep, yeah, no, it just wasn't, I just feel like it's dangerous combination. It's a terrible because you know, if I jerk off, I'm going to fall asleep. Yeah. But you're like in this, you know, you're, it's like you some deeper part of yourself knows exactly. That's what it felt like. You're not at a best Western right now, man. You're right. You came here for a reason. And I knew that the, I knew I didn't want to masturbate when I was there, but I thought it was going to be like difficult, very difficult. And it wasn't at all. And I even maintained for quite a bit of time after I left there effortlessly. So, so I don't think there's much hooking up going. There is attraction that develops no question. I had that develop with someone. So, and I'd imagine that's fairly common for the same reason that they encourage you not to have sex because you're so open, connecting it. And also the something in that state where you, so the next morning, so you talk afterwards often, you don't have to, but people will hang around. The next morning, early the next morning, you meet for conversation. The shaman is there and people are talking about their experiences. And it's not like sort of a sharing circle. The idea is this is diagnostic for the shaman. He wants to hear what you experienced, what visions you saw. Yeah. So that he knows how to calibrate the work he's doing on you via song, because that's the primary modality at this center. And I think most is they're singing to you to shift your energy. And when you get there, they do an intake interview. They don't use that word, that phrase, but basically why are you here? What are issues you're dealing with? And then they ask you a whole host of questions, like when you go to a new doctor, you know, have you had issues with this? Have you had issues with that? What drugs have you done? What's your sexual history? They're trying to understand, because my very vague understanding of the whole sort of, I don't know what the word is, but the ethos behind this is that, well, it's mind, body, and spirit are not separate. So that traumas on any level can permeate other levels. And that basically traumas exist at an energetic level. So this relationship that ended 14 years ago, that caused a lot of trauma is maybe still in me energetically. And that's part of the purging, the vomiting, is you're actually letting that go. And they use song to target these energies, these horses, these things that are lodged in you. So yeah, it really is. And traditionally, I'm not sure if this is true of all tribes, but I believe the person who I was working with is from the Shepibo tribe. And I believe they're typically, the way ayahuasca is used, is the doctor slash shaman, they drink the ayahuasca, but the patient does not. Wow. They're drinking ayahuasca to help them see energetically what's going on with you, so that they can sing more effectively to you. That's so cool. Kind of like how a doctor will, you know, pop you in an MRI so they can see what's going on and prescribe something. Oh, God, it's so cool, man. Yeah. So they say, I know, I hope you check it out. I think you do. Terrified. Yeah, you should be. Only because when I take mushrooms, it's like, man, the thing, that pattern that you're talking about, I just, that initial like thing, it's like, I can't, if ayahuasca truly is. It's a little less the early part, and I haven't done mushrooms for years, but the early part is a little less bumpy than mushrooms. But as I'm saying, I'm like, is it really? Because what we haven't gotten to the night, I flipped out, but that's the part of the experience that happened. Let's get to that night. Let's cut to it. So that day. So anyway, so this conversation that day, you know, the ayahuasca starts fading around noon. I start having some anxiety about that night, but you know, I'm going to do it, but I'm really tired. And as the day we're on, I became aware, I am really tired. I've been here at this point. I've been there about two weeks. I really have not been sleeping. Right. But okay, this is my last one. I'm going to, you know, go out strong. I've gotten a lot from this already. And so I got into ceremony. And one of the things I love about there, as opposed to what I've done in New York, is there's no, they just cut right to it. The shaman walks in, there's no chanting or anything beforehand. They just, you know, start calling people up, pouring them the drink. It's very, I like it because it's like, okay, let's get to work. We're here to work. Let's do it. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. So I got called up and one of the facilitators there, a guy named Joe Tuffer, who actually just had a book come out about his experiences, he's an American MD who was one of the founders of the center, Ni Wei Rao, really wonderful human being, really committed to helping people. And so he was up there with the shaman kind of, you know, helping pour the drinks and they poured they poured me a dose. And I was like, let me do a little bit more. And Joe's like, are you sure? That's a pretty solid dose. And I was like, yeah, because I thought they were just eyeballing it. I learned later that there are actually faint demarcations on the ayahuasca glass. So Joe knew what my typical dose was. And he was saying, Hey, this is a good deal. But I thought, yeah, this looks to me. So, so I took a pretty hefty dose. Though interestingly with ayahuasca, it's the dose response curve is all over the place, the same dose, different night. Yeah, that's what I've heard. So anyway, I did take after you. And that's an interesting thing. What do you think? Now, because there's the like superstitious or the metaphysical idea. And clearly this is a metaphysical medicine, because we're talking about singing out your energy patterns. But like, I do think about that because people will say, well, it is metaphysical. But also, I mean, that's not that far from Western medicine. If you look at some of the therapies that they do with, I mean, what is it is? And I guess what I'm saying is it's not that dissimilar. If you look at like a PET scan or something where what we're bouncing energy off your body to see certain masses. And then we're trying to when we're talking about the the drink itself, okay, the root in the bark, yeah, whatever other they just use that there just the the chacruna leaf and the ayahuasca like some kind of water, obviously, like it's some kind of liquid. So like, but also if it's a root in a bark, then we nature doesn't work with in the way that like right. So like the amount of DMT per every like, you know, gram of of of the mixture of the bark, I guess, which is it's in the root. No, it's in the root. The the so there's the M. A. O. The vine is which is actually called ayahuasca is the is the M. A. O. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's different things people use for the DMT but the most common I believe I'm pronouncing it right is chacruna, okay, which is a leaf. Okay, so there is a bark too that can be used. So in that leaf, we can imagine that the DMT is equally is equal. Yeah, like there's well, but this one the same. So they do you because you see them cooking up the I mean, these people that's one point of like, they're mad men because there's always a giant vat of ayahuasca cooking there. Yeah. And it's, it's, there's so much care put into every aspect. So they use a certain type of wood to burn under the ayahuasca to make the fire because it burns the right way. So anyway, just a side note. So the same batch is is can produce different effects. Right. And what is that? Is that a, is that a relation to the physiology of the imbibor or is that related to distribution? Well, even within the same imbibor. Yeah. And I would think distribution within a batch shouldn't be that different once it's, you know, been all dissolved. So their explanation is that you can block or allow it to varying degrees. And I did see that in myself and other people where I get it. Yeah. So you could, there's some weird way that you can put the brakes on or resist it to the point of like, you know, mushrooms, you can too. It's just kind of, it's, you ain't making things easy for yourself if you do it that way. It's not like the ayahuasca or the mushrooms will comply, but you can, you got to let them get you. You got to let them, you got to let them in and they're get those doctors or whatever. Well, and that was part of it. Well, so obviously part of it also is over the course of 10 ceremonies, presumably there may be more of a persistent MAOI effect. That's right. My honest answer is who knows. I don't, it's, I think I, I don't even, it doesn't even, I just said a weird part of my brain is curious. I think it's more than just now, before I would have come up with a purely, you know, physiological explanation. Now I feel like there's more to it than that. I feel like intention has something to do with it. And I never thought I'd say these words, the spirit of the ayahuasca, how it wants to work with you. Right. Right. Okay. So you've taken a substantial dose. Yeah. I wouldn't say heroic, but substantial. Enough where the person's like, really? All right. Yeah. So you, you, you, you drink it. You drink it immediately. Describe the taste. So have you ever drank cactus? No. Not quite as bad mescaline-containing cactus, but close. And like mescaline-containing cactus, it gets worse the more you do it. So the first time I drank ayahuasca, I was like, I don't know what everyone complains about. It's actually almost, it has kind of a musky taste to it. Yeah. By this time. Musky? Yeah, kind of a wet sort of, like a sock? But yes, but more not unpleasant, not, not rancid. Earthy. Okay. Strong. Very strong. Okay. Like dirt? Like, yeah, a little, a little like beats. I would go with dirt and bitter, definitely bitter. Bitter like when you eat mushrooms, like alcohol. Yeah. Kind of that alkaloid bitterness. But did you hate them the first time you had mushrooms? Did you, did you resent that? I don't remember. Yeah. I, for me, it seems like it's this learned diversion with everything. Just talking about it makes me want to throw up. Just like that. What is this that I'm putting down? It's, yeah, it's not, it's not, and by this time, this, so this was my eighth ceremony in like 12 days. Yeah. Choking it down was, was a challenge. Is there like, do you have something to drink after you drink the ayahuasca to help with it? Like anything to help? You can, well, you can always do whatever you want there, but you're discouraged from drinking any water. What you can do and many people do is you'll swish around some water in your mouth and then spit it into your puke bucket. Okay. Because of course there's a bucket there, which is. Gotcha. Okay, great. So, so you've taken the dose. Take the dose, go back to your place. And what does your place look like? So this, the Maloka is the ceremonial space. Gorgeous Maloka. It's basically a giant hut, but it's circular and the roof. I'll show you pictures later. It's this peaked roof built in this tradition, the Shepibo tribe tradition, where it's all these crossbeams. It looks kind of like a spiderweb when you're looking up. But a spiderweb of trees, like big branches. Wow. Like if this thing collapsed, it would, you know. Is that what you're thinking? The thought crosses your mind at some point because it's very lyrical, very poetic, the construction. It's gorgeous. Yeah. So, you know, Western we see sturdy things and they look sturdy. This looks so delicate and yeah, but it's supporting several tons of wood. Wow. So, so everyone is arrayed around the perimeter of this circle. So you have mats at sort of right angles to the perimeter. Are they yoga mats? No, they have these thicker foam rubber mats. When I've done it in New York, they've been yoga mats. Do they smell like anything? No, they're very, they're quite good about hygiene here. Considering it's the middle of the jungle and it's, everything's wet. They change sheets a lot and everything on these mats. So yeah, they want you to be comfortable. You know, there's no points in kind of the masochistic part of it, at least at this center. So you go and sit on the mat. Lying back more, reclining, pillows back and, and you know, legs stretched out was generally my position. And once the last person has been summoned for their dose, they blow out the candle and it's pitch black. The only light coming in is if there's a bright moon, you get a little bit of moonlight filtering in, but on this particular night, pitch black. Oh, God. Yeah. So you're laying in the pitch. And that's, and that's intentional, I think that's part of it is like the beginning part of the ceremony is you're on your own. So you're in pitch blackness and you're not feeling anything initially, but you know, it's coming. You know, it's coming, especially by your eighth ceremony. And you know, I never looked at a watch during ceremony because one of the other things I realized early on that I've stuck with is, you know, later isn't a real thing. That was a thought that occurred to me later isn't a real thing. So don't use time unless you have to. What if you have, what if you have to pee? You get up and you say you'll have a flashlight covered with like red tape so it's not too bright and provided you're capable of standing up on your own, you will do that and you'll walk towards the door with your red flashlight pointing at the ground so that you don't, you know, blind anyone else. And I see. Yeah. And if you're not capable, you just say help and there are facilitators who will help you and I had to avail myself of that on this particular night. So laying in the pitch dark, laying in the pitch dark and you're listening to the sounds of the jungle, which are a lot. There's a lot of stuff rustling around out there. A lot of bugs and bats and who knows what else calling out there. And yeah, for me that early part, it could start to feel a little bit sinister. But you're just waiting. And then so I never looked at a watch, but I would say the onset maybe it starts kicking in 40 minutes or so typically for me. And it's, you know, the first alerts the kind of this feeling of whoa, something's happening. I don't know what it is, but something is happening. And the first thing that happens is this greatly increased sensitivity, sensory sensitivity. And since you're in the dark, and since you're not moving, that all goes to your ears. So the sound of people breathing and moaning and maybe struggling a little bit becomes very, very intense. Your own breathing can become very, very intense. So is it distorted? Like, you know, like sometimes when you take LSD or there's that that sort of flanging thing. Yes. During sometimes not I didn't get much of that. I got I got less of that than I have on other psychedelics. Yeah, actually, now that you mentioned it, no, I the when it was raining, every rain job had that flanging sound. So it kind of sounded like this weird sort of morphing white noise. Okay, okay. But yeah, not that strong. Okay. But just so you can you can you're distinctly hearing yes and you're very open and there's this sort of building for me and I think for most people they call this period of the experience this they call it the surge. Okay. So the surge is starting. They also call it the force. Oh boy. And they talk about the way to with the force is you want to ride it you want to surf it you want to use that energy to rise up not to be totally buffeted by it, you know, like a like you're in a tide pool or something. Yeah, right. Okay. Which unfortunately is what happened on this particular night. That's me, dude, every day I the fuck all I be thinking is like, well, I, well, this, I'm, I'm doing this. Of course, those thoughts do occur, but this was part of the value of the whole experience for me is realizing that, yeah, I can have those thoughts on doomed and I can rise to the occasion and let we're focusing on probably the most humiliating and humbling night of my life in many ways. So and I'm okay with that, but let me let me, but my ego requires me to state that. Well, yeah, this was the low point, but it was a gift because a lot of learning came out of it. So, so yeah, this night being anxiety started, I'd say a little more quickly and a little more strongly. And also I should mention, you drink an order. So everyone's arrayed around the circle and they'd go counterclockwise. I happened to have the mat. Basically, I drank first of anyone there. No second, I drank second. So, and the course of going around 25, 30 people that takes about a half hour. So the shaman is drinking like last they're drinking, you know, a good half hour after I am. So I'm getting into the experience earlier than most people. That's really interesting. So the trip is actually moving through everyone in a, the, the, the, the, so the force then, if you, if you time out the dosages, then you're actually, it's rolling through the room in an counterclockwise pattern. Interesting. I mean, I think there's individual variation. Some people come up more quickly than others, but yes, in general, yeah. And you, and by the way, you hear that very clearly. Cause you know, like the vomit always starts from here, not always, but usually. You could hear the vomit coming to you. There were many times where I'd be lying there where I wasn't at this sort of, you know, start or pull position and you'd hear people start to struggle. I say struggle. You don't ever know what they're really going through, but you know, moaning, vomiting. And I'd often have the thought, Oh, thank God I'm not there. And then I'd realize, wait, I may be there in 10 minutes. This is, this is the, right. The ghost of Christmas future for me. The ghost snake of Christmas future. God damn it. That's so wild, man. Okay. So, so lying there in the dark and I start very anxious and I start the thought that started it for me. And it was a thought was I'm way too tired for this right now. That was the thought I'm way too tired for the experience I'm about to undergo. And then that started snowballing into I'm really not taking care of my body. My body really wants sleep. I'm not sleeping. What the fuck am I doing? I'm not prepared. I'm about to have a very strong trip and I just don't have the energetic resources to rise to the occasion. Meanwhile, the emotion behind is just fear. At this point, I'm not going to say anxiety is just fear. I'm just really scared and getting scarier and realizing that this is going to get a lot stronger. It's just kicking in. And you know, this I'm not in a good state for this. Oh, God. And I can feel it, man. And so I did something I had never done before or since this is my ego pride saying this, I said help because that's what they say, you know, like the first day orientation, someone said, Well, what do we do if we need help? Just say help. Someone will come. So, so I said help. And this guy, Joe, I mentioned came over and I think what I said to him was, you know, oh, and he came over and he said, Hey, let me just pee and I'll come back. And when he said that, the panic immediately kicked up a notch because it was kind of like it made me realize, yeah, I really need some help right now. How long is he going to be gone for? That's probably two minutes, but it could be a billion years. Right. Time is an illusion. It's all, yeah. So, but I had also credit him. I think it was probably, I think, you know, he's been doing this for a long time. And I think he's like, yeah, Adam can sit with this for a few minutes. And I wasn't feeling total panic. I was just like, yeah, let me, let me try to reach out while I still can reach out. Yes. So what happened? So he came back. This is where things get really blurry. But at a certain point, I started, I'm going to say I lost control of my body, but in hindsight, I don't see it as I lost control. I see it as I sort of abdicated control. I was just kind of like, I can't sit up anymore. I was lying down. There was a lot of physical surges through my body. My head was, well, for audio I was kind of nodding violently back and forth. It wasn't, it felt like this stuff was just working through me. Oh, and I should say this. So Joe went to the bathroom, panic is starting to rise, and I have this thought. The thought was this. This can be as hard as you want it to be. And I wanted to make it real fucking hard because basically what happened was so very soon I'm on the ground, rolling around, writhing. I started screaming. Just what were you, any words you were screaming or just scream? Intermittently it varied. Sometimes it was just screaming. Sometimes it was screaming for help. So my intention, you go into every ceremony with an intention. And I don't remember what my intention actually was going into that night. It was, maybe it was letting go of, wow, I don't remember. It was letting go of something. Often intentions were about purging something. But I settled on, as the experience was coming on, my intention was to let go of everything and see what comes back. Because I was like, I'm going, so let me just, I'm tired of fucking holding on to me, to my identity, to my fears, just let go of everything and see what comes back. So at times I was screaming, help me let go, please help me let go. Well, you said you wanted to die. Yeah. And so that's what the experience ultimately started to settle on is, oh, I'm dying. That's what's happening here. Now, I'm aware intellectually that ayahuasca deaths are almost unheard of. There's been maybe one cardiac death, but even that's arguable. But my mind came up with a scenario. I think that cardiac death was actually from a nicotine. Well, that guy was nicotine, but there was a female tourist who did ayahuasca. I don't know all the details, but it was like not at a center. I think it was at a hotel in Nikitos where she may have died from a heart attack. But yes, this stuff physiologically is incredibly safe. So it provided you're not on SSRIs or antidepressants or stuff. Did the lights just turn on? Or is that part of my? No, no, no, the lights are set up to do this weird pulsing thing. All right, helps set the mood for this. So yeah, so that's what just happened is I started becoming convinced, well, yeah, people don't die in this stuff, but how many people have, you know, collectively, whatever, 12 hours of sleep in the last week. And yeah, so I may die. And if I let go, I'm gonna die and I have to hold on. So I was screaming about that. I was screaming, please help me let go. Joe's advice was, ask ayahuasca for help. They tell you that there. You know, try to interact with it. I was begging ayahuasca for help. Then at a certain point, I realized whether or not to die was my decision and I wasn't going to die. I was choosing not to die. I remember shouting that out loud. I was also shouting out. Intermittently, I'd become aware that I'm in a ceremony. Other people are going through shit. Yeah, this has to be difficult for them. So I was apologizing to other people. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm not going to die though. Yeah. I remember saying, I'm sorry. I'm ruining all of your experiences. I love all of you. I'm sorry. But I know I'm being selfish. And I was people were cut. Now at this point, people are coming over to sing to me. And some of it did help a little bit. People would also, I was unable to sort of really, I'm going to say in hindsight, unwilling to navigate reality. I became aware I was very thirsty, but I had no idea. You're still in pitch black. I have no idea where my water is. I have no idea how to move my body to get my water. I became aware at another point that I'm just not getting enough oxygen, but I don't have the energy or so I thought to physically sit up to so I can breathe more easily. So people are trying to help. They're singing to me. There would be moments where it felt like I was chilling out, but this thing, whatever it was, this sort of ball of fear and just I couldn't let go. And I remember Joe telling me, go within, go within. But I was terrified of going into my body. I was terrified of my body. I was terrified of my mind. I was just terrified. I just didn't want to let go. Even though I kept screaming, helped me let go, but I just couldn't. I couldn't. And of course that I was creating more resistance if that makes sense. It was a simple way to put it is I didn't want to do the work. I wanted it to be better, but I didn't want to do the work and I was convinced I couldn't do the work. I was too tired. I didn't have the resources. And now here's the part that I'm not thrilled to be talking about on a popular podcast, but I am a firm believer in being open about all this stuff because I feel like, yeah, it's what I have to give. Yeah, my experience. I became I became a total fucking asshole, Duncan. I became a fucking raging asshole. These people are trying to help me. And I became verbally abusive to them. What were you saying? So I was. So here's an example. I'd be like, I'd be like, I need water. I need I need water. And Joe or Sveta, one of these other, you know, angels who are trying to help me. Remember, they they've drank ayahuasca too. Sure. They're but they're trying to help me. And they drink, by the way, not to have their own experience, but because it helps them see it helps them help others. Absolutely. Having said that, they're very sensitive. This can't be pleasant for them. Sure. But they've done it a million times and afterwards we'll get to the afterwards. But so it's like where I, you know, I need water. And I think it was Sveta said, your water is right over there. And I said, I can't see. And she said, it's right, you know, near your right hand. I said, and I'm like flailing around. And at some point, I said, if I fuck, you know, if I fucking say something out loud, it's because I can't do it on my own. I'm not saying things out loud for myself. It's for, interestingly, when I went into that rage control thing, I was actually quite articulate. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. And that happened several times. And then at a certain point, I was like, if I say, I want fucking water, I want you to give me the fucking water. Or like I was saying, I can't, you know, I can't breathe enough. And they'd say, you know, well, try to breathe more deeply. I'm like, don't you fucking get it? I'm saying, I can't breathe. I'm dying. I'm dying. Really just ugly, abusive. Abusive. To me, it sounds, it just sounds like primordial survival instinct. Exactly. I was in pain, any kind of courtesy right now, because you need to survive, right? You're in pain, you've hit the, it's like when you, when the, when the, when the dishwashers open and you hit it with your shin, or you slam your finger in a door, you're like, motherfucking shit, fuck someone else. So, right, there was that element. But while I'll get to what I ultimately concluded about it momentarily, but, but yeah, so lashing out, right, not because I wanted to hurt other people, but because I'm terrified, you're in pain. And it was really, and then at a certain point I realized, I think I'd vomited, but I don't even remember, I realized, I have to, I'm going to shit my pants. And I was okay with that at that point. And I think I said, I'm going to, I'm going to shit my pants. And they're like, well, let's get you to the bathroom. And I probably yelled at them, I was like, you think I can get to the bathroom? But Joe, basically, practically fireman carried me. I mean, I was walking the barely. And I remember getting out onto the porch and them shining a light and being like, which ones are your flip flops? Because everyone's flip flops are out there. And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? You think I'm going to put on fucking flip flops? It was the most, but you're right. It was. It was like, I'm dying and none of you fucking get it. It is a very funny thing to ask someone in the depths of an Iowa experience to pick out flip flops. And when I'm in any kind of yoga shit, I can't pick out my flip flops with a clear mind. Yeah, it was like, I don't, I don't care if I step on shit or anything. Like this is life or death, man, and probably death. This is not flip flops. You think I'm worried about my under sole hygiene? And I was infuriated and horrified because they don't fucking get it. They don't fucking get it. Of course they did get it a lot better than I got it. And so I got, got to the bathroom. So it's like a 20 foot walk away from the Maloka to the bathroom. They probably strategically put it as close as possible so you don't smell anything. And I get there and Joe says, and I said something else. I don't remember what I said. And Joe says to me says, Adam, you're being very rude right now. I know you're suffering a lot and we're all trying to help you, but you're being very rude. And that just was the turning point for me. I hadn't realized, of course I knew I'm an adult. I must have, but it didn't register. Something, I like how the lights just changed. Like this is the epiphany moment of the extemporaneous solo show I'm doing right now. If you're in Duncan's studio, the lights just changed. But yeah, it was like, and my reaction was, Oh, I'm sorry. Wow, I'm sorry. And prior to that moment, my thought was Joe's coming to the bathroom with me. There's no way I can pull down my pants. But that snapping to reality, I was like, okay, I can, I'm going to try to go to the bathroom on my own. And I did. And I went to the bathroom. And also the physical action of going to the bathroom, moving my pants, all of that, putting on the toilet seat, that grounded me in physical reality. And that was when I started feeling better there too. Since we're saying it all, it came also in the bathroom, I had the realization, as I started connecting more to my body, I was like, why am I wearing clothes? It's 90 degrees. Clothes are silly here. Let me just, I don't need clothes. So I walked out of the bathroom naked to this waiting retin to of people who are trying to help me. And they assumed I'd soiled my pants. I hadn't. And they were like, you should put on your, if you're going back in, why don't you put on your clothes for other people? And I was like, oh, yeah, that's, that's fair. Wow. And I went, and by this point, I, amazingly, only maybe 10 minutes had elapsed since I went into the bathroom, I was able to walk back into the Maloka under my own power, shaky, but I was able to do it. And I got in there. And it hit me, one, how horribly selfish had been because, yeah, Duncan, it was this primordial reaction, but it was a choice to be that crying, which I was, I don't know if I mentioned, I was sobbing quite a bit during the early part two. That wasn't a choice. Riding around, probably not a choice. But swearing and saying that stuff, that was a choice. It was a choice that was, grew out of a great deal of pain and fear, but it was a choice. And it broke over me like a fucking wave as I'm lying in the Maloka, now feeling increasingly peaceful, that I had chosen to be very, very selfish. No judgment in that. But that had, that was a choice I made. And holy shit, I make that choice on a lower, less dramatic level all the time in my life without realizing it's a choice. I'm in pain. I'm anxious. I'm sad. And I don't think about, and I act in ways that I feel like, well, of course, I'm doing this because I'm hurting. And this is what I need to do, but it's not what I need to do. It's what I choose to do. That's heavy, man. And I realized, I mean, I knew intellectually, everything is a choice. The light's changed again, the timing is perfect. Is this Alexa, who we have to thank for this? Is she monitoring this conversation? It's that which Alexa emerges from. But it's all, and what I came out of that, it was this feeling of just growing awe that, God, I mean, I wonder about certain things in my life, for example, why intimate relationships have been difficult in recent years and why I can often feel isolated. I do have a lot of, and I'm very grateful for a lot of really wonderful connections and friendships. But there are times when I don't have that or don't let, basically seeing that, oh, I'm just really selfish a lot of the time. When I'm aware I have a choice, I think I often don't choose selfishness. I'll give myself that credit. But it's not really giving myself credit because it's a lot easier to think you don't have a choice than to think, oh, I have a choice, but I'm choosing selfishness. No, I just don't let myself see I have a choice a lot of the time. Cutting off someone walking down the stairs to the subway from that level all the way up to just being a jerk to my mom who's just calling because she's worried about me. Those are all choices. And it's interesting, isn't it, that when you begin to realize that the decision to be selfish is, in many cases, fundamentally violent to yourself and people around you. Yes, it's a violent form of, and right, and I've hurt myself so much with that. And just realizing how pervasive that choice is and realizing that now that I know I can make a different choice and not being so naive by this point in my psychedelic career and my human career, to think that, well, now that I realize that I'll just make those choices automatically, but knowing that now there's a chance now I have, I have a degree of freedom that I didn't have around this. And also realizing that so many things that I think are in choices are choices. I give away my power of free will if indeed we have that to, I don't know what to just, you could say the devil, but just habit, expediency to nothing. I don't even realize I'm giving it away so often. And so as I'm lying there, just gratitude, I start tearing up just, wow, so lucky to have this experience, to be given this experience as well as also real real feeling like, yeah, I've probably fucked up a few people's nights here. And also feeling like fighting myself wanting to think about how I'll apologize it to them. But that's a ghost snake. I don't need to figure that out. I'm just going to be present in a moment and say what I say. And feeling real, real power, but real humility, power that I have so much more power than I realized to choose humility that, you know, I'm so blind that I've been so blind that I've given it away for nothing that I think I'm an intelligent person, I think. But I miss the most obvious feature of my own existence, which is that I'm constantly choosing things. And my choices dictate my reality. The universe is going to respond how it responds. I don't control that. But if I choose A versus B, I'm going to get a different reality. It may not be the reality that I think I'll get from A versus B, but it will be different. And that if I don't like the reality I'm being given a lot of the time, well, the place to start and maybe to finish maybe the only place is what am I choosing right now? Yeah, who am I serving? Who am I serving? Yeah. Am I serving myself or am I serving the other? Yeah, or within my am I serving or like in a case like this? Am I serving a part of myself that ultimately gets away gets in the way of my service of others? Yeah, in connection with others. And that's in that saddest thing about it is it's like you're it's the it's you know, it's the it's the weird if you're I don't know where I heard this before, but it's like if your hand decided to start trying to feed itself, instead of putting food into your mouth, yeah, then your hand would die. And in the same way, like the ego gets confused because it thinks the way to gratify the senses is to do whatever it wants. When the reality that we all come into contact with once in a while is that simple moment where you're like, God, can I you know what? I'm going to listen to you right now as a form of service. I'm just going to listen to you. I'm not going to think about me for a second. I want to hear what you have to you know, when someone comes, you know, when someone comes to you, and they usually will in a kind of mundane way start off something and then all of a sudden the next thing you know, they're talking about putting their dog to sleep or whatever, right? That was their agenda. Yeah. Yeah, but they put their dog to sleep like five years ago. But like what you're saying right now, these things are caught in our body. So the dissonance wants to be healed. So the dissonance presents itself. Well, slow down on that. That's interesting. I haven't heard that you mean so that the trauma over this person putting their dog to sleep is compelling them to kind of bring this out with the hope that by presenting it to you, they can get some healing. Yeah. Yeah. Look, look, I'm hurt. I'm hurt. I'm hurt. I'm hurt. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. And they're going through the whole world going help me. Help me. Help me. And then when they come to you, you know, maybe, oh, yeah, just walking my dog in the park. And this woman, we're walking next to each other. She's like, what kind of dog is that? Oh, it's a poodle. Oh, that poodle, that poodle looks just like my poodle that I had. Paco had to put him to sleep recently. And then I'm like, Oh, I'm sorry. And she's like, well, not that reason. It's like a year and a half ago. And then like you're looking at her and you're like, Oh, no, it wasn't a year and a half. Right. This was two seconds ago. You're still putting Paco to sleep. If you're, if you're saying that right now, you're still putting Paco to sleep right now. You're in the room and you're watching the needle go in to Paco's neck and you're wanting to be healed. And so you're calling out in any way you don't realize it. She just thinks she's having conversations or walking. So in that moment, you can think, all right, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let's listen. I'm not, I'm clearly not going to bring Paco back to life. But if I can just be a node for a second of openness to and within that moment, be like, okay, okay, I'm right here. And guess what? You know, else is right. You don't say this or they'll think you're fucking crazy. You say, you know, else is here. Paco, he's right here with you. He didn't go anywhere. He's with you. He's not dead. Paco's here. Everything's here right here. And if you can just pretend that's real for a moment with that person, maybe they walk away. And for us, they don't even know. But just maybe you've like in some way, you've been a tie, you've been one stroke of sandpaper, just taking that edge and making it a little softer. And that's what anyone can do. Just listen, right? And then and then you become the servant, you know, and just like what this beautiful doctor did for you. Yeah. And also what I love about what he did is because, you know, a lot of times you would think, when I'm thinking, I like about it because I was thinking he's going to say, he's not certainly not going to say you're being rude. He's just going to be compassionate and be like, Oh, no, no, no, act the way that you want. But what I love about it is that he told the truth. Yeah. He told you the exact truth. He said very simply, here's what's happening. You're being rude. And that was the perfect medicine for you. Yeah. Yeah, it was because that was it. That was like, right, I didn't think of it that way. But really what he was saying is you're making a choice right now. Yeah. I am. Oh, wow, I am. Yeah. Is this the choice I want to be making? No, it's not not for it's not helping other people. And it sure as hell isn't helping me. And that's very true of a lot of the choices that I make, you know, I mean, the OCD is a lot better, but I'm still aware of, you know, we were talking about this before the podcast where, yeah, part of the integration is I think I realized under the OCD is is a lot of a hurt and loss. And I think the I developed the OCD as a way to avoid that. Yeah. And so now I'm experiencing the hurt and loss more. And the broken. Yeah. And and the best. And the best, but a huge part of me that's like, hell, fucking no, run away from this shit. Run away. We'd surf the internet, masturbate, watch the sunset. This is just litany of things I've done in the last 24 hours. Eat over eat. You know, whatever it is. But but yeah, it's trusting that because, you know, it's the same thing once you're, if you're aware of your vulnerability, this is what terrifies me about Trump. I don't want to bring that. But I feel like he's just totally unaware of his vulnerability and therefore is controlled by it. Yeah. And I think, you know, and I've been controlled and still am. And I think we all are to varying degrees, but, you know, it's a broken heart isn't fun. But if you're really in that moment with it, then there's a freedom there. And there is a beauty there. And unquestionably. And it helps you serve others because, I mean, man, I've been, I've, I've been tearing up over, you know, just seeing a, an old person alone on the subway who may have a very rich fulfilling life, by the way, and still, but, but maybe I do pick up something like, you know, just seeing what I perceive as the suffering of others and, and being touched by it. Oh yeah. Yeah. When the Nova Cane starts wearing off, it's going to hurt for a second. But then, like underneath that is such a, I mean, the, the broken heart is the X marks the spot on the treasure map. And underneath that is, is, is, I mean, that it's bliss. The broken heart is the pathway into, into bliss. And, and it's, that's what's, that's, but it is, I mean, it's something to avoid. Well, I think we evolved, let's bring it back to evolution. I think we evolved to avoid pain. And certainly the pains that we evolved to avoid initially, I would say are, you know, the, the pain in your stomach from not having enough food, the physical sensation of a snake's fang penetrating your epidermis, you know, stuff like that. And we're good at avoiding outside threats. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here, right? Our ancestors who weren't good at that, they didn't reproduce. Our, your, Duncan's ancestor, my ancestors, they were good at that. The problem is, I think the mind applies that same methodology to internal threats, to emotions and thoughts. And that's where it becomes pathological, because I'm having these emotions for a reason. First of all, I can't get rid of them because they're already inside of me. All I can do is try to suppress or distract. But that suppression or distraction actually causes more broken heart, causes more loss. Well, it causes, I mean, the, and an utter lack of service to other people. It causes a, you miss out on the, what, what may very well be the best part of life is that feeling of having a broken heart and how rare it is. Because it's rare, like you don't get a broken heart all the time. You don't fall in love all the time. You don't get a broken heart all the time. It's a very rare thing to have a broken heart. Oh no, my heart is broken. Oh God, no, I hope I never get a broken heart. And yet when you listen to the music and you're like, well, 80% of this great music came from a broken heart. And then when you read the scriptures and you realize these scriptures came from a broken heart. And when you realize that at any given moment all around the planet, there is a magnetic flow of broken hearts of, of, of pure and, and unadulterated sadness and loss. And then when you are in fortunate enough to have a broken heart, you suddenly are in the company of the saints. You're in the company of people who are experiencing reality firsthand. And that feeling you have walked into this ocean of brokenheartedness now it's not your broken heart. You think that feeling is just your broken heart. No, it's the broken heart that's been broken for eternity. And that is the wound, right? This is the Garden of Eden. This is like cast out of the garden. This is the original, what they call original sin, the eternal never ending ache, the Fisher King wound, you know, that thing. And then when you're there for a second, then when you're there, that's when you can heal it. You know, that's when in your little pixel of the great eternal broken heart, just maybe by being present with it, and you can convert it, you can shift it and, and start healing like I think what may be a wound upon our species or something. Who knows? I don't know. But I do know when I had a broken heart, Roshi, Joan Halifax said to me at Ramdas's house, this is right after my mom died. And I would, and she said to me, and I'll never forget it. Cause in the midst of it, I was like, God, I don't know if I really like what you're saying. But she said, right now a window is opened up for you. A window is opened up for you. You're, you don't get this very often. You don't get this very often in a life. You should in this, this is where you can, you can really, really do the work. And whenever your heart breaks, a window opens, and when that window opens, your instinct is to shut the fucking thing, pull the blinds down and pull up, board up the window and start choking off, shut it curtains, you porn. And that's it. But, but when you're, when you're in that, when you're lucky enough that all of your lifetime of effort and like a zombie movie, putting boards in front of the window, fucking hammering nails over the window, pushing the dresser in front of the window, putting the boards in front of the dresser and then sitting in front of that with a shotgun or whatever. If you're lucky enough to find that that window gets blown open. And what's on the other side of that, isn't the zombies that you thought were there when you, when you first sealed the thing up, but just this beautiful, beautiful universe that you've been hiding from. As Jack Cornfield often says, he, I think he's quoting Hafiz, the Sufi poet, he says, fear is the cheapest room in the house. I hope you choose better accommodations. And like, when you see that, that, ah, when it, when you're like, Oh my God, the thing I was boarding up was heaven. And that, yeah. I mean, when you said that, that, that to me is also part of the signature of the psychedelic experience where you have this, you know, absolute terror, absolute terror. And then when you open up to it, it's unity. It's the thing. It's the, yeah. Yeah. But it is, but in the moment, and it's, yeah, it's, wow. Man, what a great conversation. I got to tell you, man, this really hit the spot for me. Like, I, I feel like I was there with you that night and I, I'm really interested in this place. What was the name of this place? Nihwe Rau. It's spelled N-I-H-U-E is the first word. And then R-A-R-O-A is the second word. Wow. Yeah. Well, and, and also, um, you, you have a show, the mushroom cure. Is, are you still putting this on right now? Yes. Uh, we are doing it. We're about to start actually in San Francisco, where I'll see you in Oakland for the MAPS conference. So we're doing a run at the Marsh Theater in San Francisco starting, it's from April 19th to June 3rd. Cool. Yeah. April 19th, of course, Bicycle Day. That's not coincidental. Yes. Very nice. Yeah. So April 19th to June 3rd. And that is the story we were talking about earlier. That's the true story of how I tried to cure my, at that time, really debilitating OCD with psychedelics after reading a study. I think you've got some more things to add to this show, probably. Or maybe it's the next show, but, but yeah. Well, uh, thank you very much. Thank you, man. It's been a great talking really. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Adam Strauss everybody.

Today, the Nightmare Legion sent seven black dragons over the city of Vestox, where they sprayed superheated acid onto two orphanages and a fish market. Gravy Goose claims the orphanage and fish markets were harboring forbidden clones. The blame for this attack falls squarely on the shoulder of the corrupt Paladins of Gander, who chose to hide their abominations in the cellars of civilian buildings. I and my dragons only walk peace, but in this instance had no choice. And deadly flooding caused the evacuation of happy, pretty people, Wisdomtown, and its outlying villages. We know this flooding is happening because the peasantry continue to use unicorn oil to light their lanterns. We must switch to glow crystals, or we can only expect disasters like this to continue. I'm Hammy Hound, and this is Lord's News Today. Lord's News Today is supported by the Necromancers Institute of Orphan Betterment. Support also comes from the Paladins of Gander, Paladins of Gander, here for all Anaria. The War of the Cursed Crown, as it's being called by Lord Betterment, continues to rage in western Andaria. The embattled city of Vesthox underwent another round of dragon attacks, this time liquefying an orphanage and a fish market, and resulting in the deaths of at least 30 orphans and seven fishmongers. From the front line, Dieter Dambo reports. Dieter, can you tell us what you're seeing there on the ground? Last night, while precious orphans slept, black dragons spade their poison upon Vestax. I'm being told that the acid coming from these dragons is like no other, as not only does it liquefy, but residual acid blobs explode when exposed to sunlight, making it impossible for rescuers to pull any survivors out of the ruins. Scenes of inspeakable carnage have been reported, and the citizenry have been ordered to take shelter in the mines of Prince Dreff. Are there any signs that the Nightmare Legion will stop these dragon attacks? Even in the face of collectivized curses from the Council of Wizards, the Sisters of Light, the Priests of the Peaceful Mother, and Calor Attacks from Battalions of Chromatic Dragons, the Banished One, Gravy Goose, remains set on continuing these attacks until his Ring of Eternal Life is returned to his keep in Fardale. In a decree issued after the Feast of Skulls, Gravy Goose made this statement. I was chosen by the blood maidens to live forever. I passed the trials of the ancient scribes. I crossed the desert of no return and retrieved the Skulls of Time, and for my efforts, I was given the Ring of Eternal Life by Dandy Tandy herself, and now the corrupt paladins who secretly performed forbidden rituals in the Sanctum of Gander show their true colors by refusing to return that which is mine. I have no choice but to continue my liberation of Vestox until that which is my destiny is returned to my keep. King Davis continues to pledge and dyeing support to the people of Vestox and vows to supply the lords of Vestox with a full military package, including a fresh battalion of telepathic warrior club. We now go to Beater, where shrines of sadness have been erected outside the Buckington Academy where a tutor was evaporated by an eradicating order. All know what this is. The royal class and all of their bootlicking lords and ladies expect us to sit back while the tax collectors pick our pockets so that we can fund yet another ridiculous war against Gravy Goose who only wants his property returned to him. Is Gravy Goose a vile criminal? Yes, we all know this, but he has only done exactly what he said he would do if another of his artifacts was stolen by the Paladins of Gander. Are we to forget that he has the stone of destruction and can at any moment bring us back to the age of desolation? Here, with counterpoint, his commander, Pean Pean, adviser to the House of Gander. Pean Pean, thoughts on this ridiculous war. Nobody wants war. Nobody. Then end the war. Do you really believe that Gravy Goose is just going to go back to his keep and taken out? If we show weakness and return his artifact, granting him eternal life, then he will do just what the blasphemer did during the Weaver Wars. Is that what you want? I suppose you love the idea of armies of undead dragging our children into the forest. Don't be ridiculous. Greetings, pals. It's me, Duncan Trussell. This is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. We have got a great episode for you today. Robert Waldinger is here with us today. He's the director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development. He's also a Zen priest, and they've just released a wonderful book called The Good Life, which is based on a 75-year-long Harvard study of adult life and what it means to find happiness. It's probably not what you think. Pals, did you know that if you want commercial-free episodes of the DTFH, you can find that at patreon.com.dtfh. Subscribe.

And now, everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Robert Waldinger. Let's begin. Let's begin. Let's begin. Welcome to the DTFH. It's so nice to meet you. I'm very excited to chat with you. Thank you for your attention. Thank you for being here. Thank you for coming. Welcome to the DTFH. It's been Duncan Trussell. Welcome. Welcome to the DTFH. It's so nice to meet you. I'm very excited to chat with you about your work. Thanks for having me. I'm really glad to be here. Let's just jump into the deep water. Not only are you one of the pre-minute experts on happiness, maybe in the world, you're also a Zen Buddhist. Am I correct about that? I'm a Zen priest and actually a Roshi. Roshi, tell me from the Buddhist perspective if you had to before we get into the Western definition, what is the Buddhist definition of happiness? Happiness I think probably is just being present for whatever arises. That's it. There's nothing else. Being present in whatever arises. To me, I can do that while being miserable. I think I can do that while feeling scared, angry, pissed off, and yet still maintain some level of presence in the midst of really awful feelings. But I wouldn't call that happiness. No, you're right. The sort of hedonistic idea of happiness, like are we having fun now? No. But I think there's a kind of okaness or the back pain or the itchy nose or whatever we're annoyed by and don't want to have. But just to be there for it and say, okay, here it is. Come on. That leads to a kind of equanimity even in the midst of not liking what's arising in this moment. This equanimity that you're talking about having studied Buddhism and I don't want to say failure in relation to Buddhism, but bringing into mind these practices I've been taught that I know that you have been taught, for example, waking up in the middle of the night your mind offering you the gift of whatever the particular person in your life that you're most annoyed with, the subsequent burst of anxiety around that increase in wakefulness at 3 a.m. another adrenaline spike. No, you're not going back to sleep. How are you going to go back to sleep? You're pissed now in the middle of the night for no reason. And then I try to apply this ride the wave, they say. It's a wave. It's a we can ride this wave. And sometimes it really feels like I am shoveling shit against the tide, not surfing. Absolutely. And you know, sometimes that's all it is. You can't surf. You're just shoveling shit against the tide. But you know, one of my teachers would say to me sometimes like I would come in and sit down and say, I'm just so furious. I'm just in rage. And he would say, okay, go back out there, sit on your cushion and be the Buddha of rage. Just become intimate with that rage. Dive right in. And that I found, first of all, it makes it go away. I mean, it makes it subside. But to just embrace it, to just say, I'm just all in for shoveling this shit, right? That that I have found is the most helpful thing. Even at 3 a.m., you know, when I'm like, no, I can't believe I'm awake and thinking about this person who's annoying me. They're just, oh, this is what it's like to be, you know, to be awake at 3 a.m. And this is what my body's like. And this is what it feels like in my head. And, you know, that it's just that turning toward that I've learned to do. And it's not great. But it's what I've learned to do that's better than all the agony of trying to push something away that you can't push away. Isn't there something claustrophobic about that, though? Isn't there some, you know? Yeah. Oh, I agree. So I'll do things like if I can, like not at 3 a.m., but I'll go for a walk because I know that, like, if I change my mental, if I have some physical activity and I can change my mental state as well, I can get out of that headspace just by a vigorous walk, you know? Okay. So I agree with you. It's not like you just sit there and grin and bear it no matter what, because sometimes you just can't. Right. It just seems unbearable. And then, you know, I think for a lot of us who have taken up some spiritual path, who have experienced the relief that is there as well, it's not all just shoveling shit against the tide. You also get a glimpse at the very least of some other way that you can live in the world that's very different from maybe what you thought was going to be your future. And I think what makes those moments much more unbearable is that they seem, at least for me, they seem to come after these spiritual peaks, after these moments of clarity. Yeah. What is that? Why does that happen? Well, you know, was it Joseph Goldstein who did that series of interviews with people who had had enlightenment experiences, and he wrote them up and put them into a book, and the title of the book is After the Ecstasy, And he's like saying, you know, this is just what it is. So the universe will deliver some shit to us right after we've had a wonderful, blissful experience because that's the truth of life. Yeah. And this Eastern stuff, the definition of happiness according to a Buddhist or someone in an Eastern mystical tradition is it the same definition in the West? Is it when you start talking about equanimity, when you start talking about some of these things, does that translate into your work in the West on happiness? You know, I think the biggest difference between Eastern philosophies and our Western sensibility is about the sense of well-being being so tied up with the universe and everybody else, collective well-being mattering so much in many Eastern cultures and this kind of culture of rugged individualism that's a total myth, right? We know it's a total myth, but it's what we cling to, especially here in the good old US of A. What do you mean myth? What do you mean myth? Well, you know, the idea that I am a separate fixed thing called Bob, just not the truth, right? Right. So you look at these self-made men and they're often men who declare themselves self-made, like, you know, I've done it all myself. Don't stand on anybody's shoulders. Don't rely on anybody. Haven't gotten a leg up at any time. That is such garbage, right? Right. But we hold these myths and we say, oh well, that person, and I can point to a prominent political figure, but I won't. But as an iconic person who holds himself out as I've done this myself and I'm quite special and that I think is a sensibility that infects Western culture more than Eastern culture. Right. And that's what I would say is like maybe the biggest difference between what constitutes well-being in the Eastern cultures that I know of and what constitutes well-being, you know, in the frontier mythology of the American West. Frontier mythology still with us. And then, you know, add to that, that because of the economic structure of pretty much everything these days, we live in a market economy, you need to get a nice profit margin. I'm sure you, I don't know, have you ever watched Shark Tank? I never have, but it sounds awful. You gotta watch. Really? You gotta watch. Because, you know, these individuals they represent what you're talking about, these individuals represent their, I don't know, billionaires, trillionaires, some of them own football teams or sports teams. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the entire show is based on taking someone who's got an idea that you like, using your infinite wealth that you're accruing interest on so that you'll never run out of money, giving them some loan or another and taking a chunk of their business and then sort of celebrating your like harshness in your deal making in that moment, that person. Not to ruin Shark Tank for people, but as it turns out, many of those deals don't even happen. They're just talking so someone comes, they've got a new way of making a milkshake or something. You, they give you a story about it, usually very sentimental. You say, all right, I'll give you $100,000 for 30% steak in your company. They're like I guess so. I'm actually destitute. I had to walk here 10 miles. I can't afford a new one, but yeah, I'll take it. And then the deal falls through. But I'm only mentioning it because you know, all the, whoever the particular flavor of horror of the week is showing up on the internet. You know how we have that. It's like professional wrestling. We do. Now we're mad at Andrew Tate. He's the YouTube influencer who got arrested in, I think, Romania for sex trafficking. Terrifying person in the sense that I guess he is his number one fan base or 14 year old boy. Oh no. He's presenting this idea of like you lift weights, you make as much money as you can. Get out of the matrix. They want you to be weak. You know, look at me. I'm ripped. This thing, right? So but it's all part of myth is what you're saying. You're saying this is all part of a Western mythology. And can I say that actually one of the reasons why we wrote this book is that, so we did this study, you know, we're in our 85th year of following the same people. So you follow entire lives. And when you follow thousands of people year after year after year, what you see is that no life looks like those myths. Friends, it's 2023. And that means it's time for you to supremify, perfectify, ultra uberify your business. Hiring new people can be scary, lonely, creepy and feel overwhelming.

They have twists and turns and adversities and people have weaknesses and strengths and they mess up and then they do great things and it's just all kaleidoscope most lives are kaleidoscopes they're not these kind of straight paths with lots of testosterone and with lifting lots of weights and Oh, but wouldn't you like to get on testosterone? I sure would. I had testicular cancer I can't. I'd be blast in steroids all day long just to know what it feels like but off my wife's like, you can't take that stuff I want more babies. It'll destroy your sex drive. It's like I can't take it if I wanted to I have testicular cancer it causes that anyway. Good for her. But wouldn't it be fun though to be ripped? Don't you wonder even with all of your views of the backstage the thing we don't get to see the thing when these people are off stage they're not presenting themselves as the ripped super healthy very balanced person you're seeing the nervous breakdowns the divorces you're seeing the sicknesses the reaction to economic collapse not the stuff on stage isn't there some part of you that still still plays around with the idea of like wouldn't it be nice to be a billionaire and wouldn't it be but also well I don't have that fantasy anymore because I've studied some billionaires and they're not happier than anybody else but there's the fantasy that somebody somewhere has it all figured out and one of the problems with social media is that we curate our lives for each other like I don't post my photos of when I'm hungover in the morning I don't do that I post you know me on a beautiful beach or me about to dig into a magnificent plate of food right so if you look at my posts or I look at your posts like I would think you've got it all figured out and I don't right and all of us yearn for somebody who's got it figured out that we can emulate this happens in spiritual practice too as I know you know right you know that we want somebody to be so enlightened that they're just totally arrived and it's all good for them all the time and that's not the truth of enlightenment either it's just not the truth of human life no and this brings me back to the claustrophobia to the to where you really hit this place of like oh my god it's Santa Claus oh my god we've all fallen for another version of Santa Claus yes not only is there not a bearded philanthropist in the North Pole with elves making stuff for kids there's nobody out there who's got it figured out exactly that there isn't that person my dream of that person is not some muscular dude telling me about real estate investment opportunities my version of that is the cave somewhere in the homolius sitting in caves enlightened masters radiating another version that I have that I it's really dumb that I fall prey to but I think I'm not the only one these days the UFO fantasy some like maybe there's okay if there's no human on the planet who's got it figured out maybe some of these whatever they are zipping around now the alien crafts are being operated by beings who are about to land present themselves to us and calm everybody down and so when I okay so that's like the opposite of the QAnon fantasy where the Jews have a satellite that's controlling everything and yeah right oh yeah yours is the benign UFO fantasy but we both what's weird about all conspiracy theories related to a global elite with absolute power and my dumb ass I mushroom fantasy of some celestial entities saving my ass and the planet's ass both of them bear the same essence which is you know as dark and diabolical as the QAnon people whoever might picture this whoever they are people it's still those people have it more figured out than you right like the Illuminati at least they know what they're doing I don't like yeah maybe there's an apharius plot and there's false flags and all that stuff but at least someone out there is organized at least someone out there has a plan so when I hear you say uh-uh no no no it's not like that not like that no but I've got thousands of life histories to prove it I mean that's where you know I really can say because we we've done this right you know it's the longest in-depth study of the same lives that's ever been done and I can say honestly nobody ever has it all figured out but isn't that a relief in a way because that also means that you're not an outlier there it's not like everybody else has it figured out and you don't realize that nobody does it's a relief I guess in the same way that it might be a relief when the person you are lost in the woods with finally admits that they're lost and you're like okay great now we can I'll stop following your lost ass around and start like listening to myself to see if I can find a way out of the woods it's not a relief though if you have allowed yourself any version of the rescue fantasy version of the someone's coming to save you or you're finally going to find the right teacher the right practice the right business model that is going to rescue you from whatever your particular life conditions are so in that way it's a little unnerving honestly I mean do you think that it could be possible for a person to figure it out could it be possible for a person to go against your data set and actually figure whatever this is out well you know I mean I think about this in terms of my zen practice you know is there reincarnation I don't know I can't know really so your question is is there there can't be somebody who's fully enlightened fully macho, fully whatever and and has got a no I can't be sure maybe there is maybe there's reincarnation you know maybe there's a god who was born from immaculate conception I don't know I can't say I can just say that the truth of my experience is I've never met some points in their life and god knows I struggle at times so and I find that a relief rather it is a little sad because my fantasy won't come true but it's more of a relief than it is sad to me right yeah I could see that I mean it's to get back to the social media thing I mean we're crucifying ourselves on these presentations by other people you know you're crucifying yourself when you see that person who's achieved the thing that you think you never will or the person with a body that you're never going to have because you're too old to have that body or lips you shall never kiss you know what I mean the road not taken like that's just I'm just never going to be a major league baseball player it's just not going to happen for me oh blasphemy this is I love that you call it a myth in dark moments I've thought of it as like my god there really is a secret religion you want to find the secret religion you want to find like the true bohemian grove it's not out in the woods with a bunch of old dudes plotting whatever their next interest rate hike is it's not that at all isn't the secret religion you're talking about is the one where we're praying an unachievable version of ourselves and constantly failing it's never showing up it's not coming you're just where you're at right now this is it now have you the other thing that I know that shows up in buddhism a lot but I get why I'm sure in this study have you ever seen a life that was going just great where everything seemed fine instantly cut off by catastrophe doom death yes of course of course and I bet you have too I bet most of us have where somebody just you know one of my sangha mates in my zen group just he adored biking wonderful biker was out in another state running a race got hit by a car and an instant was gone right great life doing what he loved dead I mean that just it is just you know one of the things we say in zen actually it's from Korean Zen master he said it's hard to guarantee even a morning and an evening like we just don't know and that's something that if we're lucky can allow us to appreciate the preciousness of just being alive I mean you know here you and I are having this conversation that's kind of a great thing to be able to do it's my favorite thing it's my favorite thing to do I love it so much but also you know when I have these conversations it's not pleasant in the normal sense right now all I'm feeling is in just that brief reminder all I'm feeling is that you know like when you're on a plane and you're relaxing you're watching a show or whatever you're chilling out maybe you got a nice seat or something and then all of a sudden it occurs to you how fast that plane is going you know oh my god I'm rocketing through the sky right now everyone's chilling out babies are sleeping you're in a missile and if you you know if you let your mind run away with you it can cause some panic and I think for a lot of people when they hear you that gentle reminder that comes to us from a lot of the eastern traditions suddenly oh my god I'm not calming now I'm really not calming down live a good life well I'm not going biking I'm gonna dig a bunker surround myself you know I need foam someone wrap me in foam give me a helmet I'll just start wearing a helmet all the time so how does that realization lead to the ability to relax enough to ride those waves to be in the moment you know science actually there's research on this and it shows that we get happier as we get older that as a species we get happier you would think we'd get sadder because it looks sad to be old turns out it's not it's the reverse that starting about in your 40s we start to get gradually happier and they're pretty sure from the research that this happens at least in part because of this increasing awareness of our mortality that we get more of a sense of okay this is not a dress rehearsal life really is short I am really gonna die and it's getting closer and closer and rather than make us more panicky rather than make us sadder it makes us savor what we have music

All you gotta do is go to Casper.com forward slash family hour, news offer code family hour and you will get $50 towards a brand new mattress. Casper. Hello my dear sweet children of the moon. It is I D Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast and today is Friday, February 3rd. This is a very special day because this will be the last day that I spend in Ari's beautiful mansion in New York City. Our stuff finally arrived at my new place and I gotta admit it's going to be tough to leave the palatial grounds of this incredible place with its beautiful ostriches, the monkey house, the perfumery, the massage area, the glory holes, the endless vats of high grade lubricant around every single corner to head from such a oasis in the midst of the busy lunacy of New York City to my new place, a small four bedroom brownstone with not even an Olympic size pool, just a basic size pool and a fairly normal jacuzzi and UV sauna system is going to be tough but I didn't come out here to have it easy. I didn't come out to New York City so that I could lull around in the incredible grounds of Ari's beautiful estate. I didn't come to New York City so that I could spend day after day after day inhaling high grade hashish and opium and floating around the lazy river that moves through his mansion. I didn't come to New York City so that I could enjoy endless fisting sessions with his Peruvian masseuse Dunuta. I came here to work and so I'm going to leave. I'm not going to stay. Ari has not returned. He's still in Myanmar. The ostriches are starting to get depressed. His psychic has indicated to me that Ari has made contact with some angel or entity somewhere in Myanmar and the transmission that he's going to receive is going to be so powerful that Ari could truly come back to the United States with a new name and potentially with powers that will allow him to reign supreme over the entire planet. I don't know. It could be true. Ari's a mysterious fellow but I got a lot of packing to do now. I've got to get all my stuff gathered up from the various rooms. I've got to pick up a couple of my gyms that I left in his gymery and then I got to go. I got to turn the key in to his butler Ramon and head on out. So I don't have a lot of time to do much of an intro here and you know what? This podcast doesn't really need an intro because this is my favorite kind of podcast. His guest, Donnie Cates, is a writer. He writes comic books and he is a hard worker who achieved his dreams and we talk about this here. So if you're looking for some inspiration, if you want to get a little affirmation that your instincts regarding hard work are correct, you know actually there is a, you know, a one of my friends told me there's a Mexican saying and I know I'm going to fuck it up. This is a friend of mine who lived in Mexico for a while but the Mexican saying is something like there's no problem that working 12 hours a day can't fix and I think that's a very simple and beautiful truth which is that if you look at your situation, whatever it may be, however miserable it may be, of course there are clearly exceptions for this. For example, you might currently be attached to meat hooks being slowly dropped down into a vat of acid by people in the mafia. Maybe your toenails haven't even touched the acid yet but the fumes from the vat are making your eyes water and there's just pretty much nothing you could do. You've got fish hooks attached to the medius parts of your body and armed guards are watching as you slowly, slowly are dropped into this vat of liquefying doom. So in that case, yeah, 12 hours of hard work probably isn't really going to do much for you but if you consider your situation, that being the exception, then more than likely there's more that you can be doing than what you're doing right now. You can work harder, you could do more. Shit, even if you are getting lowered down into the vat, maybe if you figure out a way to wriggle in the right way or swing or make a distraction, there's always hope. And so whenever I get to talk to people who have gotten where they are, not by some stroke of good luck or some, I don't know, bit of coincidence, by the way, I don't think I've ever talked to anyone like that, whenever I talk to people who have gotten to where they're at through hard fucking work and focus and risk, then it always inspires me, it makes me want to work harder, makes me want to risk more, makes me want to think about my intentions behind things. So I think you're really going to love this episode. We're going to dive right into it, but first some quick business. Ramon, can you bring me another glass of sherry, please? Yes. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Casper.com. There's no need for you to be withering away on that awful, squeaky, oily poop mat that you call your bed. My God, there is a spectrum of pleasure in this universe, friends. There is a spectrum of pleasure and there's no reason that your bed should be on the wrong side of that spectrum. You should look forward to laying down in the soft, beautiful, glorious field of sleep called your mattress, not dreading that moment when your body connects with a thing that's basically a glue trap for mice at this point. It's so covered with your fever, sweats and tears and the psychic energy of your trembling nightmares being induced by the fact that you're laying on a cube of death instead of relaxing on an island of sweet tranquility. And that's what a Casper mattress will offer you. I sleep on a Casper mattress and that's all you need to know, friends. But there are some required talking points, some stuff you need to know if you're thinking about making the leap into a Casper. It's an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. It combines springy latex and supportive memory fumes to create an award-winning sleep service with just the right sink and just the right bounce. The bounce part, you know what that means. It's good for jumping on. Time Magazine named it one of the best inventions of 2015. An award-winning mattress that won't disappoint. Re-shipping and returns to U.S. and Canada. Try Casper for 100 nights risk-free in your own home. If you don't love it, they'll pick it up and refund you everything. It is made in America.

That's your thing. Fine. That's your fur mattress, you monster. Lay on the pelts of thousands of animals that only wanted to frolic in the glades. But I'm gonna take it Casper.

You know what? I'm on the precipice of buying friends. I'm on the precipice of buying the new PlayStation HD super system and the VR goggles that go along with it. I know that's stupid because I already have an HTC Vive but I've moved into this apartment and I don't know. Wait, no. I moved into a five bed. I lied earlier. Fuck it. I don't know if I've ever, where I can set up a Vive in my New York apartment.

I'm going to be doing a show at the Bell House in Brooklyn and boy do we have a really, really cool guest for this one guys. February 21st, tickets are located in the calendar at Dunkin' Trestle.com. If you're a psychonaut, this is definitely a good show for you friends. So I guess that's it. February 21st at Bell House. Oh yeah, if you want to go deep, I'm going to be doing the Springer treat in Maui with Romdoss in May. I'll be doing live podcasts there if you want to come and hang out in Hawaii. It's an inevitably great time and as much as I'm loving this New York winner, I'm looking forward to laying on the beach in Maui and I hope you'll join me. All right, that's it. Today's guest is a comic book writer who currently has a hit comic book out on the shelves. Actually it's not on the shelves because it's sold out. It's called God Country and it's amazing. Download the PDF if you don't feel like waiting for the reissue to come out because it's so smart. He's an amazing writer who I had the extreme pleasure and honor of working with. I met him at San Diego Comic Con. We came up with an idea for Heavy Metal Magazine and you can see that in the flesh in December's episode issue of Heavy Metal Magazine, we did that with the amazing artist Andy Bellinger. So now everyone, send deep, deep tendrils into the darkest, most uncharted parts of your subconscious mind and allow those tendrils to suction that hidden reservoir of creative juice deep from within you. Allow it to transfuse your entire body, pushing out any blocks, obstacles, or anything keeping you from achieving absolute creative euphoria and in that moment of pure bliss as you recognize the power of your creative self exploding out of you like some magma rocketing out of a super volcano underneath a pathetic human city. Direct that blast of glorious energy to the astral plane so that it may connect with the mind of today's guest, the glorious Donnie Cates. Welcome to the DTFH, it is so cool to have you on, thank you so much for being a guest on the show. Oh, thanks for having me, dude, I'm so excited. You are a rock star in the world of comic books. I tried to, I went to a comic book store here in New York to pick up a copy of God Country because I only have the first PDF that you sent to me, they're like, when I asked about it, they acted like somebody at the Apple store on the first day of the release of an iPhone. Like they looked at me like, really? You think you can get a copy of that? No way. Yes, they're like, yeah, it's sold out. It's all sold out. How does that feel, man? You are right. I mean, you've got like a hit comic book series right now on Image Comics. It's got to be one of the coolest feelings on earth. It's a fucking trip, man. It really is. You know, so me and Jeff Shaw, who's the guy who draws that book, he's an amazing artist. He's amazing. Oh yeah. Oh my God. I have worked together twice before. While those books were positively received and everything, it's nothing like this. Jeff was actually here in Austin for the release of the book and we did a signing and everything. So we were just hanging out the entire day and we weren't able to really get on Twitter or really gauge the reaction of it. And then, yeah, we got home that night to the news that it had sold out and we're going to a second printing and all this stuff and I think, I mean, well, Jeff said it best really where he was just like, you know, we can only fuck this up now. We can only really ruin this now. Well, I mean, yeah, that's actually a scary and great point. And isn't that one of the scary things about getting momentum is that the faster you go, the more you can hurt yourself. And I'm sure when it comes to, I mean, I don't know how far ahead you've planned out this series, but you've, you know, and again, unfortunately, I've only read the PDF that you sent me and which is amazing and has the, you know, it's such a deep, poignant story mixed in with what seems like it's potentially going to be incredible, you know, with a mythical overt that's if you've hit, you've brought these two wires together and that's really brilliant way. Yeah, I could see how keeping that level of storytelling going, man, that is, that could be really stressful. Well, the thing is, is like, it's this that you, you know, the way that comic book scheduling goes is, you know, you're working so far in advance. So I've, you know, I've written, you know, all of it, like it's all done. Oh, wow. It's only, it's only a six issue story. It's a mini series. Oh, okay. Yeah. We wanted to tell a very short contained kind of, you know, a complete story, you know. Do you regret that now? Like, did, had you known that this, that it was going to take off the way it did, would you have maybe made it go on a little bit longer? No, man, I, you know, I've, you're not the only person who's asked me that and, you know, I, I'm a big fan of endings, man. I think that stories are, are, you know, are only really made powerful by their third acts. Um, and, you know, this is kind of hard for me to talk about because no one's read the rest of the book. But, you know, I think once people read the book, they'll understand that this is, we, we're trying to accomplish something. We're trying to say something, you know, um, you know, I think that anyone who's read that first issue can tell that it's not just a book about like giant Jack Kirby gods. No. We're, we're trying to do a thing, you know, well, the, the, the idea of the forgetful God, how, you know, that, that being sort of the representation, a lot of people think that's what all of us are, you know, that we're, we're kind of collectively God with Alzheimer's disease. Was that intentional? Did you, did you, did you draw off of those ideas that human beings are actually God with a kind of amnesia? No, I mean, to be completely honest, where God country came from, um, by the way, sorry spoiler guys, if you didn't read the first episode, but not really a spoiler, because I think that I think it's kind of up for interpretation. The, the, the thing that you just said about, you know, the, I mean, yeah, I think everyone knows that it's about Alzheimer's and, and, and Kirby gods and stuff like that. Um, but not really. I mean, I, I, I kind of had a bit of a profound medical thing happen to me about like two years ago. Uh, I had pancreatitis. Uh, I don't know if you are familiar with that or sounds horrible. Not familiar. It's a fucking bummer, man. Uh, yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's incredibly painful. Um, and it was, uh, it was pretty life altering, you know, like I turned 30 and like within like the first like two months of being 30, my body just started shutting down on me. You know? Um, so you go through something like that where you kind of go through your 20s thinking you're invincible and stuff and drinking your head off and, you know, doing all kinds of wild shit and then it catches up with you really hard. Um, and so, you know, two years ago, I, you know, I went through that thing and kind of had a, like a, I touched my own mortality. That makes any sense. You know? I had a brush with that idea that things can just go away, you know? Um, was it, is, is, can pancreatitis have a terminal prognosis or were you concerned it could have been something more than pancreatitis? Here's the thing about pancreatitis is, so when it happened to me, I woke up at like three in the morning, um, see, I felt like somebody had shot me, like right below my sternum, like your, like your pancreas is kind of dead center in the middle of your body. Um, yeah. And so, I mean, it just felt like trying to, I mean, it's, it's really kind of impossible to explain. It's the absolute most amount of pain that I've ever experienced in my life. And I've read other reports from people who have like given birth and also had pancreatitis or compare it to like kidney stones and they've, they've all said that pancreatitis is far and away, like just one of the worst things that's ever happened. I wouldn't wish, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Um, but I went to the emergency room and the doctor came in and he, he knew immediately what it was. They shot me up with morphine twice. It did nothing. Um, and then they came in and they shot me up with dilaudid. Oh yeah. It was just heroin. Yes. Um, and I could, I was still in pain. Two shots of morphine, one shot of heroin. Jesus. And I was still in agony, but at that point I just didn't care because I was so stoned out of my mind. Yeah. Um, and basically the doctor told me, look, there's two things that are going to happen here. I'm going to go, I'm going to go run your blood work and there's two options. One, this is acute in which case you're going to be in pain for about three months. And then it'll go, cause there's nothing, there's actually nothing they can do to actually calm the pancreas itself down. What causes it? Well, in my case, um, I didn't really have the healthiest of lifestyles I was drinking to God damn much. I'm sober now, um, as a result of this, um, like it literally took a punch in the stomach to get me to, to like, wise up, right? Oh fuck. Yeah. So the doctor said, you know, um, he said it's either going to be acute in which case, you know, it's going to hurt for three months and then it'll start to go away, but you have to change your diet and all this stuff, or it's chronic and it's never going to go away. Oh Christ. Yeah. Yeah. He left and there was like this, I hate to get into such a downer like right away in the podcast, but to explain like kind of where this book came from, I think it's important. I, so, you know, I, I was alone, I mean, I was with my wife, but I mean, I was so stoned out of my head and in pain, everything was a haze, right? Um, and I had this moment where I thought about what that doctor said and was like, man, I'm, I'm like 10 minutes away from finding out what the rest of my life looks like. Yeah. And, and if it ends up being chronic, like, I don't, I don't think I'm going to do that. Like, you know, like I kind of had a, I had, I made a choice that like, if this is what the rest of my life is going to be like, then like, I don't want to live like that, you know, and making that choice, not actually going through with it, you know, I didn't take my own life or anything, but like consciously making that choice in your head is profound. Like it's such a profound thing to happen to your own psyche, to just decide that. Yes. And it was, there was no doubt in my mind that that was what was going to happen, you know. Now, you know, all things being equal, I wasn't on a lot of drugs and a lot of pain. So maybe I would have gone a week afterwards and not done it or whatever. But at the time, it's certainly how I felt. He came back and he said that it was just a cute three months of the worst pain in real life, just three months, three months. Yeah. So like I was saying, you, they actually can't do anything to make the pancreas settle down. All they can do is, is like fill you with pain pills until it calms down on its own. And so they gave me, I mean, what looked to be like a, like a, like a, like two Coke can stock, like, like stacked on top of each other full of pain pills. And my wife asked him, like, well, how often should I give him these? And the doctor literally said, anytime you want, and as many of them as he wants, like he's, he's not going to remember the next three months of his life. Good Christ. Yeah. And it was, I mean, it was like that. I really don't, I have like clips of it, like a slideshow of that time of my life. I was, when this happened, I was two 10, I was like 210 pounds. Yeah. Um, inside of the first, I think like the first month and a half, I was down to 170. Holy shit. Yeah. Cause the other thing is that like you can't, you can't eat solid food either, uh, because your pancreas sits right in front of your stomach. And so if your stomach enlarges it all, it'll put pressure on it. So I was on the liquid diet, you know, um, and you can't shit because you're on all those painkillers. Yeah. There's that. Um, yeah. Did you get hooked on the pain pills? Did you get physically addicted? Oh, that's good. I mean, I, I, I guess I did during it, but I, but I needed them. Like it wasn't like I was getting high. It was just like, it was really just a thing of like, they were, I mean, for all intents and purposes, they were just like sleeping pills because the only thing I ever wanted to do was just like not be here because every moment I was awake was agony. You know? Oh my God. Uh, it was terrible, but I will say this to any, um, any editors who are hearing this, I met all of my deadlines that entire time, turned in every script. Now they might not be that great because I don't really remember writing them, but I definitely turned them in. What a badass. What a badass. That's incredible. I wouldn't do that. I'd be like, fuck this. I'm not doing shit. I'm going to get an Xbox, get in the world of Warcraft, start snorting these pain pills. You know, what's weird is that like as an unintended consequence, I now have this bizarre aversion to my hair being wet. So when my pancreas was so bad, for whatever reason, one of the only things, so like laying on your side hurts, like standing up hurts, everything hurts. And so as a, as a, as a consequence, the only thing that really ever felt not good, but a relief was if I were to fill up my bathtub with salt and lay in a hot bathtub. And I would do it like five times a day. Like I would just go, I would get in it and I would just lay there like shaking. And as a consequence, my hair was wet that entire three months. And so to this day, like my hair being wet, like triggers some sort of like bizarre response and it like freaks me out. Yes. And the other, the other, the other weird thing was that I couldn't get warm. Like my body couldn't get warm. Like so I was always freezing, like no matter what, like I would be sitting in like a steaming bathtub and I would just be like frozen. It was terrifying, man. I mean, it was, it was, it was, it was really fucking scary. And, and this gave you some inspiration. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I mean, you, you, I think the best stories come out of personal experiences and while I'm not overly fond of that saying of, right, what you know, but I, I do think that, you know, having some sort of personal angle to come from it is important. But that same year, right? That same year, my brother had a baby. So in this same year, I was presented with my own mortality and like this beautiful new life that like had my last name on it and everything. So you combine those two experiences and then you add in the fact that I'm from Texas and grew up rebating like Jack Kirby, Thor comics and God countries. It's not that much of a surprise that that's what comes out of it, you know. Yeah. Well, this is the, I mean, this is one of the, this is, I think one of the paradoxical aspects of catastrophe is that it inevitably, it has the potential at least to, uh, spawn beauty. Yeah. I mean, I don't think that's the only pathway to inspiration, but it definitely is a, is a time honored pathway. And also think of what else happened, you know, that the pancreatitis sobered you up. Yeah, totally. Got you out of that terrible cycle. You must have been drinking a lot, man. I really was, man. I was drinking and I, you know, I don't mind talking about it now. Were you drinking all day long? Yeah, I wasn't really, man. I, you know, it was, it was, um, I was drinking, I was a big wine guy and it was like, I've always been an insomniac and, you know, I think that if I had to guess most like writers or creative people probably are, um, and, you know, it was never of a, it was always like a, how do I turn this machine off? You know? And so I would just like get like blackout drunk every night. Um, it was, it was the wine really, it was the sugars, like the amount of wine that I was drinking. I was drinking like a magnum of wine a night, which is insane. Um, a magnum of wine, I think is like two and a half bottles or something like that. Wow. Wow. You are drinking like a count. Yeah. Like a Viking, man. Wow. Fuck. Fuck. Wow. Yeah. And your pancreas just got so soaked in sugar, it was just holy shit. Well, I'm so glad that you survived that, man. Me too, man. Yeah. The thing is, is like, you know, it's, it's weird that it's ended up being like the best thing that ever happened to me, you know, um, I'm a really fucking stubborn dude. And like I said, like, I don't think it's any coincidence that it like literally took a punch to the gut to wake me up. And like in the two years that I've been sober now, it's been the most productive, like energetic in like positive time in my life. Like I'm getting so much more done, like my mind is clear. I'm writing more, I'm writing better, you know? So it's been rad, man. It's been, I actually really love being sober. Yeah. You know what, man? This is so interesting. We're talking about this because I'm just reading this, uh, this grimoire that I found at this bookstore by Elifis, Elifis Levi you've ever heard of him, the great occultist. And it's, um, it's really cool. What I love about grimoire's magical tomes is that it hands down, every single one of them has a warning in the beginning that says, don't, don't read this or it will drive you insane. Oh, that's great. It's the best way to get someone to read your shit. It's like, once you, oh, okay, I'm definitely reading this now. It's, but you know, and what's creepy about this particular, um, warning at the beginning of this grimoire is that it, I read it and I laughed. And then the next line is you will try to laugh it away as you slowly go insane, but you will not be able to, yeah, it was really good. Like he knew we, people would laugh when, when this is a severe warning, but so the book goes into immediately what Crowley talks about, what Chogum, Trumpa talks about and what is pretty much in, um, every single, um, process of waking up, which is discipline. That's the very first thing. Yeah. You must have, um, uh, basically what it, what he says is if you are not in control of yourself, then you are controlled by the world. If you are not taking control of yourself, then you will be hypnotized by whatever the thing is. You know, it does, it's not always booze, you know, any, anything really, video games, your phone, whatever the fucking thing is, will begin to make you its slave. And so that, I find that to be very inspiring and for you, this is discipline. You, you were, uh, touched by the Lord, so to speak. Yeah. Yeah. By the devil, maybe. Um, same thing. Yeah. Yeah. I think the discipline part of it is, is a big, is a big, like, um, you know, cause I don't think it's shocking whatsoever that I have like whatever that addiction gene is, you know, like whatever that is, I have it for sure. And so, you know, thankfully what's taken the place of drinking has just been writing and writing more. And so like, I don't even battle my insomnia anymore. I really don't even fucking, I don't even think about it cause I don't have a day job or anything. I don't have to go anywhere. Right. So like if I just, if I can't sleep, I just go and write, just go and write until my eyes get blurry and I can't see. You're white school with that? Yeah. She's, she's a workaholic too. She runs a nonprofit out here in Austin, um, and she's, she's always working and everything too. And so like, I'll wake up and I'll write until she gets home. And then when she gets home, I'll cook and I'll take, you know, uh, I'll basically take time off until she goes to bed. And then when she goes to bed, I go back to it. Wow. That's good. Man. So you have, when you're, when, so you are, how many projects are you working on right now? Um, I probably eight or nine, something like that. How do you, I just don't, I do not understand. How you can keep that many plates spinning creatively. How can you possibly do that? How do you not, how do you keep one story from bleeding into another story? Well, it's, you know, that's something that I've always been able to, I've always kind of had a weird, like, um, beautiful minds, you know, that, that film, uh, or he can like do all the math and everything. I've always kind of had this weird thing where if I, like, I could tell you right now on the phone, like when you and I were breaking down the simulationists on the phone and we would like stumble upon a good idea and you would say, write that down. I never did because I, I just have it all in my head. Like I could tell you every single thing that you and I have ever talked about for our book right now. Wow. And like I could do that with every book I've ever done. Like you could pick up a book that I did three years ago and turned to a random page and I could tell you what's on that, on that page. Holy shit. It's just this bizarre thing that I do. I just love, I love story. I love like breaking story, like the coolest part of, of any breaking story, breaking story. Breaking story. Yeah. Is that thing that you and I did, like when you, when you and I got on the phone and we're just like jamming and like you would throw out a cool idea and then I would throw out a cool idea. Yeah. And just like, I imagine it's, it's, it's, I mean, I, I'm not a comic or anything, but I imagine it's, it's, I guess writing comedy is a lot more solitary in a lot of ways, but I'm imagining that you guys could get together and like, like, like jam ideas and like tags and stuff, right? Well, it, it does happen, but it is, I mean, at least for me, it's a solitary activity, but that moment when you realize that you've stumbled upon a joke, which it's, I mean, it's there, there are very few experiences that are equal to that feat. Well, there's two steps, of course. You like think you found this like linguistic equation that's comedic and then you don't know for sure. So you have to go into the laboratory, which is in front of the audience to test the equation. And then if the test is successful, even a little bit, like even if it gets a little bit of laughter, you think, oh, there's some energy here, but I haven't focused it enough. And then you go back to the drawing board. So it does, it is collaborative, but the collaboration is not between comedians, even though that does happen sometimes, but it's more of a collaborative experience with an audience. Audiences are not even aware of the fact that if, that quite often they are collaborating with a comedian in their response to the joke. Yeah, that's really interesting. I've always thought about like different art forms as like the degrees of immediacy, like the degrees of like how fast, the time between it, you know, being awakened in your mind and being in front of people, right, is like, I feel like stand up comedy is one of the most immediate ones, you know, where like film or like TV seems like the most like the longest distance. Yeah. Yes, that is right. And comics is this cool kind of like in between because like, I mean, you probably know, like, I mean, and I've had some brushes with like trying to adapt some of my stuff into TV shows and stuff. And like, I've never really, I've never really caught into it very much, just because it's so it's such a crap shoot. It's so so many so distant. Yeah. There's so many people. There's so many obstacles in front of it, whereas with like comedy and with comics, like the only obstacle really is you, you know, and that's why I love working with you, man, because we, you know, that was like my experience of, you know, in collaborating with people for stuff has almost solely been for like potential TV things or pitches or whatever. And that's a grueling process that as you, you know, for example, like there was a show idea that I had with my friend, Doug Pound, a really cool idea. And it was, you know, very creepy kind of like high school, twin peaksy thing. It was really cool. And you know, one of the people we pitched it to, their response was, oh yeah, we love it. We want to do this. But can you just base, basically they said, can you just make this like a high school comedy? It's like, which was, yeah, I mean, it's a genre, like, but it's completely different than the thing that we pitched to you. So that, that experience of like the thing, because I get it, look, I, I'm not trying to demonize the networks or whatever they, the risk that they're taking to make anything versus the risk to make a comic book is monetarily so much more extreme, you know, so much so I get their paranoia and they care and just like, but the problem is the whole thing falls apart. Whereas you and I, when we were working on this thing, it was just you and me. And then that was it. And then it, and that you're, the immediacy of that is beautiful and knowing that the thing that you're working on with a person mixed in with Ballinger, because that's the other aspect I didn't realize when you make comic books is how the artist is the, is a writer too, but is interpreting the story and their interpretation directs and guides the story in ways we didn't expect and that I liked. I thought that was pretty fucking cool too. So yes, the immediacy is so much there. Well, the other thing about comics that is so cool is like, you know, it's not really like this when you first get started, but like after you kind of get your legs underneath you and you start, you know, being able to navigate the waters of getting things out there and everything, what, what's so cool about comics is that you know it's coming out, you know, like, you know that like when you and I were talking, there was never any question of like, man, this is so cool. God, I hope this happens. It was, you know, it's happening. Let's do it. And I like, I, I hear these stories of like writers who kind of almost exclusively work in like TV and film and they have these stories about they, they write these scripts and then they sell them to studios and the studio doesn't make it. And I was like, man, that would kill me. Yeah, break my heart. I can't even imagine like, I can't even imagine summoning the courage to pour my heart into a script, even with the chance that it just might not ever come out. It's like, I don't, it's so hard. Have you ever had a dog that had puppies? Yeah. And, and you had to give the puppies away. Yeah. And the look on the dog's face as their puppies, I don't get to keep these. It's like they get brokenhearted, man. And you, I mean, there's no way, I mean, unless you're going to like have a fucking pack of dogs, unless you're a, you know, like a dog sledder. Then you, you can't keep the dogs, but you know, you witness this, you, you witness the dog playing with the puppies, teaching the puppies, the puppies loving the dog. And then one by one by one, the puppies go away. And then the dog ends up trembling on the bed and abject depression. This is what happens to the TV writer is that their puppies, one after another, after another, get taken away by a network and just euthanized. Just fucking euthanized. And that's why a lot, they, that's why these are generally very either insane people or mystical people. They're either insane because they're so attached to the wanting to see their work flower, the opportunity to give their friends acting jobs, the, the financial compensate, all the things that come from it, or they get to this place of like, no, you know, I just like making stuff and I want to make stuff for TV. And eventually it'll happen. Very rarely do you run into those people, but there are some of them out there. I think it's psychologically the one of the most also on the other thing that goes into making stuff for TV is the litigation. Like you have to get a fucking attorney. The attorney will negotiate with the network and on your behalf, the network will try to like pay you as little as they have to, because they're a business. The attorney will, you inevitably will come to a point where the attorney will be like, yeah, you got to walk away from this one, man. You got to walk away from this one. I mean, like, can you imagine if you and I to make this thing, I had to get an attorney involved to be fucked up? Well, I mean, I definitely do have attorneys involved in, in, in like, you know, longer, like bigger stories and stuff like that. For sure. You know, I think, I mean, for something like what we were doing, I mean, I, I, I have a relationship with the magazine and with grants and people over there. But it's, it's very fucking cool and very unique. I mean, when Grant Morrison is your boss, like he's just down for cool shit. You know, I mean, he's just going to be down for it. And they're, and their contract is super boilerplate and super easy, you know. But yeah, man, I can't, because like the thing is, is like to write an effective pitch or to write an effective script. I feel like you really do have to fall in love. Like you really do have to put pieces of your heart into it and put some truth into it. The only way you can really access that kind of truth is by, you know, attaching some of yourself to it, which is to me, a process of falling in love. And I don't know how me personally, and by the way, this isn't me talking shit about people who write films and they possess a certain amount of courage that I just don't have. They present, they possess this, this kind of gene of like, keep going-ness that I don't, I don't feel like I have it of like you fall in love with something and you, and you move and you move and you move and then it just dies. How do you fall in love again? How do you, how do you get back up and do it again? I don't know. They just do, they, they do it and they love it. So yeah, it doesn't sound like you're knocking them at all. It's just what they're doing is a whole, I, I agree with you. I think that the, the, the, the, any time between the inception of an idea and the idea coming into the world, like the gestation process, whatever, whatever that time, that time should solely be there for the refinement of the thing that you're working on. Right. Yeah. It shouldn't be there because some counsel of people you'll never see is like mulling over whether or not the thing you worked on for a year is worth continuing. Like it's, that's that extra time and that's something a lot of people go through, man, an extra four months, not even knowing what's happening. We're just waiting for a phone call and the phone call will come in and they're like, listen, they love you and you know, you're doomed. Cause right away when they say they love you, but so yeah, it's, it's, it's sticky. I gotta ask you though, when, so, cause I'm, you know, there are dream jobs and I think some of those dream jobs right now, professional gamer, world renowned DJ, you know, these are like glory jobs, but to a comic book writer, man, that's like, how did you, how did you break into that business? Man, I had the weirdest route to it. I, I, like anytime anybody asks me like for advice on how to break in and stuff, I have a tough time answering it. There's certain things you can do, but everyone's path is different. Mine was, um, so to go back like completely, um, I was born in Texas. Uh, I grew up in Garland, which is famous for only two things. Uh, it's the inspiration for Arlen and King of the Hill. Wow. Um, which, I mean, it's, I, I, I, and it's just like that. Yeah. Uh, I grew up there. Um, and, oh, also David Koresh went to my high school. Wow. Yeah. It's a lot though, because if you look at the Wikipedia page for my high school, it lists David Koresh as a notable alumni, which seems weird to be proud of. Also, he dropped out. So you can't be an alumni. And also I'm not on there, which is ridiculous. Well, you got to get your fucking cold compound burnt down by the government. Dude, man, we could talk about the Waco compound thing all day. But, uh, yeah, so I grew up reading comics. My dad actually taught me how to read using comics. Um, like my brother, who's older than me, is super into like baseball cards as a kid. And the baseball card shop at my, at the mall also sold comics. And I wanted them. And my dad basically told me like, well, if you'll learn how to read those, I'll buy them for you. And so I was taught how to read on like Green Lanter and Spider-Man and stuff. So like in a bizarre way, I always like to say that I spoke comic book before I ever like spoke like English. Well, yeah, because it's fucking crazy. You actually have your own superhero story. Yeah, kind of. I mean, I mean, I think everyone, well, I mean, a lot of people have this same origin story. It's only, it's only a cool story because it ended up working out. And then, you know, I was always deep into comics. Like I was that, I was that kid in high school who you, you could quiz about anything. He just knew everything about Marvel comics, DC comics. I would skip school and go to the comic book store and all that shit. And comic book conventions. You would go to those, you would go to the comic book conventions. Like, did they still have my guess? But I went to. You would, they're not just comic comic. We were the old days. Like we would go to like with the, this is in North Carolina and we would go to these like, I don't know, like gun shows for comic books, where it's just crates filled with comics and musty old comics that smell like cigarette smoke and like sour sweat. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. No, those still exist, man. Like, like your San Diego comic cons are like outliers. Like there's a, there's like, yeah, I want to say like, maybe, well, there's nothing as big as San Diego comic con in the United States, but there's like New York comic con, there's Chicago, there's everything. But, but then like local cons, a lot of them are still like that. Where it's just like, there's no famous people or anything like that. It's just cats selling like comic books and like big cardboard boxes and stuff, you know, well, back in the day, there was never even that. I don't think anybody was thinking, oh yeah, famous people are going to come to these one day. No one, you were an outcast if you were into that stuff. It wasn't even, there was just no sense of celebrity or like fashion to reading the X-Men. It was an eye roller for a lot of people. Well, that's something that's really cool that like kids who were born today or even kids that were like, maybe like people who are in their teens right now who are reading comics, like people of my age and your age are like, we're like the last generation of kids who read comics and we're like made fun of for it. Right. Like that's not a thing that exists anymore. You know, like if you read comics, you're, you're a, you're a part of a thing. Yes. Like you're a part of a, like, because it used to be totally underground and it totally used to be like only nerds and losers read comics. Right. Remember actively being made fun of and beaten up for reading comics. Sure. But that's just not a world that we live in anymore, which is cool. So yeah, eventually, long story short, I ended up moving to Austin. I followed a girl here who I ended up marrying. Nice. Yeah, that worked out too. And then I ended up running a bunch of comic book stores here in Austin, which that alone, honestly, was a dream come true. And like, I could have done that my entire life. Like I running, like I had my own store and then I helped run. So you just leased a building and then put in a bunch of orders for comics and just did the thing. No, these were, these were shops that were, they had already existed. And then a guy came and bought them all and then put them all under the same umbrella and then hired me to run one and then like hired. So I didn't own it, but I was like the manager of my own store, independent. It was called First Federal Comics. It's like the name of a bank. Weird. Yeah. And so I was running that one. And, uh, and again, like I ran, I did that for like two years or so. And yeah, I could have done that my entire life. I loved it. I loved it so much. I loved the atmosphere of like just talking about comics all day, every day. And, you know, being able to help people and like put comics in their hands. And, um, you know, being a retailer is really informed a lot of like what I do now, because I try and make comics worth people's money. And I always try and like keep the customer and the retailers in mind. Anyway, um, yeah. Um, so then they all, I ran them into the ground. Um, they, they all shut down and then, um, I wasn't particularly good at it. Um, were you, were you running? Writing during this time? Were you? No, no, dude, I, that's the thing. I never grew up writing. Like I, I was always a storyteller. Like I was, I was always that kid who was like telling stories in class. And I was like the class clown and shit like that. And there's a big theater kid and actor and stuff like that. But like never, I never tried my hand at writing. Um, and then when those, when those stores shut down, um, I was kind of in this weird place where like, I didn't have a degree. I didn't have what you would call like skills for like, you know, like a regular job. Like I knew that, I knew that I didn't have that thing in me that would allow me to go and like just have like a cubicle. I knew that I couldn't do it. And again, that's not me knocking people who can. It's just, I knew that I couldn't do it. Like I would just die. Yep. Right. Um, yeah, it's much like, it's much like the pancreatitis, pancreatitis decision, isn't it? Like there's a piece of you that's like, well, I guess I'll just kill myself then because there's no fucking way I can do that. I cannot do that. I will, that, that's a, uh, yeah, there, that's a differentiating factor because some people, they can get into the flow of it. They can get into it, you know, and some people are like, no, I'll just end up blowing my brains out. I'd rather just be a hero. I'll just get into heroin. You know, I'll just find, I'll start selling heroin or something. I'll rob a bank. I've thought just, just fucking anything to not put on a tie. I'll start robbing filling stations. Like, I'll, yeah, that. Yeah, I just couldn't do it, man. I just like, and I had jobs. Like I worked at like best buy and shit and just wanted to fucking kill myself every day. Um, and, but I could draw. Like I was a pretty good artist. I'm not really any more excited and keep up with it, but like I, um, so anyway, I decided that I was going to give this thing a go. I was going to try and be in comics because I knew that it was the only thing that like my entire life, like comics was the thing that made me special. Was the thing that like made me different and the thing that I could like hang my hat on. Like I was always Donnie, the comic book guy, you know? And so I knew so much about comics, but I had never tried to make one. And I was like, man, I, I've, I've, I've read so many of these things. I could probably do something. Right. And so I actually went back to school. I went to the Savannah college of art and design. Um, and I was going to be a pencil. Like I, my goal in life was to become like a comic artist. And then, and then I got into class, you get a student loan. Oh yeah. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, which I just paid off like, like a month ago. There you go, man. But by the way, I mean, even, even though you ended up being a writing story, again, there's the others. I mean, there are so many pieces in this that are, that are the classic thing. You showed the universe. You meant business. You went into fucking debt. Oh, massive debt. Massive debt. Do you do? Can you say how much? I was like 50 grand. Jesus. Jesus. Yeah. And, and like in art school, dude, like, I mean, I don't even know if I have that same courage now, but at the time, like it was one of those things where like, I've been, I've been that dude, like I was always that dude who just didn't believe in backup plans. Yeah. It was just like, I'm going to do this until I can't do it because I wanted to be in a band. I wanted to be in a punk rock band. I wanted to be a lead singer. I wanted to be an actor, all this shit. And like I pursued them with like, with an insane passion, like just would like block out everything else in my life and would just dedicate myself to something. And then eventually I would run up against so many hurdles that I, it wasn't the thing, you know, it was probably also because I wasn't very good at those things. But then comics came along and I, yeah, man, I just never had, I never had any kind of backup plan. It was either I'm going to do this or fuck. I don't know. I mean, I don't know what my backup plan was. No safety parachute, plunging into the vortex with no safety parachute, just diving in. Jumping, you, you jump in, you build your wings on the way down. Well, I've always been my, my kind of thing, you know, actually Henry Rawlins was on the Joe Rogan podcast, like two days ago or something. And he, he, he said this thing that I really liked where he said that while all of his friends were going into like bank jobs and like working at Walmart and stuff, he decided to sail the sea of consequence. And I was like, yes, fuck yeah, sail the sea of that sounds so Henry Rawlins. I know. Yeah. Well, the thing is, is that I think he was actually quoting David Lee Roth, which is also amazing. Um, so yeah, I went to art school and then I quickly divorced myself from the notion of drawing comics because I ended up being in classes with some of the best comic artists that are working today. Like, um, this guy named Trad Moore, who's just an incredible, I mean, just a phenom. Uh, I was in classes with that guy and I saw his work and I was like, well, maybe I need to change this plan because I'll, I'll just never be that good. Like, like, like, like I could work for 30 years and I won't be as good as Trad was on his first day. Like there's something to be said for schooling and learning, but there's just, you know, you see these people that they, they just have a thing. Like they just have a thing that is in their soul, that is unteachable and unreachable, you know, I mean, I don't, you know what, I, I, I think it's probably true, but then a part of me thinks, I don't, I mean, okay, I, I'd like to believe that had you kept at it. Yeah, you, you would have hit some peak that I guarantee you would have with your work ethic, you would have gotten to a place, but you were sort of being, you, you were, you, a lot of times people think that their failure is failure when it's just the experience of being drawn closer to what they're really meant to be doing. Yeah. Yeah. And so I was also in classes with Jeff Shaw, who draws, um, he drew, he's, we've worked together a bunch. He draws, um, God country. So like, how is in classes with that dude? Um, and I mean, he was phenomenal back then. This was like 2009. Who's the, is he the colorist as well on God? No, no, the colorist is a guy named Jason wordy, who is phenomenal. Yeah, man. I mean, the, the colors or the whole, I mean, it's so not to get off track here, but my God, man, it is so juicy and beautiful. And like, it's just, I just love how all these different artists are, are reflecting the story through their own talent. Totally. Oh, yeah. It's really cool. And calling Jason a colorist, I feel, I mean, he's a painter. Yes. I call him, he's a painter. That's a painter for sure. It doesn't matter if he's doing on the computer. I mean, he's painting and like you can tell, like, yeah, God country is just really rare this thing that we all got really lucky because everyone on that book got it, like immediately, like everyone knew what we were trying to do. And everyone just dialed in and was just like, fuck, yeah, we're all going to tell this story, like we're all going to do it, you know. So anyway, yeah, I was in classes with Jeff and Trad and a bunch of other and you know what, there you go. It's weird that you're, you know, you, that's where you didn't even know that you'd already started working on God country. You didn't even, you know, it was happening. Even then you were making these connections with people that you would be working with in the future. You had no idea. Yeah. I know when you look back on it, like you can see all these connections, you know, I feel like everyone's story is like that, like you in comedy and like everyone else, when you look back, like, yeah, there's these like really clear little through lines, but it obviously doesn't look like that because you're, because the lines aren't there because you're charting them. Right. Like you, you, you cut a path down the jungle when you look back, they're like, oh yeah, there's a path there, but it wasn't there until you chopped it down, you know, so yeah. And so I kind of quickly switched over to writing because I took, I took a few writing classes and found that I really enjoyed it and that, you know, professors and people kind of told me that I had a bit of a knack for it. And then I just, I just dived into it. And then I was definitely on, on course to graduate from SCAD. I went like two years nonstop. I didn't take summers off or anything like that. Again, I just, I put my head down and I just, I, I barrel through things. Yes. And I do that, and I do that mainly because I'm lazy and because I know that if I take time off, then it'll just disappear. And so I work really hard because I'm lazy. Cool. Yeah, I know what you mean. And so I took a summer off and in that summer, I ended up getting an internship at Marvel. Um, and so I moved to Queens. I lived in Queens and I worked at the Marvel offices. What'd you do? What was your function there? I was an editorial intern. So I did a lot of different jobs. Um, you know, there's like the standard joke things of like getting people lunch and making copies and stuff like that. But what's really cool though is that. Is this an unpaid internship? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was doing like, I mean, I was pulling like 60 hour weeks and shit. Like I was, I made a point to be the first person there and the last person to leave. Like I remember editors who were going home, like coming over to me and be like, Hey, go home. Like you have to go home. And I, I felt like, uh, what's that film? I was like, I got nowhere else to go. Like I have nowhere I would rather be than be right here. What was your housing situation in Queens? I lived with, uh, a brother and sister, a two brothers and a sister, um, really cool, um, Filipino family who were super fucking cool. They didn't know anything about comics or anything. They were all artists and writers and, um, uh, like, um, um, uh, like performance artists. Like, so I was living in this like really cool house. How did you find them? Craigslist, man. I, my, my uncle lives or used to live. He lived in like the upper East side or something. I'm bad with geography when it comes to that town, but he's, he, he lived there for like 30 years. And so when I first got there, I just crashed on his couch and told him, like, just give me a week, man. Just let me crash in your couch for a week and I'll figure it out. You know, and so yeah, I just got on Craigslist and interviewed, like went and like met with these people and stuff. And I, I had luckily was, I had managed to save up enough money. Uh, and by save up, I mean, I just stole it from my loan that I got for college. Yes. Um, so I just like took this loan and took it to, to Manhattan with me. And so I was able to get in in front of them and just say, like, Hey, I'll pay all the rent right now. Well, how much was the rent? Uh, it's like 500 bucks. Actually, it wasn't bad at all. Um, because I was, but I had like a little room that was bad when you're working 60 hours a week for no money. Yeah. Well, there's that. Yeah. Well, I, I eventually, after my money ran out that I saved, I ended up doing a night job, uh, you know, those little pop-up costume stores. Yes. Halloween stores. Yeah. Like the spirit Halloween stores. Yes. I would, I would work one of those at night and then come home and like sleep for a few hours and then go to Marvel. Holy shit. That's a psychedelic time in your life, man. No shit, dude, dude, I mean, I have so many stories from that time. Um, but the cool thing was is that like working for Marvel was so cool. I mean, it really was. It was stressful because I was just trying to make, like there's this weird dance you have to do when you're an intern of like being invisible, but also making an impression. Like you don't want to be in anyone's way, but you want to be that dude that they can count on. Yes. So I made this little rule for myself of always saying yes, meaning if they came to me and they were like, Hey, do you know how to do Excel spreadsheets? I would say, of course. And then I would run off into the bathroom and Google it and like how to do it. So everything that they ever asked me to do, I said, yes. Um, and then we'd just go and figure it out. Um, and so what was cool is that after a while, they began to, I guess, kind of see that I could write a little bit that I at least knew how to put words in order, you know, um, and so they had me writing, um, all the recaps. So like when you read a Marvel comic, normally the first page of it is a recap of what happened in the first issue. So it's like previously on X-Men and it's like all this shit. I must have written hundreds of those things. Like it's funny. I can still, I can still go into account bookstores and like, it's weird because there's only a handful of books that I, that have my name on them, but I've written like hundreds of count books or am I writing at least is in. Oh my God. That's crazy. I could tell, listen, cause I was when I was preparing to chat with you, I was looking at your bio and thinking like, man, that's such a well written. Like it's reads like a comic book. Like you're, you know, my bio on Twitter. Yeah. It was your bio find it. Um, yeah, I'm not sure where, where I found it. Hold on. Let me see one second here. Uh, let me read this. Um, let me find it. I don't know what, what site it popped up on, but it was like a really great, maybe some, no, you definitely wrote it. Hold on a second. Let me find it here. Not that it matters. Um, shit. Well, you're too famous for me to dig this up now because I'm not looking up too much shit pops up. But anyway, so that's awesome. So you start getting this tiny little morsel thrown your way. Marvel is now letting you write for them. That's exciting. It was cool because it was like a, it was a daily training. And like at the time I didn't, I didn't know it. That's what it was. But I was in a job where I was asked to write every day. Yes. I was writing every fucking day and it was always a new thing. And it was always, I had to kind of match styles to the different books. And like, you know, some of the recaps were written in, in like, in unique styles. I had to match them. How much time do you get per recap to write it? Like how much time are they giving you to work on this? It depends. Like there were, there were some that I just like had to do every week that were just like on a schedule, you know, but, but as, cause I would only work for, I was hired to work for this one office. And it was the like the Incredible Hulk and the ultimate comic line, which the ultimate comic line was kind of a rebooted Marvel comic line that had Spiderman and Captain America, like all the biggest ones. So I, I got to, I got to write for like all of these big ones. But after a while, I started getting kind of farmed out to other offices when they found out that I was kind of a dude they could rely on to get things done. So after a while, it was just, um, I mean, people would send things to me that needed to be done in like, you know, 10, 15, like by the end of the day, like, I would just have to really quick, like read this comic and just bang it out. And it had to be perfect as it was going to print right now. You know, and so that also was a thing that was preparing me for publishing for like the deadlines of getting things out the door, you know. Um, so that was rad. It was really, really, really cool. Um, and then I was asked to, uh, stay, uh, for another term because you do like, um, there, the interns, uh, are there for as long as like a semester because it counts for school credit. Um, that's actually a funny story because mine did not count for school credit because I was actually not enrolled. Right. Um, but their rules at Marvel is that you have to be enrolled. So I hope no one at Marvel was hearing this, but I, I just asked one of my professors at college to just write them an email saying that I was still enrolled. That is so bad. That's so scrappy. You're like one of those people who lied themselves into the fucking military. Yeah. I wanted to do it, man. It was a dream come true. You know, I, I, because at the time I also had aspirations of becoming a Marvel editor, like I thought that was so cool. You know, I thought that'd be so cool to like work on all these comics every day. You know? Yeah. Um, and then, you know, I, I, I, I came to a point where I had this decision in front of me and that decision was basically, do I want to work at Marvel again for like no money for an internship that like maybe might turn into a job or do I want to go home and get married and pursue my own thing? Yes. You know, um, and so I did that. Um, there's a lot of factors that went into it. I'd like to be able to tell you that it was me being brave and saying like, no, I shall forge my own path. But really it was, I was out of money and I didn't think I was going to get hired. That's so, so I left, but I left with really good contacts. Like I still know everyone who works over there. Um, they're all really awesome people. I still keep in touch with all of them. Um, and I've, I've, I've done a few little Marvel things here and there. Um, that were really fun. But yeah, so anyway, I went home. You left the Filipino artists. They were really cool. Left Queens went back to Texas to get married. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Um, but while I was there, uh, I met a fellow intern who we became really fast friends while you were in Texas when you got back to Texas. No, no, no. While I was at Marvel, um, friends with an intern, um, and me and him ended up kind of just like on our lunch breaks and walking around and hanging out at night. Like we were each other's only friends because that's the other thing is like, you don't know anybody out there, you know? And so you kind of just like latch on to people. It's like being in the army. Like cause it's, it's, it's, it's a tough gig. And it's one that other people maybe don't really get, you know, unless you're doing it yourself. Um, and so me and him, like in our off time, started kind of jamming on like comic book ideas. Um, and we came up with this one idea for this like drunken time traveler dude named Hunter Quaid, who was like a private eye in the forties, but ended up getting wrapped up and it was, it was silly. Uh, it was really silly, but it, it, it really entertained us. Um, and that was really fun. And, um, and so after we both left our internships, we just kept in contact and we ended up talking like every day and we were just like, fuck it. Man, let's just do this. Like, let's just make this comic. And so we made what's known as an ash can, which is just like a self-produced like, you know, hand stapled, um, black and white comic. What a complimentary name for something. An ash can. Yeah, ash can. Yeah. Um, and ash cans have like a really cool long background of like being like these really cool indie zines and that's kind of where all that stuff kind of like underground comic started off as ash cans. So me and my buddy ended up going to cons. We started going to like the Chicago con and the New York con and all this stuff. And we were take our ash cans to these cons and we would pitch them like on the floor of the con, like we would find out who the editors were who work for these companies and we would find them at their booth and I got the dark horse booth or the image booth or whatever. And we just walk up to them and kind of give them a spiel and put the book in their hands and that's one of the big things. How do you start a conversation like that? That's ballsy, man. I don't, I don't know how you fucking do that. You just walk up to someone like, Hey, may I have a few moments of your time, sir? Yeah. Well, here's the thing. I was, I was really annoying back in those days. I was tenacious and I, and I, but I, you know, I was probably too annoying. I was probably too pushy. My friend, Elliot, though, who's my partner at the time and doing those things, he, he was and is today a standup comic. So he was always really fucking good, like breaking the ice, you know, getting there and being charming and stuff. And so I would kind of rely on him and like, this is a true story. And I can't believe this actually worked because this is how we got that book published. This is no bullshit. So Elliot wanted to pitch this to Dark Horse. And I was, for whatever reason, I was tired and I was grumpy. And we'd been pitching all day. I said, dude, Dark Horse is never going to publish this book. Like this is a weird, like Ash can about the time traveler and blah, blah. That's just not what they do. And I don't think I don't think they'll dig it. And he said, well, I'm going to try it. I'm going to go and do it. And I was like, all right, man. And so I, and, and he was asking me, do you know anybody at Dark Horse? Like over in that booth over there. And I looked over at the booth and there was a guy standing in the booth with a microphone in his hand. And I was like, well, that guy has a microphone. He probably works there. And so Elliot walked over to this dude, no bullshit, and goes, um, hi, yes. I'm supposed to be famous. Could you help me with that? Whoa. It was his opening line. Whoa. No, no, no, I'm sorry. His opening line was, hey, I'm sorry. I'm a little lost. I'm supposed to be famous. Can you help me with that? I'm lost. I'm lost in this existence. Yeah. And so the dude, uh, uh, and then like I ran over when I saw it going well, because I'm a coward. Um, and we ended up putting the book in his hands and, uh, and it ended up working. It's crazy. Like, uh, that guy ended up being like the head of like, uh, marketing for dark or holy shit. And he ended up giving that book to the president of Dark Horse. And said, like, these guys are crazy. And like they, they maybe have the worst, best pitch I'd ever seen in my life. You got to read this thing. And then the president of Dark Horse called Elliott and I and said, he wanted to do it. Oh God. That was crazy. Who did he, did he call it? He called Elliott and then Elliott delivered the news to you or I'm just trying to picture that moment. They emailed both of us and said, do you want to get on the phone like later this week and like, again, looking back on it, that phone call could have only ever meant one thing, but Elliott and I were like, dude, do you think we're in trouble? Like, well, why is he talking to us? Like, why is he going to call us? Never come to our fucking booth again, psychopath. Yeah, he got on the phone. His name is Mike. He's, he's really cool. We have a great, uh, report of this day. Uh, and yeah, he wanted to publish it and they published it in Dark Horse Presents, which is like one of the oldest and most prestigious, uh, anthologies. Oh, man. Dark Horse. And so here's where the story gets crazy. This is where things started to kind of get weird and take off for me. Are you familiar with the band Toties? You know, I've heard of them. I've heard, I've definitely heard of them, but I don't think I'm not familiar with their music. Yeah. So they're a big Texas band and they were like huge in the 90s. And I mean, they're still huge. Like they sell out everywhere out here in Texas and stuff. But you would definitely know their, like if I were to play you like two of their songs, you'd be like, oh, hell yeah, those guys. The big album was Possum Kingdom. They have that song. It's like, do you want to die? It's really good. So anyway, this is a bizarre confluence of events. Again, my childhood, like best friend ended up being their tour manager. And he was in New York while I was interning there and invited me to their show that they were playing. And it was on my birthday and I went by myself because I didn't have any friends yet. And after the show was over, Wes took me backstage and was just like, here, just hang out with the band. I got to go and do some shit. And I was like, dude, I don't know this band. Like what are you, are you going to put me back here at this band? Like I'm so nervous. And so he was just like, well, hold on. And he went and got their drummer, Rez. And Rez is a huge comic book fan, just nuts about comics. And so Wes was just like, hey, Rez, this is Donnie. Donnie works at Marvel. Y'all talk. And so me and Rez just hit it off like crazy. And as we were kind of parting ways, I said, hey man, well, look, I want to make comics. And if you ever have any ideas for any comics or anything, like I would love to work with you guys because I'm a huge fan of your band. And then, yeah, I went back to Austin and they were in town in Austin. And I went and hung out with them again. And Rez told me that night. He was like, hey, man, if you're still serious about that offer, I think I might have like a little baby germ of an idea. And he emailed me this idea. And it was his email was like maybe two sentences long. And I just loved it. I loved it. His idea was basically, you know, what if a dude got superpowers from drinking and doing doing drugs? And so I kind of latched on to that idea and I ended up just staying up all night that night, breaking the idea and like trying to end this thing. Was it called the Hunter S. Thompson story? We ended up calling it Buzzkill. And it ended up being, so like with that premise, you could go really funny or really goofy. But what we ended up kind of latching onto and really liked was this idea that he was actually trying to get clean. And he was like in AA. But if and if he was clean, he wouldn't have powers anymore. But just because he wanted to get clean, doesn't mean that his like villains and stuff were just going to let him walk away. Right. So it became this big story about addiction and power. You know, and it really wasn't about superheroes at all. It was about addiction. Yes. And what's crazy about it is that like, like we ended up pitching it. We hired Jeff Shaw to draw it because I had went to school with him and I loved his work. And we pitched it to Dark Horse and they picked it up and it came out. And that was like the first time I ever put out a comic book that really people paid attention to. Like that, like that was a big moment. Was this when you were in your wine period? Yeah. Yeah. And that's the crazy thing about that book is that like I remember doing interviews for that book and people asked me like, so are you in recovery or like, are you an addict? And I would tell them like, no, man, no, no, no, no. It's just a book about it's just, it's just an idea. Wow. And at the time I believe that like, but looking back on it, it's just like, dude, you were writing a book about addiction, you idiot. You were, you were an alcoholic, of course. Like where do you think that came from? Or, you know, this is like, you know, if you get into the some of the stuff Grant Morrison talks about, the idea that his comics are a sigil or the idea that when you're creating, you know, this is actually to get back to this grimoire I'm reading. That's one of the things that, you know, is a magical idea, which is if you write it down, if you say it, even if it's about some other character, it's, it can affect you, you know, you can, wow, that's so crazy. But yeah, so that was you, you, you were writing a, it was semi autobiographical. Oh, it totally was. And like, you know, I, I, I didn't allow myself to reread it for a really long time after I kind of discovered where it came from, you know, and then like after I got sober and everything, I went back and I re, I re, I re-read it. And I was like, oh God, it's so obvious. I guess so obvious that you were writing about you and the things that you were going for, because there's just, there's little moments in it that like, you could only, you could have only written. There's like emotions that you could have only done if you had gone through it, you know. That's so crazy how your subconscious will scream help me through your art. And you know, like it's like, it's, it's trapped inside of your addiction, but it'll still scream out to the world. Please, please, I'm in here, someone help. Well, I mean, think about it. I mean, yeah, take that idea and explode it out because then think about this idea of the idea of that book throwing up a flair to the world and then having interviewers ask me if I was an addict. Like that book literally like put a bat signal in the sky to get people to come to me to ask me if I was okay. Wow. You know, it's bizarre. And yeah, it's really, really fucking weird. And so anyway, that book came out in 2013 and I have been really fortunate enough to be working ever since. I've, I've, I've very rarely had months go by where I didn't have a book out. Man, I gotta tell you, this conversation has not only inspired me to work harder, but it makes me feel like I do not. The fact that I just got to write a comic with you for heavy metal, that's not fair. Like that is, this is an indication of this truly being a simulation and it's malfunctioning somehow because fuck man, this isn't, I don't get you, that's thank you, I guess is what I'm trying to say because what an honor to, you know, it's another podcast and we've got to do more of these. But I mean, just to learn the style of writing comic books to also to be able to experience the strange prism that your mind is and the way that like my ideas or any idea that I had will go into this prism of a professional writer and it shoots out the other side as something like formed and real and like exciting. It's, it's amazing. You are a really cool person. And thanks man, right back at you. I'm so grateful for this. This is a very inspirational conversation. And man, I can't wait to dive into my life with some of these things I'm taking away from this. So thank you so much. How can people find you, sir? Yeah, I'm on Twitter. That's probably the best place. I'm at Don Cates, which is D-O-N-C-A-T-E-S. And yeah, I'm on there all the time. It's probably the best way to reach me. And then we can be found in the pages of Heavy Metal Magazine and more, more simulationists to come, I think. I hope so. Man, I'd love to. And also you can get the digital, you can get the digital God country right now, right? Like if people can't find it in stores, they can just get that version. Yeah, you can get it on Comixology for sure. And then the second printing will come out on the 15th of next month, along with issue two. Cool. I'm just going to get the digital one, man. I don't have patience for that shit. I can't wait. I'll have to send it over to you. I'll just send it to you. Oh, beautiful. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, you created it. Hey, cool, man.

And this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Thank you for joining us by us. I mean, I guess the sum total of everyone listening to the podcast, which is a trillion people. It expands out through time and space. People in Hollow Earth listen to this podcast. Obviously, denizens of other realms listen to this podcast. It shows up in a lot of different ways. Sometimes it's the sound of a cat fucking. That's in the Quadrinus Zalvago Nexus. And sometimes it's this deep, thick, beautiful, silky, masculine, alluring, charming, dazzling, lovely, magnificent, pleasing, exquisite, grand, and splendid voice that you are currently listening to. Did I train? I just want to put this out for all my journalists out there listening. Because honestly, I'm tired of answering the question. I get it all the time. How did you train your voice to sound like a combination, sonic boom, and goddess orgasm? The answer, muskrat come. Yeah, you heard me right. The semen of muskrats contains within it a very powerful vocal resonator that wraps itself around the human vocal cords. You try to swallow muskrat come, and you're going to get a big surprise if you think it's going to go slithering down your neck tube into your bag of acid. Because it has its own kind of strange sentience. It's been compared to a slime mold, the way that a slime mold is simultaneously one thing and a lot of things, also known as a synchocynchobeta top for the simultaneous oneness and difference. A slime mold can solve wordal puzzles. A slime mold will help you if you're in a bad relationship. And most importantly, a slime mold is the best friend you will ever have. And the stoic philosopher, Desicus, claims that 100% of his wisdom came from communicating with the slime mold. Now, muskrat come is not a slime mold. In fact, they're completely different. But what they do have in common is that they both feel good when they splatter all of your face. The difference between the two is if you eat a slime mold, it will go right into your bag. Whereas if you drink muskrat come, it's going to tendril around your vocal cords. And it's going to create a kind of strengthening resonance that over time will produce the exact kind of voice that you're listening to right now. So there you go. A little bit of insider baseball about how to make your voice perfect for podcasting. You're going to ask another next question. Where do I find these muskrats? You don't find the muskrat. When the student is ready, the muskrat will come. Ah, we've got a great podcast for you today. The brilliant Dr. Alan Levenivitz is here with us. We're going to jump right into it, but first, this.

He's an associate professor of religion at James Madison University. He's written a book, Natural How Faith in Nature's Goodness Leads to Harmful Fads, Unjust Laws and Flawed Science. But how did I find Dr. Alan Levenovitz on Twitter? His Twitter is so cool. He brings up so many awesome ideas that I didn't even notice it in the sense that I was like, wow, this is a really interesting Twitter thread until I thought, holy shit, this is like a good, this is, wait, Twitter can be good. It was mind-blowing. Then he was tweeting something about his skepticism regarding ghosts and I tweeted at him that I'd had a pretty weird ghost experience and from there, we entered the land of podcasting. So in this episode, you're going to hear a ghost story told to a genius skeptic. My hope was that he would be able to help me see where my biases had caused me to sort of hallucinate a paranormal experience. Did that happen? Well, keep listening and you'll find out. Everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Dr. Alan Levenovitz. Music playing Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, glory to be blue Welcome to you It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Welcome to the DTFH. Alan, I cannot wait to talk to you. I've got a lot of hard questions for you, but please, you're about to mention one of my favorite musicians, John Prine. Please continue. Yeah, so we were talking about how my office is here in heaven and you were talking about how there are options in heaven and how that was great. And in the John Prine song, I play it for my students all the time. I'm blanking on the name. But basically, check out the music video. It's like a cartoon and he says he's going to smoke a cigarette. He's going to do it in heaven. Cigarette that's nine miles long. Yeah. He's going to make a vodka and ginger ale. He's going to like go on a go on a Ferris wheel. He's going to start a rock and roll band. He's going to forgive all of his syphilitic critics. Critics. It's just a fucking fantastic song about what he does in heaven. I love that song. It's incredible and it ends with. Wait, how is it? Like his dad told him, when you're dead, that's right. I love that. I love that. His dad's tell. Wait, is his dad telling him that in heaven, in which case his dad would be wrong? No, it's before. You see what I'm saying? Like if his dad, no, his dad told him this before he before heaven, because obviously he's alive. His dad apparently was telling him what you can't hump in heaven. Is that what he means? Is he referring to impotent? Like dead pecker. A dead pecker. A dead dickhead. Like when you're dead, you're a dead pecker. Was his dad saying the most creepy thing? Like when you die, you become a flaccid penis. It's crazy, crazy. That's like it. I'm actually reading for the first time I'm reading The Sun Also Rises, this Hemingway book. Oh, wow. And so first of all, check this out. We got the video so I can show you. Great. I like nice looking books, right? It's just one of those things I like. So I like the British editions of Hemingway. They're really beautiful. And I was like, I'm going to get the British edition of this to read the nice looking copy. Cool. So check it out. It's not called The Sun Also Rises in England. What's it called? I can't see it because of the... Fiesta. It's called Fiesta. That's the... Look, look. That's it. It's still called that. If you ask a Brit what their favorite Hemingway book is, they'll be like, I like Fiesta. Fiesta's my favorite. You know what? I got to say, Sun Also Rises is... Maybe this is my own bias. I think that's better. Sun Also Rises is better. Well, you know, because speaking of dicks, that's why it reminded me. I think... I think the guy... You never find... I'm only... I'm like 62% through, but my friend already gave it away. I don't think he can get it up. And he falls in love with this woman and then she basically... She falls in love with him, but he can't fuck her. And listen, listen, listen. I think The Sun Also Rises is like The Sun Also Rises. And I think it's just devastating. I think so. I think it's a double entendre. I know. I don't know. I know. I think so. I'm not done with the book yet, though, so I don't want to make any promises. Wow. Okay. In that case, Fiesta, it's better. It's better. No, it's less mean. It's less mean. It's less mean. It's like you're not titling... It's not a dad joke. It's on the cover of this great book. It just both suck. But Fiesta... Honestly, both. Fiesta didn't mean what it means today. You know what I mean? In 2019, whatever, 25, it wasn't like Fiesta. That was like a new word, right? It was exotic. It probably sounded like, you know... You know what I mean? Now it's like Fiesta. It sounds like a car. It sounds like a shitty Ford Fiesta. Isn't it literally a car? Oh yeah, it is a Ford Fiesta. The Ford Sun Also Rises. That's actually... Well, all right. Not bad. I'm not a good marketer. It's not bad. Well, I've got some questions for you. We obviously... I love... First of all, let me just say, I love your Twitter. I don't like a lot of... I don't like... I don't know what you call them. Twitter feeds or whatever. Yours is just fantastic. The conversations you have with people on there are so interesting. And it's just a source. You know, I follow a few... You know, you're an example of, like, how... Like, I think the dream the Twitter people had of Twitter when they were making it, your feed is an example. It could be like this. I really appreciate that, man. Part of it is the truth. Like, I have a lot of strategies for doing it. It's taken me a long time to get myself to the place where I think I can do that. And also, I'm just lucky. I got a lot of great... There's a lot of great people out there. And it's just... I don't know. It's a great blessing to me. What are your strategies? What do you mean? What strategies? Well, I actually have a Twitter thread about how I use Twitter. That a lot of people seem to find useful. But let me think of some of the things I do. Okay. One. What are your strategies for how I curate it or for how I behave? The whole... I would love to know your whole theory on it. I would love to know your entire theory of Twitter. Sure. Well, for one, it's not dissimilar from my theory of reality. But... Okay. So, okay. Always admit when you're wrong. So, it's like a superpower on Twitter. Just the other day, I was arguing with some guy. Like, you know, some random dude about abortion or something. He was being really... Like, you know how people are on Twitter, really mean. But he made a good point. He made a good point. And I was like, that was a good point. How to rethink what I was just arguing. And it was like, his mind just leaped out of his ears. He was like, holy fuck. Like, what just happened? You've earned yourself a follow. Like, I've never... Like, it was like... You know what I mean? Like, it's not weakness to admit you're wrong on Twitter or in life. It's a sign of strength. And that's not why I'm doing it. I mean, I just did it because he made a good point. So that's one thing. Let me think of some other important ones. Don't share... Honestly, don't mock people. It's just a rule for me. It's not even like a punch up, punch down thing. Yeah. I'm just not in the business of mocking people. I can do it other places, but not on Twitter. May I push back? Yeah, yeah. Not that you should mock people, but I must say it is punched down. I think that there is a... Depending on who you're arguing with, I guess. But ultimately, if you have a ton of followers, no matter what, it's not fair. You're a person standing in the playground with... You know, I don't know how many of those followers are bots. Not that that makes it any better. That's even creepier, in fact, if you're about to get in a fight with someone at a playground who has bots and people... It's actually a robot. How crazy would that be? You're like fighting with a bully and then it turns out that they're just like a robot that you've been fighting with. It's like, how scary. Yeah, but I think that in general, even though so many people will invite your wrath. And it's so easy sometimes. And God knows anyone who's on Twitter is... I'm sure you at some point you didn't realize how much of a slippery slope that can be. And then how sticky it becomes. And then suddenly it just... But yes, okay, I do think it's punching down, though. For me, no, it's just... I wouldn't do it either way, right? So it's like, I think a lot of what's happening on Twitter... This is actually maybe another way that Twitter has become better for me. Because I think a lot of people are shouting in pain or shouting in fear. And so I'll tell you a story. When I was in grad school, there were these people... It was like a protest. I think it was like a divest from Israel protest. It was like Palestinian divest from Israel kind of thing. And I went up and I think... I don't want to get the details wrong, but it was something like come over and ask us why we believe in this. And I did. Like you said, people are inviting you in. But that's not what they were actually there to do. What they were there to do was shout in pain and anger. And I mistook... Because they were actually deceiving people, right? I mistook them. I didn't understand what was going on. And so I tried to engage in an argument. It did not work out well. And in retrospect, I realized that what they were really doing was shouting in pain. And you got to let people do that, right? I mean, there's no way you can't... It's like telling someone to relax, right? And never works. So you just got to let them do it. It's like if they're shouting in pain, you're just like, hey, man, I get it. I'm sorry you're in pain. Take it easy. Like I hope we can meet again under better circumstances. Right. Right. Learning how to distinguish those two is probably a pretty important skill set for people. It is. Because I've noticed whenever I start trying to rationalize with someone who's shouting in pain, generally the way it goes is I just start shouting in pain in a different way. It's contagious. It's contagious. That's right. You've got to put... I know masks are over, but you've got to put on a spiritual mask when the viruses come your way. Let's see. Or build up your immune system. I don't know how the metaphor works. Another, like some basic stuff, don't quote, tweet things that you don't like. So like if it's something you're arguing, if you're arguing with it, here's a couple of things I do. I can... So I'll reply and then retweet my reply. That's one thing I can do. If people are interested in the conversation, they can come into it that way, but I don't... Or I can take a screenshot of it if I don't want to engage with the person. But I... Oh, I think there's something ritually inappropriate about quote tweeting something that you dislike or disgusted by. It's like, why are you doing that, man? Why are you sharing the thing that is the virus, right? It's like, I don't know. Right. So I just don't do that. I've got a romantic dream. I want to take my sweet, beautiful, hyper-sexy wife to Paris, take her down in the Parisian catacombs, break off from the tour group, and make sweet love to her among the bones.

I'm terrible with dates. There's missionaries who are coming to China for the first time. These are people who are just shocked. You have to imagine. Just shocked that there's a civilization with great spiritual traditions in it that they've never encountered before. They've got their own religions. They show up and, of course, they start evangelizing. The Buddhists and the Confucians who coexist because in China, unlike with Abrahamic religious faiths, the faiths are not mutually exclusive. Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, they do compete for resources, but it's not like you are either a Confucian or a Buddhist or a Daoist. You might participate in all of them to greater or lesser extents depending on the party. You might perform Confucian rituals in order to figure out when to get married, but you might go to a Daoist for fortune telling, and then you might go to a Buddhist for whatever. That's great. I love that. These missionaries show up and they're just fucking shit up. They're trying to destroy these religions and replace them with Christianity. This one, I think he's a Tantai Buddhist. If not in name, then in spirit, that my friend Ziporin was working on, he comes up with this theory that in fact the missionaries are super secret bodhisattvas, that actually they are ultra skillful, hidden bodhisattvas that have come to improve Buddhism, probably to take away the list and stuff, by challenging the bad doctrines so that Buddhism can be better. Which means at a certain point in Tiantai Buddhism, of course, everyone is a hidden bodhisattva. Everything, actually at a certain point, but that's the opposite of the lists in the hierarchies. There are no lists in hierarchies because my fucking bourbon tumbler is a bodhisattva. You know what I mean? So it's like, where's the hierarchy? As Zhuangzi says, where's the Dao? It's in the piss and the shit. The person who can ride the wind and turn into a dragon and have magical powers and live forever, that person is no more or less fully realized than like a piece of shit. OK, to back you up, let me grab this book real quick. No, are you kidding? I love it. Hold on. Whoa, what? That's that's that's like Wizard of Oz. That was amazing. I found in this great book here. It's called the Ningma School of Tibetan Buddhism by Dujong Rinpoche. Oh, yeah, sounds fairly familiar. I don't know. I mean, the name Rinpoche Rinpoche I've seen. That's literally the extent of my knowledge of whatever you're about to talk about. I think I found it. OK, here it is. OK, to back up what you're saying, I'm just going to start reading from this first paragraph. It goes there's a few paragraphs before I think it goes into more detail. It should be known that the indestructible play of these magical emanations is inconceivably secret. For example, it is by no means contradictory that fields containing atoms of oceanic infinity exist on the surface of a single atom. Bodies of oceanic infinity are gathered in a single body and each body also covers an oceanic infinity of fields, fields, not fields, such is said in the Tantra of the secret nucleus. In the manner of the trichlycosm? Never heard of that before. The trichlycosm is a hell of a word, man. I love that. Freaking cool. In the manner of the trichlycosm, absorbed in a mustard seed, one should make offerings after inviting the mandala from the expanse. And in the great bounteousness of the Buddhas on the surface of a single atom or as many Buddhas as there are atoms. So the whole thing is made up of the awakened mind. The whole thing is enlightenment. And here you are beating yourself up for this or that when there's more Buddhas than you, than there are atoms, according to this very serious looking red book. Actually, I think what's funny is that, OK, and we could get to ghosts, I think, because that was one of the things we talked about a long time ago. But ghosts, I think there's a lot more people in the world who find the idea of ghosts plausible than find the idea that there are infinite Buddhas dancing on a shit atom, right? They would be like, well, that's crazy, but I did see a ghost the other day. Whereas in fact, whereas in fact, no, I'm serious, listen to me, let me hear me out, hear me out, hear me out, whereas in fact, one of them is true and the other is not. Ghosts don't exist, but there are infinite Buddhas dancing on that shit atom. You know what I'm saying? Well, oh my God, this, I think, needs to be a public debate between people who believe there is infinite Buddhas and shit and people who believe in ghosts. I will take the side of this. You want to take ghosts? Well, I'm taking ghosts now. Now, I just have to, as an aside here, I did read that flat earthers look down on hollow earthers. I don't know if you've ever heard that or not. We tell me about this. What is this? So the people who believe the earth is flat, apparently like it, like it conventions where you're, I don't know if there's like, like, like shape of earth. Conventions, nonstandard shape of earth conventions. Yeah, apparently the flat earthers, like they bully the hollow like they see the hollow or yeah, they, the, they see the hollow earthers is like, I may be being adjacent to finally waking up and realizing it's flat, motherfucker. If anything, it's like flat and I guess there's pockets in the flatness or something, but it's not a sphere so that they flat earthers bully, bully hollow earthers, apparently. And it sucks, you know, because the hollow earth is way cooler than flat. It also makes more sense. I mean, I don't think, you know, obviously I don't go to these conventions, but if I had to take a side, I'd go with hollow earth. If I had to bet on one, you know what, we might get invited to one where we get to do a debate versus shampoo. I don't think they're interested in us though, because I bet those conferences are very serious. Well, I imagine they are. You know what? I am enough of a fool that I could get serious about, you know, the problem is, I believe in both. I believe, I believe that there are ghosts and there's Buddha's in the atomic. The earth is flat and hollow. Oh, man, you just blew my mind. I thought you were referring to. I'm going to grab my ball, man. I never took it that far, dude. It's the same thing I would say, because I'm such a rationalist. I would say it's one or the other, man. You can't have them both. You got to pick. You can't have both. OK, let's. OK, now we might as well. Longs were here though. When we started chatting on Twitter, it was so fun because we're talking about ghosts and I realized that you, like so many people out there, you don't believe in ghosts and you've said it here. You know, it's probably going to. It's probably going to come back to heart. Honestly. Dad jokes, dad jokes for the week. That no, that was a seriously good dad joke. That was amazing, amazing. Oh my God. So but I can't recall exactly what the point you were making was regarding your and maybe you just saying, look, there's no ghosts. Well, it's not just that. So I actually think it's really important that people understand in my opinion. It's I always say in my opinion, because I've learned to be gentle instead of an asshole, but it really just means what I am about to say is what I know is true. OK, so I know that this is true and I think it's important that people understand why they believe in ghosts when they don't, in fact, exist. And I think it has to do with the fact that humans are extremely intolerant of there's a couple of reasons. One reason is humans are very intolerant of ambiguity and uncertainty. So when something happens, that's remarkably astonishing and there seems to be no explanation, our minds like frantically fill it with some kind of explanation. And that's because cognitive load rises in the face of uncertainty. So when we don't understand something, our minds just reflexively try to figure it out and that takes up a lot of energy. And that energy we need for doing stuff like, you know, paying the bills and and figuring out what to eat and like get into school on time. So you can just say to your brain, I think it was a ghost. All right, we're done. That's great. I don't have to deal with that anymore. Or we think it was a big foot or it was an alien. Or it was, you know, those are all the same class of thing, which is to say they are cognitive load reducing explanations of mystery. The other thing, the other reason I think that people believe in ghosts and again, I don't want to put either of these on you and there might be more is that the world is not the world is not cool enough as it is. So in other words, like ghosts and big foots and aliens, like, like they are they are, in my opinion, sometimes, sometimes, not always. I think the cognitive load is more common. But you know how people say I want to believe, right? That's the ex files thing I want to believe. I want to believe in aliens. Yes, the reason I think like, so it's not I believe in them. I think it's really important difference because I think people like, well, if the world had ghosts in it, if the world had fairies, if the world had magic, if the world had whatever, then it would be an enchanted place. And the and the error there is that it already is enchanted without those things. There's already butters in the ship. It's already crazy that that I have a play behind me that fucking grows pods and attracts bugs and eats them in its pods. Like, this is way easier than a ghost. The fact that this thing exists, right? And so what I believe is is one is a kind of blindness to the miraculousness of reality as it is. And the other is a cognitive load reducing mechanism. And I think those two things together are a more parsimonious explanation of ghosts, then sure ghosts actually existing. OK, yeah, yeah. It's like, you know, like you're when you're a kid, you, you know, the cartoons our kids watch or the dream of like the unicorn or the whatever the thing may be. You you're reading the fantasy book and you are even not even a unicorn. I mean, I don't know if you had this dinosaur thirst. You know what I mean? We're like when you're a kid and it dawns on you, you're never going to see a living dinosaur. I mean, this spawned Jurassic Park is the every kid wants to see a living, breathing dinosaur. And you get this weird dino grief when you're a kid. When it dawns on you like, no, no, no, you could see their bones. You could see, you know, recreations of them, but there ain't no dinosaurs. I'm sorry. It hurts. I don't know if you remember that pain. So I would say so this funny thing. This guy, Chesterton, who's great. Interesting, interesting figures, Catholic thinker. I think he was responsible for, you know, Tolkien and and eventually and like Louis indirectly becoming Christian. He he says this funny thing. He says fairy tales are not actually what kids should be reading. Kids find everyday banal reality extremely enchanting. So it's not actually that kids need unicorns and fairies and stuff like that. That's just adults pretending that kids need the stuff that adults need. Kids are fine with just stupid, boring, everyday shit. They don't need unicorns. They just need like, like that's the third flower your son has ever seen in his life. He's like, what the hell is that? And you're like, dude, come on, I got to get to my work plus my phone's calling me. And he's like, no, no, no, stop. There's this flower. You are not going to believe this. And you're like, no, I believe it. I've seen a lot of flowers. Shut the fuck up, kid. You know that. So the world is actually already enchanted for kids. It's that it becomes disenchanted for adults. We're the ones who need the unicorns and the fairies and the ghosts and the aliens and the big foot and the eternal life and the hierarchies of Bodhisattvas. Kids don't need any of that shit. They just need to wake up in the morning. OK, wait. But I just must tell you as a kid, when I found out I wasn't going to see dinosaurs, it was way, it was a lot more crushing than the non-existence of unicorns or whatever. Or Santa Claus. Because kids are crushed by everything. They're crushed when they discover they're not going to get an ice cream. They're crushed by the kids are infinitely disappointed by everything. I guess I'm just OK. I'm trying to draw just a parallel from my own experience. And but to get to get to the good, to not refuting what you're saying. I'm trying to like summon up like the thirst for the thirst for that, which is not real. I got the suffering that must go along with needing, you know, to to add to the already. Sometimes I wonder if by summoning up the dream of the of the whatever supernatural thing you want to summon up, you're actually trying to evade the overwhelming wildness and magical quality of reality as it is. Because it's too much to take. Yeah, that's a really interesting way to put it, definitely. That's what I hadn't thought of. I actually think that makes a lot of sense. And it's not as judgmental as mine. I'm a very judgmental person. I'm sorry, Duncan. I'm working on it. I don't I don't think it's no, it doesn't feel. I mean, I don't I think you've I you've identified probably a great explanation for why we do go looking for these things. I mean, I don't by the way, it never came out. I have to I'm trying to give you all my skeptical versions of it. So before I tell you my story, I'm very excited. But they so and I and I am looking forward to you expunging it with rationality. No, I it's like it's an exorcism, so to speak. No, because I see what those look like in movies. I don't want I don't want to see your head spinning, Duncan. Yeah, yeah, to redundantly go back to your dad joke. I am haunted by this thing that happened to me. And I look forward to not being anymore. So the the so yeah. Anyway, the the what was I just saying? Shit, maybe I should just get to the ghost story because I already lost track of what I was saying that. Why do we want there to be? Well, you said the overwhelming miraculousness and magicalness of reality is so intense that this is like an escape from that, which I think is so beautiful and interesting. Exactly. And also, maybe in the blindness that many people seem to have for just the whatever you want to call it, the primordial wildness of fundamental reality. Because that because of that, we fragment and then potentially project these kinds of like inventions of the mind that are the simple that are more manageable. Some are manageable, right? Like totally. That makes sense. But anyway, you know, you speculate, speculate. I think I also like that, you know, it's just it's too much like if we can come up with these cabinets where we can put, you know, things that generally happen, you know, ghost encounters happen really quickly and, you know, you for most of human history, there haven't been video cameras or whatever. So you can go back and look at the camera and be like, oh, it was a moth. That was a moth. So so so to fix the problem of what of like, you know, the aching reality that are nervous, our ability to perceive reality is imperfect. OK, I'll put it in the ghost cabinet and forget about it. It was a fucking ghost. So so it. But I must say, also. This is, I think, by trying to do that level of trying to trick yourself in that way. I think long term, you probably experience the same cognitive load, right? Because now you got to deal with like shit. Way more, way more cognitive load, way more. Well, because because for one you've got you've got as soon as you allow in a false belief into your web of beliefs, it's the ramifications of it. So what it takes to sustain belief in ghosts, right, is all kinds of other stuff. There's like belief in heaven when I talk to my students, right? So I'm like, OK, you believe in heaven, right? What does that look like? And they're like, well, I never thought about it. I'm like, well, so are your relatives there? And they're like, yeah, they are. And I'm like, OK, how old are they? They're like, well, the age they were when they died. I'm like, OK, so all the so but that's weird. Like so then all the old people just old forever, like are their clothes there? And so the problem is like when you allow in a belief like eternal life in heaven with the fam or like ghosts, it drags along with it. A bunch of unexamined assumptions that are necessary to sustain it, which which are also false, which then or or not coherent. And then that fucks around with the rest of your web of belief. And it makes you vulnerable, because if you have these incoherent ways of thinking that exists to support the false belief that you've allowed in, people at Satan can come and exploit those. The conspiracy theorists can come in and exploit those. And that's super dangerous, in my opinion. Like if we're going to look at things from the perspective, like, let's imagine a, I don't know, I'm going to use the wrong words here. But, you know, some metaphysical biome where like there's predatory creatures that are drawn to certain colors or shapes. You sure don't want your color or shape to be all your irrational ideas. It's a matter of time before something swoops in. It's like, I'm just exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly. I'm Jesus. And you're like, I know that actually kind of makes sense. Well, you know, you might be a secret bodhisattva. What, what Jesus, what do you want? And inevitably Jesus is like, would you suck my dick? That's right. Like exactly what he does. It's always, always ends in sucking dicks. And the thing about secret bodhisattvas, unlike Jesus, is their fucking secret. They keep that shit to themselves. They keep that shit to themselves. They wander through the world and everything harmonizes itself. And they never disclose themselves. As soon as the bodhisattva discloses itself, it's going to be asking for a dick sucking soon enough, you know. Well, I must say, I mean, where I, and maybe this is our, hopefully you'll do another podcast with me. We can do another podcast. I'm not on dick sucking. Please. I'm a professional. I'm telling you, but I'm still, I'm still a little wary. I know it was like my friend, my friend who loves you show. I told him I was going on and he was like, and I'd been talking to him about like this other thing where like part of what I was talking about was like my mom sucking my dick. And he was like, you got to talk with talking about that. He's the only guy who would be okay with this metaphor. And I was like, there's no way I'm talking about my mom sucking my dick. Like she might hear it. In fact, I just did it, though. So I'm in trouble. You want me to take it out? I could take it out. Let me mark the clip. You can't take it out once it's in there. It's in there. Oh, OK. But you did say it was a metaphor for a second before you, but you didn't lead with metaphor that for a moment. I'm like, you know, I'm not OK with that. I tell your friend, I'm actually not OK with your mom. Sucking your dick. Either I'm OK with it. That was the whole point of the story. It's I mean, I don't want to get into that. We'll do it on the other podcast. No, the other podcast is not about dick sucking your incest. No, the other podcast, I would love to talk with you about lame new age methods for dealing with evil or unfairness in the world. But this is a different. You mean like this thing I just brought home? Well, this is not new age, but I just got this today. Like, you know, this kind of thing, although this isn't lame, this is cool. So this is not what you mean. You mean the lame new age ones. This is like an evil. I think that goes back a long way. No, I'm talking about the and it gets into your having. I'm talking about that you die and you go to like, essentially some kind of really nice spot where you chill out and then you choose your next incarnation. That thereby putting the the anyone in a rotten predicament instead of having to just deal with the soul crushing reality that sometimes people end up in the most rotten predicament. You can think, well, you know, you chose that because you wanted to that's you're the universe wanting to learn about what it's like to be human trafficked and dying, suffocating in the back of it. So that to me is one of the I like it as a personal. Like, I don't know how that's crazy. You say that stuff out loud. That's absolute craziness. Never say that. Yeah, you're driving the truck. You're driving the truck and you realize I'm going to have to bail. And you're like, gang, you all picked you pick this as your incarnation. You probably shouldn't have. I'm at it. Yeah, so you're getting in a lot of a lot of people who say those things that first they lead with don't say this to anybody. But here's an idea. Now, OK, all that should decide. That's for other podcasts. I remember what I was going to tell you. So for there was an episode of Drunk History that I've been on Drunk History many times. I don't know if you've seen the show. You get hammered. Yeah, it's a fun show. And it's but the last episode I did was in a haunted house where I can't remember his name, a ghost hunter, so to speak, came and we went up into the attic of the house. I'm all drunk and I'm ready to go home and we go up in the attic of this freaking house and I've never seen the filming of a ghost hunter show. I think you should do it as some kind of I don't know, web series or something. I because, you know, you're you're you're in a ghost hunter show and you need you need it's the the money shot is the creek. You just need any please, God, let something fall. Please, God, let you're watching them do it like the mercenary. Like they're they're looking for it. You're watching them. Yeah, you're seeing. Eight hours, twelve hours of sitting in a freaking dark room where someone killed themselves going, Johnny, are you here? Show us if you're here and then, you know, for eight hours. But you don't see that you just see the one anomalous event that happened where they're like, what was that? I'm shook. And then all you need is that one event and one of them and every like, I feel a chill. Do you feel a chill? Everyone there is like, no one's feeling the chill. They want to go back to the hotel and go to bed. So I feel your chill. Are you? Oh, God, what is happening? You just need the sound and then it becomes, you know, content. You can use that. So you know, but you're it's well, it's showbiz, you know, you're making you're making entertainment for you, but you're not lying. Well, but when I'm what, you know what? When I'm I know it's a whole school of thought when it comes to entertainment or art or whatever, which is, look, this is show business. I could go into like, you know, the famous Bacowski story, like Bacowski apparently was being a complete asshole on an airplane and like was like hitting on the flight attendant and like just being a drunk, vile, drunk. Anyway, he's there with this guy. The guy reads a story he wrote and in the story, Bacowski makes the guy he was with him and Bacowski heroically stops that guy from being an asshole. The guy's like, what are you? Why'd you write that? It's not true. That's a different. I think that's I think that's different. So I think with Ghost Hunters, the different is the Bacowski story is fiction. The Ghost Hunters show is nonfiction and that's what's not OK. Listen, I mean, it's different. It's a different thing, right? It's a different thing. If you're doing fiction, I think it's different from like, I don't know, I think the genre is important. Maybe that's another podcast. But I think that's a really important distinction. It's a fun idea of talking about it because like the ethics of like doing like shows like that when, you know, and also I think to get deeper into it, it could be that just to deal with the cognitive dissonance of feeling like some kind of charlatan every day, your fucking life, you are imagining this stuff is happening. And that's that's the scary part, though, right? Then you're just a hollow shell shambling through life, you know, locked in in an endless series of deceptions. I mean, how terrifying God save us. It is. Well, yeah, especially, you know, if your source of income gets connected to Dr. Oz's example, you know, what this is why we have right livelihood in Buddhism, you know, like this idea of you want it to be honest and real and true. All livelihoods are. But what's your ghost story? Anyway, I don't mean to. I don't mean to. And also to my ghost and her friends out there, I believe some of you really might believe what you're doing, and you're not hollow shells. And you're just trying to document up his people. There are ghost writers out there, actually, who probably hate those other ghost centers who are genuine, who are actually like, no, there you go. Don't fake it, right? It's like the alternative medicine people, right? There are alt met people who are really genuinely healing people and trying to find forms of healing. Yeah. And there are others who are charlatans. And I know that they hate you for making the distinction charlatans as much as I. Yeah. Yes. OK, great. OK, great. Yes. Thank you. Because I'm feeling guilty now because I know some ghost owners and they didn't strike me, but they're not the ones filming that show. OK, so here's the ghost story. And I am I cannot wait for you to. OK, so I am in New Orleans with someone I was in a relationship with. We're at this hotel. It's the I think it was that I'll have to look it up. The Omni. I have an Omni in New Orleans. That's cool. Fortunately, all this stuff is documented. So I'm in this hotel. I have this awful dream, awful, awful dream in the dream. I am in the Arctic and I'm in it. I'm in a tent and. I hear something fall out of the sky. Now, I don't know how I knew it was falling out of the sky, but you know, you know how like bags sound when they land on the ground or something? It was like something hits the ground in this dream. So I go out of my tent again. It's obviously it's a dream. You're not like, what? Why am I in a tent? I go out of the tent and there in front of the tent is a body bag. Now, I go over and I unzip the body bag and I open it. And in the body bag is someone in the dream who looks like Pete Holmes, the comedian, my friend. And this Pete Holmes comes out of the body bag and all confused and immediately starts hitting on my girlfriend. Now, I was scared of the corpse, but then when the thing's hitting on my girlfriend, I'm immediately like, also, there is a note in his pocket, which is like some kind of love letter to my girlfriend. And OK, the thing shambles off. There's this. There's a thing. I was such a disturbing dream that I wrote it down in a journal, which I don't always write my dreams down, but I wrote this down at the time, at the time, wrote it in the journal. OK, cut to that night at the bar. I were talking to the bartender. Everyone knows New Orleans, Haunted City, whatever. So I say to the bartender, is do you know any ghost stories about this hotel? And she goes, you want to know the one we're not supposed to tell the guests? And I'm like, yeah. And she's like, well, that dude who cut up his girlfriend jumped out of the jumped off the roof of the hotel and committed suicide. I didn't know anything about this, by the way. But I will give you his name. You can look it up on your device. Look up this guy. He looks similar to Pete Holmes. So I have a dream that involves a body falling out of the sky with a note in its pocket that's kind of romantic about a dude who killed his girlfriend during Hurricane Katrina. And he kind of looks like Pete Holmes. And that was where I got in my head. Oh, there, you know, the shining idea or something. Like it's not like there's spiritual entities floating around. But in the same way, a player piano or ink in a printer or something translates certain data feeds that in the world, our brains take the symbols that we have in them, weave them together when they come into contact with whatever this haunted energy is. And that produces the thing we call ghosts, which is just some extra sense of something. That was my. That's what I've thought of. I've had many, many, many experiences where I'm like, that's a ghost. I'm like, that's not a ghost. I don't know why it's not a ghost, but I know it's not a ghost. Anytime anyone, you know, I hear anyone talking about ghosts in general. I'm like, I don't know if that's a ghost, necessarily. I don't know. But this one in particular of all the weird, supernatural encounters I've ever had, I can't quite like it's too many coincidences connecting at once. And also I wrote the dream down to probably somewhere there's the actual dream that is written down before I knew anything about. The event itself. So free me, free me, help me out and get it out of my head. I wish I could, but I have bad news. I guess the first thing I would say is this is a very interesting definition of a ghost. Oh, damn it. You know what I mean? OK, yeah, it's actually not a ghost at all. What it is, what you're talking about is like what you said, I forget exactly how you put it was much better than whatever I'm going to say. But like that there are these sorts of confluences of energy that emerge out of the kind of subconscious symbolic stuff. And then you talk about like kind of haunted energy and then those things come together and they produce these sorts of synchronicities. I mean, I'm not I am not in the way that I'm sure that ghosts don't exist, AKA like the concretized energy of a once living being moving through the world and doing stuff like picking up glasses or talking to people or whatever. Those don't exist. Is there is there a mysterious like a set of like is there mysterious non temporal symbolic energy that can hang around in certain ways? I mean, for sure. I mean, it's not that mysterious in general, right? So like for one, like places can be haunted. We talk about haunted, right? This word haunt right now. The dad joke is just becoming straight philosophy. It's like I'm like I'm haunted by a memory, right? So or like you could say like this place, like, you know, in Charlottesville, right? There's like there's an entrance. There's the entrance that black people had to use to get into the theater, right? It's it's fucking haunted. Like it's haunted by by the sins of our past. And people who analyze ghost stories often talk about how they tend to be located in places where there was an unjust death. This is in every culture, cross-culturally trans historically, like an unjust death or an unresolved sin. Is it possible that those things infuse the cosmos, physical cosmos with some kind of energy that can then be connected to by other people? I would not be nearly as like strong in my like, no, that's impossible. I would say personally, I would say it's it's unlike. I'm not sure that that happens, but I'm much, much less sure about that. So that's the first thing I would say. OK. So yeah, so I don't know what to tell you. I mean, like I'm open to that idea. I'm open to that ghost. That's kind of interesting. I could be talked into this, you know? I mean, I think it's unlikely because I don't think the physical world works that way. So like I don't I don't believe, for example, that I can I think almost all miraculous healings are false because I don't think that your mind can reach into the physical world and and do stuff exactly like that. At the same time, I take it back because obviously, like I can will myself to do things. So my mind is obviously that's not an illusion, you know? And so I well, I mean, you could say induction of the placebo effect by a charismatic exactly. Exactly. That's exactly right. So I don't I don't know, man. I guess I would say I'm I'm I'm open to it. The other I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I wish I could like I wish I could perform an exorcism, but in fact, I've just been possessed. I'm not I'm not thinking I'm not thinking harder about it. Well, yeah, I'll tell you my most like the most skeptical place I can go to with it. It's just like, OK, this was a big story. This was a big story. I missed it, but I have a foul. Exactly. So if I'm going to have to like break it down to like the like Occam's razor, you know, then that is going to be. No, here's what happened. Somebody chopped up their girlfriend in during Hurricane Katrina and you read an article about it because you're a mind like shit like this. You read an article about it and you skimmed the article to get to the murder part and you just went through the Omni Hotel or whatever. And but it got in there somehow. So you go to the Omni Hotel having forgotten you've read the story, seen the picture of the dude and your brain somehow, whatever part of your brain that encodes this stuff is like, oh, my God, we're in the suicide hotel and then regurgitates it in the form of. Oh, yeah, actually, you just exercised me. I think that's much more plausible. I guess I'm going to bet on that. Here's another explanation. It's just a coincidence. Sometimes people in the lottery, man. Sometimes your dreams just going to be weirdly like something else. I mean, we live long enough. There's infinite butters and a piece of shit. There's infinite moments of the life. There's going to be coincidence. Everyone is going to experience at least one extreme. Well, technically speaking, all things are extremely unlikely, but we only we only see them when we only see the ones were oriented to see by conditioned reality. But this is going to be sometimes we're going to experience coincidences that we are oriented to see by conditioned reality, like something looking like something else or someone having the same birthday. Right. Kurt Vonnegut hated that shit, right? It's like, oh, my God, you have my birthday. Wow. That must mean something. It's like, no, dude, 300 and one in 365 fucking people are going to have your birthday. Like, chill out. People got bored on that day. You know, it's OK. It's OK. It's not a big deal. You know, so that's going to happen, except instead, it'll be like a one in 300,000. You know, so that's another explanation. Is it just a coincidence? Now, just as doing the right there because and this goes back to what I was saying earlier, the truth is, it's all fucking crazy. It's all incredibly significant, but it's too overwhelming to allow that in, as you said before. So we only allow in the enchanted reality in these in these flashes, right? Because if we just allowed it in all the time, it would be overwhelming, possibly, or it would just be awesome. I don't I don't I mean, I don't know. I don't have the, like, you know, bandwidth to sure everyone dies. You're already a Buddha, remember? Well, she does tell people, you just can't tell it about yourself. Are you asking me to suck it up? No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. That's not I didn't say it. That's what I just want to think it through. If I call you a Buddha. No, I think it's totally photonic in that case. You brought it. I want to know because you haven't recorded it just like your dream. I want to make sure when my friend comes to me, that I don't think I brought up the digs. I think my wife's downstairs. She's like, will you please not talk about pedophilia? Like, I'm like, like, like that. No, we're not going to. We're not going to. I I brought it. Listen, here's the thing. I brought it up by saying if you are one of the one of the things you can look forward to, if you find yourself being extremely irrational, is that someone will seduce you using their whatever. The trick is that they're their powers. Now, that is so funny. Oh, my God. It's going to happen. It's going to happen. Now, the OK, so I am not sat. I appreciate your I appreciate your point of view. And I and thank God for you. My wife is like you in the sense that she will. She knows me and like she knows how my mind veers towards the irrational habitually, meaning that like when the pandemic was happening, I'd been on the conspiracy forums and I got into my head that a meteor was going to hit the earth and that the lockdowns were actually some like secret way of getting people inside to store up food without causing a panic. And I told my wife this and she's like. No, she's not what's happening. I'm not even know the look on her face. I mean, she sounds like a woman. I went on Rogan's podcast and told him that and he pauses for a second and he goes. The only reason I'm pausing is because that's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. Alan, I got to ask you. This is something that you have written about and I've thought about it myself, but not so brilliantly as you've articulated it. I want to talk a little bit about your idea of how people have like the idea of the natural world or naturalism being a kind of religion. Can we talk about that for a second? Will you explain your philosophy in that regard? Absolutely. So long story short, I think that especially nowadays where people are looking for non-religious justifications for the decisions that they make, whether it comes to who they sleep with, what they eat, how they raise their children. It used to be what I'm going to raise them as God intended. Right. But now we don't go to our rabbi or our priest or a mom to figure out what foods we should eat or how we should raise our baby. We go to the psychologist or we go to the doctor or nutritionist or whatever it is. Yeah. But that's complicated. And it means outsourcing authority to another human being, which people don't like to do. So what you can do instead of outsourcing authority to God, which feels like you're not submitting yourself to a human, right? You're you're you're still free to do what you want, but you also have guidance. People are outsourcing their decisions to nature. And what I'm arguing is that nature is exactly like the monotheistic God of Abrahamic religions. It's prior prior to everything that existed. So it's a creative force that's responsible for all organization we see in the universe. It's benevolent. Yes. So if you harmonize with it, then things will be good. And you can explain all suffering, right? Like, why did why does pregnancy hurt? Because you're sitting in unnatural positions all the time. Or why is it that people are sick because they eat unnatural foods? So yes, nature is a synonym for God. Natural is a synonym for holy. And we can see that everywhere from economic theory to medicine, so on. That is so cool. That's so controversial. That's so so interesting. There's a lot of reasons it's controversial. You know, also, I think like to add to the idea of like, you know, God is the authority. Obviously, like when you're like, you're not going to God when you have some like religious and have a parenting issue, because probably I mean, probably you're not going to get a response. You're going to an intermediary. This is the rabbi. This is the priest. So interestingly with that, with that, with that, right? So now where do people go when they're trying to? Why are my kids bratty, right? They go to like hunter-gatherers. This is the sort of stand in for the pre, you know, this is the Edenic before the fall. How did people live naturally? Oh, well, the hunter-gatherers, their kids are, you know, shucking, shucking oysters at age three and they never misbehave. And there's these New Yorker articles about how, you know, oh, these these hunter-gatherer kids, they're the way we should be raising kids. So that's the the instead of Adam and Eve, right? You have the secular version of that, which is the sort of romanticized noble savage that lives according to the laws of nature and hasn't been corrupted by modernity and technology. OK, I have. So actually, one of the schools we toured at one point was one of these schools, which was there's a name for it. I can't remember, but it's like, like just what you're saying. The idea is like, look, this the modern education system is like prohibitive and unnatural in the sense that when, well, how does it make sense to make kids sit still and listen to someone talk? That's not how people learned in the wild. So the kids like there's mud pits and like, you know, it's it's it's wild. Anarchy gets somewhat organized. So, yeah, and radical in the sense that as far as I'm aware, there hasn't been versions of that for for like at least since the Industrial Revolution, the Greerian Revolution, probably, it makes it makes here's the thing, though, and I'm pretty clear about my thesis. It's ridiculous to think that things are good because they're natural. So let's take this school, right? Presumably, they teach kids how to read, which is about as unnatural as it gets. The reason I'm wearing glasses is because I read too much. You know, there's an explosion after literate communities. So the truth is things are good when they when they create, you know, happiness and when they create harmony and when they relieve suffering and things are bad when they don't. And, you know, with a school like this or or or anything for that matter, the word that people will say is good because it's natural. It only takes a moment's reflection to see all of the ways in which the school. I mean, these kids are going to be wearing shirts, for example. They're going to be living the kids that are coming to the school with their parents. They're probably not living with extended kinship groups the way that hunter-gatherers did. You know, they're not there. I mean, there's there's so many ways in which we have accepted and celebrate the unnatural, which is awesome, right? This is that means like, you know, a lot of these kids wouldn't have made it to this school because they would have died by the age of five. I mean, you know, infant and child mortality rates were 10, 20 times what they are today. So I think what people have trouble with, but what we need to get over is that you can love nature and you can love what's natural without worshipping it. I think that's really, really important. And so we shouldn't confuse natural. You know, we shouldn't think of natural as a synonym for good. It's not OK. If you like of all the things, all the variables, what do you think is the most like what comes to mind when you think of unnatural? Like what's something out in the world that you would consider to be unnatural? Sure. So I think that I think natural and unnatural are actually useful terms. There's some people out there like everything's natural. Like Neil deGrasse Tyson, right? Everything's natural. All stardust, right? The this computer is no less natural than than a plant, which is ridiculous. So New York City is really unnatural place, whereas Yellowstone Park is a really natural place. And what do I mean by that? What I mean is that natural equals the absence of willed human organization. Unnatural is willed human organization. So when humans will something to be organized in a particular way, that's what we mean, I think, usually by unnatural. And when things emerge organically, that is to say, without the intervention of willed human action, then it's natural. So anything anything before humans, right? Dinosaurs are 100 percent natural, right? Yellowstone's not because we got a road through it. OK, so I'm this is I'm interested in this only in the sense of like you may be right, you may be wrong, but you're still finding yourself in the as a kind of philosophical speaker. For the world, this is natural. This is unnatural. I think, you know, there's it would be a really awesome debate between you and Neil deGrasse Tyson, and it would be really fun to watch. And I think both of you would really enjoy it. But no matter what, whether Neil deGrasse Tyson is saying, no, no, no, everything's natural, or you're saying here's where the distinction is between natural and unnatural, no matter what. Because you like if I if I were Neil deGrasse Tyson, which I'm definitely not, I can't barely I can't use I don't use the remote control. But the the the if I were like wanting to debate what you just said, I think the biggest argument would be, OK, human organization as it appears in the world, unnatural, meaning the language you just used to articulate the point itself is unnatural, meaning that in that, how can you really can't like make these distinctions, right? Like you're still the unnatural thing. Qualifying nature from unnatural. In other words, something unnatural. You're something you're basically saying you are unnatural. I am. That's right. So humans, I think the word the way in which natural and unnatural are used cross-culturally, trans-historically. So take, you know, ancient China, which is my own area of expertise. The word that people use that's typically translated as natural, saying like proto-daoist classics is Zeran, which literally means self so or so of itself. So things that are kind of spontaneously themselves in contrast to things that are willed by humans. So they're not so of themselves that organized by humans. Now, there's a you can ask the question, is this a useful distinction? I happen to think that it is. And I'll give an example as to why there's something in in it was pioneered by a child psychologist called the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness, it's complicated term that basically means the environment in which an organism sort of calibrated its own like through evolution, calibrated itself. So if you are, let's say there's a bunch of turtles that are laying eggs too early on a beach, a great hypothesis generating heuristic is perhaps there is some unnatural, that is to say human willed form of organization that's interfering with the turtles environment of evolutionary adaptiveness. And then you look and it's like, oh, there's these skyscrapers with bright lights. Those are confusing the turtles as to what time of year it is or whatever. So that's that's a helpful hypothesis. And and sometimes when you depart from the environment of evolutionary adaptiveness, you get problems like our teeth problems, for example, we're eating foods that are not a part of an environment of evolutionary adaptiveness. So we get problems or my glasses, right? I'm reading things, looking at tiny little things, not a part of my environment of evolutionary adaptiveness. However, that doesn't mean necessarily that depart. So I think it's a useful thing, right? Again, natural, it's a spectrum, natural and natural, a useful thing. Here's the thing, though, we just came up with fucking glasses. Now, great. Now I can see I'm happy with the solution. I and I also get to read shit. I also get to use like I get all of these incredible things. You know, we can fly to space using documents that we have written down and exchanged with other humans. Yeah. So again, I think the distinction is useful. And I even understand loving things that are natural just because they are. And I have real plants in my office, not plastic plants. Why? Because it's fucking crazy than beyond and before human beings. There was some kind of organizing principle that barfed up plants and planets and and and all of the stuff that we had no hand in. That's just I mean, whether you're secular or religious, that is a goddamn miracle. So celebrating it in our lives and trying to harmonize with it makes a lot of sense. Just don't confuse that shit with God. It's not God. It kills kids. It gave us cancer. It causes viruses that. Well, hey, no, that nature kills kids out, of course. But I don't want to get into that. I don't want to get into. I know. I know. It's the murder of children. Strangely throughout the Old Testament, it's how he's asking for people to sacrifice their kids. He doesn't like kids. I wouldn't let the Abrahamic God babysit my fucking kids. I'll tell you that. No, no, no, I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. If I'm going to criticize nature, I got to leave criticizing God for at least a different episode. OK, OK, so here's another reason that I have a problem accepting the idea of the human world as unnatural. And it's like because I don't make my thoughts. I don't make my ideas. The ideas pop into my head and then I maybe I'll pick them and then write about it or hopefully create something through it. But the origination point of ideas seems to be the same or mysterious origination point of all things, meaning that whatever made plants pop out of the earth, whatever the forces or whatever, we don't know. Whatever it may have been seems to be the same thing, making human innovation pop out of humanity, meaning that because we had the idea of ownership of human civilization by humans seems to be centered on this notion that humans are creating their own ideas. That the epiphanies come from some, you know, something. What's the word? Autonomous. Yeah, I was going to say this. So this is a parallel, I think. So again, this is and this can get into like really interesting philosophical weeds, I think it's a parallel to the freedom versus, you know, autonomy versus not. Right. So it's the free will debate is here. Right. So in other words, another way of putting the definition, working definition I'm using is free will versus that, which was a part of our, you know, biology or our, our sort of spontaneous psychology, whatever you want to call our appetites, whatever you want to call it. So to the extent that someone would reject a distinction between willed activity and own willed activity, that maps onto rejecting the distinction of natural activity versus unnatural activity. To me, though, I think the way to get out of it is just to say, and when nature is not these working terms are not the nature is not the thing that produced everything because we've already defined it as that which is not willed human activity. So the Dow is not nature. God is not nature. Whatever it is that people believe in, the Dow is responsible for everything. Or if you want to call it the Dow, you can't because it gets into the paradoxes. But but the thing that comes before all the other things is responsible for everything. That's just not nature is not that. It's it's something else. And the thing is, look, if you look in, this stuff is just it's so embedded in our our culture and our ways of thinking. It's in Shakespeare, right? An unnatural death is like you didn't live out your years, right? You got murdered or something like that. You look at the Declaration of Independence. I mean, this is crazy, right? It run in the course of human events, blah, blah, blah, blah, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them. So right there in the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson basically says, look, there are these there are these laws of nature that exist beyond and before human beings. Yeah. Now, whether or not he's right, like, whether that's how whether democracy was built into nature, I think that's bullshit, right? That's crazy. What Jefferson sort of said is the best way to govern people is with the shit we've come up with. You know, it's not because it's natural. It's because it works well. You know what I mean? Let's just like, I don't know. Like why? But people don't declaration of independence had that in it. I don't know. But when he's convincing, right, people love to hear they walk into the store. They want to hear this is the best because it because, you know, a long list of complicated reasons. They just want to know that it's natural. It's like a kosher symbol, right? It's the kosher symbol is right next to the organic symbol. Right. It's the same thing. Just secular. OK. So so we don't get caught up in philosophical weeds. I want to get to the next controversial thing about this idea, which is the separation of church and state and that, you know, so what gets really interesting here is if this naturalism is just a new close on an old thing. If it is just actually a form of weird theism or whatever you want to call it, we just shifted the the idea of God to like you mentioned earlier, nature. And and you have like environmental environmentalism and laws that are springing from environmentalism. And in school, you're being taught, you know, this idea of this is natural. This is nature. Is it if it's if it's if we determine this is a religion, it really kind of like changes the landscape of it seems like it would change the landscape of what's legal to talk about in public schools. You know what I mean? Like if if if if because you sure, you know, in public schools, you can't have prayer and the reason you can't you can't have prayer not because necessarily I think they think prayer is evil, but because there's so many different forms of prayer and there's so many different religions that are appearing in public schools. It you can't like hierarchize one over the other. But if this is another form of, I don't know, theism or I don't know what you call it. Naturalism equals theism, right? Doesn't this? Yeah. So what are your thoughts on that? Yeah, I have. So the the the idea of naturalness or nature is not inherently theological. It's only theological when you confuse natural with good or holy and nature with God. So in schools, if you're teaching, for example, whatever is natural is good. And we always, you know, so why did the pandemic happen? Because we violated nature's laws and we were punished. That's that's a religious teaching that does not belong in schools. But if you say something like, look, the natural world is a wonderful place and we value things that are natural and it's important to preserve it. Or if you violate very quickly, a kind of homeostasis in an organic environment, whether of an organism or of, you know, an environment, that can cause trauma to the organisms in the environment. If we don't want trauma, we should avoid that. That's not religion. That's just that's just thinking about what it is that we do and don't value. I mean, an analogous thing is freedom, right? So or beauty, we value freedom. If we were to say, though, for example, only things that create freedom are good and freedom is actually the standard to which we should hold everything. Then we'd be getting into religious teachings, right? Then we turned freedom into God and it's become the sort of value out of which everything sprints. So that's how I think we avoid the kind of thing that you're talking about, which I think is really important. I mean, you had this, you had this fucker, the guy with the horns, the January six shaman guy. Oh, yeah, demanding. Yeah, demanding that he be given organic food because it was his religion that he has to eat organic right now. Oh, yeah. This is in a way, it was really nice to see that because right, organic food is not inherently good. And if you think it is, that really is a kind of religious claim. It's a claim that turns nature into God and that, which is spontaneous or organic or non-willed by humans into that, which is good or holy. So you keep that out of schools, right? If you're teaching that that's how you figure out what's right or good, that's a problem. Wow. That is a lot for me to think about over the next few weeks. I'm not smart enough to immediately be like, oh, yeah. But I really love that idea. I love it makes sense. I hope it makes sense at least. I know I like talk fast. No, no, it absolutely. No, it totally makes sense. And I imagine you've gotten some really interesting emails from people about your stance on this matter. Haven't you? You must have gotten some serious. Well, so absolutely. I mean, I think what happens is just like God, right? People aren't thinking about what's what nature wants all the time. Generally speaking, people just live in their lives, right? They're like, how can I get a promotion? How can I like, you know, my kids upset? How do I calm down? It's in moments of crisis or when your cognitive load is really high, that you need a simple heuristic for making important decisions. Yes. And so there will be people who, you know, I have all sorts of unnatural things in their lives, right? They've got their computers, they've got their air conditioned homes. They've got, you know, whatever it is, right? Like all the people that want to raise their kids naturally still use temperature control. Maybe some of them don't, but like most of them do, right? They're not releasing wild animals into their homes, right? In all ways, their lives are are extremely controlled and isolated from the natural world. However, the blowback I get is when, for example, let's say there's a crisis and they're like, well, what do I feed my kid? I'm really worried about this. I'm going to use, well, natural must mean good. That's when you go to the simple heuristic. You're right. You're right. You're like, OK, I'm just going to feed him what's natural. And when someone comes in and goes, actually, that's some bullshit. They're going to be mad because if you take that away from them, it's going to take away the thing that allowed them to make decisions without increasing their cognitive load. It's going to return their anxiety. The same thing with religion, right? People are like, Jesus is great. Like he tells you to turn the other cheek. And it's like, well, what about the thing in the Sermon on the Mount where he says that marrying a divorced woman is adultery, right? And you'll find that Christian apologists are like, well, OK, hold on. You have to read that differently. It's actually a metaphor or like that was just for the time. Jesus was actually secretly telling men to be nice to their wife. You know, the couple of all kinds of crazy readings because if you take away what would Jesus do as your cognitive load reducing heuristic, in other words, Jesus is just actually whatever you whatever is good. If you challenge that, it causes stress because you need that precisely at the times when you're most freaked out or you're having the most difficulty making decisions. So I get a lot of blowback from people who have at some point or another used that heuristic, what is natural is what is good to help them get through a crisis or perhaps they've developed a ritual around it. Maybe they're really anxious about eating. And so they've used that as a way to calm themselves about the choices they make with food. When I come in and I'm like pissing on their idols, they get upset understandably, right? And I wouldn't want to, you know, I don't know, this actually reminds me of the stuff we talked about the ghosts last time in a way. I don't want to just waltz into someone's church and something I used to do with my first book. I did it with food, right? I was walking in the church and I'm like, this is fucking ridiculous. Look at this. And I'm like, that's so logical. And I lay out all the evidence. I'm like, drop in the logic grinder, turn the crank and like out pops like a good person, right? But that's actually not true. It's just me being an asshole. So I'm not sure. You went into churches? No, I didn't metaphorically speaking. No, I didn't actually go into churches. I want to see the video. That's what the new atheists would do, right? They're going into these churches metaphorically speaking and they're like, look, this is what doesn't make sense. And this is what doesn't make sense. And this is stupid. And what does heaven look like? Right? I mean, same, you know, same hairs in these cats who are smart, smart people and like understandably upset. If you do that to people, if you rip away the the simple almost divine heuristics that they use in moments of crisis without providing an alternative, right? Or without being gentle or without knowing them and understanding where they're coming from. You're not you're not doing something good. You're doing you're you're you're you're wronging them. And so I would want to say to anyone listening to this. And I say this in the book a little bit, look, man, I get why we do this. And sometimes it's a useful heuristic. And you know, I try to express as much as I can that I you know, if Jefferson's doing it, you know, like I get it, right? This dude's way, way, way, way smarter than I am. And he he understands that these kinds of principles are important. And he and he thinks of them at least as persuasive, right? If not, even if he doesn't believe in them. So, yeah, I'd want to be careful, you know, if eating naturally works for you, man, whatever you happen to think natural is, of course, right? Because there's people who are putting protein powder into their natural smoothies, right, which is a little weird if you think about it. But that's fine, right? Whatever works for you. If you got a smoothie, it works for you. Don't let Alan Levinevitz come along and tell you it's stupid, right? It works for you. But the reason it's good is not because it's natural. It's because it works for you. Well, you know, I mean, in the old days, in the ancient times, when people had blenders, that's right. In the, you know, in the ancient times, when trucks drove their natural food across the country from farms hundreds of miles away, you know, there are a lot of, like, you know, when you spread this circumference of natural out, like someone is like, oh, I'm eating natural foods and living a natural life. It's like, right. Yeah. But like the way the shit's getting into your house is we're going to make a nature argument. It's as unnatural as you could possibly get if nature is like growing your own food. It's a it's brilliant. It's a really, really cool idea. And though I am a theistic person and I love God and would enjoy the band getting ripped away, you know, he's the band. It always comes back and I'm happy with that, you know, because what what happens when you like plunge into oblivion, when you're breathing your last breath, you're like, oh, I guess I was wrong. I'm dead forever. Who cares? You know, it's it's like, and if you're right, wow, cool. I was right. But at that point, it probably won't matter either. It's just fun. I think we should all be allowed to, you know, you're supposed to try to break apart all this stuff, whatever it may be. Right. I mean, that's the you want to talk about personally, not for other people. Yeah, I don't know. I yeah, not for other people. But the problem is when you're, I mean, and you know this better than I do, when you're not just talking to yourself, you know, you put stuff out there and, you know, those ideas hit other people and you don't know how they're going to hit those people or when they're going to hit those people. And so. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I personally, I struggle. I struggle with this, right? It's like, well, what am I going to put out into the world as opposed to what is that I do to myself? And and I do think, you know, in the case of what's natural, right? I do think it's helpful. It'll be good for us when it comes to conservation, when it comes to our health to separate the idea of natural from good. Like I do think that is that is something we need to, you know, yet Germany right now or let's look at here's a great example. It's in Sri Lanka. There is I want to make sure it's Sri Lanka. I'm terrible with geography. Yeah, Sri Lanka. There's this crazy crisis going on right now where the government basically embraced naturalness. Yeah, they went all organic for their farming. And the countries now that their their output of their crops dropped by like 30 percent, I think, maybe higher. There's a huge crisis because because it turns out that doesn't that didn't work as well. And the reason it didn't work as well is because it didn't work as well. You know, natural is not inherently good. And there's going to be people that people are defending it and be like, well, they didn't go natural enough, right? You know, it's always like that's always how they argue. We're your cancer. Oh, the vegetarian smoothies didn't cure your cancer. That's because you were using like non-organic vegetables. But I really think we need to get away from that idea. Germany would have nuclear reactors right now and they wouldn't be turning to coal in the face of this crisis if they hadn't had a kind of naturalistic aversion to nuclear energy. Right. So I think that I do think this idea is important at the same time. Like I said, if you're doing something natural and it's working for you, if you read some article about raising hunter-gatherer kids and you were like, that really speaks to me. I'm going to raise my kid pooping in the corners of the house instead of using these diapers. And it works. That's terrific, man. I'm not here to tell you that that was stupid or wrong or bad. And so it's hard to kind of separate out the justificatory schemes that people use from the relative goodness of what it is that they're justifying. I get it. Yeah, no, totally. I get it. I think that is really the, I think that's probably in this line of thinking where you could go astray is because of some kind of confirmation bias, you're ignoring the fact that your attempt at quote naturalism is causing you all kinds of problems. And that's where it becomes superstition. That's where it becomes religious. And that's where it becomes counterproductive to you and probably everyone in your family. And especially, I'm a cancer survivor, man. Radiation, baby. I would be dead if I didn't get my lymph nodes blasted with a fucking beam of high powered radiation. So I went to a natural healing clinic in Florida, run by this guy who I swear to God looks like central casting for Satan. I don't know if we talked, did we talk about this last time? No. I don't think we did. He's got like a crazy widow's peak, like an artificial teen, a goatee. I mean, it's like crazy, this guy. And he runs this place called the Hippocrates Institute and they can't say that they cure cancer because it's illegal and they'd get in trouble, but they do basically promise that they cure cancer. And I went there because two First Nations kids with leukemia, the First Nations is indigenous people of Canada, they heard about this place and decided to go there and eschewed traditional cancer treatment, which is a highly curable cancer, leukemia. And one of the kids died. And the other one was dying and finally opted for traditional cancer treatment. Now in the natural medicine world, I don't know if you know the terms for, it's cut, burn and poison are the terms they use for surgery, chemo and radiation. And the reason they demonize these because they say they're unnatural. And at this place, at this clinic, you pick your wheatgrass, you juice your wheatgrass, not native to the United States, but whatever, not a native crop, invented by Ann Wigmore, Lithuanian American, whatever. You juice your own wheatgrass, you do your veggie smoothies and that's how you try to cure your cancer. Now on the one hand, it sounds, I mean, to a cancer survivor, I can only imagine what you think of this, right? I mean, it's like, what the fuck are these people doing? They're gonna die, they're gonna die here. On the other hand, when I was walking around this place and talking with the people there, there were like plants everywhere. It was beautiful, you had good food, you were in charge of your own health. It was empowering, it was green, it was everything I would want if I was dying. It made me feel alive. Whereas a hospital is stainless steel and bright fluorescent lights, you're literally a patient, all your autonomy is taken away from you, you outsource it to the doctors, this goes back to the autonomy thing. No one wants to be, no one wants to put their life, I mean, some people do, I guess, but sometimes you don't wanna put your life in the hands of another human, right? And so I understood, despite the fact that this place was run by like Mr. Satan, I understood why people were there. I understood why they wanted to be there. And I think we could learn some lessons from that when it comes to our own medical system. Look, you know, my mom died of breast cancer and she, the doctor, you know, told her you're gonna be dead in a year and was so certain about this. He was telling her like, start planning your funeral, you're done. She did use natural remedies and lived an extra three years past what the doctor said she would live. But she didn't, it didn't like heal her, it just extended her life. And she actually was pretty healthy up until the end. And she was also using poison. Right, I was gonna say, I was gonna say, we don't know in those situations, almost always there was surgery, chemo, radiation alongside the natural remedies. And of course, three years, like there's outliers, all these cancer curves, as you know, right? The laugh or whatever curve or I don't know what it's called, but like the physicians that say this kind of thing, and often the physician doesn't say you've got a year to live, they'll say something like, I mean, when you have cancer again, as you know better than I do, the way that, especially at the moment of diagnosis, the way you hear, right? As in any crisis is very unusual. The world is kind of, it's like a fun house mirror of your own mortality through which all of the, the, so like, did the doctor say like, you got a year to live lady, or did the doctor say something like, on average, which is again, doctor shouldn't be saying this, on average patients with this kind of cancer at this stage have about a year to live. And if I were you, one of the things I would consider is hospice care preparations or thinking about how if your life ends at that average time, you know what I mean? Like that's what the doctor said, what do you hear through the fun house mirror? You hear like a big face going like, in a year you will be dead. No, I'm pretty sure he was like, did he actually say a year you'll be dead? Pretty stomp, like pretty like, you know, there's a, like, my friend was telling me some doctors, they have to get like, like bedside manner training just because the type of mind that makes it its way through medical school, it's not exactly a social, a lot of them aren't, they're not social, they're mathematicians with, and like they have to be, cause yeah, what you're saying is it's like, yeah, my doctor was just like, when I'm like, what happens if I don't get treatment for this? Like what, you know, cause I wanted to ask all the questions, I'm like, what if I don't get, do anything? He's like, oh, well then there's a 60% chance that the cancer will progress and with this, with this kind of, with testicular cancer. And so you, and I, like my kind of brain likes that, that logic and I understand where it's coming from and it didn't really, all of it made sense to me, but I'll tell you the reason I have a kind of bitterness in my heart regarding, like where you went and stuff is because my, my mom went to John of God. You ever heard of John of God? Oh no, no, no, I haven't, tell me. So John of God, this was, he got really famous, he was a healer, he got really famous. I bet he did it for free. Ah, he's a, he was a famous, he was made famous by Oprah. You would go there, he would channel these various like physicians, do these healings. He's in jail now for sex trafficking, but the, who would've thunk, but, but you know, I was like, you said last time I'm Jesus, suck my dick, right? And then it's just every fucking time. Yeah, yeah, and, and, but you know, I remember her saying to me, he told me, I'm not gonna die of cancer. And it's like, that's so fucked up, man. It's so fucked up. And so, and again, I'm equating healing centers and like the way I look at it is this, if you, you, it's your body and we for sure know that there is something called, what's it, what's the name of it? You must know the name, spontaneous healing. There's a name for this happens where, where it's a spontaneous remission, a remission, remission, spontaneous remission. Some will have cancer, they, they, and they study these people because it's like, wait, what were you eating? Where did you go? What were you reading? Yeah, yeah, what is your genetics or whatever it is? Yeah, totally. But, but, cause the, the human immune system, we'll just figure out, oh shit, we gotta go rid of that and it gets rid of it. And these new, the new cancer treatments coming out, speaking of like hyper fucking unnatural, getting into your DNA and telling it, this is not good. Get rid of it. It is creating spectacular results. I just feel like the slippery slope in those places you're talking about is instead of saying, hey, this is one of the, this is something that is, that could help. Also what could help? Chemotherapy. Also what could help? Hey, check this out. This is what we know about this new cutting edge therapy, genome therapy, or this is what we know so that the patient isn't being shoved into this weird specialized thing that, that, that, you know, who knows? Are you like, you should be like, have all, like some hybrid of all these things would be incredible along with the honesty, the honesty of like, look, the honesty is, the honesty is important, man. We don't have the studies for turmeric. We don't, you know, there haven't been stud, here's, or even a precursor, here's why we have this data. Here's the number of people who have died of the type of cancer you have. Here, every single one of them gave a gift to us, the doctors, which is in their dying, it helped us understand a little bit more why and what and how it progresses and what it does. So we have infinite amounts of data about this, but the turmeric, the, whatever the thing, the hyperbaric chambers, we don't have as much data, meaning I can't tell you the probability of this stuff working or not working, but maybe, maybe. Well, so I tell you, I tell you funny story, I was working on something. I was going to write a piece, but I never did a long time ago about this guy, Rick Bedlak, he's at Duke University. He's like the world's leading ALS researcher. So this is a guy, I mean, I never really thought about it. This is a man who's, a main part of his job is taking pretty young people, walk into his office and telling them, I'm sorry, you have a neurodegenerative disorder that we have no, we literally don't know how to cure. You've got anywhere between a year to five years, you know, there's outliers like Stephen Hawking, right? But at the end of the day, this is what you got. So that's what does for living. And you know, he also researches this. And at Duke, there's this like alternative medicine clinic where they're like acupuncture and all this other kind of stuff. And he was telling me that he will often refer his patients there. I said, Rick, you know, this was back when I was a skeptic, more of an asshole. I'm equally skeptical now, but less of an asshole. I was like, Rick, come on, this shit doesn't work. And you know it and I know it, right? I had just gotten off the phone with the director at the NIH who was telling me, you know what, acupuncture is basically theatrical placebo, right? This is it. Like that we know this, you know, it's a theatrical placebo. And I was like, okay. So I'm talking to Rick about this. And he's like, well, what, you know, Rick dresses just, you know, when he dresses in these sparkly, like tuxedo outfits, like ridiculous outfits. And he dresses in them. I asked him why. And he was like, because it's the best we've got for ALS right now. Wow. And so I was like, well, so why are you sending these patients? And he said, well, what am I gonna do? Tell them there's no hope. I tell them the truth. I say, look, there are some people down the, you know, down the road who have a bunch of treatments that they have said that their patients appreciate and they think maybe, you know, the patients feel better when they take them. I don't have any data on those. We don't know what they do or don't do for ALS. But if you are interested in pursuing those treatments, you can go down there. Yeah. I don't know, it's just such a wise, to me, like, you know, I would have been like, nope, down the road, stupid. You know, like Rick was just like, why, you know, it's like, he understands something about how hope works and how you can be honest without, you know, allowing people to kind of, I don't know, a space to be hopeful without being dishonest, right? You don't have to be John of God to give people hope. Also, the placebo effect, one of the most powerful effects in medicine, the placebo effect causes all kinds of weird shit to happen to people. This is documented and it's not always good. Like, you know, what my friend is is like, I was just telling me that there's one of the cases, somebody, I don't know how, oh yeah, someone's in a trial, a clinical trial. They have been given the placebo medication. They fuck up the dosage. They end up eating way, way more than they were supposed to. And they realized- So many sugar pills, so many sugar pills. They ate too many fucking sugar pills, but they don't know it's sugar. They think, and there's all these warnings on the thing, because you know, if you're gonna do a clinical trial, let's say identical, everything. So this person goes into the fucking hospital, like having seizures, a complete fucking wreck, because he thinks he's overdosing, he's poisoned, and they're like, you ate sugar. That was sugar. It doesn't, the placebo effect doesn't just work towards the spontaneous remission thing. They call it the nocebo effect. I saw this when I was writing my first book on gluten, and I was looking at a trial of gluten. And in the blinded arm, in which there was no gluten, a couple of people dropped out of the trial because their reactions were so severe. That. So when your friend is like, go down the hall, you know, he's basically saying, look, placebo effect, it might work for you. It's, you know, it is a very powerful thing that we don't understand. And that's why- Especially for pain. Or nausea, or, you know, kind of chronic stuff. And this has always been like, when I think about my mom going to John of God, I always just think, well, placebo. Like if you put, you know, maybe he puts on enough of a show and it like, it like does something that we don't like, because if people spontaneously heal from cancer, just like watching Fox News or sitting in their house or whatever, then theoretically, purely, deeply, theoretically, maybe there is some way of theatrically convincing their immune system to work. Yeah. The thing is though, the thing with people like St. John, John of God. So again, this actually happened with Bedlak. So there was a guy who had cured a woman with late stage ALS, a healer who did these like hand things, you know, hold his hands over people and heal them. And Bedlak found out about this. You know, he'd been on the talk shows, right? You know, she had been on the talk shows with this healer guy. It was a very famous healer guy in the 80s and 90s. And Bedlak was like, well, her ALS was documented at UVA. It was documented at Duke. Like this was genuinely late stage ALS that completely remitted. You know what he did? He invited this guy to come to Duke to do a blinded trial. You think the guy came? Fuck no. Because at the end of the day, in my opinion, these healers are our charlatans. And it may be the case that through giving people hope, they can extend their life because if you don't want to live, you die sooner. And if you want to live and you have hope, you live longer. So maybe through that, they get people to live longer. Maybe their pain goes away, but these people are not curing ALS or cancer and they know it. And that is why they don't participate in these trials. If they really did, that guy would have been, if that guy really thought he was curing ALS through the mechanisms that he was talking about, he would have been at Bedlax Hospital the next day, being like, give me all your ALS patients, you know? Right. And that to me, I mean, I can't, who knows what goes on in the hearts of men. I don't know whether Dr. Oz thinks Reiki works or whether John of God really thought he was curing people. You know, when your job depends on it, you can force yourself to believe almost anything. But that's where I kind of draw the line. Like that stuff is, that freaks me out, man. I don't want people out there doing that, you know, and then when they're called on it, being like, oh, I can't come to your trial because my curing ability only works when I'm like in my, you know, special chamber. Who what a thunk? Who what a thunk? Wow, that's shocking. Wow, it's got to be secret, you know? Alan, thank you so much for coming on the show. Can you tell people where they can find you?

It's the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle, the Dunkin' Tristle. Lama Rod, welcome to the DTFH. It's really nice to meet you. Yeah, thank you for inviting me. Why don't we start off with a real basic question, one that I realized I haven't asked any of my teachers, even the teachers in the tradition that you're in. What is crazy wisdom? I don't think anyone really knows, and I think we keep it ambiguous for a reason to like, just to say anything that we do is like skillful and in line with Dharma. But I think it's exactly that. I think it's a lot of things, right? But I think when we talk about crazy wisdom, it's just this wisdom that's so precise, that it's so disrupting, you know that it seems like completely out there, right? It seems like it's out there because we're so tied into like being stable and permanent and predictable, which is really not the nature of things, right? So when someone comes along and kind of like throws something at us that disrupts us, it feels really aggressive and really like out there. When in fact, it's something that's trying to get us aligned with the reality of things. What's in your own life, what is an example of when someone has done that to you? Yeah, like a really good example is when I moved to my monastery and they told me to open up a cafe. What? Yeah, that's, you know, it gets, it really gets like that. And- Ah, that's so wild, that's the last, that is literally of all the things I expected you to say, I couldn't have guessed that in a million years. Open a cafe where? In your, at the monastery or where? Yeah, well, the monastery owned kind of a cafe property. It wasn't being used, it was closed. They wanted to get rid of it, you know, and they knew that I had a background, you know, and food service and so my teacher asked me to head up a team of people to get it going again so they could like get rid of it. Right? So I'm preparing to enter into long retreat, three year retreat, and I'm having to run a cafe. And of course, one of the monastics one day was like, do you understand why this is happening? Right? Like, and I was like, no, absolutely not, you know? But looking back at really, there was a lot of benefit. I got a lot out of the experience before kind of giving up everything and going, you know, into silent retreats, you know, but it was something that really helped me to work through a lot of stuff, you know, that I couldn't have ever imagined. You were silent for three years? Yep. Three years. For me, I'm an introvert. So that was like a dream come true, right? Like, you know, just put me away, close to me, tell me to be quiet, you know, of course, yeah. Absolutely. Wow. But come on, I mean, no matter how introverted you may be, human language on a daily basis, expressing yourself through words, it seems like to remove that for me for 10 minutes, I'm so yappy, but for three years seems, I can't imagine, can you describe what I was like? Well, and I think speech is just one way that we're communicating with ourselves or with others around us. And I think that being in a situation where you can't, you know, have this kind of communication with others, the attention and the energy that you invested in maintaining external relationships through communication actually is inverted. Like you turn that attention and energy inside and you begin to understand how you have been communicating with yourself or not ever communicating with yourself. Oh, right. So you have to understand that silence isn't silence, right? Like we say silence, sometimes we think, oh, silence is the absence of noise, but in silence, sitting in meditation, it is very active, your mind, our minds are quite busy, right? So I didn't long for interaction with others because I had a whole bunch of drama happening in my own mind that was sometimes quite entertaining, other times very frustrating. I bet, you were cloistered, are you saying that you spent most of this time by yourself? Was there any kind of interaction with other monastics or? Yeah, it was a small group of us, it was about four of us, eventually with a caretaker who was responsible for cooking and shopping and doing things for us on our behalf in the outside world. Most of our time was spent alone in our private space, our private rooms, doing practice. We had breaks and periods of interaction because you're living in a cloister, you're living in a small community, so there are things that had to be done, you had to do house cleaning, you had to wash clothes, you have to eat, you know. Some periods of the retreat, we could actually talk to one another, but then there were long periods where we couldn't say a word to one another. What is the preparation for entering into that kind of retreat look like? You know, in my case, I don't think I prepared at all. Some people really, really train to prepare. Some of that training could look like working with the language, this is a Tibetan tradition, so learning Tibetan, getting proficient in some of the core practices that you would be exploring. Sometimes the training looks like learning how to be in silence for long periods of time. Ideally, you would do that training, right? But for me, I just knew that I wanted to do it, I knew that I had to do it, you know, and I had to do it to save my life, really, because I felt like I was out of control emotionally and mentally, right? And so my training was really simply moving to the monastery and being in with the community, you know, doing the basics of learning the language, right? And just learning how to kind of shut my life down. It's like you're just dimming your life in the outside world down, like you're dimming a light to be able to kind of transition into this really radical way of being. Being still, being silent, being introspective, contemplative. So, okay, I get the preparation, learning a language, understanding the tradition, but I mean just like the basic cell phone bills, where you're living. Well, you give up all of that.

[""The Last Day of the Day""] So, okay, I get the preparation, learning a language, understanding the tradition, but I mean, just like the basic cell phone bills, where you're living. Well, you give up all of that. How do you do that? I mean, do you tell your friends? It's almost like you're preparing for your own death or something. Well, it is a death. It is a dying, right? Your old self is dying and you're preparing to give birth to a newer self, right? Yeah. And then what you're speaking to is the logistics, like the bills and the relationships and the house and the car and the insurance and money, right? Those are logistics that, for me, were quite simple. It was simple for me because I didn't have anything, right? Okay, yeah. It is more difficult for people who are older, more established, who do have the families and the mortgages and the car payments. It takes more time to wind those things down. But as a person in my 20s coming into this situation, I didn't have shit. I had some clothes, I had some CDs, right? I had a few lovers, you know? But that was like, I gladly got rid of that, you know? Did you break some hearts? Did you break some hearts? I did, well, I broke some hearts and I disappointed a lot of people, you know? Because as, you know, I think it's quite natural to assume that when your friend or your family member tells you that they're going into a three-year retreat and they'll be shaving their heads and wearing a burgundy dress and you can't visit at all. You know? That is natural to assume that that loved one is joining a cult. Right. Right, you know? 100%. And so that's what you have to kind of hold as well. Yeah. Like when people are coming to you and saying, I'm really concerned that you're doing something really dangerous and really extreme and you have to look at them and say, I know exactly what I'm doing and I'm gonna do this and I'll see you in three years, you know? Yeah. That's no different than what someone else in a cult would say. I know. And you know that, like you know that, you know what the optics are and, right? You know that you have to do this because you know what it really is. Right. You know, it's not brainwashing, it's actually healing. Right. And beginning to understand who you are. That's more of a Western problem, right? I mean, in the East, if people say they're going on a three-year retreat, it's a little less dramatic probably, at least in some cultures. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the practice of spirituality in countries and cultures that center spiritual practice. Like we center religious practice. Right. In the West, particularly in this country, it's religion. It's dogma. It's ritual. It's ceremony, right? Yeah. But spirituality is a deeper engagement with self, with our minds, with our bodies, right? It is a relationship that we're developing with the unseen world. Right. Right. And energy, right? We're getting to the essence of who we are. So that goes beyond ritual, ceremony, a dogma. It gets into an experience of who we are. Right. This is, and there's a little bit of, I don't know what you'd call it, illiteracy when it comes to even the difference between those two things in the West, adding to the cult, the feeling. And also, we have, I don't know, there's cults everywhere, but we have some pretty rotten examples of what you're talking about being actually toxic and dangerous. Did you ever think to yourself though, during these conversations, holy shit, am I joining a cult? No, not at all. I'll tell you the truth though, on the other end of it, I completely recognize that there were many aspects of cults, thinking and culture that was quite evident and present. Like what? You know, like the allegiance to a charismatic leader. Yep. Basically, right, that defines many cults, right? Sure. And the way that we're taught to have this kind of devotion and unquestioning, unquestioning devotion to this leader, right? But isn't the idea that sometimes that you need to, if I'm, I don't know, if I'm getting work done on my house, I need to have a kind of trust in the person doing the work. I don't know anything about putting up drywall. So if I'm sitting there being like, are you sure? That seems weird to me, I've never done this before, or a doctor, or a guide through a forest or something like that. Isn't that what Lama means, guide? Like is an idea, like you need to have this unquestioning trust for this process to be effective. Well, you know, I think there's a couple of things. I think when you talk about, I'll start with this, this understanding of Lama. Lama is just a Tibetan word for guru, right? You know, but guru and Lama actually doesn't mean teacher. Actually, it means one who's deepened in spiritual awareness through deepening realization, right? You know, who shares that realization, but the first meaning is a gravitas, like a heaviness of spiritual realization, you know? And that's why I have to start. Like I can't stay in this space of being a teacher. I have to always come back to the practice of deepening, you know, but as to the devotion, right? Yes, trust, the heart of devotion is trusting. Like I have to trust the guide to get me from point A to point B, but I also have to retain a level of agency where at any point I can say what the hell is going on. Right, yeah. And I think a good teacher can hold doubt and feedback and critique and pushback, right? And I think the best teacher can actually practice a profound transparency and to say, you know what? Yeah, this is what's happening. Right, yeah. No, see, because to me, this is where crazy wisdom can become problematic and that if it falls into the wrong hands, somebody could be exploiting you, doing rotten things and say, well, look, you just don't understand. You see, you're so locked into your old life that you don't realize that part of crazy wisdom is me giving you lavender baths with a bok ag in your mouth or whatever it may be, you know? And then that's where it becomes really difficult to like, I get weird, I'm weird enough to think, you know what, I kind of can see how that would be. Right. That would help me. It's real sweet because like what we're looking for is for someone to do the work for us. I just want to like give everything over to you and you're going to set me free, right? It's like, if I vote for you, you get me free, right? Yes. If I give you enough money, right? You're going to get me free. I can buy my way to heaven, right? That'd be great. You know, I know, wouldn't it? Right, you know, but like no one can get us free except for ourselves. It's through our individual labor with the support of communities and others around us that we get free. So when I'm entering into a relationship with a teacher, I retain a level of agency, you know, self-awareness, right? Sure. The choice to do what I feel like I need to do because I need to retain that agency to do my own work. Right. You know, and the problem is for a lot of Westerners, we enter, we don't actually understand what devotion is. We think devotion is someone else doing work for us. Devotion is trusting someone to show us what the work is. Then we go and do the work. Right. And it's the work that begins to direct us to what's next. Okay. So I don't rely on the teacher to keep telling me what to do. Like I rely on my experience of practice, which is deepening my clarity and care for myself and others. That becomes the teacher ultimately. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. I love that. But hey, what does freedom mean to you? How do you define freedom? Yeah. I'm actually writing about freedom right now in my book, my next book, New Saints, coming out next year. Freedom, you know, freedom is for me choice. Choice, like to, and relatively, freedom is having access to the resources that I need to be well, safe and happy. Yeah. You know, ultimately, freedom is the recognition of the illusion of the relative, you know? Yeah. Right. Yes. It's moving beyond binaries. Right. Up and down, black and white, left and right, and beginning to actually tune into and develop a relationship to this inherent, like, emptiness, space, and fundamental energy. Fundamental energy. I've heard it called fundamental goodness. Yeah. I like fundamental energy. That's a little more neutral or something. I don't know what goodness is really. I don't really get that. But you've heard that term before. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, basic goodness, fundamental goodness. You know, I'm very interested in the most direct understanding of something, the most direct definition of something. I don't know, like when I say fundamental goodness, then I have to define what goodness is. Right. You know? But when I talk about energy, fundamental energy, energy, right? You know, there are different qualities of energy, different kinds of energy. There's energy that's aware of itself, and we call that consciousness. Yes. You know? There's energies that create energies that bind energies that destroy or disperse, right? I'm just trying to get to that. Right. And I'm trying to understand that that's fundamentally what I am. Right. Yeah, I like the distinction that comes up in Buddhism between absolute and relative reality. And I like the, that's a very useful, that's very liberating to me in the sense that I am so hypnotized. So hypnotized by relative reality in the most, and it's terrifying when you realize that you have become sort of, I don't know, stuck on a kind of planet that doesn't really exist, but you're in this gravity field of something. Why are we in this situation in the first place? Like, do you have any explanation for what got us here? Well, you know, that's complex, you know? But let me give it a try. Thank you. Wow! You know, I just think that with anything, like think, well, think of it like this. Imagine a stream, like a stream moving through the woods, right? And when you look at certain streams, you see certain, you know, obstacles or like things like blocking the flow of the stream. Yeah. You know, like beavers will come and do dams and like there'll be rocks and so forth and so on. So think of consciousness as just the stream, right? And then there are things that arise in the stream, then the stream kind of gets kind of split, you know? That is how we fall into this situation. Our consciousness got snagged on something and that snag was a thought. And that thought took us out of the grand consciousness, you know? And then that started creating different streams of reality. And it took us away from the larger stream into these minor streams. And then we started believing that these smaller streams were, was it? Yeah. You know? And what we're trying to do is get back. We're trying to rejoin the grand larger stream, you know, which is the grand consciousness. It's, is this a mistake? Is this an accident? Is this like some kind of cosmic version of a bird getting stuck in something in the woods? Or is it, you know what I mean? Is this just a mistake? It was, yeah, it was a mistake, right? And the mistake was intensified when we forgot that this was all just an illusion to begin with. Right. We started, we started getting too curious about the snag. Yeah. You know, as we do in our normal lives, how we create a whole bunch of shit out of nothing. Yeah. This is what's happened. We have to unpack the shit to get back to the experience of the illusion. Yeah. Yeah. And this is suffering is basically what we're talking about here. This is a natural byproduct of this interrupted stream is this what most people, varying forms of suffering. Yeah. Various forms of suffering, which is this thought that there is something that is suffering that can experience suffering. God, it's so crazy. It's such a wild. It's so wild, you know, to get close to it like that. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Babel. My loves, I cannot tell you how excited I am to take my family to Paris. I want to do it.

Thank you, Babel. [""Babel, Babel, B-A-B-E-L.com""] It's so wild, you know, to get close to it like that. Because you're, you know, you're especially unaided by any psychedelics or anything. You know, sometimes I would take just the right amount of LSD. You know, I can get him like, oh my God, I'm not real. But even then, you're saying an I. But yeah, so this problem or whatever we want to call it, this issue that we find ourselves completely entangled and snared, wrapped up in illusion. How does that square with the idea that everything's perfect, crazy wisdom, this is all part of the dharma, that's all a teaching? You know, how does one negate the other or how do these two possibilities coexist? Yeah, well, I think the perfect text that speaks to this is the heart sutra, you know, which is the text, the sermon the Buddha gave, you know, on an India, you know, it's called the heart attack sutra, you know, because when he, you know, started teaching it, people just started like falling out and dying and having heart attacks because it was so intense. Do you believe that, do you believe that really happened? Not really, but what I do believe with, you know, when people, when beings are awakened, they emit, they radiate a certain kind of energy that's hard to hold and when they are really open, you know, and just really like pouring it on, I think it's hard to manage. So when you have this being who's just sitting there going like, oh yeah, you know, there's the absolutes and there's the relative and both of them are true and they're even truer when you have to practice them together at the same time. You know, that's, I can feel, I can feel like the tension when I get close to trying to like practice the absolutes and the relative together at the same moment. How do you do that? Yeah, you know, and that's what we're trying to do. Like we're trying, you're not negating anything. You're just saying that both of these things are true at the very same time in the very same moment. And how do I live a life that incorporates both at the same time, knowing that I can't intellectually figure this out, that this is only an experience and this experience is intended to deeply disrupt me. Which, the experience of relative reality or the experience of trying to open up or wake up? Well, the experience of waking up by holding both the absolute and the relative together. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, is there a way to not hold it together though? Isn't that kind of the problem? Is that, I mean, isn't it some form of crucifixion we're dealing with here? Right? We're kind of like, how do we get off the ride really? You know, so, and is it that it's so weirdly, at least initially unbearable to recognize the absolute while being wrapped up in the gears of the relative that we kind of burrow into the relative just to evade that, the reality that's already there? It could be, that's definitely possible, but the other intent is to short circuit that analytical mind that's always trying to make everything make sense. You know, because none of this makes sense. That's what the harsh sutra is telling us. This doesn't make sense. This is like ridiculous. Would you mind saying some of the heart sutra for folks who might not be familiar with it? Well, you know, I think the core teaching of the heart sutra is form is emptiness. Emptiness is form. Form is no other than emptiness. Emptiness is no other than form. So what it's setting up is this kind of puzzle or this kind of mind training that says that like, if you're an extremist, then you're actually not practicing the truth. So if you're living completely in the absolute, but you're living in the relative, then you're not actually practicing the teaching. Or if you're living in the relative and with no view of the absolute, then you're still not doing the teaching. That when you're in the relative, you have to understand this is also the absolute. This just so you know, sorry to cut you off, please continue, I apologize, that was rude. Oh, go ahead, go ahead. This heart sutra, by the way, my arm's going numb. This is your fault. This heart sutra, I did a, forget three year retreat, I did a weekend retreat here in Asheville, North Carolina, years and years and years ago when I was in college, sitting, staring at a wall, then they start doing the heart sutra. I wasn't prepared, I didn't even know the heart sutra existed and they're like, you know, in that kind of monotone no life, no death. I left, I went to get a beer. I'm like, I'm out of here, I can't deal with this, it's too much and I split. So I understand, I go back and forth on the heart attack, but I kind of think it did happen maybe. But then I'm like, no way that's possible. I kind of think like, if you're that tuned into someone and they blow your whole game up, you could just give up your body or something. Well, if you get the rug pulled from under you too quickly, it's hard to maintain relationships with the ego, because nowhere in Buddhism are we being asked to erase anything. You're always being asked to realize the illusion of everything. So when you have, this is a part of cult mentality. Like when a cult says that like you have to erase thoughts, you know, you have to erase the sense of self, that's brainwashing. Right. But in Dharma, we're saying, no, you're not trying to get rid of anything. We're just trying to understand that like all this stuff is just an illusion. So you have choice to choose something different than just buying in to what you think is real. Right. It's something maybe for some people that sounds like bad news. What do you mean this is all an illusion? My mom, my dad, my kids, my body, what? But the more you work with it, the more you're like, oh, it's the best news ever. What do you want to be frozen permanently in some kind of static thing forever? Well, it's like being in the relative with no understanding of absolute. It's like living your life in a coffin, you know? And then someone comes along, flips the lid open and you're terrified because all you know is the coffin. All you know is this really tight space. Because it's all about comfort and familiarity. Like this is what I know, I know confinement. I know the carceral state. Yes. Right, I get that. Everything is defined for me. I don't have to work, you know? Right. Like what I get and what I'm offered is what I take. But when we start talking about freedom, it's like I have to transcend comfort and I also have to transcend discomfort, you know? This is why I don't like the term like fundamental goodness because we have to transcend goodness as well to get free. All concepts have to be transcended. My teacher said something that told me once, I think everything might be neutral Duncan and I really hated it. I was like, don't say it, just don't ever say that again. I don't want to hear that ever again. And it's hard to hear that when you're having fun. Like when you like love shit, like, you know? But when you're told that like, no, actually, like your enjoyment and pleasure is a very small, finite thing compared to what actual liberation is. Yeah. You know? Like we can't fathom it. This is why we struggle to understand all kinds of liberation from social liberation to ultimate liberation because we can't fathom what it means to be free because we've never been free. Like, how do you, how do you even get there? Right? And again, it comes back to the heart suture for me. It's just like, it's not something I can think about. It's something that I sit and experience. All right. Yeah, right. You can't think your way out of this damn coffin, huh? Yeah. You have to come back to this really basic sensation, this basic awareness and knowing like this is what this is. Like, oh yeah. Like my, you know, my back hurts, right? Yeah. What is that? And stop thinking about it, just experience it. Yeah, right, right, right. And the experience opens to the freedom. Okay, okay. So the story, right? This is the story or add-ons as they call it or the poison arrow. Okay, I love that you brought this up. I've been thinking about it quite a bit lately. Yeah, dropping the story. And I've been working with that when I've, you know, it's amazing how if I do that, I'm suddenly having the best day ever. Or a great day or at least a day unencumbered by whatever my particular neurosis in that moment is. But this is what I've been worried about. Isn't that sociopathic? Like, if I, you know what I mean? If I'm feeling bad because I acted out or if I'm feeling bad because I was, I don't know, angry or whatever. And then I dropped that story. And I, and successfully. So suddenly it's like, no, I'm just, you're in this moment in this place. Isn't that what sociopaths do to not feel bad about doing things that you shouldn't do? Well, I think there's a, you have to understand that what we're also working with is space. And so like, I'm not trying to drop anything. I'm just trying to allow space to hold everything. So I stay in relationship. But if I feel bad, like I do, you know, this happens all the time for me. Like I do something stupid, really fucked up. And I'm sitting with the guilt, the shame, whatever it is. I'm not trying to get rid of that. I'm just trying to suffer less. Right. You know, because that shame or really whatever, the discomfort in that moment is actually teaching me something that I need to pay attention to. So if I try to get rid of it, I'm losing a teaching and a lesson. But what I'm doing is saying, like, oh, like there's more happening than this shame or guilt from doing something really messed up. Right. You know, and that's a kind of care that I offer myself because that's going to help me really like stay in a relationship to this discomfort, right? Because that relationship is helping me to understand how to be in relationship with myself and how to be in a relationship with others. You know. Okay. So basic question. I'm sorry. Yeah. So when in Buddhism, when they talk about the end of suffering, they don't mean the end of discomfort. When we talk about the end of all, absolutely on the absolute level, it is the exhaustion of suffering. On the relative level, when we talk about the exhaustion of suffering, it actually means the awakening of space and the realization that the nature of suffering is an expression of space, emptiness, and energy. It doesn't go away. Wait, wait. The expression, wait. Can you please say that one more time? The expression of suffering, discomfort, is like all phenomena. It's the same essence. It's space, it's emptiness, it's energy, right? But we have an ego, the sense of self that's labeling the experience and making it to a story that's really centering us. This good, this bad, this, this is happening to me. This is my suffering. Why am I suffering? Why am I doing this? You know. Okay. Okay. But on the relative, like we're not trying to like, like we're not trying to like completely erase suffering because we won't necessarily, like, but we're just trying to understand what suffering is. You're talking about the basic fundamental energy. It's like, you're not gonna erase that. That's here, that's this, but you're putting these labels on it that are causing all kinds of issues. Exactly. Well, I'm enlightened now. Thanks, I don't need to, I'm just kidding. I want to ask you, I've always wondered what Buddhist, what in general, and I know there's many lineages of Buddhism, but what their take is on gayness and being gay. And so I was excited to talk to you because you're a llama and you're gay. And so can you, for folks listening, what is the Buddhist stance or is there a Buddhist stance as opposed to like fundamentalist Christianity, their bigots, they think God doesn't like gay people or a lot of world religions have like completely, what's the word for it? Somehow managed to turn being like homophobic into an aspect of their religion. So what's Buddhist, how does Buddhism look at it? Yeah, well, I think you have to think about it in two ways. I think there's cultural, you know, Buddhist practice and then there's ultimate Buddhist practice. Ultimately, you know, and this is, you know, from definitely from my perspective, like it doesn't matter. Yeah. You know, this isn't, you know, a sin, it's not, you know, a hindrance, right? You know, because in Buddhism, it's not what we're doing is why we're doing it. You know, what's the intention, right? If the intention is about love, compassion, liberation. Yeah. Right? You know, that's what we're concerned with, you know? That's the heart of Buddhadharma and ethics. It's like, why are we doing this? And is it aligned with liberation? Right. And of course, to be aligned with liberation means that you're also centering love and compassion and wisdom. You know, so, but when you start talking about any cultural practice of a spiritual path or religion, then you're getting into these systems that conflate spiritual practice with, you know, the functionality of culture and civilizations, right? You know, how gayness or queerness doesn't function in a culture because ultimately what cultures are interested in is reproduction. Yeah. You know, but also, you know, because of the intense kinds of patriarchy, right? That we've been really struggling with for thousands and thousands of years, right? Patriarchy is about rigidity. It's about compartmentalizing. Yeah. You know, just saying to like, this is this and that is that, right? And when there's a kind of blurring of the lines, right? That's seen as antagonistic to the culture because it becomes unclear, it becomes ambiguous and we can't survive an ambiguity. Oh, right, yeah. And it's hard for us to control other people if there's so much ambiguity. So if you have the power to define someone, their identity and force them to maintain that identification, then you can more easily control them. Right. Right. And this is all we're talking about is control and using violence to control. Keeping things rigid and clear and straightforward. Efficient. Yeah, you know. Yeah, it seems like it's antithetical to what we were just talking about that the ambiguity that this is something that's always frustrated me with working with my teachers. Just there's never like my ego or my identity really wants answers. Or my other teacher, Tejo Munic, who I first studied with, when I was working with her, she was just making me clean the temple. And finally I said, are you giving me a book or something and meditate? She goes, I meditate. And she was like, well, what was the Buddha doing when he achieved realization? And I was like, oh, right, the practice, meditating. There is no book, but man, we sure hate it. There's not me, me, you don't, I do. I don't like the ambiguity. I feel safer if like, okay, this is my practice. Now I'm on the path. Now I'm off the path. I'm playing Elden Ring till 2 a.m. This isn't Buddhism. What's wrong with me? I'm a dad. Why am I staying up so late playing video games? Okay, I'm meditating again. This is the path. I don't, that where the line gets blurry between those two things, I don't know. It, I lose control and it bugs the shit out of me. Yeah, I mean, that's how the ego maintains itself. It's through this level of control and clarity. Yeah. You know, this is that and this is this. Like this is me, this is you. And I want to do everything to maintain these lines because my ego depends on the external world to define itself. I don't know who I am. If I can't figure out who you are. And if I can't figure out who you are, then I get thrown into a tailspin where I get really confused and full of doubt. And because I don't have a practice to hold that ambiguity and doubt that I actually start reverting to violence against myself and against others because the ego is trying to firm itself up by any means necessary. Making enemies. That's a great way to firm up. Making enemies, making war, forcing people to be something that they're not, you know, because that's how I'm using that to define who I am. I bet you have helped so many gay people, so many people who thought that like, you didn't even understand that there was a way for Buddhism to work with their identity, whatever it may be. Well, you know, here's the thing for me. It's like, I didn't depend on Buddhism to tell me that I was okay. Right. Like I already figured that out. Like I figured out that like being queer, being gay was not an issue. The real issue was the culture of the society that I was living in that was telling me that I was wrong. Like I already figured that out. And so when I came into Dharma and people were like, oh, what does Buddhism say about, you know, queerness? I was like, I don't give a fuck what Buddhism says. So I felt queer is quite honestly, you know, like that's the furthest, you know, this is what I think because I am experiencing more freedom and fluidity than I've ever experienced in my life. And that is because of the fundamentals of practice that say nothing about sexuality and gender and identity. It says awareness, wisdom, love, compassion, you know, like the fundamentals. Yes, and I love that. That's a real way for me to not feel so guilty because I think most people aren't nefarious, you know, like if you look at why you're doing something generally, it's not like, I wanna fuck up the world or let me cause problems. It's usually that within it is some kind of sloppy, maybe sloppy, but legitimate attempt to bring peace to yourself or people around you. But in this lineage of Buddhism, people get confused, I guess I do too, because there isn't there an aspect of sexuality here, Tantra, this like not sort of relegating the sexual energy to some cabinet that you're not supposed to look in. Did you study that in Retreat or have you been taught anything about that? Well, I think part of maybe what you're alluding to is like Tantric sex, you know, or just like... The masculine, feminine, energies, merging. Well, they have nothing to do with physical relative gender. Like that's what we get real confused about. Like it doesn't, because I'm a cisgender male, it doesn't mean that like I don't have a lot of feminine energy, you know, advice first or what, you know, and so many things can be drawn from that, right, different kinds of combinations. But, you know, it's what we're again talking about is the nature of the mind and energy, right? And what we're trying to tap into is that fundamental energy again, you know, that definitely is a part of my body, right? And all my, you know, identities that I occupy, you know, but as I have this body and identities, I am not this body and identities, you know, I'm actually this energy, you know, and that's what I'm practicing with. Yes. And so we can, you know, often I get questions about tantric sex and the pairing of opposite energies. And I say, well, you know, once you evolve into higher levels of consciousness, you can shape energy, you know, to manifest in whatever ways needed in order to experience liberation in the moment. Right. You know, but you can skillfully use the pairing of opposite energies, you know, to get somewhere, but like, you don't have to stay there. No, I know. I mean, gosh, no, the anima, the anima stuff, masculine, feminine, energy, swirling, or listen to my voice, does it sound like a dude's in me? No, you know, I haven't once, when I call down an hotel, there hasn't been a single time where someone has been like, yes, Mr. Trussell, it's always, yes, Mr. Trussell, I just gave up like fine, I don't care, what am I gonna, I don't say, I just order wine. That's the thing, and that's like what we have to get to, is that like, it doesn't matter how you identify me, as long as like, you're not getting in the way of me getting free. Right, or am I getting my room service? Yeah, like, yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't, yeah, and also, but I like going back to your, like, why are you doing, what's the, if someone is like talking to you, what's, what is the reason, what's behind there, whatever, and you know, if there's aggression there, then I guess, you know, there is a reason to be defensive, right? Yeah, we have to, you know, listen, we have to like get serious about what our ethic in life is, like what are we actually trying to do in this life, you know, like you have to get clear, and my ethic is to reduce harm, right, against myself and against others, right, like to reduce that harm and understand what harm and violence is, you know, to understand the ways in which I may get in the way of other people getting access to resources that they need to be well happy and safe, like that's what I'm trying to do, and I'm trying to actually become a conduit to channel more resources that people need into the world, and to become more aware of the ways in which I block people getting what they need. How do you block people? You don't seem like you're blocking anybody from getting what they need. I mean, I just think there are like many ways that we can block people, you know, like we, and this is, you know, it can be largely unconscious, like sometimes like we have certain views and perspectives that actually get in the way of other people feeling safe and happy and free, you know? I think about so much of the legislation that's happening, which is a prime example of one group of people getting in the way of other people, you know? Like, you know, when we're passing legislation to censor how we're defining ourselves to legislate bodies, you know, of women and people who, you know, can bear children, right? You know, like you're getting in the way of people having access to what they need to be well and safe. Oh, you're killing people. I mean, this is, this is the, I'm sorry, and I'm not, obviously these are not, these are my opinions. This is the Christian right. They've been doing this for decades. This is a long-term plan. Our Roe v. Wade is just the beginning. They want a theocracy. I mean, that's, and a lot of the people right now, there's a lot of like people out there are like, well, it doesn't affect me or all the system. It's like, oh, you don't, you don't get it. You think they're stopping with that? They're not stopping. They've got an agenda, if you ask me, and that agenda is to dissolve the separation of church and state, implement Christian theocracy in the West, and then start some ridiculous crusade. I'm sorry, I'm just, it's, I can't believe we're watching this, I can't believe we're watching it happen. But yes. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, and it makes sense that it's happening, right? You know, and what we, you know, what we're having to understand is that what's happening now has nothing to do with freedom. It has everything to do with control and violence, right? Yeah. And I believe that this will not work. Like it's, it's working now, but like this is what we're going to experience are people like radically awakening and saying, what the fuck is happening? Right. Like, and it's going to be a violent shove for people when they wake up one day and say, what happened to this right that I used to have? And now it's gone and it's going to trigger the fuck out of a lot of people, you know? Yeah. And I believe, I totally believe that's going to happen. There's going to be a huge shift. And yeah, we're going to have to like really struggle to push through, but we're going to come out on the other end going, okay, let's do something different now because this didn't fucking work. I really hope you're right. I mean, I just, I, I, I'm pretty skeptic. I'm pretty pessimistic regarding, I mean, I just, I have a friend who explained, broke the whole thing down to me. I don't know if you, I used to, I went through a period of watching these like, they're these, they're these, we're getting a little off of Buddhism. I hope you don't mind, but it's a podcast who cares. So the, there's these movies. I don't know if you've seen them. My wife and I would watch them on a lark. God's not dead. Yeah. You know, so these movies are funded by mega churches and the money that these movies make is used to try to pass legislation that is into lobby and influence. And this is where, how we've gotten into this predicament is that we're supposed to have a separation of church and state in this country. It also protects religious people. You don't want the government coming into your house and being like, you can't teach that religion to your child. That's not the religion of the state. You want, you want it separated. But yeah, I don't, I'm very pessimistic about it because I think that people, I don't think it's an accident that this happened, right? As we're all kind of like wobbly from the pandemic and the, you know, it's a perfect time. We're all just a little confused and like, huh? I don't know, but I'm glad you think that. I think that too, because I don't see it as this kind of relative, I don't see it completely as this relative social struggle. I also see it as spiritual warfare. And spiritual warfare is happening on multiple levels in multiple worlds at once. So in this world, right? And this is in line with Buddhism, right? You know, in this world, there's an unseen world that's also struggling, you know? And the unseen world, the reality itself, the universe is an expression of, you know, to use this term light of goodness, right? Like it's on the side, like this, like we're not, we don't live in this reality that's expressing violence, but violence happens and harm happens because like we have misunderstood the nature of things, right? You know, and so on in the unseen world, and I talk about the unseen world being spirits and, you know, these wisdom beings who are actually working very hard, you know, to align themselves with what's happening in this world, right? So my experience of all of this right now is that there's tremendous help right now. There's a lot of positive energy flooding into this world right now to rebalance. But you, the system has to break down. You know, and this is systems theory here. It's like the system has to collapse for something new to happen. You can't reform a system that never worked to begin with. Right, right, right. So you scrap it. And of course that scrapping means that a lot of people are gonna have to suffer like we are now. Yeah. You know? But when the system collapse, then it's like we started asking, but what else now? Because we have been really damaged and hurt by this old system. Yeah. You know, yeah. And I, thank you for reminding me of that. I just, I get so constricted into, I watch the news too much and I just get so. It's hard. It's hard. And I have to tell people all the time, it's hard. Like you can't keep consuming the negativity, you know? We have to like consciously choose, you know, what the positive that's happening, right? And again, for me, for me, ancestor practice is really important. I, you know, I'm descendant of African enslaved people and as well as indigenous communities here in the South. And my ancestor survived slavery and genocide in all forms of violence, right? Yeah. And still maintained hope and joy. They still can maintain their connection to magic and practice and religion and spirituality, right? You know? Yeah. And I am a practitioner of liberation theology to I believe that God is on the side of those of us who are suffering the most who are the victims. Yeah. And I think that these oppressive structures that like we will balance out again, you know? But things have to like, you know, we have to just kind of break down, you know? You don't get a resurrection without a crucifixion, right? Exactly. You have to die. Yeah. To be born again. You know, of course mainstream Christianity, you know, really particularly evangelical Christianity, really just like they took that, that kind of rebirth, you know, language, you know? But like what I'm talking about in this sense is that like all this shit that's not helping us to get free actually has to die. But because we're so identified with this shit is going to feel like we're dying. Ah, right, right, right, right. It's like I don't know who I am. Like so therefore I don't know that I am not my identity. I'm not my beliefs, you know? And so when those begin to be challenged, then it feels like I, my fundamental being is being challenged. And you have to separate those experiences, you know? But unfortunately before you get to that realization, everything just has to crash. And then you begin to say, oh, you know what? I wasn't that belief. I wasn't that practice. Yeah. Like there's something deeper. There's a deeper experience of who I am that I'm trying to get to. And that's what we're moving towards is a social rebirth. And to a deeper relationship to who we are and what we are. What does that look like? How do you, what does that look like in the world? Like, how does that look? What is that? Or, you know, how could we expect this to show up in the world or how is it showing up? It's already showing up. I think there are people who are just learning how to be more concerned with people around them. That's the first step. It's like, how are people doing, you know? Like, how can I like start actually getting to know my neighbors and then like asking what they need and how can I actually offer what I have to others around me? That basic concern is the sign, right? You know, and then what are other signs? You know, there are people who two years ago had no idea what, you know, how violent you know, certain institutions like the police are. Right. And now they're like, oh, police historians and they're understanding violence. They're understanding oppression. They're understanding anti, you know, blackness and so forth. Like, there's a huge group of people who are now educated who are trying to use this knowledge to do something different. That is such an easy thing to forget that a few years ago, this stuff was, you couldn't find, you had to dig for it to find it unless you were someone who'd been right in the face of it. And now it's become a national conversation, global conversation. Yeah, this is our vocabulary now. Right, right, right. That's huge. Yeah, it's huge. It's super huge, right? But then like, of course, it can be challenged by all this other stuff that's happening now, you know? And it's like you have to maintain the perspective. Yes, there are things that are getting worse and there are things that are getting a lot better. Like you have, this is again, the heart sutra. Like all this stuff is happening at once, right? And I can't keep focusing on one thing over the other. Right, that's it, liberation theology. I love it, I love it. It's so, because it's the other one, it's so much louder, it's got costumes that are scary and bombs in the other side, it's like people like you, but it's somehow, I don't know, it takes some discipline, I guess, to tune into it, you know? Yeah, it's asking yourself what's really happening. Like get to the root, what's really happening? Is this person who's trying to legislate my right to be gay or my kids' right to be gay and trans? Like are they just evil? Or are they just really scared? Or are they really attached to this belief of reality? Are they bad people? Or are they just not aware of what they're doing? And scared and fearful and using that fear to hide away from allowing people to be free because they actually don't know how to be free themselves. Right. I think one of the things that I, in all this conversation around what people are doing, again, I just think that people are just terrified of what they don't know and understand because it will disrupt their sense of ego and sense of self, right? And they think that who they think they are in this moment is who they are, you know? And we haven't done the practice, right? To connect to this deeper sense or experience of who we are, you know? And that's what saved my life. Like this is why I went into a three-year retreat because I was like, I'm black, I'm queer, I'm all this stuff, but like this can't be the totality of who I am. Yeah. You know, because this sucks, you know? Living in an anti-queer, anti-black world. You know, it's just too much. Who am I? Like what is the nature of me, of I, right? Yeah. And now I can be in the world and not be consumed by the violence directed towards these identity locations that I occupy. I can be free. Like everyone has to do this labor, you know? Because I want to be free from my identities that are based on suffering as much as my identities that are based upon privilege. Right. I got to be free from both this privilege and privileged identities. Whoa. To let those go. Wow. That is wild, man. That is so wild. And that's where this idea of crazy wisdom becomes much, much more in focus. It's like once you start divesting from who you think you are or who the world or your culture is telling you who you are, then you excel into the space where you're not bound by the same restrictions other people around you are bound by. You're not playing by the same rules anymore because you realize there aren't any rules. Oh, shit. And that's freedom. Then we get so afraid when we see people doing that because they're reminding us that it is actually quite possible to live beyond these regulations but they're also reminding us of how easy these people can be the recipient of violence because they're living outside of the boundaries that we force ourselves to live in. So we get jealous and try to disrupt them. And this is, for me personally, a personal example is patriarchy, right? This is like patriarchy, anyarchy, right? But patriarchy survives because it retaliates against anyone who blurs, who transcends the set guidelines. You know? Wow, blurs. Patriarchy doesn't like the blur. No. You can't control the blur. That's like you can't dominate it, you know? And that's why patriarchy, there's this misogyny, right? Because patriarchy views femininity as this blur, as a fluidity, it's not there's something that can't be controlled. But regardless, we're going to control it anyway, you know? We're going to figure out any way that we can legislate, control, marginalize, oppress. Sinister, sinister, sinister. That's so dark. What's even more sinister is when we're participating in this kind of violence, and we don't even know it, because we just identify it as normal. So normal that we can't even name it anymore. Right, right, right, like born into the thing. So yeah, it's just this is like, this is the environment. This is what you're born into. It just makes sense, it's the way it is. Yeah, it's like this old story about the fish and the water. Like the fisherman asks the fish, how's the water? And the fish goes, what water? Right, and that's where we are. It's like, what patriot are you? This is who I am. That's the sinister part about it. This is who I am. But who I think I am is actually an expression of violence and oppression towards other groups of people. And we have to disrupt that and say, you know what? I have to figure out who I am, and I have to figure out my identities that are not expressions, that are not built on the oppression of others. You know, to me, an illustration of what you're talking about and also an illustration of, I think, how things are getting better, watch any comedy from the 80s. And look at the way being gay was the worst thing. Like it was like you just, gay kids are watching this and with their friends, maybe they haven't come out yet and they're thinking, my god. I'm that that is being completely rejected in a comedy as a form of healthy, masculine behavior. Now that would never happen. That's never coming out in a movie, ever. No movie, it's not getting made. But we have come a long way, but that's what I came up in. I didn't come up in any kind of open. There was no conversation about being gay, being something that was healthy or normal or just like anything else. Like if I seemed slightly gay to my dad, he would get pissed, ride a real wheel, like, you're not gay. Are you gay? What's? Man, yeah, it's like, I just don't know. I think that's one of the good things about some, like I'm almost 50. People coming up now, I don't think they realize how baked in it was. But this is why, also, I'm so optimistic because we have so many young people who are growing up in a context where they have access to all this information and examples, like for me, growing up before the internet. I didn't use the internet until I was 18 in the college. Until then, I only had what was on TV or what I could find a book on in the library or a magazine. But now, young people just can pick up their phones and have access to any information that they want. And I think this is, of course, it can be quite negative, but the positive part of this is that they have this information and they can choose. They have choices now because they see other people. They see other ways of being, other ways of doing and expressing themselves. And this is why the younger generation is the generation that's going to really free us. And this is, again, also why I'm passing positive about this because this is the future, like this is the wave, like this wave of fluidity and openness and questioning and doubting structures of violence. That's what's coming. And what we're experiencing now, I believe, is the last shouts. It's like the last bit of organizing. Like we're going to do everything that we can to solidify this regiment, right? But it's not going to hold up. Fingers crossed on that one. Fingers crossed. I'm not a llama, didn't spend three years in retreat, so I'm still plagued by fear and doubt. But I think these kinds of conversations remind me, throw cold water on my face, and make me feel connected again. So thank you so much for the time that you've given me and for being so open with me. And truly, this is a remarkable conversation. I'm very grateful to you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

I gotta address something right now and it's a little uncomfortable but I gotta say it. I'm being harassed by record labels and you guys need to lay off. Every single major record label has been contacting me offering me multi-million dollar deals and my assistant doesn't have time to deal with your constant offers and gifts and the many things you've been sending us. Thank you, but no thank you. I get it, I'm a talented musician and if I knew I was gonna get harassed by record labels I would never have played this song when I opened for Paul Simon at the Hollywood Bowl. I can play guitar, chords. That was a cover of Taylor Swift's I Can Play Guitar Chords which is from her new album 9891 which is basically her just singing John Mayer songs backwards. The original John Mayer song goes more like chords guitar play can I Record labels I really appreciate your enthusiasm but right now I'm just doing private modular synth noise shows for my four dogs Piper, Palmer, Gatsby and Fox. I've learned to make any sound I wish on these beautiful machines. I did not heed the admonishment of my music teacher who told me you will never be able to make the sound of a spaceship traveling at light speed ejecting a bubbling plasmatic beast into a tuba being sucked into a black hole. Here's my answer to you Mr. Smith. Hopefully you can download podcasts and help. I present to you the sound of a plasmatic beast being shot out of a spaceship traveling at white speed into a tuba being sucked into a black hole. Oh shit, damn it. Shit, sorry, still learning these things. That was not a recently plasmated bubbling beast being shot out of a spaceship traveling at light speed into a tuba being sucked into a black hole. That was the sound of Jesus telling Peter that he was going to say he didn't know. The denial of Christ is the thing we all do when instead of expressing love or saying that we're happy or putting out into the universe some sweetness or forgiveness or grace or compassion or mercy we choose to be sullen or unhappy or angry. Usually not because we fear arrest but because we're trying to impress our coolest, most miserable friends by mirroring their confusion. Alright, it's like two knobs to the left I think in a couple of switches and I can get that sound of that beast getting shot into that fucking tuba into that black hole thing. And as I get this synth warmed up put a couple more coals into the attenuverters and guys, don't get my musical ability confused with natural talent. Sure, when you hear that kind of singing and guitar playing that you just heard you might think, I can never be that good. That's like insane, that's just talent. That's some kind of genetic thing, no. That's years and years and years. Literally 27 years of practice to learn how to play those two chords. Don't let anyone stand in the way of your dreams. Okay, down that end. Okay. Almost. Let me just spin this attenuverter. And that is how it's done, friends. An identical sonic representation of a sound we all have become so incredibly familiar with in these days of unregulated spaceship ejections. Let me just reiterate something. That was not a recording of the actual sound. That was completely done with synthesizers. So this can be done. You can learn to do these things. Years and years and years of practice, but don't let anybody stand in your way. My sweet loves, we have got a glorious podcast for you today with Danielli Bielelli. We're going to jump right into it, but first some very quick business. Look at that man's rotten mouth. All his teeth are falling out. Little drops of blood because his gums are bleeding.

We're going to do a joint podcast here. So I guess this is all for today. Thank you. Thank you for watching. Welcome to the DTFH. Welcome to the DTFH. Thank you. Welcome to the DTFH. Welcome to the DTFH. So I guess this is also an episode of the Drunken Taoist. Yes man, let's make it happen. How many times by now, we have had so many podcasts together, this is one. So many. Yeah, it's so great. And we've become like recorded friends. Our friendship is mostly recorded. We've had more recorded conversations than we've had unrecorded conversations. That is a fact. We live in a kind of Orwellian, we've put ourselves in an Orwellian police state where we record everything that we say. I know, and when we start, when we meet up and we start chatting, it is like, oh, that's great. Wait, stop, shut up. Let me press the mic. Okay, let's go. Record. Record, otherwise it's not a real conversation. Yeah, that's so interesting, isn't it? How much things these days are being recorded versus in the past? We're living in an age where every transaction, every movement, every conversation is probably being recorded. Yeah. Even though some people don't realize just how much they're being surveilled. There's a presence of it somewhere that keeps living long after your conversation is done in the live version. It's still somewhere out there. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I was looking up Alexa, I have an Amazon Echo. Yeah. And I found on a conspiracy website and checked the history of your Amazon Echo and see all the things you've told it to do. Yeah. But not only that, it actually records random snippets of conversation accidentally. That's creepy. Yeah, it's creepy and you can listen. Since you've owned your Echo, you can go back and check out all the different dialogues you've had, that's pretty wild. Tiny little snippets, you can change things happening at part. I didn't take the time to go through and listen to every single snippet because there's so many of them. But those snippets are not being held at your house inside the Echo. Those snippets are in the cloud. They are flying somewhere out there. Yeah, man, that's pretty creepy. Well, one thing that's different from any other generation in history is that so many of us will be in a position where your grandkids are in the mood for it. They have hours and hours and hours of material to listen to you talk. Long after you're gone and also when you are the old man on the mountain, they can still say hey, I remember when you said that thing. That's pretty funny right there. This actually produces what's going to become one of the great ethical problems of the future. It's the problem we're having now. The recent thing that happened where people started taking down Civil War statues. These people were criminals. They're racists. We have to take down their statues. Let's wipe them from the history books because we don't want to admit we don't want to honor them with a statue. And so that seems to be related to an evolving consciousness where people are... becoming less and less palatable. Not that it was ever really palatable but it's just becoming an aberration. I think in the past it was. It was kind of like, what do you mean you don't like you're not pro-slavery? What the hell is wrong with you? Can you believe that our neighbor is not pro-slavery? Fuck that guy. We're not having him for dinner no more. So if you listen to some people if your ancestors did have a podcast some of the conversations the podcast might very naturally be talking about like slave problems. Yeah, you know these damn slaves are not doing their work. Can you believe how much last week my shoulder popped up because I was whipping this damn lazy slave over and over? They would be saying slave. But they'd be saying the great reviled word that used to be just a very common word and it would be... potentially there would be like a waste on ways to like keep your slaves... Yes, maximize the work output you can get out of your slaves. So you'd listen to that your ancestors and you would probably be horrified by what they were saying in a nonchalant way because they were on some level completely unaware that what they were doing was fucked up. Yeah, because to them in perfect sense. What do you mean you don't whip your slaves? What's wrong with you? Don't you know they get all weird and upbeat if you don't whip them sometime? So theoretically now some of the things that we've talked about that to us seem absolutely normal could potentially at some point in the future be an abomination. Sure. I don't know what that might be. I mean it could be something as simple as like it could be something as simple as I mean I guess imagine like if there were podcasts during World War II in Germany and there were some Nazis who had a podcast or something like that. You know, it would be they could be hung for some of the things they were saying. Of course. So that's the thing. That's the weird thing about these thumb prints that we're leaving behind of our lives is that we don't really know where this technology is going to go and we don't know what the consciousness is going to be 50 years from now. Because that's a funny thing. It's like everybody and their grandmother is convinced that everyone else was a product of their time but I actually have gained all the experience from all those time and my conclusions are actually just the correct ones. They're not subject to time or place. They are correct in all times and places. It's just everyone else who was trapped in that strange game. Yeah, that's right. No, this is when we're waking up from the dream. At this point we're waking up from the dream of superstition. At this point we're waking up from the primitive times. We've done it. Those times are fucking crazy but these times, no, no, no, now we're really on the straight and narrow here. Exactly. What was it? Jefferson Airplane Song? The Crown of Creation? That idea, right? We, all that shit that came before led to this moment. To us right now, we got it. This is the end point. That's it, yeah. Yeah, probably not. Yeah, I don't... This is why I just keep falling more and more in love with Buddhism because that is a philosophy that to me it transcends culture it infects culture that it uses cultural symbolism to try to convey a kind of unchanging unwavering truth about human existence. You know, and I love that because it is that to me, that is real. There is something that is not, that as of yet has not changed. Now, could it change potentially? But as of yet it hasn't changed. Which is that you know, life is to put it in a probably wrong way. I just had it explained in a different way. But life is suffering. But actually the term I've just had this explained by David Nicktern who's been teaching me meditation that the term is not so much suffering as much as life is kind of out of balance. Life is a human life is kind of like the way he put it is like if you're maybe, I don't know, riding your car and one of the wheels is a little flat. It's wobbly. It's off a little bit. Human existence is a little wobbly. That's interesting because the way I always look at that statement I wasn't changing the suffering part. I was changing the world that preceded. So rather than life is suffering in my mind was like life inevitably involves a lot of suffering. Like there's no escaping it, right? That doesn't mean that all of life is suffering. It just means that there's a shitload of it out there and you're going to run into it. Well first of all the thing is it isn't even a life is suffering it's dukkha is what it's called. So it's not even like a bunch of words jammed together. It's just like there's we're wobbly. We're wobbly here. We go from one extreme to the next and we're kind of like if you sort of really look at your life you realize that it's just a little it's either a little bumpy or a lot bumpy but there's always just this kind of weird sense of like you know this doesn't quite feel right. It doesn't really something seems off a little bit here and then that sort of gives birth to a lot of activity for people. Which is because when things don't feel quite right. Yeah you need to retweet. And I think that's the metaphor for Buddhism that I always heard that was always interesting is Buddha as a physician, as a doctor so first is prescribing what is the problem? There's the idea of dukkha. There's something is off there's something is not quite right that we need to is there a way to fix it? Yes there is a way to fix. Like what causes this problem? And then it goes into the attachment to desire. Okay we got that. Is there a way to fix it? Yes there is and now I'm going to lay out the Eightfold Path with step by step instruction for how you go about fix it. Yeah that's it. So it's very pragmatic. It's principle-driven. So it's not a subject to time and place because it's just laying out a methodology for how you solve problems. And it's not faith-based? No. Another super important part of it to me is it has nothing to do with faith. It's not like you don't just pretend to believe. If you're pretending to believe in the shit you're not looking at it at all on any level. And I think that's a huge difference between a lot of Eastern stuff, particularly Taoism Buddhism versus a lot of Western stuff is that a lot of the Western stuff is faith-based. Yes. Whether something you need to believe certain things in order to be. Whereas a lot of those traditions faith is whether you believe it or not, doesn't matter. The universe is the way it is whether you believe in those principles or not. Completely secondary. It doesn't really matter in any way because those things remain through one way or another. Whether Jesus was resurrected is a pretty big fucking deal in Christianity. If it's not then the whole structure of Christianity starts crumbling down. Whether Buddha really lived or really said the thing that are attributed to him or not doesn't really matter. It's more like what are those ideas? How can they be applied? Do they work? Do you try it? It's in some ways almost more scientific as an approach. It's like if you ever invented the Macarena when I heard that. I think the idea is like if we find out that you guys, you know what? We thought the Macarena was created by Gustav Fonks in 1983 when he was drunk out of his fucking mind on Margarita and didn't do big fat rails of Colombian blow and he came up with his dance that somehow caught on and then you find out that's not true. We don't know who invented the Macarena. There's still the Macarena. It still exists. The dance steps are still there. There is still this kind of dance. It doesn't matter. It's still there. So in Buddhism, it's kind of like the Macarena in the sense that I don't know, like Siddhartha Gautama was it or not? I don't know. It probably was real. He probably did exist. But even Buddha would be like, don't worry about me. It's not about me. Right now, by the way, I'm picturing Buddha doing the Macarena. I can see a beautiful TV show based on this premise. I love that, man. The beauty of that and I think it becomes really very useful in a time period that we're in right now which is that the way humans are taking an assessment of their environment is no longer based on walking outside and looking around but is now based on staying inside, not looking out your window, but looking out the window of your computer onto the social media and from that you sort of come up with an assessment of the world. Yeah, and that's also that's another trip right there, right? Because the whole social media thing, I mean on some way this shit is also because it's like, think about when we were growing up where if you had an interesting, let's say Buddhism and then you go to the local bookstore and if you find two books on Buddhism no matter how crappy they were you'd be super excited because that's all the information you have access to. Today you can type anything into the magic box and anything you want about it pops up so it's awesome. We have access to information in a way we've never had before. On the other hand, of course it's like any invention that are the problems that come with it. It's like just because you have fire, yeah, fire is great to cook your meal but it can also burn down your house and social media works in the same way. There's a way in which internet and all of that is amazing and it does beautiful things for us and clearly there are ways to use it to fuck up your life and unless you know how to play with it the dangers are there as much as the opportunities. That's a great way to put it because it's sort of like at least with fire, when you get burnt from fire, it's noticeable. It happens instantly you know you've been burnt by fire. I would say the social media could be more like asbestos. You don't know it's there. You don't realize you've been infected with some of the poisons of the thing until you're sort of like up at 3am looking at twitter and living probably if you live in the United States or in most countries unless you're in Syria like really dark parts of the world if you've got electricity and you're looking at your computer and you have a computer or a phone and you have some shelter and you have some food then you're doing better than a lot of people probably and certainly better than a lot of people in the past you're doing great also if you can stand up and walk around you can look at the stuff and yet the I'm imagining many people are like they're doing okay it's not great it's not the best of the best but you can look at social media and start seeing strong opinions people will tell you people who seem to have really strong opinions and seem to be really like authorities on this thing or that thing will assure you that yeah this is bad thing and this is a bad thing and it's bad and this is really bad and you're looking at it and you're thinking like fuck man maybe it is bad and then you start looking at the people who are agreeing with the person who's like yeah that is bad and then you start maybe following them and the next thing you know everything's on the screen is bad but it isn't yeah absolutely and I think that's one of the problems of the human mind a lot of humans feed on fear because you know fear is the kind of thing warning, danger is out there that's the kind of stuff that kept you alive is the kind of stuff that pay attention because there's this thing that if you don't pay attention this saber two tiger is gonna eat you so you know be out for the signs that there's a saber two tiger in this territory and then you can avoid getting killed that's useful right that's the kind of mild paranoia that's useful but then there's 10,000 ways in which today that set up just fuck us up because rather than just being I have my eyes to look out for anything that can mess up with my current life that's working okay suddenly you start that's all you look for and so your life is not even longer okay because all you do is look at all the things that are gonna fuck it up right and it's like a comet is going to strike and revolution that's going to throw us in jail and take away our guns and then it's gonna be the thing that is like this fear and the media of course knows that that's how human beings are so if you have a network you know that before a commercial break you throw fear fear be very afraid we're gonna tell you how to protect yourself after the commercial break because you know that that's gonna hook people you know that that's gonna keep them there watching until it's amazing it's like people who figured out how to get rich we have a lot of yelling that the theater is on fire absolutely and where it gets even more dismaying is when you realize now we have a new currency right so we have a new currency and the currency is retweets and likes or whatever validation you're getting through social media right so this is a new currency followers retweets and likes it's a currency and so these people who are on twitter blasting out infinite tweets about how rotten the world is or how terrified they are or how we should be terrified are getting like incredible validation for it and so they're actually unaware probably of the fact that they're doing the exact same thing the media is doing which is capitalizing off of frightening people absolutely and I think it becomes a weird game because you said the keyword you were right there where they probably are not aware of it because here is the thing is maybe you have 10 things you want to say and 2 are about hey let's worry about these things that we should worry about these people or these ideas or this event or something that we need to consider and you get like 500 times more response on that topic than on another topic that maybe is more creative more this but it's that's the easy sell that catches everybody so the next time you put out something greater than 2 out of 10 is 5 out of 10 and those 5 are the ones that again hit the most and the next time is 8 and before you know it that's all that becomes your shtick that's all you do is because you got the message that that's how you're gonna get the love and the attention and in some cases the money because that's the reality of it right a lot of people who start making bank on that kind of feeding that to a certain audience and it's I think that's why to me one of my ground rules for listening to anybody is how much are they giving me that's helping the quality of my life not how right they are not how smart they are not what a good speech they can put together is what are they giving me and usually that means something creative something positive something inspiring that can help me make life better there's enough of that I'm in but if it's just he's smart in analyzing the problem that's out there I don't need to listen to 50 hours of that you know it's like 20 minutes quick get a sense of what they are talking about is plenty and I think it's a conscious decision because otherwise my brain is the same monkey brain as everybody else right it's like I will gravitate toward fear I will gravitate toward things so I need to make a conscious decision of what am I feeding myself here you know what what is this thing this is about getting peace at that other group because there's always some other group to get peace to it it's about fear is about worries about the end of western civilization as we know it unless we do this and it's like fuck that I don't want to feed myself with that stuff I want to I want to feed my brain with stuff that makes me laugh that makes me happy yeah makes me feel more at ease in that interest me more and and also you know what interests me world peace is it possible can it happen and how would it happen and what are the what what are things like if you think about like what are things that are leading to more conflict and what are things that are seem to be sort of reducing conflict what are these things what do they look like what are the steps is it possible and then like taking this grand notion of like like skipping all the things in between but imagining a world at some point where there isn't a war happening yeah there may be some skirmishes here there are some things like rotten things here and there but there isn't like a huge like there isn't really war there isn't like that that is like kind of like gone off the table like the way that people now react to racism people begin to react that way to war so that if a president if a politician if any person seems to even remotely vocalize about war being an actual legitimate solution to a geopolitical problem they're instantly fired of course now I don't know how we get there but like I imagine a world like that in a world where like economies are interconnected and a world where people are overcoming their paranoia and fear about other cultures and fear about like what I don't know it's you know I think it's possible but like to get there I don't know how to get there but if we all put our heads together with this interconnectedness that's happening and manifesting through the internet I think we can really do it I agree and I think that's where it's interesting is those are challenges right because it's harder it's very easy to bitch and complain about somebody not so easy to come up with creative solutions but at the same time because it's a cool challenge it's a worthy challenge it's a challenge that actually is stimulating it's not this sit back point of finger and say it's all the fault of the bad guys I don't give a fuck about the bad guys tell me what a good guys are tell me why you are a good guy what do you do about it that helps other people that helps yourself that helps and it's not a hassle question like how good are you kind of thing no it's like literally what's the best that we can put forward what's the best that you can put forward and even if you don't have the answer right now that's fine but let's make that a priority you know let's think about how would we answer that question in the best possible way dedicate you know you want to once in a while you have to vent and bitch I get it 10% of the time 20 at most but make sure that 80 is going in another direction you know that's going in the direction of how to build a better relationship with your own physicality with your body with the sense of community with the sense of how you create better communication with other human beings how you do all those things that's where it's fascinating that is exactly where to me the rubber hits the road and the first I think one of the things that like is a fun thing that anyone can do is imagine here here's a fantasy imagine this there is actually a decentralized nonviolent revolution happening right now it's happening we are in the middle probably by now of a really well planned out series of political actions that are leading to what could be a global renaissance and what those actions are is the end of prohibition on psychedelics the legalization of marijuana which you see happening all over the planet because with the legalization of marijuana it doesn't that doesn't just mean like a lot of people who shouldn't be arrested don't get arrested it means that human consciousness begins to merge with nature at ever increasing rates because of access to a psychoactive chemical that allows this kind of communion to happen with the planet so we don't even know like what the that plan is going to be teaching people in mass but India just legalized it Canada just legalized it Congress is trying to pass some kind of federal legalization for medical marijuana and apparently Trump is going to sign off on it if they pass it because he fucking hates Jeff Sessions and Jeff Sessions doesn't want marijuana to be legal and he put it in play that was hilarious it's like he hates Sessions you put him there not somebody else I know that was hilarious and it's I mean to me it's like oh my god this is like it couldn't be better like crazy fucking Trump hates this like person who's like to me a billion times worth some fucking Trump right and this and that which means that Trump is just going to start doing shit to fuck with Jeff Sessions whether Trump cares about marijuana I don't know secondary he's like oh my god I can just fuck with him all day long what is Jeff Sessions not want to happen I'm going to do it and if Trump does if Trump just does the opposite of what Jeff Sessions wants we really might have world peace for the next three years just to piss someone off that's awesome Trump might instigate world peace just to piss off Jeff Sessions which to me is super funny that is funny so the we have all of these things that are happening that are clearly like moving us into a world that is less violent more open-minded more connected it's happening so the fantasy is imagine that there is a decentralized nonviolent revolution happening and you're part of it and the moment you decide to be a part of it you become a soldier in this movement that's happening you become an actor in this incredible secret revolution that's happening and it's a fun game you can play with yourself and it's like you can actually sort of instigate a state of pro-noia you've never heard of this before remind me one second I remembered a word pro-noia is the fantasy that the universe is conspiring to help you oh yeah so there's a story about a psychiatrist or a psychologist who wanted to see if he could make himself paranoid so he started walking around imagining pretending people were watching him and following him and then I think he had a psychotic break because he started really believing it it went from being like oh my god I'm going to pretend people are following me like fuck I was right holy shit I'm being gang stalked so you can do the opposite of that to yourself and start imagining that this is the great fantasy or the lens to look through there is a nonviolent decentralized revolution happening it's in the same way empire evolves, revolution has evolved to the point where the revolutionaries have realized oh we can't have leaders like leaders we get fucked up in fact we can't really even have cells operating together it's better for most people to just be agents acting completely in the dark but if you just imagine that's what you are the steps are this one, pretend it's true two, imagine you've just been activated by this podcast wait for orders to come and then before you know it you will get a synchronicity you will get the weirdest fucking thing or just in your mind suddenly something will pop into your head about what you could do to help this great movement that's going to end in a renaissance and global peace that thing could be like oh shit I need to you know what my neighbor is broke and needs food or there is something to do it will just come to you this ridiculous pronoid fantasy is that you just play this game with yourself for a little while and sure as fucking shit people will start coming out of the woodwork and they will help you for real and they'll start telling you things and you'll be like wait what wait what wait a minute wait no how is that happening how do they know what is this and now you start living in this beautiful pronoid world where you are being like buffeted by the winds of some very sophisticated organized decentralized nonviolent revolution it's a blast I highly recommend playing that game with yourself I can hear John Landon playing in the background to all of this in some very imagined so it's yeah but it's just try I challenge you try it for a week and see where you are at it's better than alternative right it's better than thinking that everything in the universe is conspiring to fuck you up because I mean to a large degree is you know I'm a big believer in being real but at the same time there is an element to how you choose to perceive things that will affect how you relate to them and how things around you happen now of course you know like I think one of the things that sometimes piss me off is when people skip a step so there's the something horrible happen and it's always like ah but you need to look how it's how this is for the best and it's kind of like shut up something horrible just happened you know this is not for the best this sucks right but to me it's like it is the problem you either have the people who become complete deniers of the unpleasant sides of reality and they only want it because it's like otherwise it ruins their happy fantasy and otherwise I'm gonna have to deal with the fact that there are harsh things in life or you find the people who get stuck there and dwell there forever about how life is rough and terrible and hard and it's like to me it's like let's be real when bad shit happens and this bad shit and there's no spinning it in a cool way still this bad shit let's acknowledge it and then figure out how we move on from here you know it's like let's acknowledge ok this is shit having said that continuing to say that this is shit is not gonna help us very much right so how about we figure out regardless of whether it's fair enough none of that shit matters is these are the cards that have been handed to you we can agree that you probably didn't get the best cards but who cares these are the cards that are in your hand are you gonna play them because that's really the only thing that counts yeah is at this point are you gonna take those cards good or bad as they may be how can you play them in the best possible way yeah I like that I like wait which is the who's the Greek god that stole fire what's his name Mr. Prometheus I believe is the name we're looking for yeah Prometheus and he got in big trouble what do they do they like they chain him to a rock and every day an eagle arrives to eat his lever yeah during the night his lever grow again yeah the next day the eagle come back and eat his lever again yeah and he like but isn't the idea that through the whole thing he laughs at the gods like Prometheus maybe this is just like some existentialist take on it I like that but yeah I haven't heard it the idea is that Prometheus is like even in the midst of this yeah the Prometheus is like yeah confined away still got the fire still gave the fire to people mother fuckers and I don't have to be freaked out by this never-ending torture by your dumbass eagle eating my fucking liver PS I've gotten used to it PS I think it's funny PS I'm friends with the eagle PS I'm glad he's eating my liver because he's hungry he's awesome I've named him William his name's William I look forward to him flying down and so then suddenly you realize like this is the power of the of being a human right is that if we take like it so if we're to look at like what you're talking about like no doubt there are hard like every debt horrible horrible horrible horrible inconceivably horrible fucking things happen in them but you know if we myth a lot of mythologize it and use Prometheus as an example you can in the midst of this horrible thing still find a place of equanimity peace tranquility and power and this is to be a warrior and you can find that place in it where even in the midst of this you're still smiling at the world this is the human power this is the human potential and this is like if we do that you know what is it people say speak truth to power speak truth to power do that but do it with a smile yeah that's important because otherwise you're spending your life thinking that until the day when utopia materializes you have to grind your teeth and fight on and it's gonna be rough and it's like well you're gonna wait a long time because that may or may not happen anytime soon but having fun while you're fighting the good fight that's where it's like one of my favorite sentence of all times is my sex loving a Zen monk from the 1400 EQ sojourn who said throw me into hell and I'll find a way to enjoy it yeah and I love that right because it's not denied hell is hell it's like it sucks it is what it is right I'll find a way to enjoy it it's like regardless of what the objective reality out there is I'm gonna figure out a way to make it better than if I just go in think you know look how objectively it's terrible there is such thing the objectivity there's also the way in which you relate to it and that's a choice that's not just it's not dictated by the facts the facts limit what you can and cannot do some people are gonna have a easier or harder time but your choice is a key one that's right and the first thing they want is to colonize your brain with fear and by them I mean it's like okay so basically what we have going on here is essentially two competing paradigms we have one paradigm is the paradigm of fear disaster terror the amygdala people they're like and within that paradigm you have two different I think you could break it into two big categories one category is the people who are profiting off of it this is not just the weapons manufacturers this is the media this is people selling like anti-anxiety medications is the people who have like come up with like bullshit hyper-expensive ways to like overcome it by going to like I don't know this is there's like there's a huge industry in scaring people and actually you know I actually it was really funny I wanted to take a screenshot but I think CNN realized how preposterous the headline was so they took it down but the headline was something along the lines of like you know the economy the unemployment is lower than it's been in 50 years but Americans are still uneasy and it's like I wonder why CNN I wonder fucking why because every single day you're bugling the trumpets of the apocalypse and now you're like ah people seem to still be uneasy weird huh weird that's weird right you're selling cars motherfuckers you're selling cars you're selling ads trying to make money I get it you want to make a buck but anyway we have one paradigm it's the people who are profiting off of it and not just those people who are profiting off of it with actual money but the people who are profiting off of it with power these are the people who are like on social media putting themselves forward to some kind of like champions of peace or champions of some kind of like I don't know some kind of but and yet everything they say is a different breakdown of how rotten the world is and so those people are profiting to so that's the profiteers and then we have the just people who are authentically terrified because they don't know what's happening because they've become confused they've their brains have been colonized so those are the people I think that they can truly be helped so that's one paradigm the other paradigm is the all the peace workers in the world all the people who are like truly trying to make a more peaceful beautiful collaborative connected world where we figure out a way to have dialogue with each other and we figure out a way that like there's got to be a way there's got to be a way I know we can do this so there's these two competing paradigms happening here and the I think to be a successful peace worker you and the thing you're talking about is like we can't just skip over this when we can't fake smile at the eagle and we can't fake smile at the gods we have to figure out a way to actually find peace inside ourselves and this while of Buddhism because it's like it really has a method that cuts through whatever the particular political situation of the time period may be to get right to the crux of the issue which is that to be a human being is to feel a little off balance to feel a little off and the reason we feel a little off is because of three fundamental problems which is that we either have desire we want this thing or that thing we don't want something which is actually kind of another form of desire I desire this thing to not be happening but that's called a version we don't want to be in the car in traffic in our marriage we don't want to be looking down on a fucking eagle's beak nailing us in the stomach yet again and flying off with our fucking liver we don't want that William here's William again that fucking eagle William really can't taste that good and then the third one is just ignorance we're ignorant which kind of means we're not aware of the fact that we live in a universe of impermanence or we're not aware of the fact that we're all completely interconnected and so these are the three big problems regardless of where you're at the political situation how much money you have don't have what you're doing if you really look at your problem those are the three main fucking problems you either want to be somewhere else or want to have some shit you don't have or you don't want to be where you're at or you're just completely confused about what the place is in general so we start dealing with those things first and then you begin to like actually experience a kind of lightning of spirit and that produces I think a state of consciousness where you can begin to like work with the world and maybe make changes I don't know speaking of which you seem in a on a good wave you seem like in a really good mood today and I haven't seen you in a while your overall vibe seems pretty damn happy I like that thanks man because you know it's like you know it all too well there are those waves right there are the moments when we feel like this and then sometimes there are the moments where it's like fuck it's hard it's like mild cycles of depressions are not so mild that sometimes can kick in but you seem to be what do you think is this like a wave or you're finding a way to be at a different place of balance in your life I got lucky man I got this guy Nick Turn David Nick Turn he's like a Chogyam Trumpa student who like is like just this incredible you know what happened is like I sort of decided to go a little deeper into studying Buddhism and meditation in particular and so I started working with this guy and like he's like a really talented teacher he sort of I don't know he sort of helped me like find some figure out some shit that I had kind of like hadn't really fully grasped at least like with my own mind I'd like heard about it and read about it a million times and so it's cool man when you start understanding the way your mind works which is like sort of like if you want to have a reason to meditate I think the reason to meditate is because you want to like you want to help that it's a good reason to meditate but to really help we got to figure out a way to as much as possible like find some kind of equilibrium inside right so you know you start doing mindfulness practice and you start recognizing something that's really interesting that is like for me it's like incredibly interesting because I have known about it and I've experienced it in different ways but the methodology of this particular lineage of Buddhism the Kagu lineage, the Shambhala it's like real non-woo wooy basic here's what you do you take a seat you follow your breath when your mind wanders you bring it back to your breath that's it it's really simple and it's simple but then you start becoming aware of how your fucking mind is working at least and it's really amazing you start realizing oh my god that thing you just talked about the wave you realize oh shit that fucking wave that I thought was like my life is actually happening on a cycle in my mind at every moment and so you start getting really familiar with this incredible thing that's happening which is you're blinking in and out of reality you're going from a state of being lost in your thoughts or sleepy or whatever or caught in your body but usually just in your thoughts to back to your breath and in the present moment and that's it but you start realizing like oh my god I keep blinking in and out I'm like a firefly I'm like a an interdimensional firefly that's going from the thought realm into the like human realm non-stop of course blinking in and out of reality all day long I'm here and now I'm back lost in my thoughts yeah and what glimpse of rear back in my thoughts yeah yeah yeah and so what starts happening or what I have found has happened and one of the really cool things they say is like look whatever the fuck happened in your past meditation and whatever you think the thing is you had don't be attached to that either because that's the same bullshit because now you're now instead of your thoughts you're now instead of blinking in and out of like some other past experience now you're blinking in and out of thinking about meditation of course it's the same so that being said there is a kind of spaciousness that can start happening when you're doing a sitting meditation that you didn't even I didn't even realize it's basically sometimes when it's working for me the feeling reminds me of like a dolphin that got let out of an aquarium and is suddenly dealing with the fact that like there's an entire ocean and you've been swimming around this little aquarium that you thought was you and that is an that is a very that really really really is a big relief man that makes you happy I bet you show it that's great well it's also I'm wearing a new Buddhist cologne ok fuck all the other stuff you said that's the answer Scent of Awakening it's my own personal brand guys if you go to dunkatrustle.com for only $25.99 you can no longer be afraid and feel free like the dolphin yes, the scent of Awakening that's the way to do it about I remember like sometimes speaking of cycles you're talking about working out like a madman then you fall off, then you come back in again where are you at in terms of relationship with the body not good not great man I like not great I I went to the gym like a week and a half ago and it was felt fucking great and I didn't go and this I think I love about this guy Nick turn so cool man and the way he teaches is he's like a lot of us ask this question which is I know it feels good to work out but I don't or I know when I meditate my life tends to get better but I don't do it why don't I do it and what he was saying in this class is you know like we're always trying to find some kind of mystical answer to that question you know and he's like it's probably laziness he just he goes back to old-fashioned lazy it's not some kind of fucking like that's what I love about it it's not like some I would love to believe that the reason I don't do it is because of you know I don't know like I don't meditate I don't meditate because I'm afraid of my own awakening no interdimensional demons are struggling with you trying to hold you back because they know that the world is never going to be the same when Duncan Trussell become enlightened and then that's a six pack I'm lazy I like to play God of War it's like there's not a that's what I really love about this particular lineage is it's not bullshit it's just like you're probably lazy and that's okay I would much rather someone tell me oh no you're lazy then it's some fucking confounding complex thing right no so my that's like you know certainly something that is always floating in my consciousness is that man come on dude let's fucking let's get back to the gym it feels good what about you some some I want to do more I want to do more and it's I think one of the things that's tricky for me is that I do on any given day I do ten thousand things that I enjoy that are good so I'm not saying oh you know I'm wasting time I definitely don't waste time for oh I'm doing this shit that I hate and it's it's it's a good problem to have because it's like okay I'm working on this thing which is a good thing I'm doing this other thing that is a good thing I'm doing but there are 24 hours in a day and so something got to give so at some point is like prioritizing of okay if there are several things that you want to spend your time doing pick make a choice yeah you know because at some point otherwise the 24 hours make a choice for you and before you know it you haven't done this some of the stuff that really was a priority because you did something else that was okay you can justify it but it doesn't quite deliver the same results that's right and and I think I really need to it really boils down to just good stupid old fashion discipline of just getting up and saying today this gets done yeah I don't care how when you make it happen one way or another that's it and it's great and anytime you do that whatever it is it's just like instantly liberating like when you whatever it really is just like so he's just like the hardest part about writing sitting down to write oh yeah writing itself is like not the easiest thing ever but like getting your ass in the seats the hardest part about getting to about working out is getting the gym oh yeah the hardest part about meditating is getting to the meditation cushion it's like it's it's really not a it's really not that difficult you know and it's just like you know doing it and I had once I was I went to train I was going to to judo class and I drove probably 20 minutes to get there I get out of the car I have my gear with me I walk in I took one look at the mat I walk back I got back in the car I drove 20 minutes back and I was just like yeah it's not happening you know what I call that victory because you fucking did it like just making the effort just making the effort to try to do the thing I think it's still victory man it's not the best victory ever but it's still better than not it's still better than sitting at home without knowing there was a good victory the following week because I basically do the same thing right I walk in I sit down and I'm just finding an excuse to not step up and walk away yeah and I was somebody who saw me and we were like hey you want to jump in and I'm like I don't know and he kind of stepped off the mat and he's like are you depressed and I'm like and you know I didn't think I was depressed but when he asked me the question I was like I guess so a little bit you know and then he was so cool because the guy said like you know I totally get it I feel the same way a lot of the times just step on the mat with me we'll just play for five minutes okay we'll just I'll just show you something there are a couple of things I'm working on we'll play those for five minutes then if you want to go go okay and it's like and I step on the mat and we start playing and of course I start feeling better and everything start clicking and then I get an awesome workout and I feel better about life and it was just like oh that was interesting that's a proficient teacher yeah that was awesome right there yeah that's kind of part of being a teacher is like you you you get good at like analyzing your students where they're at right you want to come to them where they're at and like in like figure out a method for for that place he sounds amazing yeah that's super cool that was mr. Chris Hill said thank you very much now that would he did exactly what I needed in the moment right yeah I didn't even know I needed it and he had that exact right reaction that wasn't like oh come on just get in here and do it it's like yeah fuck you I'm leaving yeah he wasn't just letting me just a little gentle prod in just enough to get you to take the first step on your own and it was he's one of them yeah it was great he's one of them and there's so many of them out there like it's not just Buddhists it's like obviously it's like every religion every industry every it's they're every they're all out there man and like they're really really good and what are they good at doing they're good at helping us mm-hmm be a little less stuck yeah they're just they like and it's like everyone's you know like if you think about a car stuck in mud it's like universally kind of the same problem the car stuck in mud but the method to get each car out of the mud is going to vary from types of mud to type of car to what you what tools you have on hand to get the mud the car out of the mud there's lots of different ways to do it and it's really amazing when you realize like holy fuck there are people in the world who have trained themselves or been trained to get cars out of mud yeah only it's not cars it's people who've gotten stuck and they've gotten stuck and and they want to be free that's another part of like I think the skill set that these people seem to demonstrate is they can recognize the people who actually want to get out of the mud and the people who don't who like being stuck in the mud and the people who like being stuck in the mud they're like enjoy the mud and I think it's part of what's trippy about these phases you know the eyes and lows of life that are inevitable is sometimes when you are stuck in the low you know you're stuck in the low you know what it feels like to be in the high and you know you have done it 10,000 times before but exactly what you say this time you don't know what it is that's going to make it go click and suddenly you're out right and so you keep on that in and you turn around and you try this try that like the last time it was awesome is like the after maybe six weeks of this wasn't terrible wasn't bad but it was you know mild depression where I'm under some I'm carrying like 50 extra pound on my shoulder kind of feeling and my daughter started talking to me because she saw you know I'm in a weird mode I have been in a weird mode for a little bit and it's not dramatic but visible enough and I don't know what the fuck she said but something that she said made me I could almost even click in my brain where I felt something go clung door opening I'm suddenly looking at the exact same situation in a slightly different way I sat with it for a day or so and the next day I was done and I was out and that whole phase was over and I don't even remember what words she used but that's the thing is like it's not just a perfect methodology that always works every time it's like it has to be the right I mean the right tone the right thing that on a particular day can turn the key that's right and there has to be a willingness you know there has to be an authentic desire because a lot of people they don't I think everybody naturally wants to be lighter they want to be free they want to like it's kind of like you know what's one of the saddest things to see when you're taking a walk is sometimes you'll see people hanging on their porch a canary in a cage and like I don't know maybe the canaries never really flown but the canary sees birds and knows this is possible and it's sad to me and I think that everybody deep down knows that there's something there is more than maybe what they're experiencing there's a potential for something else but some of those people it's way deep down and they don't want to they don't want they're doing it in their own time in their own way it's nobody's business and it's absolutely fine for them to be that way because they're in process and they need those gestational periods of like deep absolute traumatic misery to get to the point of and when they get to that point of it's going to be that much more sweet because all the extra time they served in the whole mind of their self it's going to be that and no one should get in the way of that in fact I think it's really not cool to get in the way of that let them do it on their own in their own way and respect what they're going through even if it's not palatable to you it's not your job but some people man they're ready they're ready. There is need to push one thing that say that's the way out of the maze. Yeah that's it and those are the people who like some folks have gotten good at recognizing them and or you should be good at recognizing it in yourself like fuck I'm ready for this and then that's why they call this a practice which is the reason if now if you're out of the depression and I'm not recommending meditation for anyone other than me I'm just this helps me sure but right now if you're out of the depression and you start doing like a little bit of mindfulness practice what are you practicing for you're practicing so that when you get back there again and you're all lost and you've gotten all foggy and you've forgotten about the whatever and you're lost suddenly you'll this thing will happen where you where you're oh my breath oh I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna fall in my breath for a second oh wait I'm back oh shit I was gone whoa I was gone for a fucking month holy shit I was gone for eight hours I was completely gone I was up in my head I didn't want to be where I was at I wanted something I was lost I was gone and that those moments of like coming back into this beautiful world when you've been off and you're like simulated holographic jumbled confused swirly massive memories or thinking about the future worrying about the lump on your fucking head that you got to go to the doctor all the all the things those moments of coming back into this has become really sweet it becomes really really sweet when you start realizing like wait a minute I keep coming back here and that's fucking great man I had this dream it was the coolest fucking dream I was in some theater big weird theater and like I look behind me and there's this dude sitting there that look like the Dalai Lama but he was kind of in disguise or something but he's definitely a monk I'm like is that the fucking Dalai Lama and then like I guess this Buddhist stuff's been getting in my head or something but then something starts demonstrating to me it's like hey check this look what it feels like when you stop resisting as much as you've been resisting every single thing I just want to show you here's kind of what it would feel like if you just stopped resisting what came your way or if you stop being at if you start if you stopped fighting against what's happening and in the dream for like I don't know 20 seconds 30 seconds it was like what you it's like the vest thing it's like suddenly somebody just took off a 600 pound vest and it was the sweetest most liberating three incredible and it wasn't like my external situation changed it was just like the stuff that was happening I was just like in that instead of pushing it away and that's a big relief for me is to like stop fighting whatever the moment is because that's an unwinnable war and a lot of it right now you're doing through meditation how often do you do it how long like give me the basics of meditative practice oh my god it's like I just did so I just did this class with Nick turn and then it's like I haven't done it in like a few days since then and still I'm feeling the effects not that you're feeling the effects so when I'm doing it well I am doing it I'm just not doing it well and and it's important to do well that's the other cool thing about this lineage is it's a practicing lineage which means that it's like it's not a this is not a this is not philosophical yeah yeah it's like you do it yeah you do it right so yeah when you're doing it it's like five five days a week 20 minutes a day you could do 10 if you don't want to do 20 come on it's like that's like the smallest possible investment one could make to one's well-being it's not exactly a shit load of time no I mean but it's it isn't and it's that makes it that much more hilarious when you're not doing absolutely and and but then the other part of it is like don't don't beat yourself up yeah yeah that's fine I get it completely but still we're talking about something that if you have any wheel whatsoever you can do you know if you if you want it in any way shape or form it's totally doable it's not like oh you know what you need to put two hours it's like I don't know about I don't know if I can two hours you know that kind of thing yeah talking about relatively small time investment and you can what will happen or for me what's happened is like that the you start you start because this thing has happened where you begin to like he did this like in the class he did this crazy like it was amazing like you know this is all I has all been worked out over 2000 years like how to do it and evolved it's a I hate using the term but it really is a kind of technology sure but you sort of like start out with just like following your breath but then he does he's really cool there's other things that you can do with your awareness right so you can move your awareness from your breath to the visual field right so now instead of following your breath it's like your breath in the visual field just like purely looking at like the visual field around you and then like when the thinking happens you thinking and then you go back to like watching but then what starts happening or what happened for me is you begin to experience this if you're like me and you've taken LSD for your entire life you begin to experience this thing that your mind returns is like wait this is exactly like LSD I feel like I'm tripping and not tripping because you're hallucinating but tripping in the sense that it feels as though your identity is beginning to sort of dissolve into this field of awareness and that yeah I was talking to him about it and he told me the name there's a name for that and it wasn't like he brushed it off or anything he's like yeah that's like you can get into that expansive space but that's not eat right that's not what we're doing at the second this is let's go back that's still your mind again being like oh I'm spreading into infinity okay okay thinking now let's go back into that the moment again but because of like something about it like I don't know it does sort of begin to unravel it's basically like it feels like you're wearing a straight jacket and somebody like pulled a thread on the straight jacket just enough so that you can start like wriggling a little bit and it starts loosening and loosening but yeah five times a week 20 minutes a day follow your breath find a class I think taking a class is really smart with this stuff probably you know speaking of meditative practices you ever experienced much with the whole Wim Hof idea the Wim Hof method the breathing and the freezing your ass off yeah no I've you know I've done like cold dips and really like it and like I think there's something that you find within that kind of like discomfort that's pretty amazing what about you I haven't no I want to because it sounds like kind of like as far as meditative practice go that's also an interesting one where you're playing with your breath you're still doing that because ultimately that's where it all starts from but you apply it in a slightly different and I think it's like that's something that's interesting right there is the ability to the basics are the same you know the goals are the same but the ways to go about it there's more than one way and you try what works for you because yeah I know people that wouldn't be called dead sitting on a pillow but like Wim Hof thing makes sense to them and so okay then that's your thing yeah it's so important to find it and I think that's the key is what works for one person or works for one person in one phase in their life may not be the same thing that works for the next person or even for yourself in a different phase of your life and so it's like keep experimenting you know and things like these where the experiment is not you know do it for a week and you just spent what hundred and probably hundred minutes doing it five days a week yeah a week smallest time investment ever is it doing anything for you yes continue is it not doing anything for you okay try another one try a different one I think the main thing is that if you're like me and you've heard people talk endlessly about there being some other experience of reality that doesn't seem to be as terrified and heavy and freaked out and angry and spooky then you might have rolled your eyes at that and been extremely skeptical about that and thought that's not that actually isn't I actually was talking to someone the other day and like she's miserable right now and all I could tell her is like yeah yeah yeah that is how you're feeling now but it truly doesn't have to be like that like you don't have to like there is actually a way to live that doesn't have to be so so rotten and the way to get there there's so many different paths and in fact there is no it's a process so even to say there's a path that leads to this destination or that is ridiculous but there is the potential for the the lightning of your load and however you do that to me it's like that's part of the adventure it's just the moment you decide to me what really gets me into this stuff more than ever is when I actually think more in terms of like how is this gonna help me help other people and how is this gonna help me because you know everybody listening to this has either gone through the death of a parent or will go through the death of a parent and if not the death of a parent you're gonna go through the death of a friend and not not just that but like at some point you're gonna come into the company of someone who is really needing you to be fully there with them and you can help in this like incredible decentralized revolution you can train yourself up and to me that gets me more excited about it than anything which is just realizing like wait a minute this really fuck me please fuck me you fuck me in the sense of like that I can't it's hard for me to get that excited about that you know it's gonna it's hard for me to get that excited about that as much as like wait oh shit oh shit like actually this is real like people actually need our help in the world big time yeah that's one of the things like because once you become aware of how much suffering you go through in life then a lot of people just become asshole because it's like oh I've had it bad so I'm just gonna pass it on to everybody else yeah but the ones who don't do that then you become really understanding of where everybody comes from because it's like man I know all too well that feeling and it sucks and just because it's not me right now well this person doesn't need to be there it's like if there's a way that I can do something to help them out why not that's it dude and it's like especially like this is one of the cool things about being an old dude building fucking old getting these wrinkles you know like experiencing the pains of getting like an older body and like feeling like all the and all the things like I've you know they've happened to me yeah it's like all that shit is just training and this adds back to the imaginary story you can tell yourself which is instead of thinking about your life as a some kind of accidental catastrophe imagine that you've actually been being secretly trained by a super intelligent so that you can become an operative in this incredible thing that's happening and so then you look then the moment you just make that little shift and look back at like all the shit that happened to you and realize like oh god I was fantasizing that a Shaolin monk would come and take me to a temple where I would like have to like throw toothpicks through steel but it's like oh no brother this is way bigger than that a super intelligence wrapped around you in the form of your incarnation and produced a series of events in your life that have like made you who you are today and that you are going to use at some future point to transform somebody else to help in some way potentially to actually like stop a school shooting to stop a nuclear war maybe we don't know collectively what can happen so this fantasy is so fun to play around with because it's like suddenly your life stops being this meaningless never ending spray of diarrhea out of the anus of some kind of dark chaotic being but actually becomes you realize like oh this has been an organized systematic training that has in some way or another given me tools that I'm going to need to use at some point and what happened was that because you right now listening to this podcast at one point got stuck and forgot all this and couldn't quite get out and you know there have been a few efforts to try to wake you up didn't quite work out right now the call has arrived through the sweet lesbian rasp of drunken trust man wake up there's a revolution happening we gotta get going Danielli thank you so much thank you for being on my show and letting me be on yours this is awesome

121^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Conner Habib Transcript and Discussion^2016-09-30^Good evening friends morning rather whatever it is You are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast, which is a proud member of the Farrell audio podcast collective You can check them out at Farrell audio comm lots of great podcasts there for you to enjoy and to share with your family and friends and church and temple and Listen to on airplanes and on your long trips to see your sweet family Or to listen to on your commute or as you paint or work or dance or sing or make love With your step-grandmother for those of you who have responded to me regarding my pod rift project, which is If you just started tuning in now I am in the process of bringing people together to create a virtual reality space where I can record this podcast live and I invited people to Email me if they thought they could help out in this project and I've gotten a lot of responses There's actually a thread on my message board at Duncan Trussell comm Called the official pod rift thread Where you can make initial greetings to other people who are interested in working on this thing I'm gonna respond. I'm gonna try to respond to everybody and I have somebody who has experience organizing IT projects who is helping me out with this and she is going to Hopefully assemble an email list where we can all Start breaking off into teams to make this thing happen I am going to respond to you the pod rift project is going to happen and I'm very excited about this In fact, I'm obsessed now at this point I'm pretty obsessed because since I started talking about it and throwing it out there I've been getting so many emails showing me all the different forms of this emergent virtual technology Which is happening all the different ways that people are learning to interact with virtual space particularly Motion capture technologies which translate movement directly into virtual avatars. This is super important in virtual space because when you're in a fully immersive environment anything that you have to do in First world or the environment outside of the virtual space will take you out of that immersion So there are a lot of cool new technologies that are being created to go along with the oculus rift to create deeper levels of Immersion one of these is called the omni. It's an omni directional treadmill that You have to wear special shoes for it it seems to be It's some kind of like Sloped Disc that has grooves in it and you wear these special shoes that fit into the grooves and so you're basically walking In the grooves sliding along the grooves and this creates the illusion of walking through virtual space This is just one example of the creations that are Coming out right now that allow for Deeper immersion into the digital space and that's where everything's going we want to cross beyond the uncanny Valley which is a term which is currently used for the The weird weirdness that happens when we represent reality with CGI So even the most high-tech CGI when you see it you know that it's some kind of cartoon It's not real. It doesn't seem real very close to being real But it still has a kind of plasticky mannequin quality to it Well, we want to cross beyond that uncanny Valley We and I think that that term can be used for much more than just graphical representations of reality but can also be used for Any feeling that takes us out of full immersion Into a digital world and eventually we will succeed in this But we're in the very early early phases of it and the Oculus Rift is one of the most notable flowers on the tree of this technology Yet there are even though this technology is so incredible there are still detractors who claim that it is unnatural These people engage in what I consider to be one of the most absurd Logical positions that any person can engage in which is the idea that we are somehow separated from nature That there is nature and there are humans and there are two different things whereas I think that we are nature We are as much a part of nature as volcanoes cows butterflies in Hurricane but not everybody thinks this way some people consider this emergent technology to be Dangerous or evil. I just read this quote, but I think it really sums up this kind of paranoia people feel about technology It's from the book the nature of technology what it is and how it evolves by W. Brian Arthur He says as humans We are not attuned to technology, but to something different We are attuned in the deepest parts of our being to nature to our original condition as humankind We have familiarity with nature a reliance on it that comes from three million years of at-homeness with it We trust nature when we happen upon technology such as stem cell regenerative therapy We experience hope But we also immediately ask how natural this technology is and so we are caught between Too deep unconscious forces our deepest hope is human lies in technology, but our deepest trust lies in nature It is as though Arthur has just finished snorting his fifth rail of Molly We need to Claire's our deepest hope is humans lies in technology, but our deepest trust lies in nature It's a poetic statement, but it's ultimately completely wrong Unless W. Arthur is the pen name for the multi-eyed tenacled Cthulhu being that blasted humanity into the void millions of years ago There's no way that he can know what the deepest hope and deepest trust of his species is But the even crazier thing that Arthur is doing here is creating a bifurcation between humans and nature and this is a classic bifurcation And it's a bifurcation that's been going on for a very very long time starts in the book of Genesis In the Garden of Eden where humans existed in this kind of primordial state and then because they went against the rules laid down by some lunatic creator force and Eight of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they got this eternal cursed placed upon them They were cast out of the garden cast out of nature They went from background to foreground and that is created This sense of guilt or a feeling that whatever human beings do is in some way tainted or secondary To what is naturally produced by the earth and the name for this is called original sin It's that feeling of unease that people have when they look out at civilization at human civilization when you see the buildings when you see the Cars when you see the pollution when you see the organization of the primate hive which is civilization there is a simultaneous feeling of awe and dread we think What have we done? When you look at a city compared to the woodlands when you look at the honking of horns and the Emission of fossil fuels into the air the smog Your initial reaction is this is not nature. This is different from nature And because it's a product or a byproduct of humans it makes sense To then say well then humans must not be natural Suddenly at that point technology becomes this other thing it It it begins to live outside of the natural world as an outcast It's like Jesus a rejected messiah Who has come to earth to work amazing miracles but is mysteriously rejected by the very human beings? That it's trying to help now not all human beings are rejecting technology But a great many people are rejecting technology and they look at this idea of going into virtual spaces as a kind of ultimate failure human beings turning their backs on the natural world and Curling up in the darkness of their homes with screens tied to their faces I'll admit there's something spooky about watching these people with the oculus rift flailing around Because you can't see what they're experiencing. It's like watching someone in a fever dream But this is far more than just some hallucinatory experience That we're talking about here far more and rather than me going on attempting to articulate this. I'm gonna go to Terrence Jesus Christ McKenna and I'm gonna play An awesome sound clip of McKenna talking about what this technology represents for our species The alien is trapped in the deeper interstices of the human soul But can be downloaded on to the internet as a virtual reality of some sort and this you do it Very slighly. You don't announce what I've just announced You say We're going to hold a contest and we're gonna have a prize for the best simulation of a psychedelic experience in VRML in virtual space and You hold this contest and you hold it the next year and the next year and people are inspired to download What they think of as their weirdest visions But what they don't understand is their weirdest visions are the weird vision in other words the collective Oversoul Exists dispersed through all of us and if we have a collective project seek to model it To animate it to produce a reasonable simulacrum of it in virtual reality It it will come to be we will summon it out of ourselves And I think at a certain point we will understand the nature of the enterprise the alchemist dream of Something like this the summoning into existence of the cosmic Anthropos the the mystic atom the psychic hydrolyph the philosopher's stone the lapis Philosophorum the transcendental object at the end of time once again the living part of The universal panacea now I think as we move into the empowering of the imagination Through cyberspace we can actually do we can actually bring these Archetypes if you will into existence in ways that will give them a terrifying Immediacy, I mean I have visited virtual realities of low definitions slapped together In fairly short order and it shows me What you could achieve if you if many people lovingly Crafted and tool these things We would discover that we can communicate to each other the niagra is of Epiphanous beauty that pour through us when we smoke the empty take psilocybin Or something like that so in answer to the gentleman's question psychedelics were a door were a window until the advent of Virtual reality and the internet and the new information technology and they melded to psychedelic and can't open the possibility of opening that window and Stepping through it into you know the most beautiful dreams human beings have ever dreamed Think of that the niagra is of epiphanous beauty that flows through us when we smoke DMT or take psilocybin Can be represented using Virtual reality according to Terrence McKenna and by the way that was in 1996 If only he were alive today to see what was happening any who I want to be part of this thing And I invite you to be part of this thing too Come join me go to Duncan trustle calm go to the podriff thread if you have ideas if you work for a tech company If you work for Oculus if you have an idea about how to make this happen, please get in on the conversation It's if nothing else it's just fun and it's a way for us to do something together That at the very least will be a hilarious catastrophe But at the very most it can be one of the many blocks being placed into this structure, which is emerging into time right now that is eventually going to allow us to Be born into a new era Which is going to be an era that where we spend a lot of our time in a digital universe Sounds fun to me We've got a great podcast today with my friend Connor Habib We get very deep into the subject matter and I love it because Habib Represents a different POV on the thing So we cover a lot of interesting ground, but first some business Number one as always the duck at trustle family hour sponsored by the beloved sure design t-shirts Sure design t-shirts is located at sure design t-shirts.com and oh dear god Do they make such soft and beautiful shirts?

It's kind of bizarre It's like yeah, the voice is coming through the ether. Yeah, that was a weird that was a weird thing, man Yeah, you know Connor you I was I've been thinking lately about like podcasting and how All the really cool things it's done and my my favorite thing about what it's done for me is The people I've gotten to meet through podcasting and you're a person who is now a friend of mine That came through podcasting and I was marveling over like wow What a cool medium that actually makes for it makes friendships happen It's so awesome And I was actually thinking about that on the way over in my own way because I was thinking how it's It's not you know, like I love doing podcasting general because I love Conversation but also like talking with you is so fun and like getting the Framework set up so that you and I literally just sit down and talk for like a long period of time Without interruption without like, you know stopping to check our phones or whatever the fuck like, right? It's awesome Yeah, it is it's an incredible medium and I want I Guess I want to start off talking about with you to get your take on this on this new project that I'm working on Okay, because I'm catching heat a little not a lot of heat Actually, most people are into this but I'm getting a surprising amount of criticism about this not a I'm surprised I'm getting any criticism. Okay. I'm worried to put it here's here's what it is Okay, I want to do a head transplant. I want to trance. No, I'm just kidding. I know I would support that Okay, what what I'm working on is So I ordered an Oculus Rift, you know what this is. Yeah, it's like the it's sort of like a virtual reality Helmet thing. Yes, that's right. And so I have an Oculus Rift coming and What I'm working on is a project right now. I'm calling the pod rift project, which is The goal is to create a virtual space or use a pre-existing virtual space Where people can come and watch the podcast being recorded live in three-dimensional fully immersive virtual space So what that means is it's some point when you come over to do the podcast if we want to do it this way You can put on these goggles and I can put on the goggles and instead of you looking at me across the table You'll be looking at a virtual avatar of me and then some kind of like alien landscape Surrounded by people who've come to watch the podcast. So we'll be doing this live in Virtual space now. I'm super excited about this because in the same way that I've gotten to be friends with you and like Daniela Bolleli Chris Ryan and and and lots other folks from doing this podcast People there's like communities that spring up around podcast people like the ideas that are being presented in the podcast or the tone And they meet each other and so there's this interactivity that podcasts foster, which I think is fantastic So I think if I create a virtual space where we can record this podcast not all the time by the way But it from time to time do this in a virtual space where people can gather together and watch in a crazy virtual environment It's going to amplify that connectivity of the thing if they have the Oculus don't need a rift Oh, you don't know because you could you know like second life, for example Okay, I got it. Yeah, people are using that in 2d now. It doesn't matter. Okay. So what's so what's the shit you're getting? People need to go outside more That's some dumb shit. Well, look, yeah, it's true people do need to go outside people have ADD They don't need the last thing they need is more distraction. Well, wouldn't this be a more focus? Yes, right. Yeah. Well, there's the other side of his look man. I don't want to fucking sit and watch people talk I don't want to sit and watch people talk for an hour. Well, you can still listen to it, right? Yes Yeah, so what's the problem or here's another good one? Look man, it's just not gonna be someone's here's another great one I got people are already were probably working on this Don't fucking do anything unless you're the first person to do it Yeah, I don't want you to take a piss unless it comes out original. It's so fucking weird man It's so fucking weird because look I recognize that this is a rudimentary Initially, this is gonna be all it's gonna be incredibly rudimentary and primitive. I go I recognize that I know that but I'm thinking Five years from now. Yeah, imagine this think of this Montseor Habib you can put on these goggles and Go into some like imagine if you're a sculptor you can put on these goggles go into a three-dimensional workshop in virtual space sculpt with some kind of Digital putty not existent in the real world, but possibly you can feel like Haptic technology or magnetic gloves can create a sense of resistance as you sculpt this thing You can sculpt to the thing not just by yourself But you could bring other people other artists from all over the world to work on this art Experiment with you and then print that out on one of these new 3d printers That's coming out and you have now taken something from hyperspace Merged minds with another person separate from the confines of a studio or the limitations rather of a studio and Regular 3d space and the tools there you could sculpt something as a forearmed creature Perhaps, you know, you could sculpt something with hands that are shaped differently What would it look like if I sculpted clay with bird claws? What would it look like if a bird tried to sculpt something for example, you this is not and by the way, this isn't like 2020 shit. This is right around the fucking corner Right, I want to be part of that momentum leading in the direction of the existence of these virtual spaces these tunnels into Alternate designer realities where people Separated from the confines of their bodies no more black white yellow fat thin Muscular male female whatever the fuck you want to be in this space. You can be a goddamn dragon flag. Okay, okay, so Okay, so I have a criticism, but I want to It's not a criticism. It's just my mind just sort of went in a bit of a different direction and I just want to bring this To you right because I am down with everything you just said. I think it's awesome I think we should be playing with those kinds of technologies I think you know, yeah, it is right around the corner the accessibility of it is probably for everybody It's probably not right around the corner. Just even I mean Many people don't have the internet many people don't have cell phones sure kind of shit, but you're right Totally down with all that but when you started describing it to me You put your arms out and you said I want you to imagine this miss your Habib and you closed your eyes And I thought huh well we can already do all that and in sure and in a way the way that we can do it is that we close our eyes and we go in and When someone's listening to this podcast, they have an imaginative landscape that they can engage with and Change any of the aspects including the sound of my voice if they want to as they're engaging Yeah, as an imagine it so Here's the thing happy with everything you said if We continue to develop what happens when we close our eyes but the way these things sometimes tend to go is as replacement and Substitution for what happens when we close our eyes and gauge with our okay Now let's think about that because that is a criticism that people are leveling about this thing is that this is the fear That somehow this kind of technology is going to cause an atrophy of the imaginative Function of the human mind see I don't see that because I think that no matter what I think what it's going to do is cause an Atrophy of the identification with the meat body. That's what it's gonna do It's gonna cause an eye atrophy of the identification with what is truly self I think that's definitely gonna happen but in virtual space you're gonna be as able to close your eyes and imagine whatever you want as you can in This world world one whatever you want to call it this archaic shit world by the way, man You know so not everybody is lucky like we are they don't get popped out of a vagina with two arms and two legs They you know what I mean? They they they don't get that or some people like when they come out of the vagina like they end up having shitty genes So they maybe they like have like some kind of like aspect of themselves that's like, you know Makes it so they get instantaneously judged in world one by all these other lumbering shitheads and by the way this fucking You know how annoying nationality nationalism is or American Exceptionism as Putin pointed out or the you know just if you watch some of these September 11th videos You just want to fucking go to Canada because it's like overwrought assholes weeping about like you can only be Jewish Yeah, I I'm I can be Jewish without being in danger because I'm in the United States I saw someone say that it's like are you out of your fucking mind. Where do you what what era are you broadcasting from? But anyway, what I'm saying is there's a physical nationalism that happens where people are in You know like when naturally beautiful people are proud of the way they look and take on this kind of snobbishness Well, fuck that I'm talking about a time in human history where we are freed from the confines of physical limitations merging minds and consciousness in the most pure way in virtual environments with the intention of Creating a form. Okay, but I I don't think that that's what this does because what what and again, I'm not let me just Put all this under the blanket of I'm not opposed to any of this I'm not a little right. I'm not any so like I called someone a lewd. I down my message board I'm not but what what I what I think is that okay, but you're just replacing one body for another so you're right It allows a sort of collective space But what we're doing is the same thing what we do with the internet to some extent which is we project our ego into a computer Yes, and so that's it's like I'd rather I want to look at this thing that we have right this physical thing Which I I don't think is just a meat body. I think there's this matrix of growth and Feeling and thought and then you know, it may be an ego descends and becomes heavy in these, you know, physical bodies We have not sure but but I don't want to Totally just say okay, well we don't have to do this thing anymore now we get to do that thing But actually it's just sort of a substitution And it's a limited substitution It's much more limited than this because the stuff that this does By this I'm gesturing with my hands and my physical body Since you can't see because we're not in the oculus rift space right now No, you could you could see my gay flailings when I'm talking But what this does it regenerates it changes shape it grows and yes, it's constrained in a lot of ways Yes, and there's all this think about how little you know about your liver and your spleen happy But all these things that are going on inside of us our heartbeat These all have real value and I think that they have real thought feeling and esoteric and spiritual value and just sort of just be Like well not this anymore, but this Thing that we've created but that's the problem is you're saying you're acting as though this technology Truly leads to the abandonment of this reality, and I don't see that I see this technology as being a way to amplify our human experience. You are so right you're so right But what I want and what I want to say is it's very funny because I've been sort of tuned into this like Singularity stuff for lately right so when I listen to episodes of your show and You're talking about it You talk about it a lot, and I also am very excited about the mergings of these technologies But there's this lesson which I feel like You might take to heart, but then we also have to do the work of sharing this lesson or exposing other people so they can take it to heart which is It's just It's a thing that Rudolf Steiner says but it's also just an occult thing Which is for every one step of occult knowledge you gain you have to take three steps to refining your personality Fuck so that's great, right? Oh, wow So and you know I mean who knows this was exact ratio or whatever I think it's a great ratio, but the singularity stuff and this thing that you're talking about That's the occult use of physical tools in a ritualistic way to create a certain power sweet God It sure is most people Have not taken nor will they take those three steps unless we do work to cultivate the refinement of the personality before we do This so while some people I agree with you be using in this fucking mind-blowing artistic amazing way Yeah, it's It's troublesome so so I want to talk about that part about the part you're talking about the excitement But whenever we talk about that we need this added feature We need this out as feature of refinement and talking about I agree. I think you're right man I think that's good to be cautious with technology and I I agree with you and And I welcome the debate. I welcome it. There's a guy Tom Butler. I'm sorry. I called Tom Butler He's a fellow post on my message board. I I called him a Luddite. I Called him a Luddite as I say I said I will and when I typed it I even mispronounced it. So who's the real Luddite, but I called him a Luddite He sounds like an earth-first asshole man. No, I'm just kidding. I think sounds awesome. No, but he's on your if he's on your message board He's listening and he's participating But you know I know I welcome the debate and I think it's good and I think what you're saying what I really like about what you're Saying is making the connection between this as an occult ritual and I want to did I tell you about the g4? 20 what's it called not g4? It's called the 2045 It was this conference this billionaire Dmitri Itchkov put on your electronic arm. Yes, you told me You should repeat it in case well on the the eeriness of the thing was that Itchkov had You know for those of you don't know Russian billionaire Dmitri Itchkov wants to create human immortality and wants to is a transhumanist and wants to merge with machines and free humanity from the bondage of this current three-dimensional space that we've been shit out of a giant as into and That sounds so negative I Don't really mean that but shit out of a giant. Yeah, I don't really I don't really mean I don't really mean that but so At this conference what was so strange about it was you felt that occult feeling You know that occult feeling when you go to rituals or ceremonies or temples There's a sense you like steeped in a mystery you can feel that vibration Yes, or when someone's dying or when a baby is being shit out of a born when a baby's being born You feel this sense of like whoa Well, they're That feeling was coming because what these people are doing Is they are ushering in This emergent technology or what I think they're calling technology actually the seventh kingdom of life I don't know how many kingdoms there. I think it's this they're really five but the sixth kingdom whatever they're saying It's a new life form it's springing into Existence and technologists are the midwives of this birth of this birthing and so itch cough had you know at this place monks And of all religions There are people so you have this combination of people with cyborg arms mixed in with people wearing Saffron robes walking around it's like what the fuck is this and what it is is that it's Just like any other great occult birthing that you see in the movies This is the dawn of a new era and we are bringing in a life form into this planet that is going to Permanently and radically alter human consciousness for as long as we exist There's no way to stop it. You will not stop this birth Rosemary has been fucked by the devil and she is gonna pop out this baby All of them witches Habib There's no way that's my favorite movie by the way Fucking love that movie. That's my favorite movie of all time. But yeah, okay, listen So I don't think I don't think technology I don't think this technology is the birth of a new life form I don't agree with that the thing is the life form was already born What's happening is that it's manifesting in the technologies that we use. I love it So the way that we start putting things together. It's like uh, okay I can tell you a really fucked up story, please. Um, so before I was in anthroposophy Um and Rudolf Steiner I had a dream that uh one night that there were all these monks in this church And they had these pieces of shadow And they were putting together all these pieces of shadow and forming this giant being that was just a giant shadow And they kept chanting this name over and over Ariman ariman ariman Wow Now ariman in anthroposophy is the being the entity of reductive science of uh, of materiality of consumerism And right now we live in the age of ariman basically We live in this and ariman is completely counter to human evolution, which is a crazy thing Like that's how he manifests now. So what Rudolf Steiner always said about ariman was it doesn't matter like we can't stop him from Manifesting or being born basically we can't stop the birth of the antichrist, which is what you said. What matters is how we greet him now um The weird thing about the dream is that I was hearing this name before I knew anything about anthroposophy And they built this giant man out of shadow and then he burst through the front of the church He was huge and the church fell apart behind him. He just lumbered off. Yeah now I might have heard the name ariman before it's a zoroastrian name. Who knows like but it was a fucking crazy dream and That's What's happening with technology? We have people that are essentially monks who are assembling these pieces of shadow It's this giant being that's going to smash through the church and leave it in rubble Now yes, we have to be careful with how we meet this being it's of complete It's of way less importance to me not to everybody but to me What we do with this being and how we decide to greet it and how we decide to react and and act and interact with it because technology all of it from turning a key in a Block to making a watch to making a cyborg arm all this kind of stuff It all requires this little piece of ariman. It all requires this piece of shadow And we can see this by how technology always sort of finds its way sometimes And sometimes we use it for good things and sometimes we don't but that's up to us. And so I Just want us to greet this being that existed as it manifests through all our little knickknacks and pieces and shiny bits of metal and microchips We need to know that something fucked up is coming through that as well And we need to be able to meet it with our hearts You know we need to be able to meet with our hearts and not to start intellect because the intellect is just The slave of right now. You know man I know exactly what you're saying and when you know when I was shooting this rogan show We got to meet people who are working on neural prosthesis, which is the implanting into the human brain Microchips that will allow people to move Robotic machinery with their minds These people a hundred percent of the time Were not doing this for entertainment and they certainly weren't doing it to hurt people They were doing it to help people who are paralyzed move again Right and although who's funding them? I don't know but I but that's that's I just want to bring that up to say like not to interrupt you for too long or to go down that path But the people who are doing it they're doing it to help people But their money is coming probably from people who are not Giving them money to help people. You know man. I got to say I don't I think it's probably Coming from people who know that they're going to make a shitload of money from making paralyzed people move again Okay, okay, because there's a ton of cash right now. I don't know this and you know I would imagine the money's coming from from that. You know, I'm not saying I mean Yeah, I'm not all pharmaceuticals and most pharmaceuticals, you know I don't think that they're being manufactured because the other end of the pipe is some guy who's like, I want to heal the world It's just right. It's one of the many investments people floating around in yachts are making right in the hope that if they hit it They'll hit it big, you know, the first person to reverse the aging process is going to be Uh, a super trillionaire and but and that what that produces is like This is on an off note, but like whenever I you know, you can go to Hearst castle up the coast And I whenever I see that stuff, of course, there's a hippie part of me That's like waste materialism and waste, but then there's another part of me that's like, man I wish there were moguls still This is beautiful, man I wish there are moguls and I feel like that all the time moguls are going to be born again And these are the servants of aramon as you say and the result is going to be there's going to be moguls again Because people are going to figure out how to reverse the aging process and people are going to make it so that the blind can see again with Optical implants and people are going to make it so that people Who have locked in syndrome will no longer be trapped in a fucking bed Completely unable to move but for the first time in god knows how many years They will be able to exist in simulated virtual environments where they can interact with other human beings again And brother that is worth all the fucking Aramon darkness that exists in the world as far as I'm concerned But that's a beautiful thing and I know what you mean when we invent a weapon Or when you invent a weapon, there's it's it's either going to be used to kill someone for no reason or defend you from someone Who's trying to kill you with a different weapon any object that comes into existence It can hurt because that's just part of the world. But this is what and this is how I see it We are about to burrow into our minds Into the very into a new digital medium We're about to burrow into space and time and create clusters of creative Consciousness, you know where we are no longer bound by our bodies or the physical form and god damn it that to me sounds so fun well, okay, but here's a here's a Let's keep going at it then I was yeah, okay, let's go at this little bit more because There's that debate between people who are deaf And people who are getting those off. What is it ocular implants? Is that what they're calling it? Yeah, I think it's cochlear No, ocular cochlear implants And there are deaf people that are saying no We're deaf like this is how we were meant to be. Yes. Now. Here's the here's the thing There is even when you give somebody The the thing to put in their ear that makes them hear the surgery or whatever There's something armonic that leads up to the invention of that device even as we think we're helping people It's the same sort of thing as wanting to democratize iraq because Instead of us developing our compassion for people that are Completely different than us and have a different experience of the world for us We're like we'll just make them like us because they must fucking hate not being like us Yeah, sure. So we already have this like issue. I think that I think I don't think that's a good comparison. I don't think that's you can compare Imperialism to Trying to help someone who can't hear hear again I don't think that's a good comparison and I think that it's important to note that there's a few differences One big difference those people don't usually have a choice. They're being fucking democratized by being invaded People who are deaf. Nobody's going into their homes and being like time down. Let's make them here It's a decision that you get to make if you want a Cochlear implant whatever it's called you get to decide to do it, you know, so I don't think it's a fair comparison I I know what you're saying You're but what you're saying if you trace it all the way back Is this idea that the way that we are when we come out of the pussy is the way we're meant to be Which I don't I don't agree. I I I don't believe in that. So I'm glad you point that out what I'm saying is that There's something about The people that are making these technologies to help people hear some of them are deaf. Some of them can hear right It is somehow related. Okay. So maybe iraq is not the best analogy But we used to have this big movement that was like a eugenics movement, right? That was like not too long ago Actually, it's crazy how recent this was which is like if they're not like us. Let's just eliminate them Now if we filter that impulse into choice Which is what you're talking about like these people have a choice. They don't have a choice That's one level of sort of freeing that up a little bit like you have the choice to do this or not But there is a piece in there. That's like Now that you can be like us. Yes Why the fuck are you not like us and then there's also a piece in there That's like now that you're not like now that you can be like us and some of you are choosing to not be like us How are we going to arrange our society to accommodate for you? So like um I'm trying to think I'm trying to think of a good hey cripple Get some fucking artificial legs man. What are you doing? You're making us shove you around in this fucking wheelchair when you have access anytime you want to 3d printed virtual legs that you can walk around in Yes, okay. Well, let's imagine that that's a possibility. Okay, you know Let's imagine that if let's just say that right now at this very moment all over the planet anyone who can't walk could suddenly have access to cybernetic legs that would allow them to walk that they could control their minds It's a not a fair question But seriously man, what percentage of them are going to be like, you know what? I'm going to stay in this fucking wheelchair You're right. I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about us I'm talking about we who Create an off the technology that we the legged who walk around who jogged down the street What happens part part of us wants to So so we want to give them these legs to help them that's part of it But then there's part of us that no longer has to go through the act of compassion, right? So like So how over how much work are we doing? How much inner work are we doing to be like? No, it doesn't really matter. I'm seeing this as like a as someone who is attracted to guys, right? Because there's this whole huge what let me let me explain. You're gay That would explain why my hands been on your flat this whole time It didn't just fall there Didn't just fall there numb Um, it's so funny because like a lot of people wasn't like holy shit, man. They're fucking We are um, so I think I think that uh I think that it's like as someone who's attracted to guys. There's been this whole argument since I've been You know, uh a teenager or whatever. That's like well gay is genetic gay is genetic, right? Whatever Um, which is first of all totally not born out by the facts. It's just not shown to be true It's just not proven. Yes the studies. Let's say that And so a lot of gay people have come to this conclusion where they're just like fuck you who cares like who cares where it's coming from I don't care if I was born this way if I chose to be this way if I blah blah blah exactly What's your responsibility here as someone that's looking in your responsibility is to be okay with it either way because it's not Fucking with anybody. Yes. So that's that's sort of what I that's sort of where some of these thoughts are coming from it's like instead of uh Again, I'm not opposed to giving the person the wheelchair legs. I'm just saying like How much inner work are we doing to think about the person in the wheelchair who? You know who doesn't have legs that work like how much inner work of compassion extension understanding? Are we doing I think listen? I think that that is going to be a problem regardless of the accessibility of technology that allows for the Freedom of self-expression because that's what we're talking about here. We're talking about freedom of self-expression and we're talking about the And development of compassion. Yeah. Well the development of compassion You know, I think that that's sort of that's a great thing No matter what development of compassion is always a great and wonderful thing. But god damn It's I don't know how how interrelated they are But I will say this to me There's a hell of a lot of compassion in creating technologies that free human beings from the burden The burden of their genetic their genetics their genetics not genetic they're genetic or their genetic structure or the genetic Uh, the the genetic fucking mask that we're forced to wear this fleshy Costume that we're forced to wear this Gravitational field the gravity well as they call it we're trapped in a gravity well and we're in some way predestined by our genetic form So what ends up happening is that the reaction we get from people based on what we look like or how we act genetic or not Whether if you act super masculine or super feminine and you're a guy you're going to get a reaction from the world one way or the other And you can't just change that you can't turn it on and off or shift it If you'd like to you can't instantaneously turn into a woman and look at what's happening now with Transgendered people who are turning into women because that's what they feel like doing look at the fucking reaction. They get for that Freaks look at a lady boy. She boy. She weird fucking angry eye rolling shit Like how dare they change their physical form. Hey, fuck you totally meet tyrant You can suck it, bitch. We're not going to be chained down to this shit anymore I agree. I agree with that But it's the horror of the white person of the white racist think how horrifying it is for the white racist To imagine that any ethnicity if they want to can transform into a perfect arian form That's a horror story to them. No Well, or it's it's the narrative that they want. I mean, that's what that's what the That's what the nazis that's what the nazis were trying to do. They're trying to turn people white I tell you these fucking racist man if they if the idea that like suddenly people could just shift color They wouldn't like they don't want chameleons. They want this stupid entitlement that comes from their The thing that they had the least to do with Right, but set letting my people go at beep. We're not going to be chained down to our physical forms anymore but you have but you have people who are Transgender who are changing their genders and part of that comes out of not the fact that they're Part of that comes out the fact that they we have to deal with this stupid concept Of gender in the first place, right? Like there's no idea of In this culture at least and there has been in other cultures of like some sort of fluidity of gender Like that got solidified at a certain point in history Yes Now there might be something essential about a masculine and feminine cosmic thing, right? But the idea of man and woman that's bullshit Like the idea of what's masculine and feminine and like little boys play with trucks and little girls That's bullshit. But because we've solidified that they have to change their material selves to deal with our stupid concept. Yes, and that's that's sort of what i'm talking about like I'm wondering like why are we doing this physical work to conduct the conceptual realm When it's like, you know, if everybody conceptually was like look, it's totally okay if somebody It doesn't have legs We're gonna work for each other to take care of each other to love each other to embrace each other to not make fun Of people who are in wheelchairs to like blah blah blah one of my favorite pastimes by the way Of course That's my whole my whole new comedy act is based on it's just all about it's just all about yeah It's so fun. Yeah, and you ease people in by like first there's someone with a lamp Then it's someone on crutches and wheelchair. Yeah, just a severed. Yeah. Yeah, it's so fun. I know No, man, I'm talking about let me just throw this out there. Okay one of my favorite days of my life I uh, I got to be I got to play freddy kruger in a comedy central sketch on Nick Swartzen's pretend time and the guy who actually put freddy kruger's prosthetics face on him Put like real prosthetics on me so that I like Turned into it was the same mask they used for freddy. So I turned in to this like movie monsters. So um I think I was also like chomping at her all or something. So it's also like kind of high while it was happening. So which was awesome. So like you like Looking at yourself in the mirror And not seeing you anymore But seeing this completely different face this weird burnt symmetrical monster face It's amazing. It like all of a sudden you're like, wow What would I act like if I was this person and right away your personality does start shifting a little bit It starts changing to conform with the face that you're seeing in the mirror That is fun and it's freeing and I think that that is uh an experience that isn't accessible To a lot of people we can go and put on masks people love halloween. They love dressing up as other things not just because um It's fun But because it creates the ability to no longer be bound by our physical form and act in the way that is expected of people of We're no longer stuck in the gravity of other people's expectations that we've grown used to by our genetically Determined physical form I love that. I think that's a that's that's a little bit of freedom from the gravity well And i'm this virtual environment that i'm talking about this virtual space is a way for people to experiment with no longer being trapped in that form I agree and I think so here's We're sort of talking about Two different levels and what we need to do not you and me because we agree on everything but we need to We need to find an agreement um between these different aspects of this phenomenon so like So here's like this spiritual problem like when you look at poor people and you see poor people are um Like you know oh like some people will say oh well you can be happy without money and like aren't we demonizing poor people and thinking Oh, they're so poor they can't be happy, but really they're happy right and then there's this other level That's like we need to fucking filter money into you know these poor people's lives So they don't have to fucking be poor anymore, right? Yeah, so those are two different levels It's like one is can you be happy anyway, and then the other level is Yes, but I want you to thrive and that's something different like I don't just want you to survive and be happy I want you to thrive and be able to access more things and blah blah blah So what all I'm saying is all I want to bring to these kinds of discussions Whether about singularity or about whatever you know you put your brain in a computer and a genie pops out whatever the fuck it's like it's like that I mean first of all I have all sorts of problems with with singularity technology stuff that I can talk about some other time But I'm talking about in this instance is that we Need to bring the conversation of the inner work We're doing to the table because fucking man wired magazine is all about The fucking technological aspect and they're like big future beautiful universe where you know we sure we're on this virtual space Etc etc like we're living forever all that But the component of the moral development is not brought by that And very often the people who talk about the technological advancement Confuse it for moral development and to me that's extremely problematic. Okay. Okay. Let me Pose this to you there. So we have the uh, think of the various famous mandalas for the one of my favorite being the Shri Yantra mandala. Have you ever seen that? It's like perfect triangles on top of each other. It's so beautiful and trippy and amazing This uh, mandala is generally people are only seeing it in two-dimensional space But most mandalas function in three-dimensional space. They're meant to be seen from three-dimensional so when you see like the Tibetan mandalas the sand drawings of these things those are representations of three-dimensional structures, right? You look at them from 2d space. They're beautiful But imagine being able to experience them from 3d space from the perspective of them being these enormous hyper-dimensional structures that you could fly around and investigate and touch Each side and every time you touch the sides or point to the sides You could see the scripture related to what this Thing means the ability for education is so profound or even in a more rudimentary way imagine the buddha experience imagine Uh putting on these vr goggles putting on the headphones and suddenly you are sitting beneath the bodhi tree meditating as the buddha and It goes through the temptations of the buddha as the buddha siddhartha. Gautama is attaining his enlightenment That's just fun the demon ma the symbolic form springing up in front of you You can pause it if you want pause simulation and you can ask what the fuck does that mean? Oh, well the demon ma represents the human's fear of death You know and overcoming the fear of death is one of the uh first movements in the direction of uh true understanding Man, that's a great tool and I guarantee that if we could transfer this technology back to the Days the early days that it would be used as a teaching tool and a tool to Show people experientially These things these uh these uh moral and ethical lessons that come from the great world religions Yeah, but that doesn't that would do nothing to morality like I I wouldn't consider that as having any effect on our moral compass the the Because it's the same thing with I mean a book is a technology sure bible's technology the people that uh I mean, I don't like using the word technology when it comes to the bible But you know what I mean like school is a technology all these things all these things are technique And so there's the technique that's external and then there's the inner work that you do So yes, the morality is just completely separate. It's like you can't get there With technology. It's just impossible. You can you can assist people. Yes, you can help them But there's just a different component. Well, no, I I don't think that you can use technology to inject morality into a human But I think that you can use uh, you can you can use virtual space to educate people and So many different ways. I mean aside from the spiritual component of the the possibilities that open up for Uh, I mean holy shit, man. One of my favorite things was uh One of my favorite memories is when I interned at the zen center And uh, you know, we would meditate for for every Wednesday We'd meditate for periods of 40 minutes sitting in the lotus position staring at a wall And I really enjoyed that you're doing it in the presence of other people. It's really fun To imagine being able to do that with people all over the world in a virtual temple Meditating well, you know with the rift on, you know I I love that idea to me that is so cool and I know people think oh, why don't you just do it in your house? No, I can do it in my house. No problem. Right, but this I can do also I think that's awesome. I think that would be great and I think it would bring its own set of problems. It's just like um, I mean we We have cars. I mean we can go I can drive today, you know Down to Mexico, you know what I mean? I can drive to wherever and that's brought its whole new set of problems Sure And so part of the way we deal with those problems is by generating some sort of morality in the way that we drive The way we encounter our cars all that kind of stuff So there's a separate lesson that would still need to be learned when it came to being able to meditate in the room With all those other people. I think that would be awesome I think it's a new experience and I love the idea of encountering new experiences and like you say all the time novelty Well get ready because we're gonna do it, baby. It's gonna happen. I'm getting the fucking I'm getting it made I fucking love all that my My life I try to say is not about having new experiences. It's about deepening capacity And so what I always want to do is create depth of the experience that I'm already having Like there's this painter Andrew Wyeth who said, you know, um, he lived in he lives I think he's still alive or maybe he just died. I don't know. He must be really old in Pennsylvania in Maine and he you know It's painting itself for hundreds of thousands of dollars and they're all super realistic So whether you like them or not whatever but People were like, why don't you go anywhere? He never went anywhere He's like, well because every time I take five steps out of my house I see something I want to paint and so it's just this depth of his experience every single day And so that is what um, that's the component that I feel like I just want to bring to my own life And I wouldn't say that's for everybody. I just want to um, sort of Tap on that a little bit that I love new experiences. I think they're really exciting, but that's not For me the ultimate thing that we should be going novelty. No, I know I know what you mean, man We can't always be chasing the dragon of novelty. That's just being a crackhead. I totally understand that I'm trying to trying to get high on the novelty pipe and then you're always seeking new experiences That's how you get herpes. I I totally get that man. This is a different thing and and I think that um, the what's so beautiful about it and so exciting about it to me is that Human beings are exploratory creatures We like to we like to we ours history is a history of migration You know, we've traveled we have within us this desire to travel into new spaces to explore new spaces The pilgrimage the idea of the pilgrimage is such an implicit aspect of so many different religions, you know, it's such a Um, important important thing to journey to a place You know to journey to a place journey to the promised land the story of Moses wandering through the great valley to you know and in like all journey to the prom Yeah, our journey to the fun. It's a beautiful beautiful experience to like move through space in the direction of some Uh garden of eden oasis some experience. Well, I think that This emergent technology is very similar Uh in that human beings are moving through time Currently we are moving through time Uh in in the direction of this new kingdom and this new kingdom is going to be a kingdom That is brought to us by technology because we're changing the nature of time and space That's what we need to do and that that's our path right now is changing our experience of time and space And that's what this would do Totally agree with you and I think like, you know arguments that um, You know, you need to go outside more or whatever you were saying before I'm not interested in those arguments and I think people often forget to say something as simple as like Uh That sounds that sounds like something and that's not what I'm doing. Do you know what I mean? It's like so someone who like criticizes this whole thing. It's like, no like what you're seeing is actually fucking awesome It's just that like it doesn't have to be everybody's Thing or everybody's path. Yeah, no one has to do it No one's going to be forced into this but And guess what if no one else is going outside imagine how fucking awesome it's going to be for you to go outside It's going to be totally empty. It's going to be like night of the comet empty. You can like empty streets First of all, think of think of this think of this. Yeah, so now it's like, okay We have because you know, there's this term the uncanny valley and the uncanny valley represents the Uh, strangeness of looking at, uh, 3d graphics and generally it's used for video games so in a video game if you see, um Uh, a person in a video game. Actually, I'll show you I have this new computer and I can show you skyrim at Uh, ultra graphics setting so you can see an example of what this looks like. It's cool But it's obviously not real. It's like you can the thing it kind of looks like It's a little bit more than a cartoon. It kind of looks like a mannequin or something, you know And it's like you're it's like a very detailed doll or something. So that's called the uncanny valley and so The next step and they're working on graphics engines that are trying to cross the uncanny valley so that a Uh, virtual a thing in virtual space will be indistinguishable from a thing in Uh, reality now once we cross That uncanny valley then What that means is and you combine that with haptic technology is what it's called which is uh A way to simulate feeling or motion. So that means now instead of being like, all right You got to drive to venice for a 40 minute commute to be in an office building so that you can be around people It's at 9 a.m. You put on your goggles You go into your virtual room and you work for eight hours and you work for eight hours in the space with other people Who are indistinguishable indistinguishable from people in real life? What that does is that it clears out the highways and roads and guess what the highways and roads are being used for now Recreation they're being used for people to go to the beach in the mountains and for people to go to the grocery store That's not recreation But it's still they're not being clotted with humans being forced to push their meat bodies together In shitty man-made caves where they have to breathe each other's farts and steal each other's yogurt all day long Yeah, I mean what you're talking about is this awesome like moral this this wedding of like a sort of moral perspective And the technology we're using and I think that's awesome. I mean I think you like if we first of all Here's the thing Nobody should have to go to fucking their office at all anymore It's fucking pointless like we don't need to have people going in their offices when we have all kinds of technology that Alleviates that sort of problem unless you really need to have some sort of interpersonal connection with the person that's sitting across from you That's interacting. Yeah So this technology if we begin to see work that way gives that to us and it develops into some huge thing It could also be the fucking worst nightmare ever where it's like We're gonna need you to put this screen in your house and we're not we're gonna need you to be interacting with this I mean it's like cell phones like you've said before Or maybe abby martin said it where you're just like Carrying around this device where someone can locate you at any point like you could also have that version of it So what what the version you said of it is fucking awesome and that's the version that I want to work towards So it's like no we need to de necessitate all this bullshit because that's what this technology was supposed to do That's what we used to think it was going to do like oh We're going to have like robots that build products so people don't have to fucking work anymore Which we could totally do or when airplanes were invented. This is so great When airplanes were invented people thought oh, there's not going to be any war anymore because this thing That's invented is going to eliminate national boundaries Now, of course the people who are in power totally fucked it up and decided to make those instruments of war So I think it's like I think it's really important to keep having the vision that you're Having so we can keep pushing on what's possible And so maybe i'm fear mongering a little bit when I talk about like the other side of it But I I just want no no no what you're doing is responding to the innate Uneasiness that rises up inside of us when you begin to consider This tsunami that's about to sweep over our subjective consciousness and how unavoidable It truly is because as much as you know You you you're not going to be able to you're going to eventually have to adopt this technology in the same way It's like look you want to fucking work in the modern world. Guess what? You got to have a car it used to be if you wanted to work in the modern world You didn't have to have a car because cars didn't exist work was done in clusters and villages You would only work around your house. You'd work as far as you get on your horse at the most But this notion of a commute that was insane cars come into existence. Bang. What do we get a commute? Spatiality suddenly is no longer as important distance is no longer as important because we can cover larger swaths of ground Driving these metal monsters fueled by dinosaur juice Guess what? That's that that that that's much more fucked up than the idea of transcending Time and space using instantaneous Virtual teleportation where people can work together and and collaborate because now it's like guess what? You know who works in my office? People from tokyo people from england people from india people from new york People from ireland they all work together in this office because the office exists in hyperspace But I just want to I just want us to fucking get rid of the idea of like work So like me too. So like that's you know, it's like oh well we had cars so we can go to work It's like okay, but I want to question this whole fucking dumbass idea of going to work in the first place Like not only do I not want to have to go to work No, I don't want people to have to do unnecessary jobs that make their lives fucking miserable That they hate that just poison themselves because they think that they have to do this to get this other technology Money to survive so they can buy food so they can pay rent, which is also completely crazy. Yeah, so all that kind of shit so it's like um so so How do we? attack conceptual how do we attack the conceptual problems with this external stuff and I just I don't know man. Like I just don't know if we can I you can now apply for a job in India You can with this with this when this comes into existence. It's like you want to go for your job interview Sure, you're gonna be working in Uzbekistan and uh, you can go have an interview with this person Uh, you know a virtual interview with this person and start work tomorrow If you wanted to it's going to create some disruption for sure because it's gonna it's gonna like What's an economy at this point? Like what's the economy if everyone's working everywhere else? What what is that? What like what what dollars are we using? Are we going to start using bitcoins or people just going to be paid and Bitcoins who knows there's all kinds of problems, but here's one great thing that happens here with this beautiful stuff is that the motherfucking auto manufacturers the people who have been like Selling us oil and gas and polluting the environment all of a sudden their technology is no longer a necessity I love it. This is called a disruptive technology. It's beautiful. It's subversive and it ruins It ruins a lot of shit technologies right now There's I can't go I want to be able to walk down the fucking street without having to worry about getting run over every five seconds I have to use the bathroom. Hold on. Okay. I want to throw another thing out at you here. Wait. Wait. Wait. I want to Oh, please. I'm sorry. No, I'm a little too passionate. Will you put will you put will you put that in your pocket? And we'll come back to it. Yes. Okay. So this is what I want to do So remember you and I were hanging out and you in San Francisco and you said, okay So you were at that conference. What was it called again though? You just have 20 or g something 2045 Whatever so so the so you were talking about how there are these mystics there and like compared to the people who Like we're making the electronic arms to help people who are amputees and stuff like that Mystics sort of seem like a little feeble. Yes. Like now fine. I think I think most mystics are probably pretty dumb I think most of them are phonies. I mean, I think I think most people who are like on any sort of platform of power Where they're educating others usually don't have that much absolutely, but Wow, I just channeled Daniel out there Total bullshit man so like so the the Thing is though and the thing I said to you because you were sort of like, oh, well, I You know, like they seem so feeble, but then these like, you know, um, these technologies were coming out and that was where it was at And I was like, okay, but here's the thing those technologies come from a concept Like we first have the thoughts and the images and the ideas and the imaginations of these things and then we make them So they actually stem out of our consciousness. Yes. So what I want to do is like this little thought experiment with you, um, which is like I Want us to be able to come to clear make more bring more clarity and sort of purity and intention to our Conceptual world our conscious world. Yes. Um, so that the technologies that come out Um are really from the beginning aimed at this kind of shit that you're talking. Yes, right? So basically I kind of just want to say like what is utopia? Not utopia because I hate people get so defensive about utopia, but it's fine. Fuck it. Let's just use it What does the utopia look like where these technologies are working for everybody? where People are engaged with the other shit their bodies Um transportation all that kind of stuff. What are some things that you see When you imagine that space so that as you start to use these technologies as I start to either use them or not As other people start to engage with them. What does that world actually look like and not just in response to all the Shit that's going on now, but like on its own is an interesting thing for me What do you see it at Well, I don't know I don't have some grand scheme because there's so many different cultures There are so many different people that will enact itself in different ways, but I see certain things definitely And these are things some of mine are not very technology based I mean I see people meditating more often and engaging in our spiritual world I see people being warmer with each other now. That's so like this is so new agey I see people eating food that's not poison, you know for them and I do see the role of technology as assisting Like you said assisting our inner growth. So um it it could be It could be some sort of farming stuff that has to do with technology that's helping us farm In better ways. Well, let me stop you there. You know what just happened in Kenya. Did you read about this? No So in Kenya using this new high tech tech geologic technology, they scanned a part of Kenya And they found an underground Reservoir of water that will supply Kenya with water for the next 70 years They say that you could fill it up with you could pour the Loch Ness into this 25 times There's that much water down there. So what this means is that in the next five years The landscape of Kenya will go from being because the soil there is very fertile, but it's it's there's not enough rain So this will go from being dry dead land where people don't have enough water to being farmlands And you know, you see like villagers They're just like over, you know, they showed the video of the water pouring up out of this reservoir And these are people who have struggled for water their whole lives Suddenly now the ground is growing crops. Yeah, so there's an example of a kind of a What you want what you're talking about. There's an example of It's literally changing the the landscape in a way that it's bringing the dead Soil to life that's so amazing and I think there are other examples in Africa Which are just so amazing and I wish I knew the countries But there are some hotels which are modeled after termite mound So they don't have any moving parts for the air conditioning. It's actually just the air comes in and goes out in a certain way So there's no cooling apparatus whatsoever, but the place stays 70 degrees the entire time day and night There are people who grow They plant trees in a certain kind of circle and then over the years start developing a roof So the house literally grows up from the ground and then they build the and then they put the roof on top of it They have this like and then they just uh sever the roots or whatever So cool in a certain way. There's all that kind of stuff. So that's uh technology related in the proper way to nature That's assisting people. So, um, it's stuff like that for sure, but I think I'm kind of uh I don't know. I'm interested in what your actual Vision is here. It is as far as I've gone with it. So here here's what it So we're looking I'm not going to go like super far Out in the future where we're talking about neural interfaces because I do think we're a Long way away from that. So I'm talking about, uh, what we can look forward to within the next, uh Year to two years. So year to two years. Here's what we can look forward to right now There are people at this very moment all over the world particularly in, uh countries that are uh Have have have more money, I guess Maybe not. I don't know. Maybe it's all over the world. I don't know. I don't know the extent of it, but Video video game technology is more than just video games is the wrong word for what it is video games are reality tunnels that allow people to experience Alternate identities within virtual environments in 2d space. Maybe if you have a 3d um Monitor then, uh, you can like shit will pop out of the tv or whatever, but it's still not immersive It's not fully immersive. So within the next two years what we're going to see is, um This, uh, omni directional treadmill, it's called the omni you can look it up I think it's called the virtual lux omni you can look it up, but Basically, it's a omni directional tread treadmill that is meant to go with the oculus rift where you're fully immersed in the game And you can actually walk around in the game and 300 360 360 degrees So now what the static experience Of sitting around playing video games where you just sit on the couch and eat doritos and get fat Now you're actually going to be running Inside the game you're running now walking if you want to walk in the game you're actually walking in real life So you're traversing space, which means you're burning calories So there's going to be some percentage of people who start adopting this and actually start getting aerobic workouts In conjunction with hyper addictive video games, which is going to Create this interesting new gamer who you know what I mean like the fit the fit game Yeah, the fat. Yeah, yeah the fit gamer now that that's something that we can look forward to I would say and and this is going to be Hyper coordinated people then too will be the result of that Because think of how much coordination it takes to fucking play your playstation or whatever now for Yeah, forget the controls because these limited controls These limited controls, you know with pressing buttons and shit using the keyboard. These are gone So now we're talking about people who suddenly become Really great marksmen people who suddenly become you know Who knows what it is, but that yeah, you're right They're going to become coordinated in the sense that once the omnidirectional treadmill technology improves You're actually going to be dodging and doing shit in real life Right, so you're so there's going to be a direct physical Benefit from playing video games that has never existed. There's only been this you know, I think Theoretical there have been studies that say it improves dexterity. I guess it does it makes you faster, but now we're going to see a physical Effect that's one piece of it. The other piece of it is that everything becomes immersive everything becomes um Your computers are going to be it's going to be from now. I wouldn't say two years Let's say five years five years everything's immersive everything goes from being um, I sit in front of this 2d screen and type to I put these goggles on and now I'm in a three-dimensional space representing my desktop, so I'm looking around moving around, you know, it's gonna what was that movie everyone always talks about where the lawn mower Not the lawn mower man. Yeah, that's going to be part of it, but it's like it's going to be this technology Merging with you're not going to control your computer as much from the keyboard you're going to control it from voice commands and from Actually moving shit around within this virtual space That's going to be the next part of it and then this is going to be combined with 3d printers So what's going to happen is you're going to start downloading stuff that you are going to implement in your house Stuff that you're going to use sculptures Tools who knows what it's going to be? But you're going to be able to download really weird shit and then print it out in your house So what we're what what's what's happening here is I don't know if you ever read There's a book about Terrence McKenna and Dennis McKenna and their attempt to go to South America and Enter into the dimethyl triptman realm and bring back from that realm one of these hyper dimensional structures Which they thought could Completely transform this dimension. Yeah, that was a pre cognitive moment for McKenna He didn't really he didn't what he was doing was a it was like he knew what was about to happen And he was doing it prior to the technology coming into being and he was trying to use psychedelics to do it That's really going to start happening. I think think about that dude So once we can the the typing thing is a little weird for me like as someone who writes all the time I realize that I'm such a more eloquent person writing than I am when I'm speaking So I feel like so there there is some definitely other type, but yes, exactly So you still be but the but the 3d printer thing for me That's so fucking awesome Not just because like I can print out like a couch or whatever the fuck But think about um all the fucking stores will be gone, dude So like we'll move into empty apartments with one thing which is our printer Yes, and then we'll just print our shit up and if we can do that in a biodegradable way Then we'll have printed out We'll have created in some way at least the parts of just objects that we need when we need them and then we get rid of them And I think that that's amazing like just getting rid of this fucking insane material So like when you walk down the street, what's going to be on the street? I guess you could probably still buy objects that other people have printed out because they but you the storefront wouldn't have those objects in them As much as like hey, you come in you want this we'll give it to you Sure Well, and there's gonna people are still gonna want to have like hand stuff that's made in world one You know if the substance is made in world one and things made in this world are going to be like Interesting things. It's just they're not going to be the only choice and um, that's going to be really great for people who Uh, maybe don't have the money to buy a nice designer table or designer chairs Maybe they're maybe like you could just download this stuff and print it out or even better You can make it yourself and print this stuff out. So there's gonna be that so what's basically happening is we will begin to burrow into Um virtual space and in virtual space we will construct forms that we then extrude into this dimension So it's like we'll fly into alternate dimensions create and bring that shit into this world Did you see the duck the video of the duck that got the foot the virtually printed? Yes, it's amazing beautiful little duck that had it was missing its leg and then they printed one out for him And and of course there's also going to be the ability to print meat Food there's going to be the ability to print. Um, now, I don't know if this is going to be in five years I would say what I'm looking forward to within the next five years is the ability to Interface with people all over the planet in a virtual environment very close to reality where I can record this podcast Um, uh with the same sound quality and the same, uh, sense of intimacy that comes Or at least 80 of the intimacy that comes from recording it and meat space That's what I'm looking forward to which so that's gonna really open up for me the ability to communicate with people outside of like um, uh Staticky old skype, which is okay, but I want to be able to I like sitting across from you But that's not possible for everyone and that's not possible for you all the time. I want to be able to do that um With people all over the planet. Well, you know like you know how porn drives technology like people Yes, have you heard of the thing that's like, uh, you watch the porn and you like hook this thing up to a dick And it like replicates the thing that's going on in the park. Yes I've never used one, but it looks awesome I came close to ordering one of those things until it showed the inner workings of the thing and it's just like, you know Why I don't know if I trust that goes high haywire. Yes. It's the same thing with the mouth though Yeah, but uh, yeah, that's true. It has a seizure while they're sucking your dick. Oh my god. That sounds horrible Or amazing. Yeah Yeah, what if you find out that's what you're into That's your that's your fetish But yeah, I mean, I think I think that that I think that that's amazing I've been thinking about money so much lately and how like What a weird technology money is and if we could somehow Like stand back and see money for what it is then our experience of it would just be totally transformed So that's something that I don't know if it can happen in five years, but when I imagine some sort of utopic state It's like so think about this dude. It's like when you go to the deli and get a sandwich Um, think about the fact that before you go there Like let's just try to just take money out of it. Just say there's no money, right? Yes If you look at that situation without money two people get up in the morning going to this place where there's all this food They spend all the time making it pretty and then they start making sandwiches just for you and you show up and they give you a sandwich And you're like, thank you. That's what that experience looks like without money. That's crazy. It's so altruistic And this is this weird thing about capitalism. It's actually totally altruistic On the face of it. But when you start getting this weird concept that like the money is the thing So it's like, yeah, I know what you mean So I want like when I go in and I pay for stuff now and I know this is like super new age You but it's actually really transformed my Moments of going fuck that fuck me saying that's super new age. You fuck. Why am I? Appeasing that stupid feeling. Fuck it. It's awesome So I go I go into the cafe and I buy coffee and when I hand the person the money I imagine this like instead of me handing them a piece of paper Imagine this like golden light that's between me and them that's giving them a feeling of warmth and me a feeling of warmth Right and my relationship with money has totally changed Totally changed because I'm like, I'm so happy to give people money when I paid my fucking phone bill I was like, this is this act of grace. Here you go And it just has felt amazing like I felt no attachment to it anymore Michael Beckwith uh once when I went to once you man, you gotta start going to agape once you have you ever heard of agape I've heard of a holy shit, man. You'll love it. But Michael Beckwith I remember him talking about one of the things he said is when you give when you start paying for things Stop looking at it like you're throwing something into the void and look at it more as though you're transferring positive energy into the universe That's going to come back to you in some way. It's like a energetic boomerang or like Alan Watts You know one of my one of his lectures. I really love as he talks about people go to the grocery store And they're you know, they're putting their groceries in the car and they're thinking, oh God, I spent so much money on these groceries instead of thinking I just transform paper And delicious food and wonderful things I can eat and use I just turn death and uselessness into this form. That's totally great And that you know shifting your relationship with money from being the sense of like, man What have I done to like I'm just converting one state of energy into another state of energy with my consciousness It's our version of the 3d printer Like I transmute this action into an object and so like that's what we that's our version of it right now And so like I don't I don't even I think that's awesome to think like yeah I'm giving out this energy or whatever But I also think like economics essentially is based on a principle of brotherhood like you're doing these things for me I'm doing these things. We're all like in this together The thing that's really fucking crazy and sick about it is that we think that we have to make money for a living And that's disgusting and stupid But when when we recognize that economics is a principle of brotherhood And I think not even like I'm giving you this shot of energy or I'm sending this energy out into the universe It's like, oh, you're my brother. Thank you. Love it. And that's huge That's changed everything for me. And so like I imagine Like a world where that kind of stuff is happening too And there are plenty of people that are working on that stuff and when you have local currency alternative currencies In um, like the birch shers and in maryland and stuff like that where people are using different forms of money Yes, it's recognizing that it's like, oh, hello sally bread maker. Here's you know, yep I'll sew the button back on your shirt, you know, yeah, whatever it is Now take that to the global level and imagine that that that form of transaction is possible at the global level Yes, holy shit, man. And it all goes back to what this technology seems to do Which is so beautiful in that it always undercuts Power it always undercuts hierarchy. It always undercuts control It always seems to do that and you're right, man. A lot of times this shit gets made for Bad purposes, but those bad purposes always end up being subverted into things that are for the people It's democratization is what ends up coming from this stuff. And I love that, man It's great. You can't trick us as well anymore like the government They used to really be able to trick people They could trick the shit out. They could just say whatever and you had to have like some Hardboiled journalists who could investigate and it would come out in a paper and it would take so much longer for it to spread Now you've got like people like snowed and Instantaneously You're a baby sending all over the planet like look look at this bullshit So when obama comes Tottering out on the red carpet and gives this like weird speech about how he wants to blow up syria You're not looking at him anymore. It's just like a president. You're looking at him as like You're the guy who authorized drone strikes that have a 20. They kill, you know, 23 of what they kill minimum as civilians. You're a person who Authorize the nsa to do illegal wiretaps You're the person who actually gave israel Private american informant you're that person you we know what you are mother fuckers So your speech doesn't mean anything to us right now because you've lost all accountability That is a direct result of technology, right? So the new problem is not that like you are you're so right It's become much harder to fool us But now this new thing the new danger that technology has brought is that people don't give a fuck anymore, dude They're like, oh, yeah, you're drowning people. Yeah, that's fine. Like people just don't give a fuck That's that's what I hid. I disagree man. I think that you look at like the 90 percent of the constituents of the house Told them not to vote. Yes on syria. Yeah, you look at what happened in uh in in the uk the first time since the 1400s David Cameron got voted down trying to go to war. That's the first time that's ever that's happened since I think the 1400s people give a fuck and not only do they give a fuck they can communicate better and the communications are coming to the people Who represent them and those people are saying no to the uh, um, uh These imperers who are pretending to be uh democratic representatives. Yeah, totally But what I think what I'm saying is I totally agree with that But what I'm saying is that the like the strategy of the obama administration and the clinton administration before him Has not been like the bush strategy, which was like like fuck you. We're gonna do what we want blah, blah, blah It's been like but look aren't we making your lives so pleasant? Are we making everything fun? So like The obama administration has sort of fucked that up like well, I mean bush fucked it up and clinton before him too But like because the economic situation for so many people has become so dire That's why they're not apathetic anymore But if I look at like when I look across the swath of like a lot of people who I interact with who are living Comfortable lives in san francisco working for google or whatever. They're just like I don't give a fuck man Like obama's the man like he's awesome Like they they still love so there's that level of like weird denial even people who are totally educated And people just not giving yes, you're right There are a lot of obama devotees and people who can't let go of their position on obama and they can't admit What's going on fine? Whatever because they're happy because they have like eight dollar Eight dollar locally made doughnuts But there's clearly a lot more other people than those people because obama had to fucking do a huge reversal That's some of the craziest speech ever. Do you watch that fucking thing? Yes sick total delusion Total arrogance. Do you remember the fucking part? It was so sick to me where he said well, uh, we we've been making progress with russia and like de-escalating the situation Partly because I wanted to go to war like do you remember he said that part and it was like You're so delusional that you think that you wanting to kill people Creates peace you're fucking crazy. No one's buying it bitch now That that's the thing because you know there that is what you know in a way like I you like to imagine like well Maybe this was just some beautiful faint where he Pretended that he wanted to go to war with siri and the end result is we got rid of the chemical weapons But you know what it really is You know what it is because here's what you can follow the series of events. What happened Oba the chemical attack happened unproven who it came from We think it might have come from Assad not a hundred percent certain immediately after that This is cross the red line obama said if you cross the red line, we're gonna blast hellfire missiles into your ass so Obama goes in the uk are supposed to team up on this and what happens wait Holy shit david cameron. They just voted no right and he's can't do it. Yeah, he can't go to war So he's like, sorry dude, you're on your own. I would have gone to war and now it's like wait, what? Then all of a sudden the pope this new badass pope comes out And he's like wait, are you just trying to sell weapons? And then all of a sudden 90 of the people in the united states are like no We don't want to go to war with syria. No, we don't want to bomb syria. And then all of a sudden guess what obama is he's just a Puppet who only has he's like his daddy or his parents were like you go to war and everyone else is like No, man. So you see that you see how clear that you see that so clearly when he said something which he reiterated Again and again through this whole thing. It's like I could do it. Anyway, if I wanted to I just want you to know that I just thought it'd be good for you if I asked for permission He's been reasserting that again and again and that shows like that's the that's an expression of impotence Like that's so Freudian to me. It's like my dick is big. I don't care how small you say it is Yeah, right, man, and it's pathetic because it's like I could be a tyrant if I wanted to but I guess this is a democracy Right, right, right and also like well, I guess I'll leave the tyrant to the tyranny to the professionals I'll leave it to the nsa. I'll leave it to the people who are torturing people. I'll leave it to the corporations I'll leave it to the bankers because they're the ones that are in control and you yeah Yeah, what about this speech? Imagine a president came out and said I was wrong Yeah I you know what? I feel like we should attack Syria because of chemical weapons If you said this I feel like we should attack Syria because of chemical weapons But it appears that the country that elected me Doesn't want that to happen and I am your servant So I will not do this and I apologize for my aggression What have we ever had a leader that accepted that sort of level of responsibility like even when like Like or just express that sort of honesty like Wayne Clinton You know got in the whole fucking below job scandal and wasn't didn't come out and say hey It's none of your fucking business like or like yeah, I like sex. I have issues with my wife Whatever like nobody fucking says shit like that ever like nobody acts like a human being like what the fuck is going on in that instance Well, what you're seeing is this kind of like the the technology is acting like a rubber band around this appendage that used to Its bloodstream was fueled by lies and that rubber band is making it so that it can't Have this energy source anymore, which is the ability to lie to people And so it's just becoming less and less like a human thing It's atrophying and becoming more and more like a freak when you see obama go like strutting down the red carpet You know what? I mean that awful fucking weird moment at the end of this speech where he's turned around and took three steps See you later Thanks for showing us the use to walking down the red carpet, man I guess he's not a hologram Yes, you got to walk back into your mansion weirdo. Is that a red carpet? Yeah, it's totally fucking crazy Freak, you're just some warmonger who lives in a mansion. You walk on red carpets By the way, it looks like shit or does it represent blood? You should you should have people carry you like on a peliquin Why not? Yeah, why was it was so fucking weird? Yeah, um, I what did I what did I just want to say about this? There was something. Yeah, the technology. It's like, yes That's an example of us using technology in the right way, right? Yes, then there's the fucking shadow side, which is the same version of which is the nsa Using it to connect everybody for themselves and not release all the information. Sure Again, it's just like the way that we use the technology is a thing that's crucial the tech technology it connects it bring harmonizes it brings together and power depends on the disruption and the uh breaking people apart into pieces, you know and economically or racially or philosophically or whatever so The what the problem is that like the more people fuse and merge together the more difficult it is to break them apart And that we win in the end we went in the end unless they figure out a way to turn off the fucking internet Which they're not we win and you will see these pompous puffed up um antiquated versions of leaders more and more and more backing down in the face of the great Beast which is society because when we merge together man, you can't fuck with us You can't when the people join together when they truly unify come on you can't do anything It's the horror of the tyrant There's nothing worse than when when this thing that they've managed to break into all these separate pieces Suddenly forms and grows together into this one Honest thing that demands truth. They're done. Yeah, they're done. So you get to see these little Little temper tantrums that you would have been That would have been if there hadn't been a snowden If there hadn't been if there hadn't been wiki leaks if there hadn't been people like assange If there hadn't been this ability to confer to people. Hey, here's what's really going on Guess what would be happening in Syria right now, right? Fire would be raining from the fucking skies We would be going into Iran within the next year. There would be world war three and who knows what the fuck out Yeah, it's like this weird. Um, it's like this weird duo directional thing, right? Like so and We have to okay because you brought up snowden and manning and wiki leaks and all that kind of shit, right? So those people stuck their fucking necks out, right? Yes, and what was the first thing they did and abby said it too and you said it when you were talking to abby God i fucking love abby, right? She said it too. So like you Which is you have to become unafraid of death. That's the first step So like that is fucking spiritual development, dude You have to be afraid to not be caught punished dead any of those kind of things when someone does that when someone does that What the fuck are they gonna do to you dude? Yes, you're just like well, you know what? I'm not attached to this shit Yes, so like you can't do anything now that doesn't mean it's not going to be unpleasant terrifying scary awful all that kind of Shit, especially if like in north korea. They like come for your family I come for your you know what I mean? Then it's something different But when you get to that state You you can do whatever and then at the same time snowden did that and utilize the technology So he pulled himself into the spiritual world and deepened into the material world at the same time into this weird Directional thing so he occupied both spaces As was this true spiritual act he spiritualized the material and materialized the spiritual And then look at the rippling effect when just one person does that beautiful so intense It's so intense and that rippling effect is being amplified by technology and In the ability to communicate So I think though you're right these sons of bitches want to turn this shit into the into like In uh, they literally it's like if you look at what what is a bomb? What does a bomb do a bomb? Literally separates Matter all right. It breaks apart. Yeah, and that's what in and that's a that's They're trying to use technology to separate and break apart the physical form They try to use it to separate and break apart Communities they try to use it to separate and break apart whatever they can because there's more power in that But they can't fight against the great flow of time and if you look at the history of evolution, it's all about symbiosis leading to Um Full merging, you know, and they can't stop that they can't stop that and and and the more they stand in the way of it The I think the more they're going to like experience these kinds of like Global tumbles what you're seeing what which is what you're seeing with obama. I think you're seeing uh, you're seeing total fumble Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, so we just have to like I have this image when you're saying that if someone like Some enlightened person or just a normal person Hate the term enlightenment, but just some normal person like You know, it's like a political cartoon like looking up at a bomb dropping down on him and saying is that the best you can do Like yes, you have no fucking power You know and like and the idea that this person has no power and when people who are in the military start realizing like Like manning did like other people like hey, you have no power over me I know I entered into this institution when the police the people that sign up to be police are like No, you have no power like that kind of stuff when you have the people that are engaging in the system Pulling out and being like this doesn't have power over me and yes apparatus. You know, it's really something It's really something and it's a it's it's it's going to be quite interesting to see what happens Mr. Habib, how can people find you? How can people uh connect with you using this this primitive twitter bullshit internet crap that we're dealing with before we can Fly around together as butterflies and some hyper dimensional wasp nest Where we're creating three dimensional structures that we can print out Just develop your sense of telepathy and send me an aquaman style message No, just twitter is the best way.

Greetings to you, my sweet, beautiful children of the noontime bloom. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, and dear God. Every once in a while, you reel in a great podcast, like a great, beautiful, hyperdimensional podcast. Like you were sailing on some kind of moonship, and you were fishing with the skulls of cremated, enlightened beings, and you got a bite from inside of a black hole, and you pull it out, and there it is, this incredible sonic blast of magic. That's what we got today. So I'm not going to spend any time on any kind of intro. We're just going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. Roger fell into the chipping machine. His brains and his body were turned into cream. Bits of his spine flew up in the trees. And all of us were screaming. But before Roger's widow put on her black lace, she went to his website he made on Squarespace, and using an AI reconstructed his face. And now he lives on forever. My name is Roger, and I live eternally in a screen. I've been reconstructed. It's a dream. I'm so glad that I used Squarespace. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by squarespace.com. Friends, did you know at some point in the future could be next year, it could be 500 years?

Create a website, reassembleme.com is available. If an AI was on the fence about reassembling you and saw your website, it wouldn't be on the fence anymore. You could live forever, but not if you don't have a website. You see, at some point in the future, it could be next year, it could be 500,000 years. Artificial intelligence is going to be at the point where it can gather bits of data from your social thumb print. Every little thing you've done online.

You'll get commercial free, unsullied additions of the DETFH that come out sometimes weeks ahead of other episodes. Though I must admit, I'm in a bit of a podcast. I don't know what you call it. I'm recording them week to week now. I've got to bank them again. But when I bank them, they first go to Patreon and then they go onto the main feed. Also, once a month, you'll hear a long, rambling monologue thing. It's a fantastic, oh, also we've got a Discord server where you can communicate with others who are drawn to this podcast or things we talk about in this podcast. Go over to patreon.com forward slash DETFH and subscribe. We also have a shop located at dunkatrustle.com with all new stuff. If you've seen the old DETFH stuff, claw your eyeballs out.

Beautiful, sweet new merch. You can find that by going to dunkatrustle.com and clicking on the merch section. And finally, certainly last but not least, if you want to help out the Love Server Member Foundation, they have created, I don't know what you call it, a new musical division where they're combining forces with musicians like Justin Beretta, today's guest, and lots of other, hopefully lots of other musicians to create musical representations of some of Ram Dass's lectures and teachings and other members of the Satsongs teachings. They want to produce albums basically. And so they're raising money to do this. You can go to propeller.la, sign up, donate some money to the Love Server Member Foundation, and you will enter into, I guess, a sweepstakes, I don't know what you'd call it, but you could potentially get a free retreat from November 28th to December 3rd, which is pretty incredible. So if you enter this thing, you know, and they draw your name, you'll be going to Hawaii and laying in the sun and snorkeling and drinking my ties and absorbing the transcendental teachings of some of the great spiritual teachers of our time. Also great my ties, great snorkeling, beautiful reefs, and it's right down the street from the Ritz. I don't know why you'd want to go to the Ritz because it's a beautiful resort. I went up there and ate sushi once, and I felt weird that I wasn't at the retreat. So that's great. Holy shit, do we have an amazing guest with us today. The Glitch Mob, as you already know, is a powerhouse band. They create some of the most amazing electronic music, and they put on these hardcore, incredible shows. If you've never been to a Glitch Mob show, you've got to go. It's like a combination alien landing, teleportation into another realm, mixed in with atomicly vibratory music. I don't know what that is. You're gonna get your atoms vibrated at these shows. Justin's a music producer, a musician, and a spiritual seeker, and he just made one of the coolest renditions of a Ram Dass meditation that I've ever heard. We talk about it in the podcast, so let's just jump into this thing. Everybody, please, without further ado, welcome, today's esteemed guest, Justin Beretta. Welcome, welcome all of you. Glad you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. I couldn't find the theme song. I looked all over my computer, it was happening. Would you talk in your microphone, Leah? Check, check, check, one, two. That looks good. It looks pretty good. Let me turn yours up a little. I can scoot a little more forward, too. Pop that up a little bit. I think that looks good. What did you talk into it, Martha? Perfect, check, check, one, two, one, two. Oh, beautiful, okay, great. All right, here we go. Justin, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming over, man. Hello, Duncan. Hello. Good to see you. Good to see you. Holy shit, man, I gotta get this out of the way, because if I don't do it up front, I think not only will I be disappointed in myself, but all of the fans of the Glitch Mob who might be listening to this will be disappointed. We have to address it, and then I wanna dive into the deep spiritual waters, even though the Glitch Mob and those deep waters I don't think are separated at all. Absolutely. So I'm gonna ask you the cheesiest question of all time, but I gotta ask it. I was going to the raves a long, long, I was going to the raves when they were like video arcades, you know, like when video arcades, like how you would mostly play cool video. I was going to the raves when Mortal Kombat 1 was like amazing, back in those days. Finish him. Yeah, hey, exactly. And I always got this weird impression, depending on how high I was, that the music was coming from like aliens or from some kind of higher consciousness or some kind of like this was a channeled transmission coming in from some other realm. Yeah. So the Glitch Mob, not DJs, but I don't know what, I don't know, like I'm not even sure how you would like describe this phenomena, which is you guys put on this incredible show that makes me think, well, I guess if a UFO landed, this is certainly one of the ways it might show itself. So forgive me, I know it's a long set up to a very simple question. Sure. Is the music coming from aliens? The answer is yes. I knew it! I knew it! And we are all aliens here. Yeah, right. There's something about music, and this is also gonna sound like a platitude and it's gonna sound cheesy, but it's true is that the best stuff happens when we get out of the way and we don't actually really know where it comes from. And it's like when we think about it and we overcomplicate the whole process too much and we analyze, then it can become contrived. But all of the best moments have come from somewhere else and it's really, really true. So maybe it's from aliens, maybe it's from the universal loving awareness, consciousness orb in the sky. Who knows what it actually is? I really, I can't say for sure, but it is true though that there's something about electronic music in the way that we play live that is us trying to tap into some otherness that you can get into with music. So we play an instrument that we've built that's custom, it's called the blade. And there's something very cinematic about it. And the whole thing is just another way into the music and back in. So we create the visuals and the videos are all stuff that will lead rabbit holes back down into the music. But the truth is we don't actually really fucking know how the music works at the end of the day. It kind of just comes from somewhere. Right. That somewhere is what I want to talk with you about today. One thing that I have, and I think it's bad. The older I get and now they have a child coming, I guess you could say I'm getting soft and all the things I used to really shake my fist at angrily. Now it's just kind of like, I don't wanna, I know why you were trying to do that. You're cool. But in the past, one thing that I've just viciously, viciously just gotten really in the dumbest way angry about is like, you'll listen to like Terrence McKenna, you'll look for Terrence McKenna lectures and somebody is gone and put a fucking trance music underneath it. And you're like, I want, I want this free of trance music. I just wanna listen to. Just hit the mute button on the song. And the reason is because it's like Terrence McKenna is channeling the over there in his own way. And whoever is putting the sound button beneath it is like somebody running around in front of Terrence McKenna with like pom poms or something, right? It's like, we don't need, Terrence McKenna doesn't need cheerleaders. Sure. I just like him straight, okay? Absolutely. But, and so I've always thought, why does this always happen, this phenomenon? But then, Justin, you annihilated, annihilated my ridiculous and backwards and small-minded idea that we can't interlace music with great spiritual teachings with your track, Imagine, that you did with Ramdas. Thank you so much. Oh my God. It was so incredible. It's one, to know that now I have eternally this tool to help me meditate. But two, to like watch the way that, or listen to the way that you have purely reflected that, what that is into sound. Oh, wow. How did you do it, Justin? That's incredible to me. Thank you. That means a lot. You know what? Maybe I'll just stop here. I'm gonna play a little bit. Can I play a little? Do you mind if I play a little clip of it? Absolutely. Let's do it. Okay. So in the next few minutes when I'm reading to you, try to find a comfortable place where you can be with your head, neck, and chest in a straight line. And you could be lying flat down, or you could be sitting up. Meditation is many things. It can be meditating on an object of meditation, or it can be a process of letting all objects go by. The process now is to dislodge ourselves from our inordinate attachment to our own thoughts. So tell me the process of making this kind of music that pairs with one of the great spiritual teachers. Yeah, well, it's a bit of a long story. And I don't think I've actually really articulated the whole thing out to anyone. But it's funny because I had a very similar experience with some Alan Watts teachings. I love Alan Watts, and I had been reading him for a long time. And I remember going on YouTube and listening to some of his talks, and most of them don't have music. But every now and again, there is one, and they would put these really heart-string, gut-wrenching strings behind it, and I felt manipulated. And it's really beautiful because then music can be manipulative. That's the power of it, is you can play something, and all of a sudden, you're just crying. Just, ugh, or maybe, and so that person is actually trying to put their interpretation of whatever the text is. So I was like, with Alan Watts, I felt like I wanted to hit the mute button. So with the Ram Dass thing, just to rewind a little bit, I had had Ram Dass and his teachings around me. Actually, for most of my life, my father had be here now around, and there are some books, and I even remember picking it up early, maybe in my early 20s when I started getting into psychedelics and spirituality, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it. There's a lot of talk about God and Guru, and I was like, what the hell is this? Terrence McKenna made more sense to me. It was a little bit more, there was something about it that was really easy to round my head around. And I had bought books over time, and then it wasn't until actually, over the past couple years, that just some experiences in life with psychedelics, with some ego-destroying psychedelic experiences I had, which we can go into. But for the most part, I came back around to Ram Dass teachings after having some very deep psychedelic, spiritual experiences, and I was like, oh, it all comes back to love, and God is love, and liberated the idea of God for me, and put just the language of love and loving awareness back into everything, and it was almost like he handed me a map of this new realm, like a video game, someone was like, hey, take this map, it's the map of love and your heart and everything, and then it really changed everything for me, and it was the beginning of a sort of unfolding. So I thought right away, I was like, I wanna create something with this, that's the way that I just speak about these sort of spiritual experiences that I've had as their music. So I started reaching out to some friends and got in touch with them at the Ram Dass Foundation with Raghu and Rachel, and they like this idea. But I found the imagined meditation is actually from 1972, right after he came back to the United States is what they told me. So there's something in his tone that was very, very special. So when I created that, I wanted to actually paint a picture of some of these spiritual transcendent experiences I had had. So it was really for me was almost like a diary piece or a piece of poetry about this place that I had been, but I also didn't want to have the music get in the way of it. So it was really meant to be like a room, it's just a container, it's not trying to say anything too much, but it's also ambient music is interesting because it can get real cheesy really easily. You can feel like you're going into a spa. And I love ambient spa music too. This is not, I do, I love it. I listen to it all the time, it's okay. But with this, I wanted to make something that was use the sort of sound design world that I have from working in World of Glitch Mob after all these years and other projects is something that felt like interesting and deep, but at the same time didn't take over the music. So a lot of the, actually I would set up textures and then just play everything. So it was all done very, I just have the Ableton push. I set it up, everything's in C major and I just sort of hit buttons and let the whole thing kind of unfold. And then there's the sounds of a fireplace in there that I recorded that I felt was calming. There's something about fire that makes you feel like, oh, we're sitting around a fire. So there's a lot of really subtle things in there. Really, it was just about letting the Ram Dass vocals just do their thing and not really getting in the way. It is perfect, man. It's just, thank you. By the way, not that listening to guided meditation, it's great to have it, but to somehow like suddenly this pairing of like the meditation with this wonderful, I don't even call it an interpretation because it isn't, I guess a room is a great way to put it. It's like it does not get in the way of it at all. And yet the shifts in it with each moment that in this particular meditation, which up until I listened to your, I don't wanna call it a version of it, but to listen to imagine, I didn't really like that guided meditation. There is something in it I can never connect to. Sure, yeah. Because it's this, you're drawing in this being. He has a particular tonality to it, it's true. Yeah, but it was, to me, it's the idea of like, well, this is, I mean, again, the older I get, the more I was like, wow. I'm just, in my brain, it's just like a blistered pair of testicles that I just keep kicking with my thoughts over and over. It's like, why do I do this? It's so, so, so. Your brain has its own pair of testicles. My brain has a pair of like testicles and pants that are too tight that keep getting kicked over and over again by my identity. It's a stupid relationship. It's like my brain is like an S and M dungeon sometimes. But I, so I don't even know why I would have, this would have bothered me, but because it's such a beautiful concept, which is that we sort of draw into our hearts, the transcendent embodied in the form of the Buddha, Nibbukri Baba, some being, and then through that there is this like incredible, that guided meditation is such an incredible step-by-step guide to moving into the transcendent and also coming back here. That's the other beautiful thing about it is he brings you out, way out, and then brings you back. And somehow I just missed it until I heard your version of it. And then it's like, oh, right. Especially when he starts talking about love. Yeah. What was the, what was that sound you were using? What is, how did, what is, what do you, what was the name of the scent there? What's the sonic replication of the concept of love? That for me was something that I was, it was a very throwing spaghetti at the wall sort of, sort of process. And you know, I have tons of different plugins and there's a used Omnisphere on that a lot, which has a lot of really organic textures. And then there's this company called Output, which make this stuff for, everything has a lot of texture and motion and everything into it. So, and I have tons of field recordings that I've recorded over the years that I'll sort of mishmash in there. But with, I remember when I was doing the part with love and also specifically the part when he's like, look at all the problems that yourself thinks it has. I felt like, oh, that's such a nice thing, just to say, and if you can really get there, it's so cathartic. But with, with love, it was really, I had set up, set up a whole system in Ableton in the push with, with a whole palette of sounds. I had like 60 scents and sounds going in there. And I was actually just playing with my eyes closed, just riffing through. And when I heard that, I didn't even know what it was. It was just, I hit the sound right when he starts talking about love. And I felt like it was starting to, to sort of blossom. And also, it's, yeah, I was picturing like flowers sort of opening up. And there are, I think there are six sections in there. But in the beginning, I thought of doing one sort of long ambient thing, cause that's typically how it's done. But then what I realized is almost like on a psychedelic trip, how you go through little realms, right? There's like, you start off in the first bardo and then you move to this, then you move to that. And that's the sort of, that's the interesting thing about a trip or meditation is that it's not one static place. So I wanted to make almost like six different little rooms or worlds that you pass through. So there's these sonic, sonic landscapes that mishmash together. So each one has a distinct section. And then there are pieces of them that sort of flow and each one together. But it all, it kind of, it came pretty naturally, but it took me about six months to write that. I mean, the first versions were awful. And I was going through my own process. I actually remember sending it to Ragu and Rachel and they were like, yeah, this is, I think that we think this is going to be right. But it felt a little dark. Like I hadn't tapped into what love sounded like for me yet. I'm sorry. I was not aware that there was an actual back and forth with, with Ragu. That's so cool. So this was collaborative. It was absolutely. I sent them the one early on, although I would say that I sent them a couple back and forth and they were like, yeah, this, this is, this could be good. We can see what's happening. Then I went away and worked on it for a while, then sent this back fully baked. And then Ragu actually called me and said, hey, we receive lots of music and this is this, this feels like you really captured the vibe. So it was, it all kind of came. I had probably seven versions of stuff that didn't quite feel right cause it was, I was just looking for the right thing. But yeah, they were, they were great in the whole process and helped facilitate the whole thing. That is wild, man. To like, doesn't that blow your mind to think that, I mean, I think back to the little winks that you get from the guru or God or whatever you want to call it, the little like things in your life. The little universal ding, hello, hello. And it's like out of the corner of your eye, there's be here now or like out of the corner of your eye, there's a picture of Neem Karoli Baba. You know, I was just this, where did it go? That picture of Ram Dass over there. I've had that forever and I was looking at it and then I realized like, oh shit, right above his head is a picture of Neem Karoli Baba. And I never saw it all the time, I was just right there. It's, you know, but whenever I look back at the little breadcrumbs that are left here for us. I love the idea of breadcrumbs. It's cool, isn't it? It's so cool. It's like you're like, okay, I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna get lost as I can. But can you please just leave a couple of like notes, love letters, a little, can you just leave here and there a little mark? It's a little glow stick, just something. Something to let me know that everything's gonna be okay. And to me, that's what the satsang is and that's what be here now is and that's what the Bible is and that's what any of the great poems are and that's what music can be. Do you feel in your creative process that do you ever feel this sense of resistance to becoming a missionary for that place? In other words, do you ever catch yourself thinking like, I wanna leave breadcrumbs for other people who might be lost out here. And then right after that thought, you think, ah, what's wrong with you, man? You know, you're not a breadcrumb leaver. You're just here to have fun and make music. You gotta be the breadcrumb. Yes, I'm merely a court jester. Yes, absolutely, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think that's the interesting thing about creating music is that there are times where you wanna actually say something through it and I think for Glitch Mob in particular, and we have a message, there's something in the music. I mean, it's hard to articulate what it actually is, but we leave breadcrumbs. There's a lot of stuff in the song titles, but it's obfuscated. It's not really clear. So I think that's the coolest thing about music. For instance, there's this one song on the record, Take Me With You, and on Glitch Mob's last album, called See Without Eyes, which is also a sort of a reference to what we're talking about. But I remember the first time we played it for someone, and to me, this was a super hopeful, beautiful, cheerful sort of song, and someone heard it and they're like, wow, the song's so fucking depressing. It's like, and I thought, but that's the coolest thing about it is when it's abstract enough, it allows people to have their own experience with it. And we're not saying that this is happy or sad or anything, it just sort of is. And I remember that's the power of music. So I think the best stuff happens when we put ourselves into it and we're just as authentic as possible and then let the pieces sort of fall where they may. But we do leave, you know, in, there's sort of some hidden poems in the album. The album titles have stuff, you know, we have some references to Ram Dass' references to Tick-Not Han in there, but we let sort of people unfold it. But if they also don't, if they aren't into it or maybe they never see it, that's okay too. But it is true that when you have an incredible transformative experience, whether it's with psychedelics or hiking or anything, you want to proselytize and you want everyone to feel it too. I mean, that was the first thing I felt when I actually went to go spend time with Ram Dass and Maui and talking to him, the look in his eyes and the feeling I felt, I was in there in the room talking with him for two hours. And I left being like, I want everyone to feel this thing and I want to do everything I can to spread this love. And of course you come back down from that experience and go back to life and then you go to the airport and everything, you can still have that there. But it is true that there's something, all your ego wants to say things and create a narrative. But really it's all about just in the being of that love and creating from that place that I think is actually enough. Wow, yeah, right. Well, I think what you just described is skilful means. So it's like, here's this very important thing. We have to reduce it to the material universe because that's where we're at. So you end up with these hilarious examples of it. I think one I heard was, fuck it, I'll just make up my own. But it's like, so bomb squad, right? You've got a bomb squad. You've got somebody, a bomb technician. And he's on the phone with some guy who's far away, but safe. And this guy far away, he's got to talk to the bomb squad technician in a way that doesn't make it seem like he's scared at all. He's got to seem just completely calm and he's got to perfectly understand the psyche of the technician so that he doesn't like, in any way, shape, or form, add to the stress that's already happening and the deactivation of this terrible bomb, right? So just first things first, whatever it is, you do not touch the black wire. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't be like, yeah, or exactly. You can't be like, one thing you wouldn't want to say to someone deactivating a bomb is, I love you, John. I just want you to know that, man. When you're gone, I'm going to remember you. I'm going to take flowers and you'll crave. You're going to be, if you get, listen, we, I guess one good thing about this is we're not going to need a coffin because you're going to be exploding these hamburger bits. We could, like, we could put you on a back. Like, there's all kinds of things you don't want to say to someone deactivating a bomb, right? And then there's all kinds of, there's ways that you could communicate to a person in some pure technical way. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to deactivate this bomb. And I already know you've deactivated it. It's in your voice. You can hear it. I know you've deactivated it. Like, it's there. And so the person working and the person talking to him, explaining about the deactivation process, almost merge and become the same being somehow. And in that moment, the bomb. I love that. Yeah, yeah. And that's scuffle means, right? Which is that, that here we are in this fucking place, which is on one level, party land. We got Margaritas, we got, we got fucking, you know what I mean? Nachos. Nachos doing football on the beach. And we got, we, it's awesome. It's party land. We got balloons. You know what I mean? Clowns. Bouncy outfits. Puppies. Puppies. Sex. Orgies. Yeah. Fucking the orgy tent. And it's true on one level, that's all happening. And it is, it's all there, it's all there. On another level, we're deactivating a bomb. Right. And the bombs are karma. And the teachers are the ones who are like, the great teachers are the ones who are teaching you how to deactivate the bomb. But simultaneously, you feel like you're at the beach. Right. You're deactivating the bomb when you're in the airport and there's something happening that you don't like. And then there it is. It's all unfolding in front of you. Yeah. Yeah, man. And so, so learning how to do that seems to be part of what it is to be in this realm. It's like the teachers not only to transmit the bomb deactivation technique and help you deactivate your own bomb, but simultaneously you can find yourself helping other people deactivate their bombs. Right. Right. And that's what we were just talking about just before we started recording was one of the things was when you come contact with the teacher that resonates with you in a certain way. We were talking about in that other realm of pure consciousness going there and seeing, for me, I had a connection with a friend of mine, this artist's name, Andrew Jones. And this is, I don't actually know if I've ever told him this before, but Andrew, if you're listening, I had an experience where I- Also known as Android Jones? Android Jones, yes. I had a high dose psilocybin experience where I totally left and went to the other side and I was by myself and it was very, very transformative and beautiful and when I sort of, I went through some difficulty to get there, when I went to the other side, I saw some friends of mine, we were talking about this place, sort of like this festival of teachers on the other side of these guides that are like, oh, hey, oh, you're here, hey, how's it going? For me, I saw Rob Doss, I saw Android Jones, I saw my friend Jonathan who we've had, we sort of been on the spiritual path together, someone who is creating from that place and sort of creating rabbit holes back down to this place or back down to other teachers in their own way and that I felt like I had received the message. Also that there is no one right way that this all makes sense for us, but there's, there are many different ways up the hill. Yes, yeah, that's right. And that's the other thing is like every bomb technician, you know, there's teachings for every bomb. That's right. And there's technicians. They have their own instruction manual, their own set of cables. Yeah, that's right, that's right. And the, but you know, you can't walk around, it's like nobody wants to, like if I'm at the beach and I'm hanging out with somebody who's looking around, all he sees is people about to get blown up, it's like, I don't want to be at the beach with that dude. Get the fuck out of here. No way. And that's not, that's those types of teachers aren't for us. But maybe for some people there is that, you know, severity of, and there is that version of it, which is, do you not see, are you not aware that death sits upon your shoulder? That at any moment, your cognitive faculties could begin to become impaired and your ability to have this mind, this lucidity could be lost in a second. This is all you have now, now. Shut up, fuck you, I don't care, right? That's not, that's not our, that's not our, that's for us, isn't the way, but for some people, that is the way. And that way is converted into, you know, when we see it through in Christianity, it's like, this is the kingdom of good, good and evil sins. That's right, polarizing. You must accept Jesus Christ in your heart right now, or you will die. Or else. And burn forever in hell, right? That's a severe teaching and that kind of teaching, that's like, to me, that's like, if I'm deactivating a bomb, the last thing I need is for someone to like, suddenly put a gun to my head. Yeah, to lean over your shoulder and say, don't fuck this up, buddy. You know, after the bomb explodes, you're going to burn forever. It's like, fuck Jesus Christ, we're already getting exploded. Anyway, I think I'm fucking the metaphor. I don't even know what I'm talking about now, the point is, there's many different teachers and many different paths. But the paths and the teachers are all leading to this place. Yes. Or maybe another way to say, a placeless place. How would you describe this place? What is it? And what is it? I think that it's the divine grand mystery that maybe we don't actually even know, but we can subjectively experience it. And I was reading this book called Sacred Knowledge by William Richards, which described the difference between a spiritual and a mystical experience. And a spiritual experience is when your ego is still intact or there's a sense of self and an object. And mystical is when you actually merge and become that thing. And this is an incredible book, I highly recommend it. But for me, it was the actual merging with that thing or that place that felt very, very familiar. And people can have this without psychedelics. I mean, this is just the way that I've done it. For me, I think I needed to have that. I just needed to be clobbered over the head with love and oneness to really understand. It was the combination of the meditation and the psychedelics in, and I think it's also important to say that it was very different for me doing this outside of the party in the music world. I don't mean taking psychedelics at Burning Man or at festivals. And that's not also not to speak poorly of that. That's just a different thing entirely. It's a whole different place versus doing it in a more sort of sacramental way. So for me, it was actually merging with that and feeling something deep inside my own subjective experience that felt like my true nature was something that I was understanding, not intellectually, from reading a book, but I felt like I was becoming that pure love. And that's actually the place that I was creating from this whole time. And it's the place that when you're there, there's nothing to do. You're fine just how you are. And knowing that and then coming back into the intellectual world of reading books and teachings and everything, that place made perfect sense to me in that that's where music comes from. That's where love comes from. That's where, I mean, all of these things that we do come from there. But it's interesting because there's something about the familiarity there. When you're there, you think, oh gosh, it's so nice to come back here again. And we're all going to go back here. Now we just get to come back to earth and have fun. Yeah, right. That's it. That is the other side of it. It's just that I always run that thing you just described. And when you're with Ram Dass, it's like he's a window to that place. He mirrors that back to you. Yes, absolutely. And so you're around him, oh, yo, yo. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's so cool. And then, but then here, man, this is the place of tangled wires. You know, like for me, I almost wanted to leave it for you because you're a music producer. I wanted you, before you came, I was ashamed. You're looking at this musical setup. You don't even know what I did. I, for you to prepare for your coming, I entangled so many wires because I'm like fucking Brad, it's coming. I gotta like, he can't see all these tangled wires around. And so like, you know, here things get really complex and tangled and you get lost in the tangle. And over there, it's just perfect and simple. And when you're lost in the tangle, it's so easy to forget that this is a place where, for lack of a better word, we're here to have fun. Right. Whenever a parent has passed for me, the feeling, as they dissolve into the bardo or however you wanna put it, that comes in is always, in jewel, this is for, this place is for you. Yes. This is your place. Wow, I had that exact same download from my father actually after he passed as well. What, can you describe that to me? Yeah, I had an experience where, this was much later on in life, but I was, I had a download, this was probably early to mid-20s and I had just started experimenting with psychedelics and I was on a fairly heavy dose of LSD. It could have gone totally sideways because I was just at some guy's house on New Year's, but it ended up going great. And I had that download actually of, hey, this is for you, enjoy it. I actually kind of got cut off and had to leave early, but enjoy it, take care of your family, have fun. This is beautiful and I saw the rest of my lifespan in the form of the sort of little pool of light that you get to experience and then share that with others. Oh, wow. God, that's beautiful, man. Yeah. That, that is so sweet. And to have that feeling of relief, knowing, because I was untangling chords, listening to Imagine. That's awesome, that's perfect. There's a point in Imagine at the very beginning where he's like, find a place where he can sit, he's like explaining the meditative pose. And I'm like, boy, this is the story of my fucking life. Ramda's talking about just meditating, here I am with a bunch of chords on my bed trying to untick it. That's what life is like. What's that reminds me of that book title, Jack Cornfield After the Ecstasy, the Laundry? Yeah. It's like, yes, we can go off and have these crazy experiences, but the real practice is that untangling a big ball of fucking chords are like going to the grocery store or driving around in traffic and not getting angry. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and that sort of what I've learned from Ramda's and what I've learned from these retreats is the word learned is wrong, isn't it? It's not really learned. And that's why I love the title of one of his books, Polishing the Mirror. That's right. Because, and also I love that it sort of brings us back to when you were playing this song for someone and they're like, God, this is so depressing. And you realize like, oh, shit, my music is a reflection of this person's depression. Or this person's mirror has a nice code of depression over it, right? And so the learning thing, even though that's, it's really learning seems to be kind of the wrong word for it as much as like, all right, okay, okay, we're going to like start, we're going to start doing a little windshield scrub in here. So to speak, we're going to try to get this like, you've been on the highway for a long, you know, like when you pull off, yeah, when you've been on a long road trip and you like, there's fucking bugs and just black shit. And do you believe that Guru sees through that into the light behind it? Right, absolutely. I mean, and that, what you make me think of right there, and I love the idea of not learning. And one of the things about the whole, the Ram Dass teachings for me and other sort of Buddhist texts was that, I thought that like, I'm this flawed, silly human here and I have to learn and take these spiritual teachings, or at least that's just sort of what I learned growing up, but really polishing the mirror is just the idea of, no, actually this is all in you and you're there all the time and you're perfect as is. And now we're just sort of scrubbing the guts of life off of our psychic windshields. Yeah, we've smashed into the guts of life. That's right. But I have to say that I think the humor is really important too and that's when I really connected with your show and that's something that I really love about what you do. And also with connecting with the Ram Dass community and other, even like when you listen to Dalai Lama, like he's funny and it's easy to take ourselves so fucking seriously. But the mixture of having the word, what's the Polly word I think it's Lila or something like that is sort of Lila. Cosmic humor about the whole thing, then everything really starts to make sense because you just have to be able to laugh it off. Yeah, well, I mean, this is like, I was, I'm gonna keep referring to books because I was like, I don't even know what this, you've been putting your stacks of books you read every year on some, what is that, medium? Oh yeah, on medium and I did it on Instagram post. It's freaking cool, man, but like I was looking, well, you read a lot of the same stuff, but I thank God someone, I think through Twitter, Patreon someone like sent me a link to Jaren Lanier and somehow I missed him all together. I don't even know how. Oh, he's incredible. So I ordered his book because it looks really cool. The beginning of the new, what's it called? The beginning of the new everything? The dawn of the new everything. The dawn of the new everything, yeah. Holy fuck. Whoa. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. Like this guy is like, what is this guy? Yeah, he's a techno guru for sure. Techno guru is a great way to put it. But he, as he's describing all these various, as he's defining VR in all these different ways throughout the book. In one of the ways he defines virtual reality was mystical in the sense that here you are of sentience in the virtual reality world. But you know, you can be a tree. Right. Or you can be nothing. And here you are looking around with no body to, he doesn't describe it in this exact way, but the point is like within that, you truly get the experience of not being your avatar. That's right. You're trying on different orbs of consciousness. And that's the whole thing is with virtual reality. It's a whole fully baked consciousness that you can then get into an experience from a different way, or at least that's what he says is the ultimate goal or the best version of what VR can actually be. Yeah, yeah, that. And I don't remember what it was like, oh, I mean, this is a little like salacious. But I can remember having VR goggles on. Have you ever had sex in VR? I have not. So it's really interesting because like you can put VR goggles on. I think I was in God, what's that Adobe paintbrush program they have? It's called Tilt Brush. Oh, Tilt Brush. Oh yeah, the Google one. Yeah, so it wasn't like I was looking at like VR porn and it's like it's in Tilt Brush, you know? And it's like, so you have this thing happening to you, which is like one of the most amazing, super hyper sensual things that can happen. But in the Tilt Brush land. You're just painting. You're just, you're not, you're just, you just, fuck painting. I think I put the controllers down. Right. You know, you're just like in this surrounded by this like vast expanse and there's not really a you there. And yet there's this incredible feeling happening. Wow. Right? Yeah. I have to try this. Yeah, you must. I don't, I'm so, I've unfortunately, I'm diving back into VR after reading this wonderful book, but I've been sort of out of that world for a little bit. So I haven't, I don't know where it's at right now as far as these kinds of experiments, but it reminds me of what you're saying, which is like, if we get too caught up in the chords here. Yeah. You know, and in this like incredible experience we're having, it's incredibly sensual here, you know, like you don't have to be getting a blow job to like feel, like it's like you're always getting a blow job. Like we're like, oh, what is the plural of clitoris? A clitori? Is it clitori? I don't know, but let's just say that it is. So fun. Clitori. So we're like interdimensional clitori, like, you know, pushing into this realm, right? And like no matter what is touching us, it's like the most powerful experience ever, you know, to the point where we have to build up filters and filtration mechanisms to block the stuff up. To not have orgasms all the time. All the time. Yeah, right, awful, awful. And we have all kinds of orgasms here. Like everyone, like the most obvious orgasm is the one like where like cum comes out of you or like your vagina trembles and you just, you're wet and you're, you're true. But like there's all kinds of other versions of this, right? Which is like sometimes you'll be in the shower and a thought will come into your mind. And you're like, whoa, well that's a great thought. Or sometimes you'll like be at a party. You know when a party like hits its peak? You know, peak party, that thing? I don't care about anything else. Yeah, yeah, peak of the festival where suddenly you're like in a hive of bees or something and the sound of the entire thing is somehow all merging to everyone's like. Peak experience. Yeah. Hive mind, yeah. That, there's all these other forms of orgasm that are happening here. But the point is, if we get too caught up in being a clitoris, right? Yeah. And suddenly it becomes like unbearably rotten. It can become like terrifying. Like you wouldn't, look, honestly I have no idea what it, I have yet, I think maybe in my DNA it could be in there but I don't know what it's like to have a clitoris. But I was, my wife and I were up in Big Sur and we were on this hike and I was looking at all these holes and trees and I just watched creep show or this guy like buries this couple up to their neck and like this and I was thinking like, man what a great creep show or some like angry guy takes another guy like who like, who he's jealous of or whatever and like makes him put his dick into stumps until something bites it. Wow. It's the worst, the worst thing. To be in the woods, someone's got a gun and he's like put your dick in that stump. Anyway, the point is, we're like that in the sense that we've been pushed out of the transcendent into this temporary material realm. And if we forget that there is an attachment to something or a connection to something vastly bigger than us, then we're just a fucking dick in a stump, man. Yes. It's terrifying, right? It is terrifying. I'm sorry to vulgarize the beauty of you, man. I'm sorry, dude. This is what I, I'm so sorry. My mind converts everything into this rotten way. Forgive me, it's vulgar. No, that's it. It's, but you know what? I think humor is so important because it is so easy to overthink and overanalyze these things. And I think, you know, sometimes you can be a beautiful transcendent butterfly of love and bliss and sometimes it's just a dick in a stump. And you know what, that life, life just presents all sorts of different things. And that's really okay. But I do think that having those little reminders in some way, and I think for me, and this makes me think of, there's this meditation book that I just read called Altered States and Altered Traits. Something like that by Daniel Goldman. But I just love the idea that altered states become altered traits and the more time that you spend in a particular state, it'll start to become sticky. Or they talk about that in stealing fire too, where if you wanna have more creative flow states, you spend more time in creative flow, so therefore it becomes easier like a muscle. And the more time that I've spent in these meditative states, the easier it is to go back there. When I very first started meditating, I was doing TM and it was really meditation was just I would get on my pillow for 20 minutes and then I'd go about my day. But it wasn't until doing vipassana, silent retreat that I realized that actually it's all meditation and everything is a way back into that umbilical cord to transcendent union and it's not just actually the sort of exalted pillow, but in the moment it's everything and especially when stuff gets tough. That's when the work really starts to show up. And for me, and when it really starts to pay off, and it's not, I think I had this wrong idea that doing spiritual work or doing personal work meant that this stuff wouldn't happen to you anymore, but it's not. For me, it's more of like, you're still gonna get angry. You're gonna get sad and frustrated, but it's when you catch yourself and then you don't judge yourself for doing it, or at least you catch yourself judging yourself and then the time that it comes back will start to get quicker. But you don't actually just transform into some butterfly clitoris flying through the horizon. Whoa, I've seen those, man. But you're right, that thing is hilarious. I used to do that. That's a very funny thing. That's like, that thing you're describing, that's the way I used to, when I honest to God, there was a time in my life where I walked into a gym and I thought to myself, I don't wanna get too ripped. And I meant it. I meant it like, oh yeah, man, I better be careful. I don't wanna get too fucking muscular, man. Like, it really, oh yeah, watch out, dude. That's not, is that really something you think is gonna happen from your intermittent gym experiences that you're just gonna sprout a six-pack? Or like, don't worry, you're okay. You have nothing, so, you know, the same is true for the way me, the way I have thought about meditation in the past has been like, well, better off, don't wanna get enlightened right away. I know, I should take it slow on the path to enlightenment. Don't wanna fuck up the podcast, you know. Like, I mean, I could probably get enlightened tomorrow, but I don't wanna like. I know, if I become too woke, then things just get all weird. Yeah, yeah, so, you know, I kinda like to hang out here, you know, right before getting enlightened. Yeah, that kind of ego shit is so funny. Which is, and man, I really love this, like, the teaching that Ram Dass so clearly articulates, which is that, it's not, like, the terminology that I have used, and I still use, because it's hard not to use it, is I'll say over there, the other place, the other side, the behind the, whatever you wanna say, heaven, the astral realm, or all of these things are based in time and space. And so they, and the way we understand things here is we're localized in our bodies, because we are caught in the sort of atomic mesh that is our human incarnation. And so we have to think in terms of like, well, there's a door, and behind the door is a yard, and behind the yard is a thing, and that's how we think. That's our map, yeah. That's our map. Right now, there's someone in Tokyo, right? And I'm not in Tokyo, and like, we're all separate, you know, so that's how we think here. But, and so we use terms over there, but the way Ram Dass talks about it, which I really love, is that, no, we're protruding, he doesn't use these, but it's the idea that we're protruding into time, right? And so to say we're over there, or they're over there, is actually sort of to use a terminology based on this place, which is like, oh no, we're there right now. It's all happening right now. This is it. You're in it. This is it. You're in the grand festival. That's right. You're with Andrew Jones. You're with Ram Dass. You're with Jesus. You're with Neem Karoli Baba. You're with, but not only that, meditation is so beautiful that you put music to, because there is an invitation in there to, what is the, do you remember the Sanskrit, the mantra that you say, which is? Yes, I, excuse me, I can't recite it, but yeah, and it's sort of in the beginning, it's- I am that, no, the, no, the, I am that, that I am, or that's me too. I am that, that is me too, something like that. Yeah, do you remember what it was, the- Afridiam, something like that? Anyway, guys, listen to it. This is my, I'm listening to this beautiful mantra, which means that's me too. So Ram Dass is saying, sum up any event from history. Right. That's me too, right? I am all of this, right? And the, what's funny is when I heard the Sanskrit version of it, I'm like, I'm gonna remember, that's my new mantra. I'm gonna chant that forever. That's beautiful. It sounds so beautiful. And then as soon as the thing's over, I'm like, I know totally, I listened to it a hundred times and I can't even remember it right now. That's what it is to me. That's what it is to be in meat, man. It's very clumsy over here. But the idea, the concept behind it is so beautiful in that it is an invitation to embrace all of it, the clumsiness, the forgetfulness, the all, the anger. Embrace all of it. All of it. So when we get angry, the difference is, it's not as if suddenly you're like, never angry again. You just go, oh, oh, you're angry. That's okay. Yeah, that must be hard to be angry. That's part of me, man. I get angry. Oh, that's part of me. Whoa, look at that. I get jealous. Whoa, look at that. I get like, I get scared. Look at that. Oh, wow, that this part of me is a hypocrite or that part of me doesn't walk that, all of it is you. Right, and then I think, yeah, you realize that you have this inner judge and you have this fear, because it's actually there to protect you. It's there to protect you from saber-toothed tigers coming and running up and eating you or whatever this is. Which happened to my neighbor two days ago. That's brutal in Echo Park. Yeah, that's fucking horrible right now. The saber-toothed tiger population here, they started off with this like. I know it's really, it's ballooned recently. Well, and they introduced them back into the ecosystem. I don't think they should have done that. They're like, they used to be here and then they brought them back and now they're rampaging through the neighborhood. I know, it's really sad. I mean, the climate change is really, it's really been affecting all the tiger population. I know, but it sucks. But you're right, it's there to keep us safe, right? That's right. It's there to protect us from these dangers that we receive. That's right, and I think that having a relationship with your fear and with your judgment and for me, that's what the whole musical process is all about and creating music and listening to music. I mean, actually, ultimately, music has done so much for me to help me with that. Even if you get rid of all of this sort of woo-woo stuff we're talking about, even if music just lets you know that someone else has felt this particular thing, because it's such an emotional, it's like, I think of it as HD emotional communication, whereas we can say to someone, I love you, or you can, I feel what you're feeling, really music, like you feel that is packaged, it's a time capsule of emotion over time, and music has gotten me through some really tough moments. That's one of the reasons when I tap back into why we're making music is to maybe, if this creation does that for someone else on some level, then great, then I'm happy just for one other person, you know? This, I wanna talk about, this makes me remember something, we went out to dinner and you told me something that really changed my life. And you would just come back from you were in Maui and you had gotten to hang out with Ram Dass for a little bit, and I'm just gonna start it off, but you were telling Ram Dass this, about how you send love out into your fans. That's right. Can you tell that story again? Yeah, absolutely, and that's right. So when I went to Maui, Glitchmob had gone there for a, to do a project, to shoot some photos for upcoming album, and it just so happened that you and I had just become friends, and I wanted to go see and just have a chance to talk with him. And when I went there, one of the first things he asks, he's like, oh, so I think all he knew about me was that I do music. And he says, so tell me about your music. And I said, well, it's electronic music. And he was like, yeah, I like electronic music. And he asked me what, just tell me what your process is. I don't remember the specific question, but something that we do in Glitchmob, and what I said to him was that we sort of, we soak up all of the love from people, whether people write us notes, or at the shows, we give high fives, and then we send it back out in the form of music, almost like where this machine that turns love into music, and I was, as I was saying this, he stopped me, and I remember just the look in his eyes. He was like, oh, you catch that? Hold on, that was your ego. Your ego acts, and sends, and has to actually do something with love. You're in your ego right now. Your soul just is that, and you act from that place of being love, and that's where the real magic is. Man, that was, I'll never forget that conversation. That is such an easy thing to forget. Such an easy thing to forget, and that was a huge moment for me, too. I mean, I think about that almost every day on some level, that it's such an easy switch to think that you have to actually do and act, but really, and when he says the soul, some people think of, maybe it's a soul that lives on, beyond, or maybe not, but really, for me, it's sort of like he's talking about our true self of just being the pure love down below there, and the fact that even in my whole narrative and the story that I have about my musical path, that I feel like there's something to actually do there, but really deep down below, you're getting below, like I would think you were saying, behind the veil, we're actually all there all the time. Yeah, and that, to me, that shift, that letting go of being the, of pretending, I mean, it's like, I used to have it, man. My mom, when I was a kid, I vaguely remember my mom attached one of those bullshit steering wheels to the side that you give to kids. You know those? Yeah, absolutely, yeah, the little, and the kid will like, spin the wheel and pretend he or she's driving, but like, no, it's like, and you can actually trick your, I can remember going by a Toys R Us, or a toy store, someplace I wanted to go and like spit. Yeah, it's not working. What the fuck, the wheel's fucked up. What's going on here? And it's like, you're all pissed off, because the wheel didn't work. You're a kid, you're imagining mind, and then like, every once in a while, when you spin the wheel the right way, the car does turn that way, oh, yeah, holy shit, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, right? And so, to realize weight, you know, I don't think, I think this whole life has just been an artificial steering wheel that I've been pretending to spin around. That's actually the best metaphor for life that I've heard. I love that. So it's because it's simultaneously like a relief. It is, that's like, relax, nothing is under control. But then also there's a feeling of like, wait a minute, I earned this. You know what I mean, you wanna feel that sense of like, this is, to me, we're running into this big problem with society, which is that, with the world, which is that, and you, you know, it's really like, like the Pentagon, I think they just invested, I can't remember how much, two billion or four billion into artificial intelligence research, Google, Apple, all the great corporations have all, and all the, so essentially what's happened here is all the great corporations and all the kings and all the states have in some way or another gotten into this really amazing race, which is to be the first person to channel sentient AI into this dimension. Cause once you do that and you pair the thinking mind with the computational power of a machine, then you will be able, and they're already using it, you know, but, and it's so funny that, I don't know if you saw the Apple keynote speech that was yesterday, did you watch that? It's so funny, cause it's like the AI right now is like making it so you can have like a trunk on your nose. Which by the way, today is Ganesha's birthday. Yeah, Ganesha's appearance date, but Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Ganpati. But the, you know, the AI is doing that right now for us, or the AI is like gonna scan your face and so that you get your phone turns on, and that's where we're at with it right now, but where it leads in variable is automation, you know, it's all forms of automation. Formally, if you wanted to make it seem like an elephant trunk was stuck to your face, you would have to like do, they would have to have other people around you, like doing, you know, controlling it, and like, it would be a very complex thing. Now the AI is doing it. And so what this is going to lead us to, or one path for the entire species, is that suddenly we aren't gonna have to do anything anymore. The cars are gonna drive themselves, the music's gonna make itself, the comedy's gonna make itself, the art's gonna make itself, the food's gonna make itself, the house is gonna clean itself. Everything's gonna do it on its own, just like the way nature already does, it's gonna, that same wave of harmonious doing itself-ness is going to somehow possess matter. And now as human beings, we've all completely, when you go up to somebody like, so, what do you do? Right. That's how you define, I'm a, I am this. I fly, I'm a pilot. Right. That's, oh really, so now one of the fundamental ways that we define ourselves, which is through our work, is going to, that's gonna start going away. And so it's interesting, because it seems like as a being begins to wake up, the being begins to realize, I don't know how much of this I'm, I don't think I'm doing any, oh I don't even know if that I'm an I. Right? Yeah. It seems like because of technology, this is going to happen to us as a species, which is, we're gonna realize like, oh shit, actually that thing we thought to find this as a species, which is our ability to like use tools and make stuff. To do anything. This guy is going to suddenly no longer, we're not gonna have to do it. Now what? Now what? Now what? Yeah, that reminds me actually, I saw a, I went to a music tech demo, I think a year or two ago, and it was the first time, I had read all of the stuff about AI, and the AI is coming for different jobs, and for automation, and this was the first time I had seen a music AI do something that was actually compelling, and I felt it. I was like, wait a second. Yeah. It's coming for us. Yeah. But really, there's an AI service, which exists now, I forgot the name of it, but you can go on it, well basically score a commercial. So you can say you click a button here, and you say that I want this to be hopeful, and then it goes to cheerful, and then the guy actually scored a football commercial in 30 seconds, whereas before it would have taken a composer many, many hours, days to write this whole thing, he just clicked a bunch of different emotions, and this isn't actually just putting together other songs, it's actually that the AI has the ability to, it knows what's happening in the video, it can speed up or slow things down, and actually write music from scratch, and I thought, wow, now I felt that. At some point, we think, and I want to sort of be a humanist, I mean, I want to think that there's something special about us, like will AI ever replace, let's say a band, or a podcast, or a painter, is there something actually special about what we do? And I think people can romanticize it, and if you want to be a humanist, and he talks about that in Homo Deus, a lot in Yuval Harai's book, which I've read twice, he goes super deep into this, and I think I want to be romantic and say that, there's no possible way we could fathom what things are going to look like in 500 years, and maybe people will actually prefer to see some sort of artificial intelligence band play, or hear a podcast that is perfect, I mean, who's actually to say, but one of the things that he talks about in Don of the New Everything, in the Jaron Lanier book, which is really interesting, is like the most, the perfect version of all this technology is that it actually just brings us back to ourself. It's not actually about VR. I mean, yes, VR can do all of these things, but what does it actually say about our own experience, and how does it actually inform us to be better people and live and enjoy life more, and AI hasn't come in and taken over yet, but while we still have our jobs here, how can we actually learn to appreciate it a bit more from having to think philosophically about what we actually do here? That's right, man. It's a teacher. And this whole, our reaction to the incoming AI is exactly what a monkey descendant would do, which is like, it's gonna take my bananas, you know? It's like, it's gonna fucking steal our bananas. Don't you see it? Don't you guys know it's gonna kill us and steal our bananas? That's right. Yeah, and that is us applying to the AI our own paranoia and fear. The AI at that point has become a reflection of our speciel paranoia and our fear of saber-toothed tigers. And that's what we're seeing, I think, in many of the prognostications. And also, though, you know, is the problem is, it's true, right? Because the problem is like we're dealing with like, in between, and I know, again, using time-space continuum language, in between the here and the there, the clear light, the where we are right now, the state of the monad, the unified consciousness, there is the bardo, and there are, you know, I remember someone asked the Dalai Lama about this, like what about like, I can't remember if they were saying aliens or entities or spirits, and he's like, oh, yeah. Oh, yes, yes, yes, there are. But these things, just like us, they die. They experience old age, disease, death. They're impermanent, just like us. And yet the totality, the sum total, that thing, the ground of being, that's when we let go, that's what we are. So I think the AI is going to be a channel of that, but in between here and there, there's a lot of little things that can get into the system. Yes, there's a lot of snags that can happen. Yeah, yeah. I was watching Elon Musk on Joe Rogan the other day, and he was saying how he actually thinks it's gonna be people using it against each other. That's gonna be the real problem, and not necessarily the sort of Skynet version of them coming and just attacking us, but really coming down to country versus country, or corporation versus corporation. Driving is mad. Yeah, and I guess, and it's funny too, because to not go totally crazy in short circuit, my mind goes to, well, how can, as an artist, how can I use this to create more love and more art? And there's, I mean, to think about, it's easy to be dystopian, and sure, it's like, it comes back to like, okay, here we are diffusing a bomb again. Maybe the bomb is made from a neural network, but really, I think all we can really do, at least for me, in the way that I think of it, is just to create more, and to create more ways back to it and get from it. So I think I'm excited for what AI can bring to the artist's toolkit. I don't think it's going to, at least anytime soon, get rid of the creative roles, but I think it's going to greatly enhance. I mean, imagine if you took an iPhone XS Max, and showed it to someone 1,000 years ago, and showed them that this is where things going. Imagine how crazy. I know what they would have said. They'd be like, why did you fucking call it Max? They're going to be like, wait, can I see a dictionary? Yes, hold on. Hold on, let me look, I just want to look, wait, there's so many other words you can use besides Max. Also XS, XS? XS Max? Oh, it's 10. But it's like the fact that they named the goddamn thing XS Max, like some kind of commentary on capitalism, it really feels like this is like, that can't be accidental. You're like, it's maximum XS, here you go. Do you want it? Boom, boom, boom, there you have a $1,000 phone that's only slightly better than your other phone. You definitely do it at maximum XS, that's what we'll call it, yeah, we did it. It's so funny to me. The irony is just too, it's too good. It wasn't accidental, it couldn't have been. Apple must be somehow aware of the fact that they've messed up and they've already made tools that are better than anything we'll ever possibly need and anything after that is just icing on icing. But I know what you're saying. Holy God in heaven, the technology, the ability to create that we have around us right now is so amazing, but what you said just now is, if there, and God forgive me for saying this because whenever you say it, you're always wrong, but I'm gonna say it, I'm always wrong anyway. What you just said is the answer to the problem if you ask me, which is like, sure. For example, let's imagine I had a trumpet here, right? Just a trumpet, simple trumpet. That's a bludgeoning device. If you wanted to, you could probably pick it up and use that to just fucking smash my skull in. You could hold up a bank with a trumpet. Yeah, you could, you could just, you could just all you have to do is like blong the fucking security guard in the head with it and then it's gotta be made of something pretty, maybe you needed to sharpen up the edges of the trumpet. Titanium or something. Yeah, but still, it could happen. Yeah, and or, or if you wanted to, you could walk into a bank with a trumpet and play a really beautiful song really quick, you know? Maybe you, maybe like, you know, I don't know why I used a fucking trumpet for this example. There's a lot of other cooler instruments that are less like. I love the trumpet, but yeah, maybe like a harp. A harp, exactly, yeah, right. A harp, you could beat someone's death with it or you could play beautiful music on it and the answer to the fear prognosticators when it comes to AI or anything for that matter, it's coming down the pipes, is when it comes, if I can, I'm gonna use it for love to, I'm gonna use it as an expression of the love in me, the love that I am, and that's what I'll do. And if in that process, it eats me up, all right. That's okay, and that's just part of it. Excuse me, and that's what these new technologies do and I think it's easy and too to become scared and get caught in the outrage fear machine of everything that's coming and certainly there's something to be scared of if you wanna look at it like that, but I think of AI and all of these new emerging technologies, like an industrial revolution, when cars came around, I mean, certainly, they didn't have seat belts and cars for many years and lots of people have died in car accidents, but also, we could just decide to drive to Mexico right now. That's pretty cool. So there's a lot of good and bad things that have happened from this new technology. And I think AI is gonna be the same thing, like people will probably die or become cyborgs. I mean, in a way, that's what Jaren Lanier talks about in his, and actually in the new book, it's something like 10 Reasons to Delete Your Social Media accounts now and his argument is actually that the AI is fucking here, it's already here and we are already wrapped up in it. It doesn't look like a robot, but actually the algorithmic addiction that we all have to social media is the very first emergence of the sort of intelligence that we are all in this sort of psychological test box all the time wanting to... Skinner box. The Skinner box, that's right. We are now in an invisible Skinner box and I think that what he's trying to do is just sort of sound the alarm before it gets too late, but at the same time, I think it's easy to look at everything through a dystopian lens, but if we can actually just come back to a place of creation instead of sitting around and ringing our hands. That's what the machines wanted you to say. That's right. That's the thing, the idea is really scary, because he calls it the idea you shouldn't think, which is he was talking about the Skinner box, BF Skinner, for those of you who don't know, what do you call it? A behaviorism behaviorism. Behavioral psychologists. Yeah, behavioral psychologists, the idea is like you can actually create a system and put a being inside of it and the system can perfectly train the being to do whatever it wants, because anything that a human being does is not based on some autonomous self, but is just based on like really basic survival mechanisms. That if I can fully understand the way your meat machine works, then I can like program you in a way that I can do whatever I want to you. And this is what con artists do. This is what fucking like fascist governments do. This is what brainwashing is. But if a machine intelligence starts doing that, then it's gonna do it so much better than any manipulative force has ever done it that theoretically it will be able to hypnotize the entire species and make it do whatever it wants. And that would be the first thing it would do is like, and this is like if you read Nick Bostrom's book on AI, this is what he talks about is like when the AI comes, you're not gonna know it. You're not gonna know that's not right. We think of these big robots tromping through Los Angeles. Yeah. I can't help but think of Terminator, but really the AI, I think it's actually the one of the best analogies. I don't remember if it's from that book or from another one, but he talks about how when you're walking down the street and you see there's some ants on the ground and you squish them and you kill a thousand ants by one step, you don't actually hate the ants. You're just stepping on their colony because you didn't see them or maybe they're in your way. There's no reason to think that the AI couldn't think of us like that. It doesn't have to be malevolent. We just might be in the way of something else that wants to do. Sure, or it might wanna, it's gonna, I think an AI is gonna like, well, we can't even imagine what it's gonna do, but Lanier's concept is like, oh yeah, the AI has appeared and it's using our phones to manipulate us and the, and much of what we're doing right now isn't really based on anything other than like being like programmed by the algorithms, but it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is like, it's the artificial steering wheel. It's not as though technology is like, is unnatural. It's the technology's reflecting a thing that's already happening anyway, which is that we are in a Skinner box. We're in all sorts of Skinner boxes. I mean, society is a Skinner box. Learning music is a Skinner box in a certain way. I think about art all the time and there's a sort of, a feedback loop that happens when we create a song and then we go out and release it to the world and play it and get this feedback and then go back in and that's still, that feedback mechanism is really what he's talking about there. One of the things that he says in the book is when he's talking about variable rewards, right? Like if the mouse goes up and hits the thing and gets the piece of cocaine every single time, it doesn't like it, but if it doesn't know when it is going to get the treat, I don't remember, is it food or cocaine? I don't remember. Either one works. It's the same thing. Depends on the mouse. If you don't know when you're gonna get it, then it becomes way more addicting. That's why when you open Instagram, they've actually put all of the little notifications in one thing, right? It's not, they don't have follow, heart, comment all in the same thing and they sort of batch them together so you never know what you're gonna get. It's a special treat. Makes it up. It's a special treat every time. That is, I mean, where he's obviously right, man, is that it's like, okay, sure, maybe fucking nature. It's a goddamn skinner box, but it's like, guess who didn't make nature? DARPA. All right, one thing we know is DARPA didn't do the big bang, right? So do you, like, sure, okay, hippie, yeah, nature's a fucking skinner box, you dumbass, but what happens when fucking DARPA's AI decides it wants to scan the basic elemental primordial, psychic pillars of a human being and then the way he puts it is really quite terrifying and I do understand why he says don't think about it, is like, what happens if AI begins to do to us what we do to cats every time we take a laser pointer and shine it on the floor. That fucking cat's completely absorbed in the laser pointer. It's just running around, it doesn't know what's happening. What happens when an AI starts doing that with us? Monkey descendants, it's just like, okay, let's do civil war. Let's do a civil war. Okay, oh shit. Well, we've done a scan. We definitely need to do a population reduction. We'll be fine, let's do, we're in the clouds. Let's do a thermonuclear war over here. Or let's do a like, you know, let's do a mass die off or how about this, even better, let's just start putting out there some kind of idea about how we shouldn't procreate anymore and let's see if we can do, or let's do a variety of ways, probably, you know. Let's just drop their population by 60%, that's the goal. Let's separate everyone drastically. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the fear. It's like somewhere in between, but you know, again, what it all comes down to, think about all that shit as much as you want or as Lanier brilliantly says, don't think about it. How about this, do what you can right now. That's right. And that is why I think the teachings that we have been attracted to are so particularly beautiful in their simplicity, which is we work on ourselves so we can help the person closest to us. And that's what we do. The idea is we're gonna work on ourselves right now. And by that, we're going to try to wake up, remember, and the more we can remember, the kinder we'll be. Yes, that's all there is to it. And I love how with these teachings, there's also nothing really spooky to believe either. Like that's just really the basis of the whole thing, right? And there's no dogma. We work on ourselves. We have a relationship with that truest part of ourselves from which we can then share our gifts with others around us. What a blast, man.

Every single track is a true hit. Sweet friends, are you fucking feeling the grinding gears of the state propaganda mechanism? Do you feel like your hand has gotten trapped and wedged in some grinding rusty gear in a satanic cursed clock tower surrounded by robe occultists muttering strange patriotic incantations as they usher you into a hell labyrinth where you're forced to stick your hand into one gear or the other? Well, then hopefully this podcast will give you a little break because this podcast, I got to have a conversation with artist Robert Ryan. He is a legendary tattoo artist who also happens to have built a beautiful temple. And I don't mean like he set up like a bookshelf and put some Krishna statues on the bookshelf next to like a half empty bottle of wine and some like old roaches. I mean, he literally did the traditional temple building and you'll hear about what goes into building an authentic temple in this episode.

So now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH Robert Ryan. Robert, welcome back to the DTFH. Man, I've been thinking about what I would love to chat with you about. And to me, I just want to talk about your temple, if that's okay. Okay, yeah, yeah. I'd love to talk about the temple. I don't know. You are the only person I know who has built a temple. And I wonder if you could just talk about what that means. Like what is a temple? And most importantly, when did, what inspired you to, and maybe also if you could describe the temple and then tell me what inspired you to put so much time, energy, and money into making a temple. So the temple is called the Mahamrithanjaya temple, which is, that's one of the names for Shiva. Rithanjaya means conqueror of death. Wow. So it's the death, death conquering temple. And it basically by conquering death, it doesn't mean that you, in this body, you will become immortal, but you will conquer all your attachments. So you'll gain immortality. You'll gain the essence of immortality, which is consciousness. Wow. So the temple is a place for myself to worship daily and try to achieve a better understanding of myself through connecting with consciousness and where other people can come visit as well and try to connect it also. We have four mortis there, which are like the statues or are people called deities. One is of Shiva Lingam, which is the unmanifested version of Lord Shiva. There's a deity of Ganesha. There's a deity of Kali. There's a deity of Krishna. And there's a deity of Moragon, which is Ganesha's brother and Shiva's other son. And then there's a morti for the worship of the guru as well. But can you talk a little bit about, it's not just like, this isn't like the kind of thing I do where maybe I'll see a cool deity and I'll put it on like a shelf in my office. Talk a little bit about what it means to install a deity. Well, the deities were installed by my guru whose name is Rudra Abhishek. And the ceremony that we performed for the installation of the deities is called Prana Pratishta. And the Prana Pratishta is the giving life into the deities. So a certain amount of mantras have to be done in a certain time of year in accordance with a lot of other things. You know, it's a real pinpointed kind of scientific approach to giving life to the, to give life force, to give essence, to give the energy to these deities. And then after that, the deities are maintained by bathing, which is called Abhishek. And then giving food, which is called bog, the bog offering. So I'm offering them food and bathing them regularly. And then giving, offering flowers, incense and things like that. So there's daily maintenance beyond after the installation. This, as I've been thinking about that our conversation, I kept thinking like, wow, it, it's like, there's some parallel to having a family to having a temple. Yeah, it's the inner family. It's the family that you have inside you, which is the universe, you know? So you're maintaining that little piece of that family within you each time you go into the temple. Wow, that's so cool. Cause like, you know, for us, we have to, it's a similar thing. You got to bathe the baby. And it's really the, like that's one of the best times of the day. He loves the bath. You know, it's fun to, to get in the bath with him and like you, it's like, you know what I mean? It's, there's, there's something so beautiful about that being the end of the day and like, it's a ritual, you know? And there's purity. You're bathing him. You know, you're washing the dirt away. You're cleaning him. You're making him more, you're making him happy because you're taking away all the stuff that we incurred during the day. And that's also what you're doing with the deities and that worship. So we, but when you're bathing the deities, you're saying you're really bathing yourself. It's exactly what you're doing. You're purifying yourself. You're sharpening the subtle energies. So you're able to comprehend these kind of, kind of theories and these, these, um, I guess, you know, these medicines that have been given to us by these saints over thousands and thousands of years. These are all prescriptions through them. Oh wow, man. And the, the, the, you know, for folks who haven't been to a temple, uh, cause so many people haven't. I mean, that's like a, you know, many people listening to this may have never stepped foot, especially in like a Shiva temple. And, um, so they, they may, you know, they, they may have had an experience in like a Christian church, a synagogue, a mosque, maybe. And I think in a Christian church, synagogue, mosque, one of the wild things is when you begin to realize that the centerpiece, whatever it may be seems to be alive. Like there does seem to be in a great church that it's not just inanimate. There's this like perplexing sense of like Prana or energy emanating out of it. But can you talk, talk a little bit about breathing life into a deity? And don't, don't you think that's more than just a symbolic gesture? It's a highly, it's highly higher than a symbolic gesture, but as a symbolic gesture, it's very important too. You know, like, cause that's, that's where our minds kind of fall in these ideas of symbolism. You know, that's, and before there was language, they spoke through symbolism. So the Shiva lingam, which is a stone, um, uh, worshiping of that, you know, you could just be pouring water over any stone. But when you, when you give the consciousness and the life force to that stone through these rituals, then you start to identify yourself within the deity. Wow. And see, yeah. So like you said, bathing yourself, you know, washing yourself, um, each step in this process of cleaning the deities is like a stage in your spiritual development. You know, so for each powder that I pour on top of the Shiva lingam is a stage in my development as, uh, from an embryo, you know, from, from the egg to the flower to, um, you know, to the aspirant to the, from the devotee to the aspirant to the disciple, you know, all these things, these like evolutionary processes that each person goes through, not just in the spiritual practice, but in life. Yeah. So you're, you're, uh, kind of, that's like a frozen moment in time as you're, as you're bathing at each one is like you watch the, the birth and the rebirth and of creation each time you bathe this stone. Wow. But would you say there's a form of communication that happens with these deities? Yes, there is. And, um, that's the thing by sharpening the subtle senses that, you know, like someone might just look at it as a statue or a stone. But when you start to develop a relationship and you start to see yourself and you start to see your loved ones and you start to see all of humanity in these objects. That's when, you know, the communication, the communication starts, you're opening like a channel between you and the divine. Yeah. Because you're recognizing the divine within yourself. So then you're able to hear the divine from outside the self. It's, to me, that was one of the more mind blowing experiences of my life is encountering the deities and, uh, the Laguna Beach, Hare Krishna temple, initially just seeing statues, like just thinking like, Oh, those are statues. I don't know. You know, they're like, you know, cause my mind at the time wasn't where it got to. But the first thing you do think is like, I guess it's just like a mannequin or something or, you know, and some people would even think that's kind of creepy. What is that? You know, that doesn't make sense. Or some people get superstitious because of the prohibition of idolatry in Western Christianity, you know, like we don't worship false idols. So some people see that and they're like, they're idolaters. You know what I mean? And so I had a little bit of that from my Christian upbringing, too. Like, Oh my God, this is, this is the golden calf. This is the thing they warned against and they're doing it. They're worshiping an idol. I don't know who, who the fuck that is in me. But then you start sitting in front of them and you're maybe chanting Hare Krishna a little bit and suddenly you start realizing like, I don't think that's just a statue. Like there's something way more to that than what I thought going in. And that part is the mind blowing part for me, the connectivity between it. And I go back to it all the time in my mind, you know, like I like the reflective idea. But also I got this real strong sense that it was not just a reflection I was seeing, but a living, for some reason, a thing that was deciding to represent itself in this dimension. Via those statues, you know, that it was very alive and very conscious and very advanced and somewhere in there that I got scared. Yeah. Well, to circle back to what we, what you asked me initially is like, how did this happen? The temple pretty much built itself around me. So funny that our group, our sangha, the people that follow our guru, we were all meeting in Asheville where you are now. What? And yeah, in Hendersonville and at Flat Rock actually. Oh, I remember you telling me that. Oh shit. Yeah. That's cool. We would gather there twice a year and we would, we'd worship there together and we had this place and then it was taken away from us. They stopped renting to us over some, some things that happened that had really nothing to do with us, but they just kind of stopped renting to these kind of communities in general. So we can sell under, you know, so it was through, through ayahuasca actually, you know, to be frank. So they were like, no ayahuasca ceremonies here. No more, you know, because they were, they were letting like a few different shamans come there. But they let people go there and get fucked up on booze guaranteed. They're like, you can have a wedding where people are puking, you know, you can have a wedding where people are going fully blacked out. But no, you're not going to drink some shit that lets you talk to the earth at our fucking convention center. The pharmacological inquisition was a, was a foot. So how did they, how did they find out you were drinking ayahuasca? We were, we're upfront with them. And what it was, they were actually very cool about it. But what happened is another group had some problems there on the premises with an ayahuasca ceremony. So they just did away with them in general. So somebody freaked out. So we kind of felt, yeah, exactly. Maybe the police came. I'm not sure what happened. It wasn't through our community, but they kind of put the kibosh on all ceremonies of that nature. I would. I'm sorry. Wait, I'm just, just to put pause on the spiritual talk for a second. But I swear to God, man, I would pay like a lot of money to see that episode of cops where they bust an ayahuasca ceremony. Like, wait, wait, what? What are you guys on again? Wait, no, but it's a routine of bark. Every time I see one of those documentaries, which the none of them are good, because there's no way you could capture the experience of ayahuasca ceremony in a documentary. Drop the cord! Drop the cord now! Put it down! Drop those fucking beads, motherfucker! Some guy's getting tased while he's purging. But anyway, yeah, so yeah, when you, when you see those documentaries, they, everyone's eyes are always like lit up because it's dark, you know, and they're like super freaked out. It just looks like it always reminded me of cops ayahuasca. No, that seems antithetical too. Like, it's like, how are you going to do an ayahuasca ceremony when there's like a camera guy is like zooming in on you. It sounds really disruptive to put it mildly. So go ahead. I'm sorry. I never, I never saw a good one, but, and I've watched probably all of them. So anyway, yes, we would get together in Nashville and we lost our spot and I, we were going to install a lingam there. And I had actually been the one to procure it because I met this carver of statues in India. So I had him carve one and we lost the space. So I had this lingam and this Nandi, which is the bull that accompanies the lingam. He's always has his focus fixed on him as she was vehicle. He rides a bull named Nandi. So I had this marble lingam and Nandi and I had no, you know, I was like, what am I going to do with this thing? And I had this old garage in the back of my house and it came to me one time in a meditation that like, maybe I should just install it here and turn this garbage garage into a temple. And I asked a friend to help me build it. And then all of a sudden, all these things happened. And by the grace of my guru, he was the one that kind of oversaw the whole project and kind of instructed us how to do it properly and where things should go and when we should do it and things like that. Then he came and installed the deities. Who taught him how to do it? His guru, you know, and then his guru and his guru and, you know, it's the lineage. So you got the sense. Did you get the sense that you, you know, it didn't matter where you all thought you were going to build this thing. It already had decided where it was going to go and it wasn't going to be Hendersonville. No, and it was funny because through my guru, when I speak to my guru, sometimes the side guru comes into his body and it's a really powerful experience. And his name is Tataswamy. And Tataswamy said, I have big plans for you. And that was still when things were, you know, happening in Asheville. And that's what I think the big plan was, was to be the facilitator of this temple. Wow. I want to thank BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Is there something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals? Like, I don't know, a global pandemic where suddenly you find yourself having to quarantine for two weeks straight and knocked out of work just because somebody in your preschool, your kid's preschool had a picnic with somebody who later came down with COVID. And then you weren't sure if maybe you had it because you were already at the sniffles because I don't know allergies, but maybe it was a cold, but also maybe you had a plague that if you went around with it, it would infect other people and permanently be scarred by those dark karmic marks that more than likely would make you incarnate in some future life. It's some horrible thing, like a grub worm and frog shit.

Better help. Talk about that a little bit. Because again, some people listening may not be familiar with even what the term Saad Guru means. Can you talk about that a little bit? So the Saad Guru is the manifestation of all the Guru's body into the one Guru. The overseeing Guru of all. Whether it be Adi Shankarya or in our case, it's Tathaswamy. It's these Guru's that keep incarnating and incarnating into other bodies. And they can be in multiple bodies at one time. Like Yukteswar, Paramahansa Yogananda's Guru was made famous for doing that. He'd be like three places at once. Same with Nikoli Baba. Yeah. Yeah. And that's one of the cities which is the powers when you become a perfected master. You can travel from body to body. But yeah, so the Saad Guru is like this overreaching. It's all the Guru. It's like the accumulation of all the Guru's in one Guru. And it's like probably like meeting someone you've known forever. It's probably like, you know... 100%. It's like the grandfather. It's like it's, you know, or the grandmother, regardless of whatever that Guru might be. But yeah. So yeah, it is. Like I've known you since before I was born. Yeah. And when someone becomes an actual Guru, is it just that they are then the vehicle for that being basically, right? It's like the idea is I've understood it and I don't understand it well. But there's one Guru. That's it. There's not like a bunch of different Guru. There's one Guru who has different bodies. Yes. Yes. And whatever manifestation it takes up, it takes up for the follower or, you know, for the aspirant, you know, it becomes the one that's going to be most suitable for him in that time and place. But there is one overreaching Guru. And it's like the Guru is darkness and Ruh is light. And the Guru is the remover of darkness. And so, you know... But it doesn't have to be... Can it temporarily appear? It can temporarily appear in your friends' candidate. It can just show up. It should be in everything. When we hone our senses and when we do all this internal work and sharpening of the spiritual sword, we'll be able to see the Guru in everything, in every situation, in every moment. And the idea is such a loaded term, but all the terms get loaded when we're talking about stuff, you know? The term Jesus Christ is such a loaded term. But Guru, you know, it connotates the most douchiest idea in the West, you know? Yeah. And because there are so many false Gurus, you know? Right. But the true Guru is the inner Guru, you know, the Guru you have in yourself. And then if you long for that Guru enough in your life, the external Guru will make himself known. That's right. Which he did for you. He did for me. He did for so many. Yes. I mean, you know, I see it sometimes in my child. Not like I'm going to saddle him with that. That would be a horrible thing to do. It's like, force your... Decide your kid as your Guru. But I've seen the... It's helped me understand why Krishna appears as a child. You know, it's helped me like see that. Like, oh, now I get that relationship. I totally get it. Because like, you know, we were just... Me and him were just walking up a trail and he was holding my hand. And I'm looking down at him. And I'm thinking like, whoa, this is how you die. And this is one of the ways you die is these little beings walk you into your next incarnation, you know? Like how crazily perfect that was. How beautiful that was that these sweet beams of light come to you. And then they like... Many times they're with you when you breathe your last breath. And how beautiful that is. What a beautiful way of seeing that. You know, like having your son who is now you, you know? Yeah. Walk you to the threshold. But, you know, and he is your guru because you're getting to see undifferentiated light through him, you know? You know, through those eyes. Like when you see a child's eyes, you know, like the clarity, because they haven't been mucked up with all the things that we come in contact with over the course of your material existence. Yeah, that's right, man. That's it. That's it. You know, it's just so simple and perfect, you know? And yeah, if you do... Even if you get to meet someone who has a guru, like I know you, I know Ragu, if you get to meet someone who has the real thing, you still get the reflection of that being. You know what I mean? It reflects through the devotee, you know? And I think that's where I've met Nimkolibaba is through Ramdas and Ragu and all of the, his, the people who got to be with him, you know, and then also, of course, the other things, the other stuff that happens, which is crazy. Yeah, yeah. But that's the essence of the Sanatana Dharma, you know, which is the teaching of all the Dharma. You know, it's not just Hindu. It's also Islam. It's Christianity. It's Buddhism. The Sanatana Dharma is the continuing of the teaching. And that's what we follow, you know? Like, you can follow a different strain of the Sanatana Dharma, but the overall Sanatana Dharma is everything. It's, it's the weaving of all those things together. And that means, that's the essence of its meaning is the continuing of it, you know? You keep knowledge going, you know, as a guru, as a disciple, as an aspirant, you keep it going. And that's the prayer wheel with the Buddha, you know? You keep sending the prayer out, no matter what. Oh, wow. And you, you know, what's really beautiful about that idea is that even if you are someone who has yet to meet your guru or to meet someone who has met their guru, and you hear this stuff, but you haven't come in direct contact with it other than books or listening, maybe did it to a podcast or whatever, you still are in contact with it. You know what, that there, it's always there. It's like you're saying it's in you and but also it's, you know, one of my teachers, David Nickton, I remember when we were working together, it was the craziest experience. He was just saying, Duncan, it was so simple. That's the other thing. These teachers, they're so simple. When you try to articulate moments with them, it sounds like the most, it can sound very mundane or not very exciting, but I remember I was talking to him and he said, Duncan, do you believe there was a Buddha? And I thought about it and I'm like, yeah. And he was, he said, do you, would you think the Buddha gained realization? And I thought about it. I'm like, Oh God. And just in that moment, I felt it. I felt the, that the Buddha in that moment. It was like, whoa, whoa. Not anything like I, in my mind, what I constructed is that being, it was completely, it was warm and love and, you know, it wasn't like, in my, somehow I constructed like an austere emotionless Buddha, but this moment was like, whoa, it's just love. It's like, it's the, it's like the voice of love. I can't explain it, but to me, what's cool about this transmission that goes from guru to disciple or devotee or whatever you want to call it, is that it produces temporal, it produces a telephone that goes all the way back probably to before the big bang. And that's crazy to me that the, you know what I'm talking about? It's like the reflection of this Dharma through time in is not, it's not like somebody hears it and then conveys information to a person. It's that someone becomes a light, a mirror reflecting a light that is shining into this dimension through time. You know what I mean? It's not, and we're not, I'm not telling you how to do crunches here. You know, it's, you know what I'm saying? It's like you're getting a light is shining on you or through you in that relationship. Well, as you said, you know, the word transmission, you know, as it transmits from guru to guru to guru, then eventually it transmits to you and into your body, you know, and then it works its way up your spine, you know, and then up into your third eye in between your eyes and then up into the top of your head. And then from there it just explodes and then it goes out again. So it travel even the way the current of the transmission from teacher's mouth to students here on, onward and onward, then to the spine and up through, you know, to have these like mystical revelations, you have to kind of, you know, it goes for our idea goes through the chakras, you know, the chakra system, which are the five points in the spine and two points in the mind, you know, or in the brain. Do you think it's possible that these, that seed gets planted and you don't even, maybe you're not quite sure it's even happened, but it's growing inside of you. Even if you'd, what, like, what happens if you, if you do meet your guru and the guru teaches you something, but then you forget about it or you get distracted by life or whatever does that happens all the time. Yeah. And, but does that seed continue to grow inside of you, regardless of your connection physically to that particular guru? The way it grows is, it happens for mantras, you know, that's, that's watering that seed. They plant the seed, you chant the mantras and it grows inside of you, you know, you know, oh, oh, you know, like that, that's the Bija, the word Bija is seed. And each mantra has a seed syllable. And, you know, once the seed is implanted, if you keep watering it and you keep watering it, it will rise up the spine up to that third eye and then you'll have the revelation and that's the book of revelation. Since, you know, we're in the West, we can talk about the Bible a little bit. That is a description of Christ, Samadhi. What, what do you mean, describe that? So, so this, this comes from the teaching of Shri Yukdashwar. I think he might have been one of the first to enlighten this in English. But so the seven seals, the seven stars in Christ's hand represent the seven rishis, the seven candlesticks represent the seven chakras, the seven seals represent the knowledge, you know, that you gain once you go through the chakra system and then, you know, all the things, all the descriptions of Christ, like the, the blade of the two blades of the tongue, you know, is the duality. And then he's, he's shining like a sun, you know, they, they describe like they kind of go up through his body and at the top of his head is this, this shining of a million suns or whatever it says in the book of revelations. So yeah, it's, it's the description, it's not so much like, I, I think a lot of people attach like, you know, of course, Armageddon to, but I think it was Christ's apocalypse, it was Christ's Armageddon. It was him coming from the sun of man and turning into the sun of God. Whoa, that is so crazy. It's a mystic revelation. That's what, that's what happens, you know, and like, I think the nuclear bomb was a mystic revelation in some sense, you know. Yeah, right. Yeah, that was definitely, I think about that sometimes is like, oh yeah, that was a summoning or a contact or a way that something came into the world. You know, it was more than just the atom getting a splitting of the atom. It represented more than that. Ho, I think it was, well, hopefully it wasn't like foreshadowing, but the, I, the, what you're saying, um, it makes me think of something I was just watching. There's a documentary camera in the name of a guy who went to visit Hermits and interviewed them and he ended up with his Buddhist monk who lived up at the top of a mountain and the Buddhist monk was talking, was like, agreed to do the interview, which is pretty cool. Cause the guy you could tell he was cool. And so the Buddhist monk was like letting him have like Darshan with him. And the Buddhist monk was saying, you know, we don't really talk that much up here. There really isn't much that happens and there's not much to really say up here. And he's, and it was so crazy, like realizing like, I don't think that this monk has talked in a while, but any, and he said, we, there's monks who are down there who come here and they say they wished that they were up here instead of the monastery, but they're also, they're, they're teaching too. What they're doing is fine too. But he says the lay people, they come here and we talked to them, but he's like, I don't know about if we, if telling them things actually works because they hear what we tell them, but then when life circumstances arise, they don't do, they don't follow the Dharma. They, and so, but what he said was, which is why we think, I don't know who the we is, but he's like, which is why we think the recitation of mantras and sutras is best for lay people chanting. I just thought it gives me goosebumps because it was, it was just, it's exactly what you're saying, which is, you know, and maybe you could talk about this a little bit, the difference between hearing, because you can hear all kinds of beautiful things, the, particularly what you're talking about, the book of revelations being Christ's Samadhi process of realization. You can hear from the Bhagavad Gita, there was never a time we did, I did not exist or you or anybody, or that the God is the original fragrance of the earth, you can hear that, but then all of a sudden you're screaming at some asshole on the highway, you know what I mean? It's like, but what is it, what is it about mantras in particular, or the recitation of sutras or the recitation of holy scripture? Why is it so powerful? I, it's the one thing I've never been able to wrap my mind around the idea that I can just chant Hare Krishna, I can just chant Hare Krishna and in my life begins to shift in the most profound ways versus I can read Heidegger, I can read Nietzsche, or I can read Sartre, or I could, you know, read Alan Watts, or I could read Tecnoton, or I could read Ram Dass, and it's a much, if there's any progression, it's much slower than just the recitation of the holy names. Why, what's going on there? Why, what's your theory on that? Well, I think one way to look at it is, you know, think of music, like listening to music and your idea of a concept of a song, and then actually playing a song, or then actually writing a song or being there when the song was created or happened, like spontaneous, that spontaneous feeling, you know, like where is a song born from? You know, and being part of that connection to the unified field that creates mantras, you know, and I think that's, that's what the power, it's the difference between hearing something and actually participating in it, you know, but also mantra is, you know, it means, you know, the quieting of the mind or the stilling of the mind, and through mantra, that's when you start to notice more things because you slow your mind down, because it's the one time where your mind's not just racing like crazy, you know, like it's not, it's not the monkey, you know, on the stagecoach or on the, you know, a drunk monkey, you know, at the helms of four different horses that are all tangled up, you know, that's where your mind, you know, that just, you know, goes from thought, from thought, from thought, from thought, but when there's mantra involved, it's the only time that the mind knows what the next thought's going to be, you know, so it keeps the mind tranquil, so then you're able to see more things, and I think that's where the power is, you know, that's where you start magnifying, you know, the microcosm with the macrocosm and vice versa, and start to see those things, that unity, the non-dual bliss that can exist out there, that does exist. Man, I, one of my favorite moments in the K-hole was I, I was in the K-hole on Ketamine. The Ketamine hole? Or Ketamine hole. A lot of people say K-hole now, and they're using it in the wrong, you know, it's like, I went down the internet K-hole, it's like, no, it's a different kind of K-hole. What? There's no internet fucking K-hole, get out of town, man. There's an internet A-hole. Yeah, you went up the internet to asshole, baby, but there's no K-hole. As far as I'm aware, if there is a K-hole on the internet, I'd like to find it. But the, you know, before Ketamine stopped working for me, I remember being in that spot, and then we were listening to Mantra, and like, seeing the, I don't, I don't know what, who that being was. I keep thinking like, who was that? It looked like Jaitanya Mahaprabhu, but it looked like all the other depictions I've seen of various monks, it could have been any, I don't know. But the being was chanting, and as it was chanting, it was like manifesting the world through the chant, like the, it was building reality from like saying these chants, and I feel like sometimes I wonder when I'm chanting, did I decide to chant, or is that like me thinking I decided to chant, like thinking like a tree decided that birds were going to fly out of it? You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah, yeah, no, 100%. I, I, I agree with you. I don't, I don't think it is you, but it is you, you know, and that's like the, the whole science of self-realization is like the big you or the big I, you know, you know, capital letter I, or capital letter S for self, you know, like the true self is the one that's chanting. The other self that we all identify with is the ego self, and that's, that's the Maya, you know, so the true self is always engaged with divine, you know, and it's just a matter of waking that up in the other self, you know, the day-to-day self, the lazy self, the egoic self, you know. Where is the true self? Where did, where does the true self live? Does the true self live in this world? It lives in the heart. It lives in the heart of everyone. It lives in your kid walking you off the path, you know, that you were on earlier today, you know, it lives in the idea of it's the creative potential for anything. You know, it's the creative capacity for anything. It's like, you know, it's like potential and kinetic energy, you know, like that's in, in Sannathana Dharma, it's Purusha and Prakriti. It's like Prakriti is the creative energy that, you know, that makes us material bodies and Purusha is the consciousness that recognizes the material body. Right. And it's the inner play. When they're unified, that's the Shiva Lingam, the Yoni, the male and the female principle, you know, that's when you start, that's when you have consciousness. And I'm interested in Shiva. I don't understand Shiva at all. I ended up gravitating towards Krishna more than Shiva. So I know, and I don't, I mean, saying I understand Krish, so if you're ridiculous too, but I do, I've, you know, I know a little bit more of the stories of Krishna than I do of Shiva. Do any particular Shiva stories come to mind? Do you have a favorite Shiva story that you think about or that you've been told? Yeah, yeah, definitely. One, one that comes, comes to me right away is Neelakanta Mahadev, which means he who has a blue throat, the great God with the blue throat. Shiva is depicted with his throat being blue. So the story goes that when the gods were churning the ocean of existence to create the Amrit, the sacred formula of immortality. So the gods were on one side and the demons were on the other and they had a giant serpent and they were like, you know, had it wrapped around a stone. So it was like a churning, you know, like, like you churn butter, you know? Yeah. So back and forth, they're creating this like friction, you know, which is totally symbolic of the friction that happens in each one of us, you know, with our, you know, devil and angel on each shoulder, you know, our, you know, our, our, our laziness and our, um, our propensity to do things, you know, there's all these dualities that live inside of us. Yes. So the gods and the demon are churning, they're churning these, you know, this giant serpent and through the friction around this rock, this, this like sacred mountain that they're doing it, um, they created poison. The first thing like, well, first of all, all of these mantras started coming out from that churning. Wow. Then some like gods and demigods, then all these animals start to come out of it. You know, so it's like creation story happening too. Yeah. And then the first thing before the Amrit comes out, comes poison and the poison is just like, it's so potent that it's even the demons are afraid of it, you know, and it looks like the entire planet's just going to, or the universe is just going to be destroyed. And she, they asked the gods, Ashiva, if he would, um, help them. So he swallows it and, uh, he drinks the drinks the poison, but he doesn't swap, he actually doesn't swallow it. He holds it in his throat and it turns his throat blue, you know, and, uh, the, the real, the concept is like all the poison that's going to be created in your life, all the bad things, you know, just through karma, they're doing things from action and inaction and everything. Um, it's important to hold it, you know, like to, to accept it, but not to spit it out. So it's harmful for everybody and not to swallow it. So it will kill you. So you hold it in your throat. Whoa. That's crazy. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So, and that, that's what happens to you in the, when you really start doing this kind of like inner work on like a, on a spiritual path, you know, because you start chanting mantras and you start trying to like sit a goal for yourself and have like right conduct. And then the opposite starts happening because you start shaking up all that dust, you know, and you start having like some really bad thoughts. I know you, I, I've heard you talk about it before, like in meditation, you'll have these like really kind of like negative things will come out and you're like, where did that even come from? I haven't thought about that person that I hated in years or whatever. Yeah. Um, it gets all stirred up. So Shiva, the power of infinite goodness, which is Shiva's, that's what the, the meaning of Shiva is the consciousness of infinite goodness. He can, he can hold that, you know, he can hold that poison. And that's another thing. Like we have to do it, we have to do the work and hold it in our throats, but we can also put the burdens to Shiva as well. Cause he can take, you know, there's no fear in Shiva. There's no, you know, he's like surrounded by goblins and ghosts all the time. And yeah, he's, it's just like, you know, uh, he's like a destructive force. You know, he's, he's the destroyer in the, in the Trinity. In the, in the Hindu pantheon, you know, so he's also, you know, intoxicated. He's outside of society. He's not like a, you know, all the gods have like a real elaborate with like crowns and stuff. He has like dreadlocks, you know, and he's got a tiger skin for clothes. And, um, you know, he's covered in ash. So he's like, he's like kind of the anti-hero in the pantheon as well. So anytime that there's any kind of serious, like fear related or intense negative energy related stuff, the gods would always go to Shiva to neutralize it. Wow. That is so cool, man. That is so beautiful. It's just to think that these stories exist at all and that they've been, you know, told like the way you just told the story for millennia is, is so wild. I mean, just the, even though like, you know, if you were just like, I think telling them versus reading them is important too. You know, the reading of the story is way different from hearing someone tell it. And I, you know, obviously it started as a oral history, you know, oral tradition, you know, is before writing all these stories were way before writing. You know, and a lot of these rituals were way before writing. So, and before, and before painting and, you know, before like the tools that you would use to make art and sculpture and stuff like that. So imagine like the creative capacity of these rishis who, who passed these stories down. See, they were the ones who were having the revelations. They were the ones that were doing, you know, their lifetime of topists of, you know, spiritual discipline to gain these, these revelations and pass them down to people and, you know, without any kind of context at all, you know, like they, they didn't have books to reference. They didn't have, you know, like if I make a painting, I'm usually referencing like four or five different images and kind of trying to find the history of what they are, but they just did, they pulled them out of the, out of the unified field. Can, can you talk about the, where do these stories live in time? Because I feel like one of the mistakes people can make regarding these stories is to imagine, oh, that happened in the distant past. And wouldn't you say that actually the churning of the ocean is happening right now? Like that didn't. Yeah, it's always happening. It is happening in each one of us. It's happening geopolitically. It's happening, happening internationally, worldwide, universally. It's always happening. You know, it's continual. All those stories, those like in time, you know, like when the Rishis were around on this planet, you're looking 5,000, 6,000, maybe 7,000 years ago. All those problems that people were confronting, you know, and trying to better themselves with are just as relevant now as they were then. And we're, you know, the, the Philip K. Dick had some kind of, I don't know, an epiphany breakdown. Maybe there's no difference where he realized I am. We are all right now in the presence of Christ being crucified. It's just so powerful that we're hallucinating our lives or, or we're Christ being crucified, dreaming all, all of our individual lives. Do you think that applies to this? Are we in Shiva's throat right now? Are we the poison in Shiva's throat? Exactly. We're a hundred percent. If we're lucky, yeah. But, but no, yeah, we are, we are, we're living for any of it to have any kind of meaning or potency, potency, potency, potency, potency, potency. Yeah. Uh, for it to be serious business, it's got to be happening right now. You know, it wouldn't, if it wasn't relevant to what we're living at the present moment, it wouldn't have lasted as long as it did. And, but isn't that's one of the, to me, I think that's one of the tricks people play on themselves because it's too much to deal with. Like, because what you first, it's like the deities. You see them and you're like, I don't know what those are. Some kind of mannequin or something that people are burning candles to. And then you're like, oh, wait a minute, that's not, that's not a mannequin. Similarly with these stories, you think, oh, that's cute. That's like some kind of primitive, you know, mythology and you get all intellectual about it and stuff. It, but when you shift into like that moment, we're like, oh, fuck. That's now, this didn't happen in the distant past. And it's not just a damn story. And the Rishis weren't sitting around like, Hey, let's make up a cool story about where the universe came from. Yeah, they heard it. They saw it. They realized what was happening. They were realized they were in it. And then they started like, you know, the mantras that they're saying came out of it. I think that's what's, they just started saying the mantras. They just, they were like, and then it came out. But I know the some Hare Krishna related mantras, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Hare Ram, Hare Hare. What are the Shiva mantras? Om Nama Shivaya, which is the five syllable one is the main mantra for Shiva. Then there's the Mahabhritan Jaya mantra, which is Om Triyambakam Yejama He Sugham Him Pushkivar Dhanam, Orva Rukami Vabandhanam Rithyohamokshiyamam Rithahati that that loosely translate. We worship you. Oh, three eyed one like a cucumber who is tied to the creeper. May you free us from bondage and liberation and bring us to immortality. Damn, that's I listen. I didn't know that was a Shiva mantra. I had an album that I bought called Indian Temple Music, and it was someone saying that with bells ringing. And I've heard it before, but I didn't know what it was that it was related to Shiva. That's so cool. That's one of my favorite mantras. I didn't even know it was a mantra. I thought it was a prayer. I thought it was more than I guess a mantra is a prayer. Yeah. But yeah. And that's beautiful. They beautifully did a version of it on Emil's record on Om. Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah, they do have it in there. It's such a beautiful version of it. When I heard that, you know, it brought me so much joy. So and then another one is the Shiva Gayatri Mantra, which is Tepurashaya Vidmahe, Mahadeva, Yadimohitanurutra Prachodayahati. And there's different Gayatri's for all the different gods and goddesses and stuff like that, but that she is. So those are the three main ones that we chant in the temple. And then there's a bunch of other ones as well that we also do. And there's a lot of stotram. And one's called the Rudram that I'm trying to learn currently. Is it longer? Is it just? It's long. It's it takes about 45 minutes to do. One's called the Chamakam and the Namakam. So that's like the. That's Vedic. It's right. It's from the Krishna Ajurveda. But it's like the Hanuman Chalisa is an example of a very long mantra. Yeah. So this is the Hanuman Chalisa times four. So it's pretty long. Yeah. And there's there's ones that are even longer, like the Devi Mahatmayam, which is the the story of Durga and like her conquering all the different demons. That's about chanted fast will take about four hours. And my guru will do it forwards and backwards. So eight hours. In one sitting, without getting up or doing any, you know, like not taking any breaks, he'll do like eight hours straight chanting. That's powerful pranayama breathing techniques. And, you know, you have to be initiated to chant these kind of mantras. You know, you could really do a lot of damage to yourself or just to get the proper instruction and the proper pronunciation. You know, it's not the Om Namashivaya is one that anybody can chant, you know, or the Mohammedan Jaya, anybody can chant. But the other ones, you need you need someone to teach you them. Yes. Yes. And I know people who when you hear that, I'm like, come on, it's just words. But it's like, you know, I think what I feel inspired to do now is to chant more after chatting with you, because it and I have been chanting a little bit. I know you love chanting. I do. You love it, don't you? Yeah, I love it. I love chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra more than it's so hard to do sometimes. Yeah. And you know how when you're meditating, the big part of meditation is I've been taught is not it's like, yes, of course your mind wanders, but it's when you notice you've come back. That's what's cool about meditating is when suddenly and you realize like, oh, right, I'm always going in and out of the moment. But when with chanting in my life, it's the same thing where all of a sudden I'll be like, well, I'm chanting again. Why did I ever stop? Or I'll realize like, I've stopped chanting. What's going wrong? Why would I stop chanting? That doesn't make any sense. And then I, you know, you start again and it's a it's some sort of relationship, I guess, right? Like it's like a I don't know why I go. I drift away from it. Is there some explanation that your guru is given? Yeah, it's the ego that's in the way. It's the ego is no indifferent from slothiness and laziness and things like that. And just like finding better things to do and like, you know, your expectations in life or there's so many things that get in the way, but like it's keeping you for it's blocking your consciousness. You know, it's blocking you from attaining that unity that will bring you true happiness in your life. And I think that's what's happening when we're not doing what we think we should be or what we, what we love to do and what really moves us in our hearts once we're doing it, but then we don't do it because the ego gets in the way. And that's the battle. That's the demons. That's the churning of the ocean. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's also like all the, every, all the stories of the gods, there's always demons involved, you know, even, you know, the Bible and everything. And the demons are the things that block us from the light, you know, the guru, you know, the guru is the one who brings us to the light, the demons are the ones that block us from the light. But I love the acknowledgement in that story. You told that both are seemingly necessary aspects of whatever this, you know, progenitive mechanism of enlightenment is, right? It's like, Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah. And I always got that with, with the Bible too, with like Christ and the devil, like devil gets a bad rap because he's a totally necessary aspect of the entire story, you know, and like, it doesn't exist without the devil. And yeah, same with the gods, you know, like you need, you need that. And that's, it's because it's a reality. That's what we are, you know, demon, you know, you instantly think of, of, you know, the worst thing, you know, the demonic entities or, you know, these like, but really they're just thoughts, you know, it's, and it's the mind getting away from itself. And that, that's the demonic tendencies, you know, that's ego, greed, you know, jealousy, anger, all those things just come from bad thoughts, you know, a mess, wayward, wayward thoughts, you know, if you, you know, that's when, when, like the next time you find yourself in a messy house, you can do a little meditation with that and just ask yourself, how the fuck did my house get like this? And the answer is you got distracted. You, you got distracted. And when you're not paying attention, shake its messy. When you're paying attention, things tend to, you know, organize, you tend to be clean when you're paying attention. All the qualities that are supposedly go, the great virtues seem to be solely related to not being distracted. You, if you're paying attention, you're a better listener. If you're paying attention, you're going to be more healthy. If you're paying attention, you're going to treat yourself better and the people around you. And I guess the demons, you know, yeah, the trash demon, the mess demon, you know, we got a dog shit demon right now because I keep forgetting to order a pooper scooper and I've got three fucking dogs. So now every one of our, you lost attention. Yes. That's all I got to do is get one. But because I'm not, now it's literally manifesting as shit on my son's shoe, my wife's shoe, my shoe, because the leaves here, we're not used to the leaves. Dog shit looks exactly like leaves. See, it's camouflages perfectly. Where they're running through my yard. You have to slay the dog shit demons. I do. I just need to get a concentration, but I will get you there, man. We'll get you the fucking thing that you need to clean up the dog shit. But I love it, man, because like, you know, these, this is the problem with these grand stories is you could just forget like you hear stories of demons and you're like, why don't I have demons? You know, I'm just, you know, I just smoke. I don't have deep, but it's like, that's a fucking demon. You have a demon that is like praying on you and devouring you. It has always been useful for me to identify things that I don't like in my life as demonic forces because it produces an adversarial relationship, which I, you, which I can you, it helps me. It's easier for me to think of like any kind of addiction I have as a demonic problem, because then it's like, fuck, I don't want to de, I don't want a demon. And then I work with it, versus like, well, you know, it's just what I do. The, it's a, it's a, it's a convenient categorization of things, but also, you know, think of any time you've overcome a demon in your own life, that's what gives you confidence, right? That's what gives you, you know, that's part of the joy of life is overcoming these things. I was going to say, you pick the perfect word. That's the joy of the overcoming of something that has been bothering you about yourself for so long. You know, like I just, it happened to me. I just lost a bunch of weight and I'd been fighting this weight for like, seriously, like 20 years. Like cause I'm, I'm sedimentary, you know, I tattooed for a living. So I'm always sitting and tattooers, even though I'm vegetarian, I eat like I'm on a steak out, you know, like Chinese food all the time, just real fast. Steak out eating. That's exactly what I do. That is so funny, except I'm not even on a steak out. I'm watching DateLine eating fucking noodles. Yeah, exactly. You're not even paying attention and all of a sudden you made this giant bowl of noodles. Just gone. So yeah, but by losing that weight, man, I really overcame something that had been, it just, I couldn't even buy clothes for myself anymore. They weren't fitting me properly. And I was just such a, and a pandemic, I was just eating like, like it was a snow day on the East Coast that we would have growing up, you know, you're all from school, you just eat all day. Yeah. And so I was doing that. And my wife brought home a scale. I stood on the scale and was like, oh fuck, you got to, you got work to do. Yeah. And I just changed my diet the next day. And I used all the things that I worship with in the temple. I was actually doing a hundred day worship of Debbie. So I just added the diet into part of that. And I lost 55 pounds in three months. What? What? Yeah. I had exercise and stuff like that. But it was like, it was part of every day for a hundred days. I exercised, I dieted, and I worshiped Debbie, I worshiped Durga. Were you just eating salad? What were you eating? Like, what was your diet? I was eating salad. I would have oatmeal in the morning, salad for lunch, and then saladed with like maybe some vegetarian meat, like with in the salad too as a protein for dinner. Congratulations. Yeah. Thank you, man. I feel great. But like you said, joy. It brought me so much joy to finally get rid of it. Because I know a lot of it was my bad diet and laziness, but a lot of it was also, it was karmic, man. I had this karmic weight that I had to get rid of. I knew like I could trace it back. I was putting on shirts that fit me 20 years ago that I still had for some reason, you know? And I would stand, you know, I was like, maybe a shirt you like, you're like, oh man, maybe one day I'll be able to do that again. And it's just like kind of false sense of hope. But I was able to do it. But I was like, I remember when I was, I fit in this and all the stupid shit I did to make me not fit in this any longer, you know, or all this, you know, this is why my back hurts chronically, because I just neglected everything in my life. How's your back pain now? I don't know back pain. Wow. So this to me, this is where like, you know, this is where the rubber hits the road, because this is not just some abstract thing where you're doing puja, where you're doing mantra, where this has real world positive consequences that, that, you know, and I mean, I think there's a reason why in AA, they say you need a higher power. I think there's a reason why there is like in any kind of 12 step thing, there's the, it's got to acknowledge that you need help in this regard that you need someone else to eat the poison. You, you, you, you, you need allies and not just allies that have bodies, but allies that are in, you know, that are in these stories, that you feel in the mantra, that there is legitimate transformation that happens through these practices that is, that is more than just like having like moments of epiphany, that your body changes, your physical form changes. You die. That part, that version of you, man, that's my toddler doesn't weigh that much. That's a whole toddler. That's you, you evaporated a whole being. That's like a creature that you is gone. I was carrying around under my shirt, you know, that was like, you know, and like, I look at, I have two dogs and the larger of my two dogs weighs what I lost. I'm like, I had, I carried her around every day for like 15 years. Holy shit. That's heavy. Well, literally heavy. That's crazy. I never thought of that before. It's like you're carrying around a dog or a monkey or whatever you give it, a mollusk, a larva, a big 50 pound larva. Imagine if you were a thin guy and everywhere you went, you had a larva wrapped around your chest and stomach. This has been an incredible, I don't know how I'm going to end on that, but I am. This has been so inspirational, man. And I, you know, every time, yeah. I'm sorry. I started to interrupt. I was just going to say when you were, when you were talking about like the things that you need, like the higher power and stuff like that, it's inspiration. That's what you need. That's what the guru is. That's what God is. That's what the divine is. It's inspiration. It's inspiration to, it's the creative capacity that you can like rise over the mundane self and become the best version of yourself. Robert Ryan, God bless you. God bless your guru. Thank you so much for this conversation. I love to talk to you. It is so good to talk to you. And can you, I, you know, I've skipped over, speaking of like the relative reality, we skipped over that you are this world-renowned tattoo artist who you do some of the, you are, if I ever get a tattoo, you are the only person I'm going to let put ink into my skin, but maybe you could, can you tell people listening about that side of your life for a second where they can find you? Sure. Yeah. I tattoo at a shop that I own with my two business partners called Electric Tattoo here in Asbury Park, New Jersey. When there's not a worldwide pandemic happening, I'm traveling quite often to a lot of places. So once we get back into the travel mode, if we do, I will be coming to a city near you for sure.

It's coming out early next year and it's a description of a lot of the deities that we just talked about and a lot more. It's over 100 new paintings and a lot of writing that have been working on. Oh, man. I can't wait to see it. You can find me on Instagram. That's probably the best place to find my work and it's Robert Ryan 323. I love you. Thank you so much. I love you too, man. Great to talk. I can't wait for this. Great to talk too. When this pandemic ends, I know of a place, if you all wanted to come back to this area, I found a place. I found a place. Awesome. We'll talk about it offline. Howdy, Krishna. Have you been to Mount Soma? Mount Soma, Noth, maybe? It's very close to you. It's a beautiful temple up in the mountains and a giant Hanuman, Morty outside and the pundit there is really good. So when we're able to travel, we'll go visit there together.

Hello pals, it's me, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Hare Krishna! Uh, I love that song. That song just makes you want to stick a heroin needle in your neck and stare at a lava lamp until a gargoyle carries you out of your apartment and into a cave. Beautiful song. Don't fear the reaper by the blue oyster cult. And I love the song. I'm not sure that the song is necessarily a Buddhist message. I think it really is more about a vampire that flies off with a girl, but I'm not positive about that. As a side note, it's also the name of a candy that an entrepreneurial elementary school kid who used to ride my school bus would sell in the morning. I don't know where he got it from, but the candy itself seemed sinister, I guess because the name cult was in it. But it was called Blue Oyster Cult. I think it was called Blue Oyster Cult and it tasted like lemons. Had nothing to do with a band or a cult. Regardless, that song contains within it what I think is the essence of what the advice you guys gave me after my last episode where I talked about how I was terrified over getting these chest x-rays and blood tests, which is what I have to do as part of this protocol I have to follow since I had testicular cancer. And I'm not good at waiting for results from medical tests. In fact, I freak out. I have severe anxiety attacks. No matter what I do, thinking about the statistics, it doesn't help. Like I can think about how there is only a 6% chance that there will be a recurrence of the sort of cancer that I had. And that just doesn't help. Trying to assuage fear with statistics is like throwing matchsticks at Godzilla. It doesn't work. You just, I just get overcome by this sort of tsunami of inner terror, a black wave, a chilling black wave just washes over me when I consider the phone call from the doctor or the doctor's appointment. So that was what I was going through and I didn't expect to get such an amazing response from you guys when I asked for advice. But what I ended up getting was not just really good advice and how to deal with anxiety when you're waiting for medical results or when you're dealing with a medical problem, but also so many stories about what you all are going through. And some of you guys are going through things that make getting chest x-rays and a blood test seem like a nice day barbecuing at the beach with your pals. Something about sharing your problems or opening up about stuff you're afraid of and then hearing what other people are afraid of, it eases the terror in some way and it helps you know that you're not alone. I want to figure out a way to connect everyone who sent me an email with each other, but I don't know how to do that without massively invading your privacy because I'm sure some of you who sent me emails have no interest in being part of a group or a forum or a group of people talking to each other, but I just feel selfish being the only person who gets this kind of support and you all deserve it too. So I don't know, maybe I'll talk with Steve, figure out a way to create a Google group or get all those emails together in some place where you guys can all talk to each other because you helped me tremendously. As it turns out, I had nothing to be afraid of, everything's fine. I went to see my doctor, he says the tests were perfect and that I'm fine. So I don't have to worry about any more tests until June when I have to get another CT scan. And then after that, I only have to get tests once a year. So it's a relief. But just because I'm getting through this current little catastrophe that happened in my life doesn't mean that there won't be another one. And for a lot of you guys, you're still going through your personal struggles right now. And so I wanted to play for you a clip from a Jack Cornfield lecture that I'm listening to that I downloaded from Audible, which addresses the idea of facing our fear in a graceful way. This is from Jack Cornfield's audiobook, Awakening is Real, a guide to the deeper dimensions of the inner journey. And you can get this on Audible, and I'm sure that it's on Amazon too and a lot of other places. So Awakening is Real, a guide to the deeper dimensions of the inner journey by Jack Cornfield. This from Ellie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize winner. He said, suffering confers neither privileges nor rights. It all depends on how you use it. If you use it to increase the anguish of yourself or others, you are degrading, even betraying it. And yet the day will come when we shall understand that suffering can also elevate human beings. God help us to bear our suffering well. So that really speaks about taking the difficulties of one's life, whether it's the spiritual path, or well, there isn't really anything else, frankly. It's the spiritual path, or nothing basically, because that's what your difficulties are. I mean, you know the old kind of trite saying, you're not a human being having spiritual experiences, you're a spiritual being having human experiences, and using them to remember who we are. So sometimes it happens in an accidental way, but in meditation, one deliberately turns toward difficulty, or turns toward the measure of suffering that we're given in life, and says, all right, let me find something that's greater in this heart and mind, through which I can understand and live wisely. There's a passage in the Maji Menekai where the Buddha says, and so I reflected, perhaps I should face my fear. This is the Buddha before he was enlightened. Maybe I should seek out those dark groves, the deepest and wildest parts of the forest, or the charnel grounds and funeral grounds, on the new moon of the month where no light shines, and go out there in the places most feared by humans, and sit or stand in such a place, and not move, while all the wild sounds of the forests and the winds and the animals are heard around me, and not move until I had faced my fear absolutely and fully, and conquered it. So that was the Buddhist little trip into that, and he did. Face your fear. Go into the shadows. We don't have fields of dead bodies that we can sit around these days, and if you do have one, you should call the police immediately, and there's no, if you want to get eaten by a wild animal these days, you actually have to work at it. You used to be able to just stand outside of your hut, and a wolf would come out of the forest and drag you away, but these days, the wolves and the graveyards, they live in our minds, and I love the idea of transforming them into teachers. I love the idea. I'm not very good at executing the idea. In fact, this stuff, as much as I love to talk about it and play clips from it, it's really hard for me to use it, and when I was waiting for these test results, and just in a deep state of anxiety, nothing helped, really. Nothing helped, but the cool thing about Buddhism, and the cool thing about meditation is that it's not something that you're in a rush. It's not something that you can rush. It's just a tool that you can have in the toolbox for the inevitable time when you find yourself in the graveyards and dark parts of the forest of modern life. So hopefully that helps. Jack Kornfield's fantastic. For those of you who are going through the heavy shit right now, I highly recommend that audiobook. You can find out more about him by going to jackkornfield.com. The Dunk of Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.com. Squarespace is a company where you can finally bring your idea for an award winning website into existence. You don't have to learn to code anymore. You don't have to snort Adderall until 4am and rub cocaine into your gum so that you can digest some brand new technological language that will allow you to build a website. Don't do it. Coding can drive you insane. Literally, you can lose your mind from having to deal with formatting HTML and action script, and God knows what. I learned to code four years ago. I learned how to code in action script, and the way I did was by taking amphetamines. I took speed that one of my friends gave me for like three days straight and went to a deep coding trance. It was blissful and demonic. I felt like I was staring into the necronomicon. I felt like at any moment some dark digital demon could come clambering out of my computer screen and rip my eyeballs out and fly off to some dark peak and throw them over the edge. It wasn't fun, and this dangerous dark path of coding is why so many web designers have completely lost their minds and why when you run into them, if you turn your back on them for just a second, you can see their eyes look up into the sky. You can see their eyes dilate and they'll begin to mutter weird strings of code as some kind of prayer. They lose their minds. They become characters in HP Lovecraft's story. For those of you who are web designers and right to complain about the fact that from time to time I jab at you guys during these square space commercials, I'm not talking about you. There are a lot of great web designers out there. I use one. His name's Steve. He's amazing. He's the guy who designed my website. His company's called Chromadial. He's a great person and an excellent web designer, but not everyone on this planet can afford a web designer right away. Sometimes you want to just dip your toe into the digital water and find out if that business selling journals made of grandmother flesh is going to be profitable before you go and get a supremely advanced website.

Your skin is more sensitive than the vulva of a newborn unicorn. It's so sensitive that if you wear regular T-shirts, your skin reacts in the same way that the skin of a satanic child reacts when doused in holy water. You erupt in boils and spray a combination of blood and pus and sweat out into the world. You actually turn into a satanic sprinkler, just spraying death all around you. If I wear a regular cotton T-shirt, then I actually have to go to the hospital for two weeks to deal with the severe boils and diseases that break out all over my body because my skin is so special and so, so very soft. But thanks to Shoredesign T-shirts, I don't have to worry about going to the hospital every time I accidentally put on a friend's shirt. I get to enjoy the blissful experience. It feels like you're being embraced by the wings of a gargoyle. Yes, yes, I think this is the second time I've talked about gargoyles in this podcast, which is weird. Don't know why my mind keeps going to the gargs, but maybe it's because I just found out that gargoyles are very sensitive loving creatures that have been completely misunderstood, and they are great at giving hugs because their wings are so very soft and because they're so lonely because they've been rejected for so long. Shoredesign T-shirts figured this out a long time ago, and what they did is they started luring lonely gargoyles into their T-shirt company using ads on Craigslist. Swarms of lonely gargoyles descend on the Shoredesign T-shirts manufacturing plant in Thailand thinking that they're going to find a soulmate or someone to love them. In fact, what they find is a grinder because they're shoved into this grinder, liquefied, and the liquefied gargoyle wings are what's used as the fabric for these wonderful shirts. If you don't believe me, order one. Go to ShoredesignT-shirts.com, check out their amazing designs, and if you put my name in, you will get 10% off these wonderful, wonderful shirts.

You don't want to go to a target, you don't want to go to a Walmart. Children go into these places and they vomit on literally everything. They put everything into their mouth, they rub their sick botulisms. I don't know why kids have botulism, but kids are dirty, dirty things, they're just filthy. I was in a cafe the other day and there was somebody's kid laying on the floor, literally licking the tiles of a coffee shop, and the mother looked down and said, just building up his immune system, insane parents, insane children. You don't want to go to a retail store, it's a volcano of pus. It's like shopping inside the boil of a leper. Stay at home, it's safe, you can control everything.

Thanks for hanging in through this introduction, everybody. I love all of you. Thank you so much for listening. And now it is with great pleasure and joy that I turn the podcast over to two of the most interesting people on planet Earth. Chris Ryan, who is the author of the bestselling book, Sex at Dawn, which is a sort of biological approach to exploring monogamy and non-monogamy and polyamory and also an anthropological observation of the different ways that people deal with monogamy or non-monogamy. And it's an incredible book and it will reduce guilt that you might be feeling if you're in a monogamous relationship and think something might be going wrong because you're wanting to hump somebody, your neighbor or something. It's completely natural. Chris Ryan also has an incredible podcast called Tangentially Speaking, and you can find that by going to feralaudio.com. Also joining us on this podcast is the legendary comedian Joe Rogan, who is host of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which is one of the most popular podcasts on planet Earth. He's also one of my best friends and I love him. So now everybody, please open your third eyes, send your love tendrils in the direction of Chris Ryan and Joe Rogan. There's a grunt solo in that song. There's like a whole maybe 20-second section where the guy's just going... It's fantastic. That was Chris Ryan that you just heard everybody. And we are here on one of the most epic Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcasts of all time. I'm here with the great Chris Ryan and my friend and mentor, Joe Rogan. That's a lot of responsibility. I really can't be your mentor. Maybe I've graduated. 100%. We're just buddies. I made you a mentee. But you did. At one time. You did take me under your wing. You totally did. Well, you can put it that way. What I saw is an awesome human being that could use a little bit of help. It worked. Duncan and I have had some awesome times together. We lived together for a bit. Really? Yeah, Duncan lived in my place for a little bit. I was engaged to be married and my fiancé left me at the altar and I ended up... Yeah, she gave me... Well, virtually. Not really. But she gave me the boot and I ended up at Joe Rogan's house and what's really funny about it... Crying in the rain. No, it was pretty seamless. It was seamless, but I was depressed as fuck. You were depressed. I was depressed, man. I can remember driving up to your house. I don't remember who's... I was in your... Was it my car? It was in my car. I was riding me up to your house and I'm trying to play Elliot Smith because I'm so depressed. You're like, turn this shit off. You're like wallowing. You had a whole fucking swimming pool full of mud. You were just rowing around and wallowing. But that was the cool thing. He wouldn't let me... He kept pushing me away. He was... What you were doing was really smart because you were like just sort of in a cool way pointing to where I am like wallowing or getting off on the pain. I never really... It took me probably a few years after that to realize just how much I was using suffering as a drug to get off on. But that was the beginning of really realizing like, wow, man, I'm just... I get off on this. Like, I want this kind of experience. I want this kind of suffering. A lot of people do, man. A lot of people enjoy the extremity. The extremity of the pain, of the knowing that their life is falling apart. And then they almost like, it's a self-fulfilling thing. They just create more drama and more bullshit in their life. I was just telling you like, dude, you're a young, funny, smart comedian. You're already good. Like, your life is a fucking amazing ride right now. Oh, this girl doesn't like you anymore. One day she'll love you. Okay? One day she'll miss you so much. Just come on. Come on in. Yeah. And Duncan started going in my tank every day. He started going in the isolation tank. And that's like a big part of like what allowed him to sort it out really pretty quickly, dude. I mean, you don't give yourself enough credit for how quickly you bounce back. And we're like talking like really rationally about the situation. Because it was pretty quick. Well, I mean, you know, I wish that I could say I agree with you, but I don't think I don't think I really bounce back. It took me a long time to figure out that pattern. But I just went, you know, I've been cleaning my house and I went through this closet and I had six boxes filled with journals from the last 15 years of my life, maybe longer. And the really dismaying realization that came to me was the shit I was writing in the journal when I was 16 is almost identical to the shit I was writing in that journal that you found at your house after that breakup. Oh, wow. You found a journal like the bread song? Well, I didn't read it out of respect, but my housekeeper wrote in Duncan's journal, Duncan left his journal behind and she wrote a love letter to her boyfriend. What? In the same journal? Yes. Yeah, it's in there. That journal is just a magnet for two years. Isn't that hilarious? Like I didn't know about it. I Duncan left it at my place for a fucking years it was sitting on my desk for years. I swear to God, I never read it. I opened it up and I said, Oh, this is Duncan's journal, but I have a lot of respect for what people write. There's no way I would read your shit. That's very cool. It's not I would know. I mean, there's no way. It just took you years to get around to giving it back. No, he just never came by and got it. And he even came by my house since then, but never wind up getting for whatever reason. And then one day, most likely, but one day I handed it to him and then just the other day he sends me a text. He's like, dude, that fucking journal has like a Spanish love letter in it. You want me to read it? Have you translated it? No, no, no, no. Out of respect for my housekeeper. I put it into Google translator and it was definitely a love letter, but I couldn't really make out. It's very sweet. Why did she write it in your journal? I think it was just laying around my house and she didn't think it was anything. You know, she thought it was just some open pages that she could write in. It was just sitting there. You know, my fantasy was that some mystical Spanish shaman had read my journal and wrote the answer to my problems at the back like, Oh, wandering soul, I know you're suffering in here, but it was just some is just another love stricken human. What is that? How creepy would that be if it was that? And some of that would be like a premise in a movie, like some magical woman wrote in your journal and like you've you like set up security cameras, how the fuck is she getting in? Yeah, she keeps writing in your journal every night. I knew the Spanish. Yeah, I know when you were ready, you will read this and you know, like now is the time now is the time like a reverse sinister a horror movie where the ghost loves you. They keep like fucking up trying to help you. Yeah, they get in the way, you know, or the timing is bad or something. Yeah, man. I what is that conflict conflict in Chris Ryan? What's the what is that? Why you are the master of evolutionary biology? Why is it built into us this this thing where we we lament and suffer and miss people that we've been intimate with? What is that? Is there some reason for that? Is there a biological explanation for that? Yeah, I think so, because the feeling loved by people feeling protected and respected by people is survival. You know, for our species, that's what made us survive that we had these communities that were so multi dimensional and interdependent. This is why being rejected by friends hurts worse than anything. Yeah, right. Like if you've got a group of friends, and you know, for some reason, they decide they don't want to hang with you anymore, that hurts worse than, you know, like losing a limb long term. It's a very, very painful thing for human being. That makes sense to me, man. But I don't under that makes sense to your friends and your family. Right. But why someone that you're mating with this heartbreak is this what's even more intense because you're allowing yourself to be completely intimate with them, you're naked with them, you're touching tongues, you know, you're touching tongues, your penis is inside them, you know, you're grabbing her ass, you see her asshole, you know, all things that you taste. Wait, is that with the W or? It's an H, just a regular age, but it could be whole. It's both, in fact. Well, I was thinking about this, I was talking to a friend earlier today, actually, about this, and how the way I knew this woman in, let's say in a city we won't name, who had a job where she worked about 10 hours a day. She lived alone, sexy, beautiful, smart woman, and she couldn't bear to come home alone. So she got a dog. She got this yappy little dog, no offense to Fox, who's not yappy. And this dog stayed alone in her apartment all the time. And there was like a little mat for the dog to shit on and the neighbors complain. And so, and I was thinking like, and I talked to her about it, and she's like, but I love that dog. Wait a minute, you love that dog or you love the love that dog gives you? Because what you're doing to that dog is cruel. Yes. From the dog's perspective, I don't see a lot of love here, right? I see what you're getting out of it. And so I think the problem is that we mistake the feeling of being loved for love. That's demonic. That's so satanic, man. Think about that. It's just clumsy. It's not demonic. It's just dumb and poorly thought out. There's nothing demonic about it. You know, it reminds me of this thing I was just reading in Buddhism. The last time we got together and talked, you were saying there's this passivity in Buddhism. And I was just reading this book and it was talking about how there is a difference between mindfulness and being unattached and being detached. There's a difference and a huge difference. One difference is you're numb to the world. You're not feeling it. You're actually like shut down to the world. And the other one is you're completely open to the world, but you're not clinging to any single experience. Exactly. It's the difference between loneliness and aloneness. The Buddha called the difference the one where you're closed off, but you're pretending that you're opened up. He said that is the closest enemy to awakening because you fool yourself into thinking that you're awakened or you're a realized being just because you're shut off to the world or you're like playing it cool. But this isn't about playing it cool at all. It's about feeling everything completely. So what you're saying is that hipsters are satanic. You're essentially saying that the detached hipster. Especially the goth ones. Those are my favorite. Those need the biggest hug. Exactly, Joe. It's so funny you said that man. Let's go hug goths. They need the biggest ones. We'll go to some concerts and just hug everyone. They don't even they don't they don't want to pat. Don't pat a goth. Rub, rub, like really centrally with no like self consciousness. You have to like rub their back with love. If you hug them and pat them, they know it's like the dad pat from that awkward fucking dad that's you know in the military or something. It doesn't really know what the fuck to do with these little kids. All right, yeah. Don't cry. Don't kill yourself. I won't be able to deal with it. It's so funny when you realize that that thing that you're realizing that is the seed of compassion. And the problem with that is when you realize that the whatever you want to call it, it's not just hipsters watch locked up raw. Those people are doing the exact same thing. Harden prisoners who are like they don't feel anything. They don't feel all you're seeing is varying degrees of cowardice. You're just seeing a different version of being afraid to experience life. Well, in your life going back to you at that moment when you were really depressed when you broke up with your your girl and you guys were separated and you were really freaking out. Listen to Elliott Smith what the message that I think you get when you're kind to other people is you also need to be kind to yourself. And you are always kind to other people. You're a very friendly, nice, warm guy. But I don't think you were so nice to yourself. And I don't think you appreciated yourself and enjoyed yourself. And me as an objective observer, sort of objective, you're your good friend. I love you. I thought you were awesome. We were good friends. So it didn't I didn't get why you would beat yourself up. I didn't get him like, dude, you're awesome. Like, what are you talking about? Like, you're funny, you're smart, you're introspective, you're constantly analyzing, you have these new angle we have. Duncan and I used to have conversations when he was the talent booker at the comedy store, I would call in your comics, call in and give their dates, like they say, hey, I'm here Tuesday and Friday. And then they would, you know, book you. He would give it to Mitzi, I guess. Did you give it to Mitzi? Yeah. And later Tommy, did you have to work with Tommy? Tommy was my protege. He created a monster. But Duncan and I would have these conversations where I would call up and we'd have these long conversations where I would just call up and I would say, hey, yeah, I'm here Friday and Saturday. What's going on, man? What are you doing? And then he and I would just have these fucking, you know, we really became phone friends. Oh, this is before you knew each other? No, we knew each other from the store, you know, the comedy store is a real camaraderie environment for us. It's like an academy. It's an artist colony. Yeah, Ari talks about that a lot too. He was there. Like Hogwarts. It's also a place where everyone is given respect. Like one of the cool things about the comedy store is the highest level comedians will mingle with the Sunday Night Open Micers and everybody's just comics, you know, that's legitimately true. Yeah, we used to hang in the back with Eddie Griffin, Damon Wayans, you know, whoever came by. I mean, it was just comics. When I was nobody, I was there and when I got on television. But there's still some puffed up turds who come wandering through there. What's cool about it is you get to witness universal justice all the time because you'll see somebody come strutting through there puffed up like they just like had a meeting with Zeus or something. They have to go on after Joey Diaz. Yeah, you can watch. Yeah, you'll watch that level of justice, but then you watch a much darker justice, which is that the audience turns. No, you see them three years later. You know, after whatever the thing is they got all puffed up about is inevitably faded away. And that thing that they were using is their main identification or the main thing that they're like, this is C. I am a good person. I got a show. I got a show. I got a show. And then and then you get to watch so you get to watch this amazing rise and fall of like, but but you so you see you really see people for what they are because when you run into somebody who's all puffed up and shitty because they've gotten a little bit of success, then or you run into somebody like, I remember like watching Robin fucking Williams, whatever you think about Robin Williams as a comic, that's a famous, super famous mega star as far as comedy goes. And I remember watching him standing outside of the original room. And he was talking to two tourists, like, you know, a guy in dad pants and a woman wearing Hawaiian, a Hawaiian shirt. And I you know, I was like, looking at him to see like, I wonder how you interacts with these people. It was like he's talking to his best friends. He was just right there with them listening, asking them questions, talking to them, not like in a hurry to get away. And I'm like, that is once you've seen that, you have no excuse to be a shithead to somebody because you got a fucking comedy central special. Dum dum. Did I tell you my Robin Williams story? No, I was at the improv, did a show at the improv, like one of the weekend shows where I was headlining for the whole weekend. And I always take pictures with people after show trial to as much as possible. And this guy came up and I was talking to him and he was just he was holding my hand shaking my hand and telling me I was I had this this dolphin consciousness bit of this bit about this idea. It was a real epiphany that I had when I was really high on pot cookies, watching these dolphins play, I was playing with them and cheering with them within why wild dolphins. And while this is going on, I was like, I think they're no different than us. I think they're just in a different body and they can't control their environment like we can. I started trying to analyze what it would be to be a dolphin. And then I thought about it like what if I was like if I was in his body, what if I literally would be him, I would do what he did if I lived his life. And then I started thinking about that with people. And I said, Well, what if everybody is essentially the exact same thing? We're just going through different biological filters, different life experiences, different genetics, different circumstances that we have to handle. And I changed my way. I look at people. I decided to start looking at people as if they were me living another life. And it really happened like trip B is nice to someone as you would be to if you ran into you and you were living another life. But you got to really, it's got to internalize. You got to really, it takes a while to put that into your head. So I started doing it in a joke form, just talking about this. And I didn't even realize this guy who was praising this bit was Robin Williams. I didn't know he's a tiny guy. I thought it was just some old guy with glasses. And I was in the middle of shaking hands with this guy and holding this guy's hand when I went, This is fucking Robin Williams. Like, whoa, this is weird. That's cool. It was really cool. It was intense. And I've criticized him before. You know, he's not a perfect person. He's done a lot of plagiarism. I think he's very talented, but I also think he has an exorbitant need to be loved, a substantial need to be loved, like a lot of us do. And I think he came from a time of less accountability. You know, our time had experienced a few scandals, the Dennis Leary, Bill Hicks thing, and we'd seen the damages that could be done by plagiarism. And our generation of comics were vehemently against it. Yeah. And people grow, you know, people change, you know, whatever. He was on a bunch of coke, you know, that's no excuse. Drugs is not an excuse to be an asshole, but that it's certainly if you're, if you're doing something wrong and you're doing cocaine, it's going to amp what you're up, what you're doing. 100%. 100%. Not to pull this too far away, but are you guys familiar with the aquatic ape theory? Can you describe that? I would love to have that explained. And while you describe it, I'm going to turn the volume up. So I have to crouch down here. You think it sounds okay? Chris Ryan sounds okay? I sound, do I sound all right? I sound a little delicious. I sound great. I'm told I have a sexy body. You don't think he sounds distant because I'm wearing different headphones than you guys are. Listen to mine because I'm sorry about this, you guys. Don't worry about this. Don't worry. I'm telling you. So should I just do the grunt solo? Yeah, let's hear it. Jungle boogie. Oh, no, you're, he's fine. It's fine. It's your headphones. There you go. Just probably your headphones are probably slightly unscrewed or something. Sorry about that, you guys. It's good headphones. You're cheap bastard. You got fucking sponsors now. Living in a house. These do feel kind of plasticy. I got those. Those are old. They're dog shit. Those are from the old days. I do need to upgrade. Well, there's some charm to them. Keep it bohemian. Exactly. So aquatic ape theory, right. The basic idea is that humans at some point in distant, in the distant past, millions of years ago, probably after we split from the chimpanzees about five million years ago. So we're talking three, four million years ago probably. The idea is that these proto hominids lived along the shoreline in parts of Africa that were warm and the water's warm. And so the place that has the most food and is the safest is the sort of tidal zone of the water. So you've got, and when you're in that kind of area, you're not getting attacked by sharks because it's not really deep enough for sharks to come in and you're not getting attacked by leopards and terrestrial predators because you're in the water. So plus there's other clams and mussels and all this kind of shit in the water. So there's a lot of food there and it's comfortable. The body, the water temperature is close to body temperature, so it's comfortable that way. So the idea is that at some point, these animals split into two species, one of which eventually became dolphins and the other of which came back to land. But the sort of explanation for all this is that there's a lot of stuff about humans that appears, that's convergent with marine mammals. Like for example, of all the apes, we're the only ones who have saltwater tears. We've got, we're the only ape with subcutaneous fat. We're the only ape that if you drop an infant in water, it knows to hold its breath. Any other ape, you know, you drop a baby chimpanzee in water, it just breathes water and drowns. A human, you've seen that cover of that nirvana record, you know, that's a baby underwater holding his breath. What dick is doing the experiment where he's dropping baby chimps in water? Hey, it's knowledge. You got to pursue knowledge. What's the evolutionary mechanism of becoming a dolphin from a chimp or from an early chimp? That's wild. Well, you know, all aquatic mammals were at some point land animals. That's why they have lungs. That really hurts my brain when I start thinking about how long it took for that to take place. Yeah, yeah, it's hard to wrap your head around. And that throws a giant monkey ranch into the whole aliens made humans theory. The difference between a person and a monkey is not nearly as weird as the difference between a monkey and a fucking dolphin. Right, right. But now here's what's really interesting. If you look at dolphin anatomy, it's almost the same as human anatomy. The brain, the heart, the lungs, the, you know, like in inner anatomy of a dolphin is very similar to human. I just what I like what you're saying, it leaves room for mermaids. What you're saying there, it really does. What's the in between space, man? It's like you have these proto hominids and then you have the the the dolphin. But in between there, you've got a merman. Well, the idea is that mermaids were manatees, you know, manatees. I know I've heard that that like horny sailors pulled manatees on their ships. I'm not buying it. If they didn't fucking nobody waved a magic wand or hit a microwave button, and all of a sudden the, you know, a chimp became a dolphin. It was a process. I have been so horny, man, in my life. But I have never been so horny that I would fuck a manatee. Do you know how horny you have to be to, if you've seen a fucking sea cow, a manatee, it's got barnacles and oozing sores. Fuck some weird shit. I mean, I don't need to tell you that. You know, people fuck farm animals and, you know, pieces of meat folded over and stuffed in a manatee's jar. Yeah, but okay, let's think about the difference between fucking a sheep and fucking a manatee. A sheep, you've got to, it's in your barn, you corner the thing and you can fuck it. It's so you're not really, you're raping a sheep. Let's just tell the truth. Who knows? This thing doesn't want you in there. Why don't you know that? It probably doesn't know it wants you if it had to choose. If you'd say stomp once for you want me to fuck you, stomp twice for no, it would probably fucking, you're not going to fuck me, man. Just give me some food and stuff. But wait a minute, I got to stand up for the film. What an unlucky sheep. You're taking my fucking fur. Now you want to fuck me. You're killing my babies and eating them too, by the way. That's what lamb is. Lamb is baby sheep. You know, when they get older, they get tough and wiry and it's not so good unless it's a stew. I'm thinking you might go to the sheep and the sheep's like, wait a minute, you're going to fuck me or you're going to kill me and eat me? I'll take the fucking. Well, that sounds like rape. If you fucking storm a village and said, listen, you got a choice. I'm going to fuck your baby or I'm going to kill it and eat it. Yeah, yeah. That's romance. That's Jesus Christ. Well, when you fucking, do I get it back? That's a quality problem. Anyway, here's the, I mean, the deciding factor is, you know, you're on a ship, right? You're on some fucking ship with your friends, you're with like a bunch of British rapists at sea for five years, killing whales or whatever the fuck you're doing, beating seals around the world. There are no sheep, dude. There are no sheep. It's like a manatee or, you know, some ugly British dude. I picked the ugly British dude over, over, over. Listen, man, if I've got a pick between fucking some like withered version of Russell Brand with like a, with a, with a, with a hook, with a hook hand or I've got a sunburn or I've got to dive into the shark infested waters to try to like lasso a massive rhino type thing. I don't think they're actually fucking it. I think it's more of a, just an idea that there could be a woman out there that saw them and like, I think we have a hard time understanding A, what it would be like to live in an area where if you wanted to picture something, you had to fucking draw it. Right. I mean, you're, you're talking about a long ass time ago and their perception of all these unique things that they would encounter was insanely ignorant. You literally knew what, I don't like the way I said that. It's not very pretentious. The way I said, literally, literally, literally knew, you literally knew what you saw and that is it. Everything else was a really abstract expression of these things. If you saw the Rocky Mountains in a painting, would you really know what the Rocky Mountains look like? No, you would have to take this artist's interpretation of that experience. But if you were there and you saw the Rocky Mountains, you would be like, wow, that's the fucking Rocky Mountain. Like you're, you only know what you've experienced. So all of a sudden you're on a boat and there's this undocumented animal that you find in a place where you've had nothing but fucking potatoes for six months and you're dying of diseases and everyone smells like shit and they're throwing up and vomiting. You would imagine that it was a woman. You saw her in the water. It was misty. It was dark. There's a woman in the water. There's a woman in the water. She's calling to me, man. Some crazy fuck really thinks that it's a woman. He jumps overboard. He's dead. The siren dragged into the rocks. No, he was an asshole. That guy was an asshole. There was a test, a massive test. We all got over a wooden boat and sailed across the ocean. This guy failed. He failed hardcore. The siren called me into the rocks. No, the universe wanted you to get your weak fucking seeds and jump overboard with them. Guaranteed nobody stopped him from jumping in there. They're like, hey, there's a fucking mermaid in there for you, Tommy. She's calling you, Tommy. Go to her. Hey, it wasn't his fault. Mrs. Johnson, they led him with magic to the rocks. I like that these sailors turned into New Jersey people. New Jersey garbage men. The floating mafios. Yeah, they're just assholes. Well, okay, now, following your line of logic there, then, do you think that the human imagination is is devolving, is withering away? Because we've got, like, now it's like you don't even have to imagine anything. Like, when's the last time you jerked off without looking at porn? All the time. Can you just close your eyes? I do that in bed. Yeah, I do that in bed. Yeah, if I'm in bed, I need to go to sleep. I just just think about things and I jerk off. Wow. All right, so you still got a vivid imagination. How many, what do you have like your top five masturbation memories? Spank. No, they're all just functional. You make stuff up. Yeah, sometimes. It's not just caveman shit. Just get it out of my body and start to go to sleep. I'm not, I'm not like trying to enjoy the fantasy. It's not like sex. Like, you know, when you, I think one of the people that, there's people that appreciate sex and there's people that I bet nobody wants to fuck. Because the people that when nobody wants to fuck you for whether it's a physical thing or your personality, you probably don't appreciate what it's like when two people actually want to fuck each other. Like, without saying anybody's name, a friend of mine was telling me the other day that he just got back with his ex-girlfriend. They had a little bit of a breakup. And he got back with his ex-girlfriend and I was like, how was it when you guys fucked? Like, it was fucking incredible. It was amazing. Are you talking about me? I don't want to say it. I'm trying not to say it. I wasn't going to say it. I don't know if you like talking about like personal things on the air. On the last, on my last podcast. You went into depth about it. No, on the last, on the last, on the last podcast, I actually asked the audience, is it possible to get back together with your ex-girlfriend? Is that, is anyone to have that? Don't ever ask that question. Does that ever work? Because of course it's possible. You're doing it. But no, I'm glad I asked because you get, no, I'm, this is the thing I'm learning as a side note before we, before we get, before we get into that. As a side note, here's what I'm learning. The audience, like, I, like, I ask them questions about stuff and they email me answers and they're fucking good answers. Like, the last podcast I asked, because I got to get chest x-rays tomorrow, because I have to do this every four months and it sucks and it stresses me out and it's like, I don't like doing this. I'm freaked out about it. I don't, and for two years I've got to be freaked out every four months. I've got to get freaked out every four months to get these x-rays. Is any, is anyone out there dealing with this? Do you have tricks for how to deal with this? Because I don't know how to deal with it. I keep freaking out over it. And man, I got like, so many responses and all the responses were like, I've got to, some of them were like, I have a cyst in my brain. I have like, you know, like stuff from people who are experiencing this, the whole spectrum of medical anxiety. And wow, man, it really helps me to read all the different, like the advice that they gave me, like the best advice, you know, the best advice was, it sounds morbid, but it's pretty cool, which is like, look at your life, find out what you love about your life, what you're proud of that you've done in your life, think about what you've done and realize that even if right now you die, you've had a great life. Just recognize that. Just recognize that you're living right now. Be in the moment. People keep saying that. Like, bring it back to the moment. Don't cling to things and just know that you can't stop time, no matter what this situation is going to change. So I got that just from asking, throwing this question out there. The thing about the ex-girlfriend, you know, I got a bunch of sweet emails back, which is like, you know, I'm married. I married a girl I broke up with and we have kids and I love her and the home's filled with love, but it was hard. It's hard. And so anyway, and yes, the sex is amazing when you get back together with your ex-girlfriend. My point being that people that don't think that sex is a big deal, I don't think they've experienced sex with someone who wants to have sex with them, whether it's their physical body, whether it's their personality, whether it's the relationship that they chose. I mean, there's people that have unappealing bodies to you or I, but to each other, they love each other so much, their bodies are delicious. Right. I think there's a lot of people that don't, they don't get that success, just like some people never get good friends. I know a woman, she is in her seventies and she doesn't have any friends and she hasn't any friends for a long time. She has children and she stays in touch with them and she's kind of burdened someone away because she's very overbearing and always negative, but she doesn't have friends. And then there's people like you and I who have a bunch of great friends. Right. One of the main reasons I stay in LA, one of the main reasons why I don't just fucking pack up and go to Colorado, is because all my friends are here. Me too. We're all fucking each other up because we're stuck in LA. I'm getting very close to buying a giant chunk of land in Colorado and starting a compound. Wow. I was thinking about this. I was listening to you and Shane Smith talking about this. He was saying how the more he sort of gets to know these people in the upper echelons of government and corporations, the more he sees that a lot of them have like, what's he called it, escape hatch or something. Like a piece of land, a house, somewhere, if shit gets crazy, they've got a place to go. And I was thinking about that. And the problem with that is they'll be alone. And what we really should do is like people like you guys are talking about like, you guys really have a community. I don't really have that. I'm tempted to move to LA actually simply because I've met so many great people. I hate LA. Come here with us. I don't live in LA. Well, you live, you know, I live out in the boonies. Right. That's the boonies. But you drive an hour, like to hang with Duncan for an hour, then you drive an hour back. So what, you know how often I do that? It's not that often. What do you have a nine to five job that I don't know about? No, no, no, no, no, traffic at 7am. Exactly. So what are you worried about? The times that you're driving are going to be completely unusual. Yeah. Not only that, like you don't have to be centrally located. You don't have to live in the shit. You know, you just live in a nice place where it's quite fucked. You can live in Santa Barbara. I love Topanga. But anyway, my point is that I really like this idea of having a place out there that you can escape to. But I think the key is have it have the community there. Yes. Like have 15 really good friends all you don't have to you don't have to own the same property or whatever. But you're all there. So like you can all go there in the summer. And you know, it's like, yeah, let's all get away together. Because being isolated, it ain't going to work. Yeah. It's like that movie where the kid, what's that movie? Into the wild? Is that it? Yes. The guy goes to the woods, then realize once he's in the woods, you can't enjoy this by yourself. Right. Like we fucking need each other, whether we like it or not, we need each other. I like it. I like that we need each other. Because I think if you, you put out the right vibe, you can surround yourself with the right people and you can have a cool group of humans that you surround yourself with. Well, that gets us back to the first point you raised, right? Like why do we get so attached to somebody who loves us? It's because that's your community. Think about how many people you know whose community is their mate. We obviously are separate. We obviously are different from each other. We're separate from each other. But yet we're not. Because we can't rely on each other. We can't exist. If we exist completely solitary, we either go crazy or we were crazy in order to accept that. Right. Like when you think about like the fucking unibomber type, the Ted Kaczynski guy, he's by himself in the woods in a cabin and riding crazy shit. Yeah. Just completely by himself. Like that. That's a broken mind. What's the worst punishment you can give a criminal? Solidary confinement. Yeah. And Amnesty International considers that torture, by the way. It is. Well, it is. I mean, you think about what happened to Bradley Manning after he released all those WikiLeaks documents. They left that guy naked in a cold room where he could barely keep his body temperature warm enough to stay alive. And they gave him solitary for years. 24 hour light. 24 hour light. And the dude was not convicted of anything at the time. These demons. Sorry. And they kept it going on for years. It's I mean, it's really unbelievably evil. And anyone involved in that should be stripped of power. They should remove them from any position of power. Right away. They'll say what you're doing is fundamentally anti human, regardless of what this guy did. If this guy ate babies, I could maybe understand it and maybe you should just shoot him and get it over with. But all this guy did was he made a moral judgment about information that he believed would change the way people view what he believes is an unjust war because he's a part of it. All right. That's not a debate. What kind of a fucking society do we have if that's not subject for debate? And if this guy is a traitor, because he showed something that actually did take place that whole that was illegal. Yeah, that whole fucking thing where they're they're shooting missiles and they find out that there's kids in the van. They're like, fuck them. They shouldn't take their kids. You're like, whoa. Yeah, we that is no judgment. Take judgment out. That is information. Okay, and that's information that we should all have access to. If we want to make an informed decision about whether or not we support a war, right, whether we no judgment aside, we don't say you those guys are pigs, they should die or hey, those guys are in a crazy situation. They're just human beings and you and I would do the exact same thing. Forget a bolt, forget both sides of that coin and just say that's information. It's like one of your kids comes to you and tells you that their uncle is molesting the other kid. And so like if you have two kids and a kid tells you, hey, you know, John's getting molested by uncle William. And then instead of being like, thank you for telling me, you're very courageous for telling me that we're going to take care of this. You're safe. It's like you little shit. You take that kid and you put him in the room and lock him in the light on and take his clothes off and turn the air conditioning off. Patty, I just wanted to save William. But also, I mean, take it to the next level. Like you said, even if he's eating babies, you know, maybe you should shoot him, whatever. The thing is, we've got this incredibly punitive sense of punishment where like even if the guy is eating babies, it doesn't help anyone to torture him, right? Those babies are gone. So all you're doing is you're saying, we got to separate this guy from society. So do that. Not really. What they're really doing is they're letting that information get out so everyone knows if you ever fuck up and go against the government again, expect this. Yes, this is what we do. Fuck you as hard as we can. But you know, the thing is, and you're right about that, of course, there's a publicity element to this. But the thing is, we're doing this, we, the United States government is doing this to thousands of prisoners all over the country who are in perpetual solitary for the rest of their lives for no purpose. There's no reason. It's just a, it's just because they're bad and we want to fuck them. It's important to realize that it's not just the United States government. It's all governments. It's most governments. No, wait a minute. We've got a higher percentage of our population in prison than any other country on earth. That's because every other country, you can just get away with crime and no one gives a fuck. Go to China and kill somebody, they go, wow, what do you want me to do? No, China, they fuck, China, they execute. Fuck, man, the goddamn, those, those wax museums, those wax museums filled with plastinated, very busy. Can I investigate? What do you want me to do? So I can say I was not here during this racist element. How is it racist to make a Chinese accent? I really want to know how you can't make fun of, can I make fun of an Englishman and am I a racist now? Yeah. Well, and how come Chinaman's racist as a word in Englishman? Exactly. Might as a racist to talk about Australians. No, that's not racist. But if I go, I'm going to try to, you'll kill someone. I am very busy. Now all of a sudden, I'm a racist or our Chinese people, all your fucking, and some of the Chinese people complaining, by the way, white liberals with armpit hair, they're like, enough of this fucking male privilege, white male privilege. Did you see the trouble? Did you see what trouble Natasha got in? Did you see your awesome apology letter? Yes, it was fantastic. The last thing, it was beautiful. It was about as good as I could get. I tweeted that and some guy was like, some like smug dickhead was, was like, oh yeah, her publicist just set that whole thing up. This is all just to raise her profile. That's just a fool. Dude. There's no need to, no need to even talk about that guy. He's paranoid fucks, man. They're the same people who fucking government, man. No, the fucking, what are they called? The drama actors, conflict actors? What are they called? What do you have in your hand that's, that's been lit on fire? This? Yeah. Aubrey gave me this. This is, this is, this is the wood that they burn when you're doing ayahuasca ceremonies. It smells really good. But I'm, I'm going to get a beer. Is there anyone else? Yeah, we'll all take one. Let's take a pause. We don't have to pause. No, we don't have to pause. We'll just wait for Chris to come back. No, it's, what are those things? We just, let's talk about Chris. He's beautiful. He's a beautiful man. What did we, what were we talking about right before I interrupted you? So rude. Oh god, like that's, that's exact. That's like a component of podcasts is interrupting each other and forgetting what we were talking about. That's a big part of it. And people at home going, what the fuck? You guys never completed that story. Well, dude, um, can I smell it? Yeah. What is it called? Do you know? I can't remember. It's really light. But that's the, I bet that's, that smells like doing ayahuasca. Yeah, it sure does. Doesn't it? It smells like fear or love. Yeah, but they're the both the same. They're next door neighbors. Oh, they are. Well, fear is like, yeah. Isn't it weird that we let everybody use fire? Well, any fucking asshole, anybody, you can be a five-year-old kid. Can I get some matches? You don't have to have a fire license. You can have a license to use fire. One of the most destructive forces on earth. Ridiculous element. And think about all the different things that are flammable that you could just buy slowly but surely and accumulate from a liquor store or from, you know, any drug store. Just think about, go to a car place, you know, that's think about all the different things you could light on fire. Dude, I was just watching this show. It's, I don't remember what it's called, but basically they just, they drop X military vets in really shitty places. Dude, you're screwed. Yeah, it's pretty cool, man. And this guy, he took some kind of component that's in the stuff that you put into flowers, you know, like the little packets that come when you have flowers and you dump it in the water. If you take that and you mix it with antifreeze, it creates a flammable chemical and bursts and like, well, start a fire. Whoa. So if you take flour powder and mix it with antifreeze, it starts a fire. You don't even need a fucking match. You just like pour that and flour powder and boof. I don't know flour powder is a word for it. Sounds like a type of acid or something. Dude, the thing I wanted to talk to you about that you were, that you were describing with the dolphins is something that I've been reading, which is, so I'm reading this book on Buddhist psychology by Jack Cornfield and it's fucking awesome how deep Buddha went into breaking down the way human beings experience reality. And so the idea is that there is a field of consciousness that we are in, like water, like fish swimming in water. So there's a field of consciousness that we're in and they compare it to, they use two comparisons. They compare it to a mirror, this consciousness, this field of consciousness, in the way you look in a mirror, a mirror can be reflecting anything. It can be reflecting a beautiful girl. It can be reflecting tigers eating somebody. The mirror is not affected by the reflection at all. So that's this field of consciousness completely not affected by the things that are emerging into it and never touched by the things emerging into it. So the field of consciousness is like a thing that is flowing through us and we're flavoring it with our experiences. So the experiences that you have as a person is like dropping dye into water and there's these temporary colorings of this field of consciousness and that's the human experience. And so the idea is you begin to watch. If you begin to watch, you will start to notice that your experience is broken down into bits into like these little beads or moments of experience. And with the more you meditate, apparently the more you realize that like, you know, the way you breathe, like if you start watching your breath, this is what I love about meditation and meditating lately and you start, you start, you just watch your breath. That's it. So you sit, you watch your inhales through the nose and exhales through the mouth and you just watch your breath. That's all it is. You just watch your breath and suddenly you realize, fuck man, I've never paid attention to the way I breathe. Like I've never even noticed the way I breathe. And you'll notice that when you inhale, there's a microsecond where you're not breathing anymore. The breath stops. There's a pause in between the inhale and the exhale and the exhale and the inhale. There's this weird little pause, this moment of no breathing. And that's a really important moment in Buddhism because it's supposed to represent the exact same thing that's happening with these moments of experience that make up our, the threat of our existence. And in between each of these beats or moments of experience, there's this pause. It's a micro pause, like a, probably shorter than a millisecond, but it's a pause. And that pause is the field of pure consciousness, which is what we actually are. That's what you really are. You're not, you're the person that you think you are is the experience of consciousness meeting this temporary manifestation that's the atomic cloud or swirl of particles that makes up a Joe Rogan. But that's not what you are. You're just consciousness flowing through it, like water through a sea cave or something, you know? It's really cool, man. It's really cool because the idea is that the more you let go of this identity of the self, the more you move into this expansiveness. That's what they call it. They use really cool terms for clear mind. They always use like the sky expansiveness. It's this open field of freedom. It's freedom, really. So that reminded me of the joke you were talking about. And your joke is very similar to an idea in Buddhist psychology. That's very fascinating that you flavor reality around you. And that mirrors the idea that psychedelic trips, when you have a psychedelic trip, you are experiencing the psychedelic trips of everyone who's ever experienced them before, all connected together as like a mosaic. Have you ever heard that about psychedelics? It's one of the weird things they say about things like, what was the shit that Timothy, Special K? Ketamine. Timothy Leary was really into, not Timothy Leary, John Lily. Lily was into ketamine and isolation tanks. He would whack himself with ketamine and go into an isolation tank. And dolphins. Yes. His thing was that, like McKenna described, taking ketamine as it's like there's no experiences there. You go there, it's like a city of empty office buildings. And you're like, you're wandering around like, where is everybody? Like, what's going on here? And it's like, that's the feeling that you got. Like you were really new to the party. Whereas if you take mushrooms, you're dealing with thousands and thousands of years of experiences. Also why when you do ayahuasca, you experience snakes, jaguars, all the different things of the jungle, black people. There's all these different like archetypes that repeat themselves over and over again in the ayahuasca experience. So much so that it's really hard to deny that these same things might somehow or another be connected because this is the experiences of the people that took this ayahuasca in this place for thousands and thousands of years. And there's their concerns, dancing, jaguars, snakes. What do you think about that, Chris Ryan? I've had two ayahuasca experiences. I didn't see any snakes or jaguars in either one of them. But I mean, I'm not sure if this is directly related, but I think it is. You're talking about fields and intersecting fields. I have this, I've had experiences twice now, once with ayahuasca and once with piety, where something really freaking bizarre happened before I took the drug. And in the case of piety, before I knew I was going to take the drug. So it seemed as if there was some sort of like a field that got to me first before the experience. Dude, I have had the exact same experience with LSD, where like I can remember back when I used to take acid all the time, I can remember in the morning, I remember once clearly in the morning thinking, I'm going to take LSD tonight, I can already feel that I'm going to take LSD tonight. I had no acid, no access to acid, didn't know anybody who had it. But like that afternoon, I remember running into someone who was selling acid and like he sold me acid and I took it. But I remember feeling like this backwards, I know exactly what you're saying, like time is melting backwards. Now, the non psychedelic skeptic would say, this is because you were thinking about LSD for a long time. So there were many days where you're like, man, I'm going to get acid today. And you didn't get any acid. Or they're like, you took, we were taking acid every other day. So there's like 80% chance. When you, when you say the weird things happen to you, what did you, what did you mean? Like, what were these things? You want me to, it's like a three minute story. So I'm in Brazil, first time ever with Stanley Kripner, who you've met and hopefully you'll meet at some point. We were in Porto Alegre. It was my first trip with him. He was my, my professor in grad school and he invited me as first trip I went on with him. And then later he and I went to 30 probably countries around the world together. But this is our first trip together. And he, before we went, he said, is there anything you'd like to check out when we're in Brazil? We were doing a trip in Porto Alegre Salvador and Rio. And Stanley is famous in Brazil, like really famous. Like there there was a crowd of people at the airport to greet us and, you know, sign his books. He's the godfather of Brazilian parapsychology. He's like, anyway, so, so we're in Porto and I told him, I'd like to check out ayahuasca. So he, you know, wrote to somebody and arranged that we would go and visit one of the two churches in Brazil that has permission to use governmental permission to use ayahuasca in their ceremonies. There's Santo Daime and União de Vegetal, UDV. So we went to a UDV church. So these guys came and picked us up in Porto Alegre. And we're in the car driving to this place. I'm not sure how far away it is, but we've been driving, you know, maybe half an hour on the highway. And we turned off and we're going down this bumpy road. Stanley's in the front seat, passenger seat. There's the Brazilian guy driving, another Brazilian guy in the back. And the three of them are all chatting in Portuguese, which I don't speak, but Stanley does. So I'm just looking out the window, right? And we're sort of bumping along this dirt road. And they're, you know, typical scene you'd imagine, like, you know, little houses, chickens, kids running around with no pants on, you know, like a real rural third world kind of scene. We're cruising, we're going on maybe 10 kilometers an hour just bumping along. And I look and walking down, I'm in the back right seat, and walking down toward us on the left side is this beautiful woman in a sari, like an Indian sari with a bindi, the red dot in her forehead. And she's carrying like a shallow soup bowl. And she's carrying it really carefully so she won't spill it. And she's stepping carefully and she's hot. So I'm checking her out. And I sort of turn and check her out from the back as we go by. And I'm thinking, man, I hope she's part of this thing. You know, I hope it's close up here because she was really sweet. And, and then we pull 100 meters out, we pull in. I forget, we're getting out of the car. And I say to Stanley, Hey, did you see that woman back there? And he said, No, I said, Oh, man, smoking woman back there. And this is my first trip to Brazil. So I'm like, I'll key it up on Brazilian women, you know, right. And so then they show us around the place, they show us where they grow the the two plants that they mix and they make the brew and all that. And then we have a light dinner. And then like two hours later, we go into this room where they're going to have the ceremony. And there's a table up front for the guests, one of which is us. And then there are all these folding chairs and rows. And as we go into the room, she's sitting in one of the front rows. And I say to Stanley, Yeah, there's that woman I saw. And he said, Oh, yeah, she's beautiful. Oh, great. So we go, we sit down, we take the tea. And you know, the way they do it in that church is you drink everybody drinks the tea and then you just sort of sit there in dim lighting for a couple hours. And everyone has their experience. And you just sit there with your eyes closed and you have your experience. And then there's what they call a mestre, the teacher, they'll bring up the lights and people talk about what they saw, what they experienced and he'll sort of lead a bit of a group therapy kind of thing talking about, you know, what we're learning today or what you learned or whatever. It's a very cool thing, wonderful, very effective. I want to do that with addictions and things like that. Anyway, so okay, I at this point, I was in the process of separating from a woman I really loved a lot. And there was no anger or play the Hulk music. No recrimination. What's Hulk music? The piano music when the Hulk would walk away at the end of every episode. Oh, yeah. Okay, I'll play that. So you don't play it. Don't let me. I'm sorry. So you can edit that in later. So anyway, it's a very painful process because we loved each other, but she wanted to have kids and, you know, a beach house and I was like a guy was never going to have any money. And you know, that's not my thing. And so sad when you really like someone and you just can't meet. But you know what? She and her husband are two of my best friends in the world. They've got our cats. They've had our cats for the last two years and all our shit in their attic. Really? Yeah, they're wonderful people. We were at their wedding, you know, it's wonderful. But anyway, so so but it was very painful because I think when most people break up, they like slice the knot and we were untying it, you know, trying not to hurt anyone, you know. And so it was painful. And as I was tripping, I kept looking at this woman who was sitting there with her eyes closed. So I wasn't, you know, making her uncomfortable. But I would look at her and she would help me because she would just make me tune me into the fact that there are other women, there will be love, there will be happiness. I know, you know, it'll it's going to be all right, just remind myself the world is full of beauty and love. And anyway, but she doesn't, you know, she's Brazilian, she doesn't even speak English, whatever. It's not about her individually, right? Yes. So the whole thing happens and they do the ceremony and the talking, the therapy and all that. And then it's over. And we get up and the mestre says, Oh, Christopher, have you met Hasila? Her name was Hasila. And she comes over, she speaks perfect English. Hey, how are you? And I said, I got a, I got a puke because I was like waiting to puke. I ran outside and puke and I came back in and I said, man, the gods have a sense of humor because ever since I saw you on the road out there, I've been wanting to meet you. You're just so striking. Like, you know, the way you're dressed and you're beautiful and you're here in this rural like setting and wow. And she's like, wow, how long are you going to be in Puerto Alegre? A few days, whatever. Here's my number. Okay. So then I hooked up with her in Puerto Alegre. We went out. We had dinner a couple of times. She took me to her house. She was much younger than me. She was like 21. I was probably 30, 36 or something at that point. And I remember we were lying on her bed in her house. She was showing me pictures. She had grown up, her parents were Sanyasin. She had grown up in Hawaii, Oregon, India and Brazil, which is why she spoke English so well. And she was showing me and she had been raped. Somebody when she was 11 had given her acid and raped her. Oh my God. Yeah. So she'd had some real traumatic shit. And I remember she's showing me pictures and telling me the story and she looks at me and she says, this is the first time I've ever been alone with a man and I wasn't afraid. Wow. It was so beautiful. Now, I didn't, when I say I hooked up with her, we didn't have sex. It was nothing. It was just, you know, beautiful friendship. Wow. That's so crazy. Okay. Now, last night, the last night I'm in Porto Alegre, I meet her for a drink, say goodbye. And I say to her, you know, this has been great. This is, you know, my first experience in real life. She turned me on to Carlinhos Brown. You know, I never heard Carlinhos Brown. I don't know that. Oh, he's like the James Brown of Brazilian music. He's fantastic. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. You'd know his music if you heard it. Anyway, so she turned me on to all this great music. She introduced me to friends and I was just like, this is so wonderful to meet you and what you've given me in just a couple of days. And since I saw you on that road, I knew that you, you just had this energy and she's looking at me and she says, listen, I didn't want to say anything earlier, but now that I know you a little bit, I think you'll be okay with this. I was never on that road. Holy shit. That's nuts. She said, I don't know what you saw, but I was taking care of the kids behind the building. I don't know anybody out there. There's no reason for me to be walking on that road. I where would I be going? Listen, she had an acid flashback. That's all that is. She forgot she was on the road. No. She gave her acid when she was 11. She had an acid flashback when she was 21. That's somebody who's never taken acid talking, ladies and gentlemen. Joe Rogan has never taken OSD. One of the great travesties of the modern world. Why is that travesty? Because, man. It's one of the classic psychedelics. Right. But why do I need to follow all the classics? The same reason you should read Play-Doh. It's an important experience. Is this the gentleman, Carlinos Brown? Yeah. That's the dude. Yeah, he's great. Look, man. I want to be a skeptic, but I can't be a skeptic anymore. I believe that there's something else that pokes into the world from time to time. This certainly is. There no doubt is something else out there. I mean, that's what the imagination is. The imagination is something undescribable. People want to quantify it, and they even want to diminish it by saying that it's something silly. Oh, he's imagining that he's on Mars. Poor little Billy with his cardboard sword. He's imagining. He's a gladiator. But the imagination is responsible for this fucking podcast. It's responsible for microphones. It's responsible for electrical cables. It's responsible for the internet. It's responsible for the house that you're living in. It's responsible for every fucking single thing we're wearing that we drove. It's all a manifestation of the imagination. The imagination is literally the fucking machine that creates everything we see in human society. It's not a little thing. It's the fucking thing. It's the thing. It's the greatest thing that anybody's ever... Hey, you don't need imagination, which needs hard work. You fucking show up on time. You do your job, and you go to bed with a sense of satisfaction. And you jerk off, and you go, when you do it. That guy doesn't have a Budweiser bottle to drink unless someone figured out how to make glass. That's all the imagination. The imagination is the whole fucking ball of wax. It's the silent... Oh, shy. I didn't do anything. No, no, it was you guys. It's the imagination. The whole thing is the imagination. Even language comes out of the imagination. The idea of making a noise with your fucking face comes out of the imagination. All of it does. The imagination figured out how to hunt. When you see an orangutan getting ants with sticks, when they stick sticks in there, that is the imagination. What do you think that is? Describe that. What do you think the imagination is? What is that? It's the machine that creates, and it's the machine that changes. Why a machine? Because I think that it's all the same. I think there's a machine, there's a genetic machine that allows a caterpillar to become a butterfly, and then there's imagination that allows a human being to one day physically manifest the big change. You know, it's weird because imagination existed prior to machines. Like, imagination was there when there were no machines. But it grew the same way humans grew, the same way a woolly man grew. Machines grow out of imagination. Yes, all of it does. Not that it matters. It's, you know, whatever. It's semantics, but it's like the term machine. When I hear the term machine, I think of this, like, right angles and a cold, dead thing. The imagination is, yeah, inorganic. You know the greatest Marshall McLuhan quote ever? I know what you're going to say, but say it. Human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. Yes. God damn it, he wrote that in the 60s. Yeah, we're all like walking clitori. Is that plural clitoris? Is it clitori? It is now. Is it really? It was never used even more than one. They're too shamed. We're shaves too. Only one clit is fine. There's no need to say clitoris. Garden of clitori. Can I interest you in a bowl of clitori? I only eat lamb clitori. And while they kill the lamb, whether you like it or not, it's not so bad to eat the clitori. It's actually quite green. It's so weird that we are the clitori of the earth. We're like the earth we are. Do you know the clitoris is the only organ in the human body whose sole purpose is pleasure? That's you obviously never seen my butt. I haven't ever documented it. It's pure pleasure. Speaking of which Conor Habib says hello, I just talked to him the other day and he was like, yeah. I got to do a podcast with that dude. I heard he's quite fascinating. He is. He's super cool. I'm a bad friend. I got to go have coffee like I fucked. I'm sorry Conor Habib. I'm a bad friend. Oh, sweetie. You'd never fucking clean out your voicemails though. I like Duncan's strategy for never getting voicemails. He never deletes voicemails. Very intentional. Can't you just not have a voicemail box? Extremely in just text. I had to take on that strategy for the Rogan board. I'm just getting too many private messages because you could just send me a private message. I can't answer them all. It's impossible. Did somebody tweeted something yesterday like with me and you and I don't know. It was that thing with you and Nancy Grace. Do you see that? So for some reason it was like Nancy Grace saying, pot makes you fat and sloppy and Joe saying, yeah, you can abuse anything. Even cheeseburgers. And there's a picture of Joe looking like super fit and Nancy Grace looking sloppy and fat. And so the point was, you know, come on. But anyway, my name was, for some reason, my Twitter handle was included in that. And now I can't look at Twitter because it's just flooded with retweets and mentions. My Twitter is a cascade. I have 1,200,000 and as of the time of this podcast, somewhere around 50, 250,000 people. So I like that you keep that much of a track on my fucking. I'm on it every day. I think it's a valuable resource for communication. I learn more from things people send me. The way it used to be, it's like the idea of Twitter was like super narcissistic. Everybody was like, I don't give a fuck if you're going to the movies. Because that's where people would do like on my way to the show on my way to the movies in the car with Mike, you know, like people were writing really dumb shit. And then somewhere along the line, people said, no, no, no, this is good because it keeps people from being verbose. This 140 text limit is actually probably a good idea because it shrinks URLs, the tiny URL option. So because of that, you're allowed to like transmit information at a rate that's just never been possible before because blogs are too goddamn long. Nobody wants to read your bullshit. Nobody wants to watch your video or you pontificate for fucking 20 minutes. But if you send a tweet, they tweet 140 characters, science invents new form of skin, you know, whatever, you send it to me and I'm like, holy shit, I read it and I retweet it. A million 200,000 people then have access to that. And then they go, oh, if you fucking send that guy some cool shit, he'll retweet it. And then a million people see it, send it to him. So they send it to me and you become like a portal. But how do you how do you manage the volume? I can't do what I can do. So you just don't have any obligation when you've got time to read whatever is current and you miss what I do it in good faith, do it all in good faith. I read what I can I go on when I can I do but I don't let it take over my life because it would take over every second of every day of every minute of it would be impossible to ever have time to do anything else. That thing you just fucking tweeted dude of the Iranian man who hasn't taken a shower in 30 years. He smokes animal shit. Yeah, he smokes animals done. It's like the dirtiest man on earth. It's he's comedically dirty. Like you see the picture of him with six cigarettes in his hand. That's fucking amazing. And you would fuck him before Emanity. No, I don't think so. There wouldn't be hesitation. I wouldn't want to be within a 20 mile radius of that guy. Yeah, I feel like I'm really fortunate to be in this weird portal position. And that's how I view my my take on things is that I for people people have entrusted in me the responsibility of being a portal because I've been so adamant about my thoughts and what I believe and you know my my philosophies and being nice to people and that we're all together in this thing and then because of that people tweet me shit on a regular basis and they know that I'll tweet it out. So what I think it really is is like it's a portal situation like this guy can handle it. He knows that he knows what to do with this. Send him the information. You know, you send some of the information and they can pop up how they get sent it to a million people. That's never existed before a good TV show a good TV show on cable. If you're lucky, we got a million viewers last night. Wow. Well, Twitter gets a million viewers every fucking minute. Yeah, every minute of every day, anything you send Dr. Chris Ryan, you know, you send Chris Ryan PhD. Do you send that to me? I send that out. And then the people that are on my Twitter, the combined millions of them. So if someone sends something like retweeted 6000 times, that's not just retweeted 6000 times, it's retweeted 6000 times and then seen by how many people on each retweet. Because it's exponential. You know what, man, there was a transhumanist I met at that GF 2014, 45, 2045 convention we went to, which is that convention by the Russian billionaire Dmitry Ichkov. Yes, but I can't remember. God damn it. I wish I could remember his names really cool. He listened to our podcast, but he was talking about how like Twitter and technology is actually creating these sort of technological neurological correlates. Not Jason Silva. It wasn't Silva. No, this was like one of the other guys there. There's so many smart guys there. But the idea is it's like what you're talking about is you sort of become a synapse and in this sort of technological brain. And it's like all this information is like flowing through and you're sort of like picking what information to continue up the line. And what I really love about what you're saying is you step away from the ego, you step away from the idea like, like I've, it's me. And you realize, like, I don't know why, but for whatever reason, I'm a conduit for information. But that's really what it is. That is what it is. It's a nice way to say it. You know, you're complimenting me saying, you know, step away from the ego, but it is what it is. I'd be a fool to think of anything other than that. Just don't step into the ego. Yes. But some people do think, no, see, here's the difference because what, so some people, what they do is for whatever shit reason, they get to become a conduit. And then they recognize that they're a conduit. And then what they start doing is they start monetizing this very simple bit of information that they've figured out. Because there is one really simple thing that you can figure out in the simple, and there's a lot of different ways to say it. But the problem is it's a very simple thing. I think it's a very simple thing. And there's, there's different sentences. It can be described in a sentence, you know, which is like the most simple way to say it is all one, all one, we're all one thing. So that's the fractal that you can unfold and unfold and unfold. And if you unfold that, you've got every religion and every philosophy and everything unfolded in there. But some charismatic assholes, they really figure that shit out. And then instead of just like giving that idea away as well as they can, they try to turn it into a system. That's when you start getting this system of. Doesn't that seem obvious though, when it's happening? I see, I feel like it's all about intention, the thing across the board. Yes. And even the concept of monetizing it, we both have podcast sponsors. There's nothing wrong with monetizing something as long as it's all done ethically, and it's all done in the right mindset. And I think that it's not about taking advantage of being a conduit. It's not, it's not about that. But it is that once you are a conduit, you know, what, what, what is your obligation? Your obligation is just to be you. And if you're, you know, when you sell things on your podcast, sell things that you actually enjoy and there's nothing wrong with that. The idea of business, business and making money always being a source of evil, not necessarily. Just like love is not a source of jealousy. It doesn't have to be. Business can be done ethically. If someone has a fruit stand, they grow fruit and they sell it at a reasonable rate and that's where they feed their family. There's no greed there. No, I wasn't thinking about that. I know you weren't. I know you weren't. But it becomes this thing that people love to say they always love to equate and then this guy just starts making money off of it. The idea of making money is always somehow connected with an erosion of ethics, with an erosion of respect for the connection that you have with other people that you shouldn't be allowed to make money or that someone if they do make money will turn to the dark side. I mean, I don't buy that just like I don't buy all the other assumptions that we lay if you leave a man with a woman who rapes, you leave a woman with your money, she'll spend it. You don't have to clarify. I just need to. I don't have to clarify for you. But for the audience, I want to clarify by saying, I'm talking about the systems of religion where you come into the religion and there is going to be over the course of your lifetime within the religion, all these varying costs that you have to pay. I mean, there's literally like religions like Scientology, for example, that have tears of learning where you are. Now I'm uncomfortable because now you're equating what I do with a religion. My Twitter handle is a religion. Listen to this, Mr. fucking start a compound. Listen with friends. That was me. I'm ready to go. You know, there's twice twice twice two times in my life. There have been two times in my life where people have told me to shave my head and move into a compound. The first time was when I was hanging out with a Hare Krishna's the second time was when I was hanging out with you. You had taken Rogaine. I was like, take it from a guy who's got a fucking hair transplant scar. Shave your fucking head, man. It's nonsense. You will be so free once you shave your head. Whatever reasons, reasons. It's not a reason. It's the same form. Shave your head. I went further. I went further than you. I went way out. I took the hair from the back of my head and had them take a strip of it and put it in the front. I'm giving you advice. All his age words. All his temporary. You don't need Rogaine. I stopped that. Take it from Rogaine. No Rogaine. I think all men in their 20s should shave their heads. No, they should. Like when you turn 25 or whatever, every man shaves his head that way that you won't worry about getting bald later. Like you've seen it. It's not that bad. And after you shave your head, go to the airport and give people carnations. I have to pee over your head. Do you guys want more beers? Yeah, sure, keep it coming. I'm good. I'm good. Pussy. Are we pausing this? No, no, no. Let's keep going, man. Let's definitely talk about Duncan. He's such a unique mix of so many different things. How long you known each other? I want it more than 10 years for sure. I'm not sure when we actually met. It was somewhere, I think in the early 2000s, whenever he started working at the comedy store. It's so important, man, to find people like that, find cool people, and then be close to them. That changes life more than anything. You're an unusual guy in that respect. I know a lot of alpha males, and you're this alpha male guy who isn't ostensibly, I'm not saying that's your trip, right? But you love. And most alpha male guys, it's about dominance. It's about maintaining some sort of hierarchy, and you're not into that trip. I noticed that about Aubrey as well. I met him last week. He's also a friend of yours, and I could see why. It's like, yeah, it's cool to not have that shit get in the way, but it's unusual. Aubrey's exactly like that. He's my brother. I love that guy. Yeah, I think that's a huge mistake that people make. There's a weakness that they disguise as strength. And that's it, not being loving, not being nice. The best times in life are the loving times. The conflict makes you who you are, but I feel like you should do voluntary conflict in order to work all that stuff out. My real conflict in life, not so much. I mean, I had some issues. My parents got divorced. My stepdad was a young guy, and the whole thing was weird. I was seven years old. We moved from place to place, but my conflicts are very minor in retrospect. If you really, really reflect on it honestly, my parents were very nice. My stepfather's a great educated guy. My issues were very small. No one abused me. No one beat me up. I got away pretty light, but I found conflict in martial arts and in competition to be a massive part of figuring out what makes me scared, what makes me puff my chest up, what makes me loud, what makes me angry, what makes me insecure. And most of it is uncertainty, an uncertainty about my health, my safety, my future, all these different things. And I found that in the idea of physical hand to hand, one-on-one combat, that you face the most terrifying thing that for a lot of men ever on a regular basis. And then through that, you can see who you really are. Through that, you can find your character. And I started getting into Musashi, Mimoto Musashi, the Book of Five Rings, and the Book of Five Rings. I actually have a tattooed. My whole right arm is Musashi, Musashi fighting a tiger. First line of that book. Can you say the first line of that book? First line of the book. My name is Miyamoto Musashi, and I have killed 76 men. That's the first line of the fucking book. I have killed 76 men. Wow, that's way bigger than Dahmer. With swords, but he was also a philosopher. He was also a poet. He was also an artist. And he believed that it was very important that you be incredibly well-rounded, that you be artistic, and that you be open, that you not have this ego hanging over your shoulders weighing down your performance because you put so much weight on your performance being your entire identity. So through martial arts, I realized that's what my fear was. That's what all the chest puffing stuff was. That's what all the aggression stuff was. It was all just fear and insecurity. And in overcoming that fear and insecurity personally, it became much easier to just be really friendly and just really nice to people. So where does stand-up fit into that? It's just fun. It's fun. It's expressive. It's a great art form. It's, to me, the most fun thing I like to do as far as an audience member. If I like to go see some stand-up. If I knew that Duncan and Joey and Ari were performing somewhere and I could sit in the audience and watch, I'd be like, oh, this is going to be great. This is going to be a fun time. It's fun. But is it also, especially in the early days, about confronting fear and failure? Yeah. Well, you've confronted whether you wanted to or not. I don't think I consciously went into stand-up thinking it was going to be that scary. I don't think I had any fucking idea until I was so scared the first time I went on stage. It was shit in my pants. I was ready to chicken out, man. I was totally ready to bail. Was it an open mic night or something? I thought it was a badass. I was really confused. I thought I was like, I'm a national Taekwondo competitor. I won the fucking US Open. I'm not scared of talking on stage. See, this is where I'm going with it. There may be others, but I can't think of another comic who's also physically intimidating, because generally, they learn to be funny as a defense in high school. My sense of humor completely came out of being with a bunch of people that were about to go fight and they were terrified. I needed to be the guy that broke up the monotony. I was the guy who made fun. We would be on the bus and we would be traveling to a tournament. People would be scared. I've seen several of my friends get knocked unconscious with head kicks, good people that I really cared about. We were competing, and some of us were in over our heads. I've seen several of my friends get knocked out, good friends that I love to death, and it was scary. I would be the guy that would break everybody up. I would just do impressions of my instructor having sex with female students and rude disrespectful shit that I would never admit back then. No, man, but you've got a deeper thing than that, man. You know comics have a deeper thing than that. It wasn't just like in the van. I hope this is okay to talk about, but I remember one thing you told me about when you were a kid going to do magic tricks on the pier. Where was that? San Francisco. And how your parents would just let you wander off to go do magic tricks on the pier. Comics come from strange families, man. But the idea of little young baby Rogan doing magic tricks, you had the bug for your whole life. Well, I didn't get enough attention. That's what it was. And I found that I could get attention doing that as a kid, doing the magic tricks. And then as a fighter, I could get attention. I realized that I felt like between those two times, it was like I got attention through my artwork. I wanted to be a comic book artist. And then when I started doing martial arts, I realized that I had an outlet for all this aggression inside of me, this built up frustration and anger that I had a very unusual outlet. And this was an outlet that would allow me to just blow it all out in training and would literally be free of it for the first time in my life. And when I talked to my parents about it, they're like, you changed, you became a totally different person. You were this weird, scary kid up until you were 14. Just a scary, weird kid that's, you know, I mean, I was always just way quicker to want to punch somebody in the face way quicker to get the fuck, you know, away from things. If they didn't seem good, I'm like, fuck this, I'm out of here. I was the guy that was like acting on, I was convinced that the world was out to get you. I was convinced that no one was going there to protect me. And I was very hostile to any, any aggression or any weirdness. And then doing martial arts are completely relaxed. See, man, that thing that you just said, this is why compassion is so important because you'll encounter somebody right now who's like that right now, who's like, you know, all defense mechanisms. And if you let your ego take control, you'll be a dick to that person, you'll try to punish them, you'll try to hurt them, or you'll try to get away from them, not realizing that you're just seeing like a precursor to something that could turn into an amazing being and an amazing, amazing being, you know, there's a, I am, you know, there's all these like sweet stories people tell about the time that they were nice to somebody. And there's this thing I've been trying to write and I was right. I'm going to tell a really quick story, this thing that happened to me about why compassion is so important. When I was in high school, I was, and I just didn't pay attention, and I like had shitty grades, and I didn't care about high school. And so I was in remedial, I was like in the 11th grader, I was senior maybe, and I was in algebra with 10th graders, because I was doing that bad, I just hated high school. And there is this like, there was a bully in the class, but he was a bully in the 10th grade, and I was a senior, and he was bullying some, he was always bullying, he's bullying some kid. And at the end of class, I like, I grabbed him. It's not fair, I'm like two years, I mean, I'm bigger than him, I grabbed him, I pushed him against the wall, I'm like, you just leave him alone, just fucking leave him alone, you shithead. And like, you know, I walked out of there feeling like a hero, like, yeah, I really love this bully have it. And so then the next day I'm at school, and there's this week, everyone's being weird and shit. That kid, that afternoon went home and shot himself. And Duncan, I always know when you're lying, I'm not lying. I swear to God, come on, I swear my mom. Really? Yeah, that kid went home and shot himself, he went into the bathroom, and he put a shotgun in his mouth, and he blew his brains out. Now, what? Yes. And he wrote a letter, the letter was, there were other things going on, it wasn't that he wrote this letter like this idiot senior, like shove me in the wall and said, don't be a bully. But if there was a scale, and on one side of the scale was suicide, and one side of the scale was life, and marbles were dropping on those different sides of the scale, I dropped on the suicide part of that scale for sure that day. And I was one of the last experiences that kid had. So I was in high school, I didn't have, no one had taught, no one, no one had taught me about compassion. I never probably never even, I probably heard the word three times and thought it was a stupid word anyway. So you know, you hear these stories all the time of like, I was the sweet person and the kid like didn't commit suicide. So this is why it's so important to be compassionate to people, because you have to recognize that when I was a kid, I was doing this black and white thing, and I had turned this guy, who was just this lanky, angry kid, I turned him into a villain. This is a villain, he's a bully, and he deserves to be punished for the way he's acting. When the reality is, that kid was suffering so much in his life, that he decided to commit suicide because of the level of suffering that he was experiencing. So when you're around a douchebag, you really are just around somebody who's having a not great life. You're not around a villain, you're around a person who's deeply suffering, and you're attempt at justice, and you're attempt to like, right the wrong and teach him a lesson. That doesn't work. It doesn't work. It's like the war on poverty, the war on this, the war on that. It's just the amount of damage that the bully can do is so catastrophic that the people who have been bullied by the bully are like, good, fuck him. That guy ruined my life, now he's gone, now the dragon's been slain. They, in my opinion, are more important than the bully. And the bully, if he's going to shoot himself because you told me he was a cunt, okay, I'm sorry he's in that position, but I am far more concerned that you saved that little kid from that big asshole. That's the justice in the universe. You didn't do a bad thing, man. You shouldn't be down you even looking at me like the way you look when you're telling a joke, which is why I said, Doug, and I know when you're lying, because he will do that to you. He will say, and that boy visits me every night in my dreams, fuck his mouth. No, I feel guilty about that now. You should not feel guilty about that, because I think that what had happened is that kid had escalated into a very bad space of physical violence. And human, I mean, you're not talking about a philosopher, you're talking about a 15 year old kid, okay? And that 15 year old kid does not recognize esoteric ideas or really abstract concepts, or you preaching about compassion, you fucking 17 year old weirdo. What they understand is you slamming them up against a locker and say, hey, fuckhead, cut the shit. Unless you can invest a massive amount of time. You invest the time. Oh, Jesus, you don't. All right. You never have a lifetime for yourself. No, man, you invest, listen. Kill bullies. Invest the time. No, Joe, do not kill bullies. Love bullies. Listen, it's more effective. Trust me. If bullies know you'll kill them, they'll just be like the future Bradley Mannings. Listen, if they don't know that they're going to get stuck in that 24 hour surveillance, Bradley Manning got bullied a lot. If being a shithead to people fix them, we would be in paradise. You're right. You're right. Being a shithead does not fix them, but the only way to have peace on earth is to kill shitheads. So then once we kill shitheads, there will be no shit. I'm joking. Come on. You know me. There's a great story told by one of the early American Aikido students who was in Japan studying Aikido. This is like in the 60s or something. I know you think Aikido is probably a bullshit martial art. No, I don't. No, no, no, I don't. It's not that it's not practical. I mean, I don't think it's great for street fighting or something, but what Aikido is really great with is conceptualizing conflict in a way that allows you to neutralize the conflict without getting into a dominant, submissive, kind of hierarchical bullshit. How's that? How's that? Well, because the idea, the central idea of Aikido is to end the conflict without hurting anybody. That's impossible. Well, it's not. How is it possible? That's the beauty of Aikido. Well, one of the stories that's told by this American guy, you can find it on the subway. Yes. Yeah. So the guy's on the subway. He's training. He's big. He's strong. An ancient story took place on a subway? Yeah. It's recent. It's in like the 60s, right? They used to have subway. So he forces. So he's on the subway and this dude gets on who's drunk and belligerent and starts screaming and like raising hell, right? And so the big, strong American guys checking him out, like, I could take this guy for sure. If things get weird, I'll step in, right? And then the guy starts, he goes over to these girls who are sitting there. I may be misremembering details or whatever, but he starts screaming at these girls and really getting threatening with these girls. And the American guy's like, all right, fuck it. I'm going to. And so just as he's like getting up from the thing, he hears an old guy go, hey, like he just discovered something, not hey, but hey. And the drunk guy looks at him and it's this old guy and he says, do you like sake? And the guy's like, yeah, what do you care? Oh, my wife and I used to drink a lot of sake is great on an afternoon to drink a little sake and the sun's going down and he starts lulling this guy in with it. You know, he's I'm with you. I get you. I know. And within five minutes, the drunk guy's like got his head on his lap. The way I heard the story is the drunk guy says to him, he's like the old guys like, you know, me and my wife drink sake and the drunk, the old guy asked him, do you have a wife? And the guy's like, my wife died. Oh, that's right. My wife died two months ago. And then the guy like sits down next to him and starts crying. Right. And that's why he's being a fucking belligerent shithead because he's crazy because his heart's been just cracked open by life. And he's angry. It is possible. And that's how you resolve conflict without even getting hurt. Yeah, but that's not that's not Akita. Well, what Akita was created for was to disarm swords. Well, that's why that's why because the other guy's got a sword you don't. So that's why when the sword's coming at you, you don't block it, you step out of the way and you give him that trajectory. And so you use I first heard about Akita from a professor of mine in grad school. And then I went and studied with his teacher. And and so the whole point is you don't meet that aggression with your own blocking aggression because you'll get your arm cut off. Right. So you give him that. So if somebody comes at like when I'm doing a public speaking gig or something and somebody comes at me with a question afterwards saying, you know, you know, yeah, you think you know what you're talking about, but you don't know shit about genetics, man, you know, and you you've completely misrepresented. I give him that. Like, yeah, okay, you're right. Yeah, I haven't studied genetics nearly as deeply as you have. But, you know, if what you say is true, which it probably is, there's still this evidence from the you know, and just swing it around. So like, give him that swing, you're not going to block that. So don't jump right into a conflict. So Akito in conversation as well. Yeah, jiu-jitsu would be a more apt term, because Akito is really just for one aggressive assault that you have to disarm the idea of being the guy is a weapon. Jiu-jitsu is all about never meeting things head on when someone's coming at you, you back up when someone's when someone's resisting you follow through and you always stay in your own point of center. Well, it's all about, you know, look, there's two schools of thought when it comes to grappling, you know, there's the take them down, smash them, hold on to them. And the jiu-jitsu thought is, if he wants to go left, you go right. If he wants to go right, you go left. If he thinks you're going to take his back, mount him. If he thinks he's good, you're going to mount him, attack his legs. It's like, you're always moving in a lot of misdirection, a lot of technique to jiu-jitsu is without a doubt the most technical martial art. There's so many techniques in different ways that your body can move that the difference between say, an attacking martial art, there's variations in the way to deliver a punch or a kick or something like that. But the amount of variations is incredibly small in comparison to the amount of variables you achieve when you're grappling. Because when you're grappling, you don't have to worry about balance or you don't have to be standing up on one leg or two legs. Like you're moving around like fucking snakes and wrapping each other up and trying to counter techniques and trying to get a guy to think that you're countering it so you can set something else up and get him to over commit so that you can compromise parts of his body. See, what you just described, man, so many people don't understand that. When I tell people, like, I like to watch the UFC, I like watching fighting. And the reason I like it is because I'm friends with you and you've described it to me in that way. But a lot of people, when they see it, they don't realize that they're looking at this intellectual chess game that's sort of merged with this physical combat. That's what's cool to me is that what most people don't realize that. They just think, oh, look at the dude's wrestling, man. He's got his ass in his face. No, it's knowledge and discipline. Those are the two most important parts. Knowledge is first, discipline is second. Then the knowledge to understand what's coming up next and intellectualize it and to have it already prepared in your database. If a guy goes this way, you know what to do. If a guy over commits to the Camorra, you go to the Fireside Iron Bar. It's like this part of your brain that's just been conditioned. So that's the number one thing. And then the discipline, the discipline of fucking showing up and getting in shape and getting your, your body does not want to get into a position where it can roll with a grown man hard for five minutes. Doesn't want to do that. The only way it can do that is you got to force it. You got to tell it, listen, bitch, I don't give a fuck if you're lazy. You're going to take these 70 pound balls of iron, you're going to fucking swing them around and do presses. You're going to do all these things so that you develop this body that can do weird shit that other people can't do. And if you don't do that, you're going to get strangled. What do you want to do? You want to get strangled? No, I could get back in there. And only by doing that, this force of will and, and, and, you know, and focus, that's, that's the only way you can become successful. Do you ever feel in daily life, not when you're working out or sparring or something? Do you ever feel like you're walking around with a weapon? No, no, I feel like I'm happy that I'm not weak. You know, I feel like if some weird shit goes down and some drunk asshole, you know, it comes to attack me that I know instantly what to do, that it becomes a conflict to me, like physical conflict is a huge part of my life. Like it's been a part of my life for since I was a teenager, a young teenage boy, but doing something. Do you think on any level that makes you seek it? No, no way. I've seen you and I've saw Joe at the comedy store. It was really cool, man. I remember like, you know, knowing Rogan and being, having been around him and gone on tour with him. I've seen him like, I remember once you were like doing some kicks or like I went, you were like training with some kickboxing trainer and you're like doing kicks. And then like at the end of like training with these kicks, you take the pads off and your fucking legs are bleeding. Yeah, my shins are bleeding. Your shins were fucking, his shins are bleeding because that's how hard he kicks. Like you see him kick and the guy who's like this trainer is like, you watch these ripples going through the poor bastard who's doing the training. So Joe knows that Joe is clearly a disciplined, trained fighter. But I remember once at the comedy store, I don't remember what happened, man. You were talking to some girl and she got weird. I don't remember what it was, but she brings back her boyfriend. And it was clearly a situation where you could have easily like, it was a, if you had been an asshole and wanted to like prove that you could fight or your ego was caught up in it, you could have easily, this would have been like a, probably a pretty bloody bad situation for that guy. And I remember watching like, I wonder what the fuck's going to happen here? Is he going to like fight? And then you totally diffused it. It was like, it was, there was no ego. You just said exactly the right things to make the guy not feel like he had to be aggressive. And then he walked away with his girlfriend and it was over. I don't think, I remember what you're talking about. That guy did not want to fight. He got in a bad situation where he had a bad drunk, abusive girlfriend and she was causing problems. And I think he was pretty aware of it. But that's what a martial artist does because a guy, he and I had a sort of like almost instant understanding. I remember that he came over and he's like, Hey man, what happened? And I was like, look, dude, I'm trying to be nice. She's just drunk and I'll do respect. You know, I don't, I just got to get her out of here, brother. You know, it was one of those things. Don't do that dumb guy with the guy in his case. He was cool. Right. He, you know, was you could get in a situation where you have to defend yourself. It's unfortunate. Of course. The reason I asked that there was a brief period in my life when I carried a pistol. What period was that with the math period? These aren't my original teeth. No, and it was weird because when I had it, I changed the way I saw things, you know, and I was like looking for, not that I was looking to shoot anybody, but I was just aware of the fact that like I got this pistol and it just changed. I mean, I was living in New York. I was riding the subway, you know, it was a weird thing. I had to have it legally. I mean, I had codes to a vault with about a billion dollars worth of goods in it and I worked in the Diamond District at the time. Wow, that's incredible. Weird time in my life. So yeah, so the insurance company, since I had the code, required that I had this pistol. And so it was just weird. It was like really weird to. You were illegally carrying the pistol. You didn't have to conceal. Legal. Yeah, Eddie Bravo had that situation happen to him. You know, Eddie Bravo to this day, when he goes into Canada, they harass him, not harass him, but they give him extra questions because he was working for a check cashing company and he would carry a giant amount of cash to another place. And as he was on his way, he got pulled over and the cops come up to him. You were legally required to say I have a loaded firearm. Here's my permit. This is my job. And so they take him out of the car, they handcuff him, they check all his credentials and then they let him go. And even though there was no charge, every time he goes into Canada, they're like, what happened to you when you got arrested for having a gun? And it's like, well, I got arrested, but I was allowed to have the gun. Well, then why did they arrest you? Well, I was working at a check cashing place. Do you have any any proof that you're working? You know, it's like he has to go through this whole hour process. So if I go to Canada with him, like when he was working for the UFC, I'll be like, good luck, bitch. I'm like, I'm not going to walk through that thing with you. Bring me in that room too, man. I had to go in that room with him twice. You sit in that room and they fucking ask you questions. I've been in that room. Comedy. I'm here for comedy. I tell jokes. That room sucks, man. And you get pulled into that room a lot more coming into the US than going out. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. For sure. What's with Ari and the TSA? He gets crazy. Ari gets crazy. I'm gonna pee. You guys talk about Ari. Well, Ari, yeah, Ari has like a Ari and Brendan Walsh have very strong, strong opinions about the TSA and they get very, they're activists, basically. I mean, is it performance art on some level? No, no. No, I think it's that, you know, comedians have a very, they tend to have a anti authority perspective. And so he bristles under the idea that he has to like, you know, he's obviously not a terrorist. He's clearly no threat to anything. The TSA, we all know by now that the TSA misses stuff coming in all the time. They're not like really that effective at all. It seems to just be a way for people to make money. It's a way to... It's security theater. Yes. That's amazing. Security theater. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. So my opinion with it is I'm usually in a hurry or I just want to get through and I know that's a shitty way to look at it, but I just, I don't, I'm not aggressive with them. Well, I'll say, I mean, they're doing a job. They're getting 12 bucks an hour, right? I mean, the guy, this is the problem with civilization. One of the many problems is that the guy who you're talking to, he's just doing his fucking job, right? He's not the guy who passed the law or decides what they're looking for or who they're pulling over, right? He's just dude with a low level job. Well, that, isn't that the story of fascism though? Sure. It's the story of everything. Yeah. It's like, so it's like, it's the diffusion of responsibility. Right. And it's like, there's no way that you're going to get to the top of the pyramid with the guy who's like pulling the strings. So if you really, the idea is like, make it so it's not so easy for the people at the bottom of the pyramid. And then maybe that will cause change. I don't, I think Ari, of all my friends, like, I know who I think Ari is at the very top of the list of my friends who I know is going to get arrested. And it's going to be because of what he's doing. Ari's your friend who like when the shit really hits the fan and Alex Jones is right and the New World Order happens. Ari is the one who's the first to get marched behind the house and shot in the face. Definitely. Sorry. He wouldn't be able to keep his mouth shut. He doesn't keep his mouth shut. He wouldn't be able to. Well, I admire that in a lot of ways because he's not doing it from a position of power. He's just doing it from a logical argument. He's like, well, why? Why can you tell me what to do? Why? We didn't ask for this. This isn't the law. This is crazy. You're just a person. You can't search my bag twice. I was there with him when the guy told him that he was going to search his bag twice. And it was fascinating watching Ari react to it because he was like, come on, let's just go. Come on. You see I'm not a threat. Let me through. And the guy's like, oh, yeah, you want to talk to me like that? I'll search your bag again. He goes, you don't just get to search my bag again. And he's like, why do you get to search my bag again? You search my bag. Give me my fucking bag. He said, give me my fucking bag. He farted in front of this guy. Okay. The guy's like, you do have to listen to me. And Ari farts loudly. He goes, you got to smell my fart. He goes, go ahead, smell my fart. I mean, he's like standing right next to the guy. The guy might have even thought he was on a TV show because the way Ari was doing it was so over the top. And I'm behind Ari laughing. I've already gone through. Okay. Ari won't take his shoes off. They tell him to take his shoes off. Sorry, it's medical condition. That's how he says it. Medical condition. I'm not taking my shoes off. So because he won't take his shoes off, they have to search him. So they pat him down and they have to pat him down. He's like, come on, just go, hurry up, hurry up, come on, move. And he taunts him the whole way. And the guy goes, he goes, I'm going to bring my, this is another time in Vegas. He goes, I'm going to bring my supervisor over here. He goes, oh, great, another idiot. Is he the king of the idiots? Yeah, bring him up, bring him over. And he goes, hey, hey, idiot, what are you going to do? You going to tell me I have to take my fucking shoes off too? Let me go. I'm late. I'm going home. And then, you know, they fucking freak out and they don't know what to do. But ultimately, what's revealed in this is that they're not cops and they aren't just employees and Ari is right. They searched him. They did search him. He goes, I don't have to be nice to you. He goes, he goes, get a better job. He goes, what are you doing is bullshit. He goes, you're fucking enslaving people. You're stealing and you're enslaving people. It was, it's fascinating. He doesn't give a fuck. Ari's a cool guy, man. What a cool freak. He's a loon. Well, he's very confident now too, because he's finally independent. He's also independent. He's going, yeah, he's going to be here for a few months. We're doing some gigs. We're doing, what are we doing? We're doing Chicago Theater, January 24th, 24th. Yeah. Maybe hopefully by the time we get there, global warming will have firmly kicked in. I feel that the cold, this whole polar vortex is really just the Illuminati getting together, yes, ignore global warming. You know what, man? Somebody tweeted this to me and I love it. They showed that meteor that shot over Russia. Did you see that? No. So it's a, I saw the meteor, but I didn't see the tweet. They tweeted a picture of the meteor flying over Russia and with the trails behind it and they're like, the meteor is dispensing chemtrails. Yeah, it's the Illuminati, brother. It's really cool though when you see a thing that's inarguably a natural object entering the Earth's atmosphere and the exact same trails are coming off of it that are coming off of planes that the chemtrail freaks. You've gotten a lot of trouble about that, man. It's really funny. It's not trouble. It's foolish people that are uneducated. It's really simple. That it's really unfortunate, but it's really simple. And if people know about this, well, I know that I didn't see that episode of the show. So Joe, there's a chemtrail episode and Joe, Joe came out against chemtrails. He doesn't believe that chemtrails are happening. He says that those are contrails. I agree with you. I don't believe that either. I think it's a bunch of bullshit. And I think it's in the same school of thought with the people. The idea that the fucking Boston bombings, those are actors. What's that called? Those actors? It's called something actors. What's it called? We talked about it right before, conflict actors. Conflict actors. But like, you know about this, right? The conflict actor thing. So basically, these lunatics say that the Boston bombing is actors who are pretending to be heard. And they do these disgusting gruesome. Yeah, the victims, they do these gruesome diagrams where like they show in one of these diagrams, it's a guy who just had his leg blown off. You see his fucking femur poking out. You see the white bone. Blood is not gouting out at this very second. I don't know why. I'm not a doctor. Blood isn't gouting at that moment. It comes out in heartbeats and spurts. So if the photo was taken in the diastolic stage, there wouldn't be any spurts, right? Exactly. They don't know that. So they're like, look, fake bone, no blood. And then so now they're, so it's not just bad enough that when you finally ran a marathon, you're probably like, have been training for years to do this marathon. That's the mind of a comic. Start with the training. You finally run a marathon. I think about me. I've been bragging to my friends for months. I'm going to do this marathon. I've been jogging guys. I'm finally getting my shit together. Your first marathon, you end up looking down at your femur because your leg got blown off by a fucking psychopath, right? That's the worst. That's already helped. That's pretty bad. Now let's add to it. Now the picture of you staring down in shock at your femur poking out is being distributed by lunatic idiot. I don't even want to call them lunatics. They don't even deserve to be called lunatics because they're fucking not lunatics. They're just morons. Like they're not even like lunatics. There's something glorious about a lunatic, free, wild, roaming the world out of his mind. These are just dumbasses, like paranoid dopes. Now your picture is being distributed by paranoid fucking dopes. But the tragedy of it, like the guy who, like the guy who doubted Natasha's thing. The tragedy of it is that there's a germ in there that I actually admire. The germ of saying, I don't believe what I'm told just because it comes across the media. We all admire that. We're all critical things. How about just learn the word diastolic? How about this? You fucking learn the word diastolic and then put your fucking shit pictures up their asshole because they don't know it. And by the way, these pictures, they'll have a picture of like, people tend to look the same. If I take a blurry picture of a person and put it next to another person, they look kind of the same. And now if we're like, well, they do kind of look the same, that doesn't mean they're the fucking same. If you really want to do it, like if you really believe this is happening, like there's these, I can't remember what they call them, drama. I can't remember the name of the actors. Conflict actors. Conflict actors. Here's what you need to do, fuckface. It's like the fourth time you haven't remembered the phrase Conflict actor. It's infuriating. Are you having some kind of embolism here? I don't know why this really. It's awesome. It really pisses me off. Embrace it. It really pisses me off. Go, if you really believe this, if you really believe this and the world doesn't believe it, you need to make the pilgrimage to the home of the person whose children were murdered. And you need to go make sure that they're there. And then you need to go find the person that you think looks like them. You have to prove this for real, not just by taking shitty internet JPEGs and posting them up on Twitter. You need to fucking investigate cocksucker, because if you really believe, if this is really happening, it's your moral responsibility to not do lazy research and just tweet some shit picture. You've got to go deep, man. Right. But don't you think it's your responsibility to treat him with the same compassion that you wish you treated that boy? Don't you think it's your responsibility to take him and use the seeds of what Chris Ryan said? And use the seeds of what Chris Ryan said, is that there is something there that I admire. The fact that they're not willing to just trust what the state-run media is telling them. This is why you need friends. I have really good friends, unfortunately, that believe some of the things I rally against about chemtrails, like me and Eddie Bravo and chemtrails. Look, I love Eddie Bravo to death. That guy is my brother. I love him. I respect him. He's a fucking awesome human being. But he and I disagree about the chemtrail issue. And I think his heart is in the right place. I think he really wants to make sure that we live in a safe world and he rightly doesn't trust the government. We just disagree about the methodology and we disagree about the problem with the chemtrail thing. And this is one of the things that I got in trouble with with all these people is that there's a real science to the whole idea about chemtrails. Is your dog scratching at the door? No, I just opened it. Oh, yes, want some air? Yeah, we're in a cloud of frankincense and myrrh in here. There's a real Duncan's lightning sense. There's a real science behind it, unfortunately. When you burn jet fuel, which is what a jet engine does, it changes the atmosphere. When you're driving or you're flying rather through a hazy, cloudy, like semi-cloudy night or day, and either one, when you're going through those clouds and the jet engine burns jet fuel, it creates moisture and literally creates a cloud. It absolutely does create a cloud. Just like when you watch like these is a bunch of videos that are doing people are doing on YouTube because of this polar vortex that they're talking about. Have you seen the supersoaker? Oh, yeah, they spray it boiling water. They spray it. 41 below zero in Winnipeg. So these guys took a supersoaker filled with boiling water and they shot it into the air. You know what happened? Clouds. Looks like chemtrails. It looks like clouds. Clouds are not like a super complicated thing. And this idea that these are aluminum and barium, like I had Roseanne Barr in my podcast last week and she started spouting off about chemtrails and they were spraying aluminum in the air. And I explained to her like there's a guy who did a documentary on these things and is called What in the World Are They Spraying? And he had this analysis of this water and the water showed that it was X percent aluminum. And I said to him, I said, okay, this water that you had tested, why does it say sludge? It says sludge. And the guy says, well, I don't know, it was water. I said, but did the water have dirt in it? I don't think it did have dirt in it. Well, it says sludge. If it's sludge, it means the lab saw dirt in it. Do you know what percentage of aluminum is in dirt? At the bottom of a river. Yeah, everywhere. The luminums everywhere. So what you have is dirt that tested positive for being dirt. And you're using that to say that this is why I can prove to you that chemtrails are real. When you if you did see aluminum being sprayed out of a plane, first of all, do you know how much fucking aluminum you would have to spray out of a plane to make clouds that go across the city? It would take millions of pounds of this shit. You wouldn't even be able to fit in a fucking plane. If you blew aluminum out of a jet, it would literally it would be the exact dimensions of the jet in aluminum powder. That's it. If you stuffed it to the back of the fucking pilot's head, you don't have much room for aluminum, fuckhead. Okay, so if you're flying around spraying aluminum, that shit's going to run dry real quick. These guys are making clouds with a jet engine. Yeah, that's it. And the real concern is not that the real concern is we are getting accustomed to the idea of burning jet fuel in the sky all day. That's the real chemtrail. That's it. Our fucking temperature on earth has changed. You can observe it clearly. The 9-11, the days after 9-11 when they shut down flights, the temperature of the earth noticeably shifted. And it shifted because we're not burning fucking jet fuel in the sky and making artificial clouds. It's not this gigantic global conspiracy to engineer the weather. No, it's a side effect of jet travel. That's it. But here's the thing, man. So I agree with you and everything you just said. Could I just jump in not to pile on you here? But I just want to follow up the end result of what you're suggesting that that guy go track people down. So it starts with the guy training for the marathon, right? Then he loses his legs. Then he's got people questioning whether it really happened to him. Then if people follow Duncan's advice, they show up in his front fucking heart and knock on his door. I don't need you to know I'm real. Go away. Put my fucking wheelchair down. My son's getting me home in five minutes. I'll fucking kill you. Stop unwrapping my bandages. I'm not going to show you my fucking story. This is not a hologram. What's here? This is the this is I'm sorry. I just had to know perfect. Don't go hunt them down. It's perfect. That's a beautiful statement. You're right. That in the compassion argument, we shot Duncan right into the fucking middle of the ocean. I deserve it. It's just it's so close after the bully story. It's so all of my friends, Raghu Marcus from the Love Server Member Foundation, all my friends will inevitably I'll go. I'll talk about compassion and then I'll be in the depths of like angrily ranting and judging someone in the most furious dumb way. So I'm no, yeah, I have a lot of work to do, but my point is I got to go to a lot more retreats. Probably like $100,000 for the retreat. First world problem. Yeah. My point is so the chemtrails aren't real. No one's dropping aluminum. But this is the thing. The real problem with calling non-chemtrails chemtrails is that if there ever was anything the government sprayed out of planes, which they have done in the past, you, you diminish it by crying wolf disinformation accidentally inadvertently distributing disinformation. But that's the chemtrail. That's what I'm trying to say is your disinformation and you spreading fear by talking about something that isn't real and infecting people with that same paranoid nonsense is the chemtrail. You're spreading poison. You're spreading poison by talking about an illusionary thing that is not spreading poison and you have become the fucking chemtrail. And you make other things that are real, real things. You make them a joke. Yes. And you're distracting attention away from the lack of banking reform, the prison industrial complex, you know, all these things that are real. Well, you see what's going on today, right? You see this Governor Christie thing today. Yeah. What is this Governor Christie thing today about? Well, it's a fucking distraction because they're about to talk about what that is. Some people don't know what that is. Okay, Governor Christie today was he got in trouble because they said that there was a memo amongst staff members that claimed that Governor Christie had threatened to shut down various aspects of the bridge, various lanes of the bridge, and they were doing it just to like for political muscle. To punish someone. Because the mayor of that town didn't endorse him for reelection. And somebody died in an ambulance because they couldn't, because of the congestion supposedly. Of course, of course. So this sullies his image and this becomes a big scandal. But at the same time, the the Obama administration is silently trying to pass a new trade bill that everyone is freaking out about. And people are it's there, it's congressional deal reached an Obama's trade talks authority. This is a it's a very fascinating thing. This this TPA legislation. There's a massive amount of people that are freaking out about this, and they're calling it the NDAA on steroids. Whoa. Yeah, they're like saying like what they're doing here is changing the way, you know, they can do business and what they can get away with. It's so weird how like anytime some crazy scandal happens, that's when the shit bills go through. Of course. That in late Fridays, late on Fridays, when you like when you come out and say, Oh, yeah, I did fuck the whore. But anyway, you know, people forget about it over the weekend. They won't hear it. Sorry, I have to piss again. It's the whole thing is very strange. I'm just learning about it. A friend of mine on Twitter. I just I just like to note for the record that I have the biggest bladder in this room. Yeah, you hung in there tough. But it's like you get weak when there's three people you know, you can step out. Yeah, you know, when I'm doing a one on one podcast, if it's just you and me, I know I have to hang in there. Yeah, that's right. You do them live so you can't even hit the pause button. Yeah, TPP is this legislation. So look into it, folks. I'm just learning about it today. And it's it's pretty fucking scary. It's really, it's really bizarre and fascinating stuff, but it's scary. Ever read Howard Zinn of People's History of the USA? No, I haven't. I've heard it's been recommended to me, but I never got around to reading it. It's fantastic. It's a history of the United States written from the perspective of the losers, right? Because history is always written from the perspective of white upper class men. So this is history of the United States written from the perspective of slaves, Native Americans and women. And it's and it's very it's a huge bestseller. It's been a bestseller since it came out, you know, 1520 years ago. And it's interesting story about him. He was Matt Damon's next door neighbor, growing up in Boston. He taught at Harvard or MIT or one of the big colleges in Boston there. And Matt Damon's mother was like a single raising him, a single woman. And Mr. Zinn, who lived next door, used to take Matt to, you know, to ball games and to the park. And, you know, they so he was sort of a surrogate dad for Matt Damon growing up. That's probably why he's so fucking smart. Matt Damon is pretty interesting. I mean, I thought it was funny that Matt Stone and Trey Parker decided to make him a complete moron on their that Team America. Oh, he was a puppet in Team America. And he just could just only say Matt Damon, he was like, stupid. But he's very smart. Very smart. And Ben Affleck is super high IQ as well. Matt Damon had one of the best takes on Sarah Palin. He's like, are we really going to accept that this person and what are we living in a fucking a comedy movie where just a salt of the earth person by circumstance gets into the White House. And she's really going to be a heartbeat away from the White House. I mean, this good old fashioned moxie and she's going to save us from Putin. He's like, what the fuck are you talking about? And I remember him saying that I was like, wow, that is like a movie from the 80s. But and it is reality. And there are the head of the Congressional Committee on Science and Technology believes the earth is 6000 years old. Stop it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. 40 more than 46% of the United States believes that the earth is less than 10,000 years old. Yeah, according to recent Gallup poll. Yeah, but I don't believe that because I always say this and people criticize it as my lack of understanding about science. But I believe that if you have a poll about how old the earth is, you only have the results of people so fucking stupid, they're willing to take a poll on how old the earth is. That's a good point. I don't think it's 46%. There is critical thing. I don't even think it's 20%. I think you're dealing with a small percentage of fucking idiots. Well, I saw a dancer poll. I saw you interviewing Neil deGrasse Tyson. Was he just on the show once? Yeah, just once. We're trying to work out another one. This thing. He's great. He's great. I fucked with it, bro. I don't know what it is. No, those things get, yeah. Neil deGrasse Tyson is great. Fantastic. But if I remember correctly, you guys were going back and forth a little bit about the moon landing. Are you a skeptic about that? We weren't going back and forth about it. He was kind of schooling me about, but he's a very, very skeptical guy. And even if it was like really ridiculous, if it wasn't absolutely confirmed scientific consensus that the moon landing was a hoax, he would never be willing to go in that direction. He's a scientific person. Me, I'm an idiot. So if I see a 1% possibility that someone faked a moon landing, I will explore it with every ounce of my being because I find it fascinating. What's really interesting about the moon landing is that not just have we not been able to go, but that we went seven times, six successfully from 1969 to 1972, and then we just stopped. And when you go back and look at the footage, it looks like horseshit. It looks fake as fuck. If you watch the interviews of the astronauts after they land the press conference, it looks like they're lying. If you look at the actual footage of people falling down and getting up, it looks like they're on wires. I don't think that the moon landing is fake. But what I do think is, first of all, if you're dealing with a situation where you're in another planet, you're in one sixth earth gravity, like our conception of how a person would move and not move is probably very distorted. We have no idea what it would be like to be in one sixth gravity. It'd probably look really fucking weird and fake because it's not on earth. So our whole, the way we accept movement and see movement and recognize it in our head, it's based on our atmosphere. It's based on our gravity. It's based on the oxygen in the air. When you're on the moon, things are going to be fucking weird. Me as an uneducated, unscientific person, I didn't think of that. I thought, well, this looks fake as fuck. That guy's on wires. And then there's always this automatic need to look to anything from that time as being bullshit. The idea that they did accomplish something in that time, look at what they did with Lee Harvey Oswald and the single bullet theory. Look what they did with the Gulf of Tonkin when they led us into Vietnam. Look what they did with Nixon and Watergate. It seemed like deception was the standard. And it seemed like the idea of them being noble and telling the truth was probably more preposterous than deception. And then if you look at Neil Armstrong's speech, his 25th anniversary of the moon landing speech, where he talks about truths that can be revealed that under great things that can be accomplished, if they can remove one of truth's hidden layers, he starts giving this really cryptic speech. Have you never heard it? I'll pull it up and I'll play it for the audience. But make no mistake about it. It's not that I don't, I used to believe that people didn't land on the moon. I used to firmly believe that. I don't believe that anymore. The thing is, in those days, the earth was full of telescopes that were powerful enough to watch. Not really. Not really. They can't go to the moon. They can't see what's on the moon. It's really hard. It's really hard to show. Yeah, there's no telescopic pictures of the moon landing. No one took pictures with telescopes from the earth of the moon landing. I'm aware of. Well, I'm not saying optical telescopes. No, they could observe the path. They're measuring the fucking waves coming off quasars, 100 million. Oh, yeah. Now, here, I'll play it for you. I'll play it for you because this will this will kind of make you freak out because it's a it's very bizarre. And again, this is me not saying that people didn't go to the moon, but saying it's it's bizarre whether you believe people went to the moon or not. This is a fascinating aspect of the reality that we live in, that this is actually the speech that this guy gave at the 25th anniversary of the moon landing. You ever see Ari and not Ari? Ali G's interview. Yes. You got no fucking signal here at all. Do you have Wi-Fi here, dude? Yeah. Hold on a second. We're going to tell the world. Oatmeal Maiden. Okay, give me a second. Oatmeal Maiden XT. Let me get you. Come on over to Duncan's house and steal his Wi-Fi. We'll crank this back because there's no cell phone here. What is your network? I just interviewed a woman. Oatmeal Maiden XT. Oh, you're serious. Oatmeal Maiden. Wow. Quaker? I don't use it for anything else. Freedom 108. Yeah. Change that shit. Who's going to get into my fucking network? The people, man. Jesus Christ. That's right at the two hour mark. Thank God. I'll delete it. Yeah, just delete that shit. Or you could just change your password. Okay, I'm back. Good point. Freedom 109. Freedom 110. They'll never guess of that. I just interviewed a woman a couple of days ago who's one of the first women to work in the upper echelons of NASA and she designed the first Landsat, which is still in operation until like two years ago. You know, the satellite that maps the planet of the earth just spins around the earth mapping, mapping, mapping. So they could see like, you know, that's the satellite that can like say, oh, look, this forest is burning, you know, or this ice cap is receding. That's all her stuff, her work. She's amazing. That's wild. Yeah, some of the new technology that they have. Like if you heard about, I think I've already talked about this with you, but in Africa, how they used one of those satellites to find like a giant reservoir of water. Oh, yeah. And they find the, in archaeology, it's amazing. They found all these road systems in the Amazon. Oh, yeah. It turns out that actually the Amazon was like farmed. Yeah, it was huge. For a long, long, long time. Like way, way back before they thought that people had colonized the Amazon with sophisticated farming techniques, they thought that people were just hunter-gatherers exclusively. No, they had established communities and they had different paths for water and, you know, they had a lot of shit. Your Wi-Fi sucks a fat one too, buddy. No, it doesn't. How dare you? Well, people can just Google it, right? No, I'm gonna, I'll come up with it eventually. Hold on, I'll get it. What's it, what? It's just for whatever reason. It's not pulling up. I don't know what's happening. What's the, what's the, what is it? Oh, here it is. Here it is. On the 25th anniversary of the event in 1994 Neil Armstrong made a rare public appearance and held back tears as he spoke these brief cryptic remarks before the next generation of taxpayers as they toured the White House. But this is real. Today we have with us a group of students among America's best. To you we say we've only completed a beginning. We leave you much that is undone. There are great ideas undiscovered. Breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth's protective layers. Okay, what the fuck does that mean? All right, I'm not saying that that means we didn't go to the moon, but why the fuck would you say that if you're on the 25th anniversary of NASA and you're standing in front of the greatest high school students in the country and you're trying to give them a pep speech or you're trying to explain to them what could be done in this world, what you've done. Why wouldn't you say I've been to the fucking moon, man? Let me tell you something. I just want to, I would much rather him give an hour speech on truth's protective layers. What the fuck is a protective layer? It's, and here's the thing, people that you fucking don't believe went to the moon. You're fucking idiot. You're a truther. That what I just played you is real. Yeah, it's real. Okay, but it's very strange. I'd like to hear the rest of the context. What he said right after that. I'd also like to know if truth protective layer might be a Shakespearean term or a term. That's good. Let me look it up right now. Let's look at truth's protective layer. If he wrote that speech or someone wrote this. Sounds like a death metal band. All good points. All good points. All good points. And also, even if, you know, like let's assume he wrote it and it's not a Shakespearean term or whatever, you know, truth is protected by layers of ignorance, by fear, you know, it's a metaphoric term that could reflect lots of different directions. The real issue is that it's very cryptic. Regardless of his intention when he was trying to put out, it is undeniably cryptic. I'm going to read where this is where I go for all my answers. And it's where you should go if you're wondering about something. Yeah, who answers? What did astronaut Neil Armstrong mean when he said they are great ideas undiscovered breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth's protective layers? Let's look at the best answer. He also said there are places to go beyond belief. What it means is Neil Armstrong found aliens. I wrote that. By the way, that's that's how good Yahoo! answers is. I wrote that. And he has been sworn never to speak of it. One, he was crying when he said it because he had been sworn never to speak the truth about what he knows. Two, he appears to be speaking in code, which would confirm the things he saw on the moon. Three, former chief of NASA communication systems, Maurice Chat Lane, said Armstrong had indeed reported seeing two UFOs on the rim of a crater. The encounter was common knowledge in NASA. Four, places to go beyond belief equals aliens are already capable of interstellar travel because they are here. Five, breakthroughs available, truth's protective layers, disclosure that aliens are here, learn the truth behind the cover-up and discover the truth about the most important discovery in all of human history. What Neil Armstrong said to Mission Control. NASA, what's there? Mission Control calling Apollo 11. Apollo 11, these babies are huge, sir. Enormous. Oh my god, you wouldn't believe it. I'm telling you, there are other spacecraft out there lined up on the far side of the crater edge. They're on the moon watching us. Maurice Chat Lane said, we were warned off the moon. Have you ever wondered why the moon missions ended? Whoa! The aliens are like, get the fuck off my property. Just as likely as we fake the moon landing, by the way. Just as likely. All of it, all of it likely. I like this story. I like the idea of aliens on the moon. I like it. And some grumpy old alien being like, one day those monkeys are going to come up here. I'm telling you. Better get out of here. It's my yard. The moon is their yard. Get off my yard, you fucking hippies. John McCain. Hippies in your space suit. You can't even breathe moon air. Well, fucking pussies. I think that's a great way to end the podcast. Is that it? This has been an amazing podcast. Guys, if you want a three-hour podcast, that's the standard for the Joe Rogan experience. This is already twice as long as my usual podcast, but this has been awesome. Oh, it always will be. And we should tell people what we've decided to do. Oh yeah. So what we're going to do is, all three of us are going to start doing podcasts together, and we're just going to sort of leapfrog from each person's podcast to the next. Yeah. I mean, we thought it about doing our own, like having like a trial log type podcast, and Duncan didn't realize trial log means conversation between three people. No, I thought it was something weird. We're copying the McKenna Rupert Sheldrick Ralph Abraham name, but it's actually means three people talking. What we were going to do is just start our own, but we decided, well, why would we do that? We already have like all these people that listen to our podcast and only help each of our podcasts individually. So we're just going to go back. So you're up next, Chris. Well, as the baby of the group, I definitely am up for that. That's fantastic. Well, there's no baby in the group. That's ridiculous. Very nice. There you go. Well, you're more new to podcasting, but not to thinking. And that's what makes it all beautiful. It's a fun way of talking. This is really. Yeah, it's fantastic. It's very unique, you know, the three of us doing it this way. I like it a lot. A lot of fun. It's a blast. Yeah. I'm looking forward to doing this once a month. Chris Ryan, tangentially speaking, and you're at Chris Ryan on Twitter. Chris Ryan, PhD. Chris Ryan, PhD. Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan experience at Joe Rogan touring all the time. I'm going to start going out with him again. I stand up high. This weekend. I'm in Phoenix. I can't every show sold out. Going to the desert. Oh, that's right. He's going to leave a body in the desert. No, I'm not. You're the one who said that. I'm just going out to the desert. Just loads. Not a body. Just come. These are savages I've let in my house. I'm sorry. I disappoint again. Thanks, you guys. Thank you. I'm so happy we're friends. I'm happy we're friends as well. Definitely. Thanks for listening, you guys. That was Joe Rogan and Chris Ryan.

125^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - DAVID SEAMAN Transcript and Discussion^2013-08-27^Hello everyone it's me Duncan and I hope that you're doing great. I'm gonna start this podcast off with one of my favorite monologues about technology and it's from the movie Waking Life which you should watch if you haven't watched it by Richard Linklater the whole thing is rotoscopes so it's got this beautiful mushroomy psychedelic flowing effect to it and it's filled with so many interesting ideas and the thing and the music is beautiful and it's just a very poignant incredible film so definitely you should watch that you can rent it on iTunes but in the meantime here's a clip from Waking Life about technology. For looking at the highlights of human development you have to look at the evolution of the organism and then at the development of its interaction with the environment. Evolution of the organism will begin with the evolution of life, proceed through the harmony coming to the evolution of mankind, Neanderthal Chromanean man. Now interestingly what you're looking at here are three strains biological anthropological development of cities cultures and culture which is human expression. Now what you've seen here is the evolution of populations not so much the evolution of individuals and in addition if you look at the time scales that's involved here two billion years for life six million years for the hominid hundred thousand years for mankind as we know it you're beginning to see the telescoping nature of the evolutionary paradigm and then when you get to agriculture when you get to scientific revolution and industrial revolution you're looking at ten thousand years four hundred years a hundred and fifty years you're seeing a further telescoping of this evolutionary time. What that means is that as we go through the new evolution it's going to telescope to the point we should be able to see it manifests itself within our lifetime within a generation. The new evolution stems from information and it stems from two types of information digital and analog. The digital is artificial intelligence the analog results from molecular biology the cloning of the organism and you knit the two together with neurobiology. Before under the old evolutionary paradigm one would die and the other would grow and dominate but under the new paradigm they would exist as a mutually supportive non-competitive grouping independent from the external and what is interesting here is that evolution now becomes an individually central process emanating from the needs and desires of the individual and not an external process a passive process where the individual is just at the whim of the collective. So you produce a neo-human okay with a new individuality and new consciousness but that's only the beginning of the evolutionary cycle because as the next cycle proceeds the input is now this new intelligence as intelligence piles on intelligence as ability piles on ability the speed changes until what until you reach a crescendo in a way could be imagined as an almost instantaneous fulfillment of human human and neo-human potential it could be something totally different it could be the amplification of the individual the multiplication of individual existences parallel existences now with the individual no longer restricted by time and space and the manifestations of this neo-human type evolution manifestations could be dramatically counterintuitive that's the interesting part the old evolution is cold it's sterile it's efficient okay and its manifestations of those social adaptation you're talking about parasitism dominance morality okay war predation these will be subject to de-emphasis these will be subject to de-evolution the new evolutionary paradigm will give us the human traits of truth of loyalty of justice of freedom these would be the manifestations of the new evolution and that is what we would hope to see from this that would be nice the telescopic nature of the evolutionary paradigm if you say that three times in front of your computer a German intellectual climb out of the screen and French kiss your asshole it's true I just did it's wonderful feels good I love that it really breaks down where we're headed it breaks down what the singularity is but in the process of this incredible evolution that's happening this amazing marriage that's happening between analog and digital the wedding that our sweet Lord Jesus Christ talked about so much this technology is being used for shitty things if you don't believe me just listen to this clip from somebody freaking out and on the world of warcraft oh 25 hundred leads bring that 25 hundred literate here in a fucking two-shot that dumb idiot yeah yeah bring up cuz I fucking own anybody in your fucking guild retard you're the best you're the best bro yeah no I'm not the best but I'm better than you that's all I can say stop even fucking talking cuz I rape you and I rape anybody in your fucking shit guilt isn't that amazing those two kids are using technology that didn't exist 10 years ago they're wandering around in a virtual reality a simulator a reality simulator where they have projected their egos onto avatars running around a fantasy land and instead of being happy or instead of marveling at the intensity of that experience or the implications of what we're going to be able to do in just a few years using that technology they've just reverted to hissing at each other and calling each other names the de emphasis on predation has not quite happened yet and of course that's just a small version of the way technology can get used for shitty things in the large-scale we see technology being used to blow people up and to monitor everyone on the planet and this can be quite frustrating to those of us who see the potential of where all this can take us which is possibly a mortal life where we can experience multiple existences at once and anything that we can think of we could instantaneously create it's frustrating when you see that this technology this these tools of connection are being used by warlords for the same old purposes that tools are always used by warlords which is to hurt people in the planet but Terrence McKinnon was very optimistic about technology and here he is giving a rather dated talk on the way technology tends to get out of its creator's hands to be used for other purposes the technology is the production is the we could think of it as the residue of the workings of the imagination and the imagination is not is under the control of the the super ego or the over mind so that I think technology has a weird way of always escaping the intentions of those who are working with it a perfect example would be the the chip which makes possible the personal computer that thing was developed under contract to the Air Force by I think sperry Rand and when it was finally finished it didn't work right it was far too slow they wanted it for guidance systems of missiles and this kind of thing so this thing is a thousand times too slow it's just the lonely it's worthless toss it in the wastebasket but somebody said but wait a minute you know what you could do with this and created you know an information revolution that must be absolutely appalling to the forces that wish to control I have an apple to computer and a 350 dollar modem and I can access the Defense Department databases I can access all the complete shelf list of the library of Congress all chemical abstracts in short all information in the world I can access from my living room in Sonoma County and so can anyone else who buys a thousand dollars worth of equipment this was not part of the plan apple to he had an apple to and he recognized the reaction things were going because he's a genius that's Terence Jesus Christ McKenna if you're not familiar with him just do a Google search and prepare to get your mind blown here we have this technology what many people are calling the seventh kingdom of life which is growing through us into the world and technology tends to have the effect of harmonizing complexity it connects it allows the rapid exchange of information and it fuses people and things together people in the form of social networks things in the form of just look at any kind of new the new prosthetic arms that are out where people can control them neurologically this is a fusing of inorganic inorganic matter using human neurology to control the inorganic matter and this fusing is going to happen more with increasing rapidity and with amplified intimacy to the point where we will inevitably have neural prosthetics and designer blood cells which will transform our potential and what we are in really extreme ways it's a very beautiful thing and that is where we're headed but in the process of heading in this direction this technology it's not just getting away from the military and being used for things that the military wouldn't have intended it for it's getting away from designers and development developers and being used by the government to monitor all of us and to control us and so you see it's a double-edged sword but there are many people like Terence McKenna who believe that there is an intellect a kind of vital force flowing into time of which we were we are apart and this vital force this intellect is the wind in the sales of evolution and technology could kind of be compared to the skin of a balloon that is being inflated by this vital force and is moving in the direction of a pure manifestation of the very same force that caused all life to grow from this planet it's kind of a techno Christ the second coming a utopia that is made possible through the harmonizing qualities of technology and anything that gets in the way of that harmony anything that gets in the way of that fusion will eventually become obsolete in the same way that anything that doesn't function in an ecosystem in an efficient way will eventually become extinct this is going to happen in front of us during our lifetimes according to a great many people because the difference between this new life form technology and all other life forms is that it evolves at an exponentially increasing rate this idea was articulated very beautifully by a Jesuit priest named Taylor de Chardon and I'm now going to play for you a clip here is a clip from the reflection series podcast I found it on YouTube and this is a clip of Iliad Delio talking about this amazing human I don't know what the reflection series podcast is but it seems pretty cool you can Google search it I'll have a link for it on my website he was an evolutionary thinker and by evolution here you know I think to understand he art it's not I think to interpret him in a Darwinian sense but in the Bergsonian sense for him evolution is a descriptive process of the whole of life as life you might say unfolds toward more complexified life forms so the law that best describes his thinking is convergence complexity the whole unfolding of this cosmic life is one that moves from a simple to more complex and more complex means greater unity and so he looks at this unfolding from matter to life to mind to spirit we of course are oh I should just note here that for Teyar the whole of evolution really can be summed up in the primacy of consciousness he did not see that consciousness enters into evolution at some point in time rather from the big bang you know whatever that big bang is that the beginning so to speak of the universe consciousness is present and consciousness you might say is what evolution is about it's the unfolding the converging the complexification is the rising of consciousness in evolution so he does give a primacy to consciousness so we here we humans are you might say the outflow of what we know today to be about a 13.7 billion year old universe story it's it's rather a fantastic story we are emerge we emerge from it we can self we can reflect on it but we are you might say continue to be in it we continue to be in evolution so Teyar describe the of the human person as evolution made conscious of itself I'm gonna put that clip the entirety of that clip at Duncan trustle.com so you can listen to the whole thing it's really cool and you should get into him if you've never heard of him before but McKenna waking life Sharden they're all talking about the same thing and it's something that we're all feeling which is that we are rapidly accelerating in the direction of a new era for not just human beings but for everything on the planet the reason that I'm playing all these clips is because today's podcast I talked with David Seaman about the NSA and the way that the government is currently using technology to monitor humans and to control humans by gathering information and I wanted to play all this stuff because I think the podcast maybe can come come off as a little sinister and I don't want to spread fear out there so I wanted to preface the thing by saying that I believe that there is a transcendent force that is expressing itself through matter and through us and this force is all about harmony and fusion and as it unfolds there's gonna be some black wizards who try to use it for shitty purposes but ultimately things are gonna turn out okay so I'm gonna play one more clip to for you this is Glenn Greenwald who's a journalist who helped Edward Snowden leak all this information his partner was recently detained at an airport and held illegally for six hours just because he's with Greenwald but this is what this is Glenn Greenwald's advice to all of us and let me tell you if anybody is catching heat right now because of this NSA stuff it's definitely Glenn Greenwald here's Glenn Greenwald with a little bit of advice for all of us and one of the things that I set out to do is one of my principal priorities and how I've done this story and how I've gone about that is to show that you actually don't need to be afraid that you can stand up to the United States government and be defiant when they deserve it and exercise your constitutional rights without that so that that is the message that I hope more than anything is conveyed on a visceral level the revelations about the NSA are important the things that we learn about journalism and it's important but ultimately the thing that matters most is that the rights that we know we have as human beings are rights that we ought to exercise and that nobody can take away from us and the only way those rights can ever be taken away is if we give in to the fear that is being deliberately imposed and so that I hope is the message of Edward Snowden and of the reporting that we're doing which is you not only shouldn't be afraid but do not be afraid don't be afraid that impulse inside of you that makes you want to stand up for bullshit like the NSA in the on the big scale and for whoever is trying to oppress you or hold you back in the small scale that is the force of evolution unfolding through you and you should be a servant to that force and you don't have to be afraid of anything let go of the fear put down that snake filled suitcase writhing with brown recluses and jars of AIDS let it go everything's gonna be fine because you are part of the unfolding intellect the embryonic Godhead that is at this very moment emerging into time at an exponentially increasing rate and anything that gets in the way of godlings gets crushed or I guess recycled is a better way to put it so be on the side of harmony connection and don't be afraid to stand up to people who are trying to get in the way of this thing that's happening and anytime technology gets subverted to kill people or to control people to dominate people or to hurt people then it's getting in the way of this techno utopia that is in the process of being born so don't get bummed out by this podcast that's all that's hippie talk for saying don't get bummed out by this podcast if it gets a little heavy or too sinister everything's gonna be fine the guy at the very forefront of all of this is telling you not to be afraid so don't be but and it's fun to think about it and it's fun to watch the way this technology unfolds in the way that humans react to it in different ways depending on what type of person they are okay all right let's get this show on the

concerts you're something to be embraced appreciated massaged oiled and worshipped and adored and you should do the same to those around you today's guest on the Duncan trustle family our podcast is an amplification journalist he is in the process of creating his own morning show called the rise morning show you can follow that on Twitter at rise morning show you can follow David seaman on Twitter by going to at D underscore seaman seaman and I'll have links to his podcast at Duncan trustle dot com so now everyone rip open your metaphysical chest cavities and allow the temple of love that exists within to illuminate wherever David seaman happens to be at this moment in the time space continuum now here he is the great David seaman David seaman welcome to the Duncan trustle family hour cheers did Hari Krishna so you are looking for a place in Los Angeles huh I am making the big move I'm allowed to say that on here yeah I don't have anyone who actually stalks me oh you don't they're very lazy stalkers just Twitter only don't you worry though you really put yourself out there man and the stuff that you say it not only attracts people who are logical and political but there is a fringe of people who maybe would stalk you on both sides people who agree with you and people who probably vehemently don't agree with you including the NSA well I mean my views are so moderate on these things like it's actually one of those cases where everybody else is crazy and there aren't that many situations where that's the case but in this instance like you have these agencies that are acting in ways that are unconstitutional and illegal yeah and to call that out is actually the most sane thing you can do like I had a guy the other day comment on one of my YouTube videos and he said have you tried anti-psychotic medications my he was like my brother my uncle or something after he did that he stopped worrying about the government spying on him and I was like you know dude you don't fucking get it like maybe that was acceptable I think that 15 years ago but knowing everything we know today to call these programs out is not paranoid this is like just basic journalism 101 like first day of journalism class is you challenge authority and you gather facts and that's what people are doing and it's not paranoia and it's not anti-american and so I really don't allow the people who are a little bit behind the curve in terms of the data and the information they have I don't let that slow me down at this point there was a time where I you know I had less confidence about this stuff and I thought maybe they're right maybe I'm making such a big deal out of it maybe Obama's a good guy and I'm just being a dick but I just know too much at this point to ever go back into that kind of pre-red pill environment you know well I would like challenge anybody out there to point to a time in the United States history that hasn't been marked by covert operations and violent wars first of all so you can't really pin down a time I don't I'm not aware of a time because where where pretty awful stuff hasn't been happening from the roots of slavery to Vietnam to the concentration camps we had for the Japanese to obviously these terrible wars that are going on right now where they're using not just the drones but if you seen that vice documentary on in Iraq the 50% birth defect rate in Fallujah have you seen that no I haven't seen that but yeah we leave these regions war-torn and even Afghanistan I mean I've only seen Charlie Wilson's war and read some articles about it but that's sort of what we did in Afghanistan was left in a half-assed kind of situation not just half-assed we're using this new I mean we a half-assed but poisoned because we're using this there's a new kind of weapon we're using a bunch of new weapons that we you know war is great because and war is great if you're a weapons manufacturer because you make a lot of money but also gives you a place to test the weapons that you've been working on and there's a new type of weapon that uses shit I can't uranium it's called some some special type of uranium the way this amazing device works is you launch it into a house it sucks all the oxygen out of the house of course causing your lungs to collapse so anyone who's sitting in the house they're long your lungs collapse because there's no all the oxygen gets sucked out and then you're incinerated so you get these two phases of death first the air gets sucked out of your body to the point that your lungs collapse and second you're roasted now the way that this weapon works apparently is it somehow uses uranium so we left uranium all over Fallujah and now there's a 50% birth defect rate where kids are being born either you know dying within the first couple of years or with severe brain damage you know I can't remember the name of the senator there's a senator who's been trying to get the military to admit they've done this but of course the military will never admit it because then they have to pay for it which they don't want to do so point being when someone tells you you should take anti-psychotic medication because it will make you stop worrying about the government yeah what you just said with that weapon system you explained only sounds beautiful if you're a total fucking sociopath oh yeah otherwise like if you have even a shred of empathy for your fellow human beings that you stop and you go there's something wrong with that first of all second of all our taxpayer money is going toward these sorts of things so let's dig a little bit deeper let's find out what's going on and there are some people out there who go oh you're being anti-american you're being anti-Obama which yeah I am anti-Obama at this point I think he's a fraud but I was talking to Abby Martin actually I guess we're both friends with her yes and we were talking about how these sociopaths seem to rule the planet in a lot of ways today and that there's a antidote to that or maybe not an antidote just a response which is that there are also people out there who care too much people like us and she has a word for it I think it's called empath or empath yeah people who actually care about what's happening around them and there's kind of this battle this ideological battle between the people who care about what's happening in your environment and your country and your planet and the people who not only don't care but are seeking to profit off of things that are pretty terrible and on a smaller scale like this isn't the same as sucking oxygen out of a baby's body but I think it's terrible to violate people's constitutional rights just to make a buck you know this is not being driven by a real need it's being driven by money like the program the NSA using is using is designed to make billions of dollars for these contractors who have to provide the servers and the software and staff there was a simpler solution to it called thin thread which was abandoned and would have cost you know a fraction of what they're doing now hold on before we get into that and I do want to get into that because you're an expert on it I want to I want to I want to before we go flying deep into that I'm sure people who was in this podcast know about what's happening with the NSA but for those of you who don't can you just explain it as though you are explaining it not no no offense I mean when I say explain it like you're explaining it to a six-year-old I mean so I can understand it I'm sure you guys already understand it but just take us through exactly what's happening with the NSA okay and by the way when I flew out here from from Florida to LA it was one of those flights that has free satellite TV because Virgin America is pretty good about that yes and I was just looking at this you know string of TVs in front of me of you know 50 or 60 people watching their TV screens and it was all people watching Juliana Rancic on e-news talking about some bullshit about Kanye West and Kim yeah and all this stuff yeah it was that and then people were flicking between that and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and I even tweeted about this is like a like a living nightmare for me so I'm surrounded by all these people who are watching these two sources of information that I do not consider to be news yeah and then I wonder why I encounter people on Twitter who are like fuck you you're being anti-American right for discussing these programs and it's such a big jump it's like how do you get from believing that that is news to the government is spending your money to wiretap you illegally well what you know what it is is it's a basically what you're doing is we're having a really wonderful party here there's hot tubs plenty of great dope lots of drugs but you're the assholes coming in and saying they're crucifying people in the backyard and that makes us you can't enjoy the party as much how am I going to enjoy this fucking party when I know that the electricity running the hot tubs is fueled from the blood of blown up kids hey shut up let's just enjoy the party yes we're all vampires and we're grinding up human beings so that we can have a great time over here but I guess that you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet friend I think that's why people get mad because they don't want that cognitive dissonance and this entire thing this thing that we're in called America seems to be a machine based on reducing cognitive dissonance to point where it's you're not even sure what it is you just maybe and if you do feel cognitive dissonance then they'll start telling you you're you're depressed you're just depressed right get on some medication you're depressed you have low serotonin levels it's not that there's some deep part of yourself that like turns on the news is like holy shit man I'm living in the belly of the antichrist it's that you're just not feeling well you should take antipsychotic medication yeah you're making this all up even though it's on the homepage of the Guardian and the Washington Post so I'll just imaginary like the other day at the homepage of the Washington Post which is one of the most influential newspapers in DC obviously and the surrounding area their top story was that the NSA's internal audit has found thousands of privacy violations and this is their own people saying we found this and people were saying oh well the NSA is coming forward with their abuses no the reason why this became public is that that whistleblower Snowden had this in his cache of documents right this is one of them was internally they know that they're fucking up right and so you have the very people who are running these things going oh look we it's almost like something out of a out of a bad movie like there was one example where they messed up the country code to zero which I think is for Egypt somebody typed in 202 instead so they sucked in all the phone calls from Washington DC whoops small mistake there now we have every single politicians phone calls every single journalists metadata you know now now also did you read a Glenn Greenwell just tweeted that his partner got arrested in the UK did you read about that yeah I was reading about that on the way over and they used a terrorism statute terrorism statute to detain him at Heathrow Airport and for nine hours because that's what they're allowed to do is up to nine hours they seized his laptop and cell phone and video game consoles interestingly enough he played video games I thought that's kind of cool yeah yeah it was it's so weird because it's like why do these laws exist are they being abused we know they're being abused because this happened because this guy's only crime is being the romantic partner of a journalist who's doing some very sensitive work yeah and so they're using a terrorism law to make his life more difficult and to steal his property and steal his his time yeah I mean this is a this is a point of law when the government decides to detain you and impede your freedom of movement that's a big deal in fact a lot of people tell you when dealing with police officer police officers one of the first things you're supposed to do is say am I being detained officer right if the answer is no you're free to basically just get the fuck out of there yes and that's a very important distinction legally in effect they're using a terrorism law on some guy whose only crime is being the boyfriend of a journalist is beyond Orwellian oh yeah absolutely and they're using this to I mean that's what Greenwald was writing is there it's clearly a form of intimidation if you think if things keep progressing in the direction they're going because it does seem if you if you look at this thing you can actually actually saw a timeline someone made a really cool timeline on the internet to show the this per the escalation in the surveillance state that's happening right now if things keep going in this direction where do you see the United States in five years we could go one of two ways one way is it gets a lot worse and it gets to the point where we literally have thought crime because we are very close to that at this point when you're just the boyfriend of a journalist and you're being detained under terrorism laws is if the original version or the original definition of a terrorist was somebody who kills innocent people to further their political ideology yeah that was the original definition and now a terrorist has just become somebody who's a minor inconvenience to this multi-billion dollar transnational surveillance state complex and that's a big redefinition of that word right and so in five years time it could be that if you go on the wrong YouTube video you listen to the wrong episode of the Duncan Trussell family hour that's every episode every episode okay then then you're fucked that's one direction we could go in I think the other direction is you're already seeing public support for these programs there it's crashing crashing burn on this the polls they're doing people don't support this stuff and every time there's a new instance like this thing today yeah with him being detained or anything like that you see this or you see them trying to put Bradley Manning in prison for up to 136 years yeah when the public sees these things they go this is extreme and the one thing of American politics is the man who tries to position himself the most in the middle yes the guy who wins at least in theory right that's what a big thing of political theory and at this point the government itself does not seem to be moderate it seems like it's extreme and a lot of the American people are like this is fucking crazy so this needs to be rolled back and you had a vote the Amash amendment where they were gonna defund the NSA and they only lost by five votes yeah Abby was telling me about so that's incredible because that means the second time something like this comes forward now that there's been additional pressure put on these people in the house it's very likely that it'll it will actually succeed and you'll start to see defunding some of these more ridiculous programs because people are fed up and people are not stupid like I use that example of I was looking in front of me at the TV screens on the airplane and part of that is that's the only options available you're stuck on a plane they give you some free shit yes so when people have their internet at home I'm sure they're seeking out better information in the form of Reddit and podcasts and Google news and so people know what's going on people know what's up and there is this ridiculous article actually posted on the Guardian it's a big newspaper so they can't always get it right you know they had this this contributor who was saying that Obama's popularity is falling but we don't believe it's because of racism and I was like oh no shit maybe it has to do with all the articles that have been coming out about these civil rights abuses wait now what do you think happened to Obama because do you think he started off a fraud or is there something that happens to a person when he gets that kind of power that you just transform into a beast I don't even want to pretend to know the answer to that it's something I think about a lot also I sort of love the idea that there's an adjustment bureau type of situation where you get in there and they're like here's what the public is told which is that terrorism is very sporadic here's the reality we're stopping hundreds of attacks every week and if it weren't for what we're doing it would be total chaos throughout the world yes and that's one possibility I don't see any evidence to support that I think it's something that people like to fantasize about is like oh Obama's actually looking out for us yeah there's some secret information that we the public cannot see and what's so creepy about that is that the Germans did the same thing like I know people on the internet hate when you compare anything to Nazi Germany yeah it's actually a thing for it called Godwin's law where you it's it's like the more you talk online the more likely somebody is to compare something to Nazism and I think that uh if you're if you're at Subway and somebody's making your sandwich and you tweet out you know this bitch is a Nazi yeah that's not an accurate comparison you know her making your sandwich is not really the same as the rise of the you know national yeah not really the same as the rise of the national socialist party in Germany so it's not accurate but when you see a government that's doing more and more creepy illegal stuff and their justification is basically this is too complex for you to understand there's some stuff going on behind the scenes and if you could see that you would agree with us yes the Nazis did the same thing where people are going why are you carting off homosexuals to these death camps right why are you carting off journalists and uh communists and all this stuff and of course jews this is a national security situation if you could see everything we can see you would feel differently about it we're trying to protect the they didn't call it the homeland they called it the fatherland yeah and there's a book called they thought they were free the germans 1933 to 1945 which will scare the shit out of you when you even skim it because they were being told a lot of the same stuff that the department of homeland security is telling people today sure but maybe there's a little difference and well yeah I mean obviously like going through a body scanner and being put in a microwave oven for three seconds no no no I don't mean that I mean the difference is that um I don't know what the danger was in Germany but I think there is a danger here and I think the danger comes because we've been dropping bombs on people in the Middle East now for I don't know how long has it been going on for a decade is it a decade how long has it been going on for how many people have we killed we've we've incinerated I think at least a hundred thousand people I look the numbers up man it's a big big number of people that we've blown up not to mention the people we've poisoned so there's a group of people in the Middle East who are not very happy with us man I was talking to Abby about this you know that if we for example got invaded by like the idea is if let's say a group of seven militant fundamentalist southern Baptists somehow managed to hijack an airplane and fly it into that mosque that's in the middle of Israel because they want the temple built there let's say that that that had happened and so because of that we got invaded somehow Russian Vedas I ran invade who knows and they invaded they invaded us and they flew planes over DC and blew up people and killed and you know people who've been killed you know people get and then your aunt calls and she tells you that your or your rather your sister calls and says that she just had a baby with fucking birth effects because it had plutonium in it from something that the Russians were dropping and over time you're not going to be the one who starts sharpening his sword and figuring out a way to go to Russia but somebody is without question somebody wants payback there's no way that somebody over there doesn't want payback and all the people that want payback there is a very small percentage but a percentage that can get it guaranteed there's so many nukes and bio weapons floating around out there what I'm saying is I think that one thing that the Obama administration and Bush and everyone is saying that is true is that there is people who want to blow up things here now and that our ability our government's ability to fight those those uh radical elements is actually lessened when they misuse the immune system you know this whole infrastructure that we've built up as a kind of immune system and instead of actually you know if you need to detain somebody in airport at an airport because they really do have radical ties and because they might have something in their suitcase that can kill a thousand people yeah that's when you should maybe bend the law and do kind of an NCIS situation where you go in there and you go under the Patriot Act we're gonna keep we're gonna keep your ass in this chair until you tell us where the suitcase nuke is exactly that's when you I don't want to say should be using because I don't think these powers should exist in the first place you don't but if you're going to use them that's when you use it and then for every time you use it on a journalist boyfriend or on somebody you tweeted something that makes fun of President Obama every time you use it in a way that's completely inappropriate you lessen the likelihood that the American people are going to allow you to use that in the first place and you lessen the validity validity of it but you don't think these things should exist at all these you don't think there should be um an NSA you know I well here's the thing the NSA most people most people did not think about the NSA at all before these disclosures came out in the Snowden documents yes and those who did think about it thought that it was a secretive government agency that hired brilliant people brilliant mathematicians to hack into the communications of our enemies to break enemy code which is something that has been important for a very long time yes to do that and then that gives us a strategic edge on the battlefield and with terrorist groups allows us to infiltrate them digitally uh that's what we thought they were doing and so that's legitimate right like we need that yes and it turns out what they're doing instead is that's what they used to do and then post 9 11 all these programs started being turned inward and when you're changing it from actual foreign surveillance targets where you do want to know what they're saying because there's a you know a security benefit there when it turns from that let's figure out what you've been what you've been sending over your direct messages on twitter yeah and that's fucked up you're abusing the technology you have you're abusing the mandate you have why do they care why are they why are they surveilling us why do they care I think information is power so that's what it is they just want what's what power are they gaining from reading my boring emails to my brother you can take that out of context so since it's secret information it's not subject to the same kind of review and this has been the big issue with that special operations division of the DEA which uh they claim Reuters did an exclusive on this they claim that the SOD is obtaining NSA data what's the SOD special operations division of the DEA and they claim that it's sucking in or that the NSA is giving them certain data and then they can use that data to figure out who is dealing drugs are involved in other common drug crimes within the United States so again nothing to do with terrorism all right and then they can't actually admit that that's how they found out that you were a drug dealer yes because that would expose the program and that would also expose illegal surveillance yes so they do something called parallel construction which is the most creepy shit you'll ever hear and again this isn't me making this up this is all from the Reuters piece yes parallel construction is oh we're gonna stop this the NSA or somebody there goes stop this guy at 7 p.m. when he's at the intersection you'll find a lot of weed and so the the issue there i think for years people wondered how are they so good about targeting these guys who drives down the highway with like 10 kilograms of cocaine you know i think that's insane who does that in the middle of the day and they do that because they had very specific intel based on a legal surveillance and searches of people's emails and text messages get this guy at this time you can say he has a broken tail light and then once you're once you're talking to him say that you smell weed in the car before you know what you have probable cause and now you have a legitimate a legitimate investigation but it was based on wow on a fishing expedition on drag net surveillance holy shit that's scary isn't that scary so scary that's terrifying to think about wow so to answer your question that's how it can be misused and then there's the other thing which is six years ago you were stoned and emailed your brother yeah fuck america in response to the outcome of an american idol episode yeah you go yeah fuck america you become this popular podcaster this famous comedian and you start criticizing whatever administration exists five years from now they bring you into a fucking room and go we don't know about this email yeah fuck america my fantasy that's my fantasy getting taken into that room no because that room is kind of like getting to see that unicorns exist or something like once you get into that room it's the final proof somehow it's like wow you guys are real and then you get to be face to face with the mantis you get to talk to the thing and be like what are you yeah you're just like me you're a person you're an earthling what are you man are you are you crazy what are you a brain are you in a cult are you brainwashed who do you work for see that room is really curious to me because right now these beings i read about them all the time i just haven't come in contact with them it's like a myth they're these mythological weirdos who yeah have their who have zero problem arresting somebody for drugs and taking their but because like this is an important thing you guys to bear in mind that uh when somebody gets busted with drugs it's not just like they they do a little bit of jail time it's that they their money goes their house gets taken by the government their money gets taken their family gets broken apart their kids get put into other homes that's real that happens in the united states it's not just like you get arrested it's like you lose everything and a lot of the time you're losing everything for growing a plant it's not even that you're losing everything for cocaine which you shouldn't it's that you're losing everything for plant matter that's a really important thing to realize to bear in mind on top of all the other stuff well that is absolutely terrifying man i figure um that's really terrifying but i you know and that here's the thing the mantis in that room yeah i i love that term the mantis is like a praying mantis across me at the desk yeah just feeding on misery and confusion uh unfortunately again that's the fantasy that i wish existed was the adjustment bureau type of thing yes it's a lot uh more mundane it's just money and the law enforcement uh they are a club you know they have lobbyists they have uh conferences where they all hang out and talk about stuff it's about jobs it's about money and you take away one of these uh agencies that shouldn't exist in the first place like the dea that's putting kids in prison for decades yes you take that away a lot of people are out of work yes we can't allow that to happen so they at all costs you know priority number one is self-preservation well it's it's you know what it isn't that is a mundane because that's vampirism bottom line that's basic vampirism because what you're doing when you arrest a person for money what you're doing is you're using this device called a prison to transform their life energy into group cash yeah and when you are it's almost like the matrix it's only a couple steps away from that and using them as a fucking human battery yeah that is I don't yeah I think it's the exact same thing prisons are uh like solar panels for humans that turn human life into cash and each person represents a certain amount of money for the prison per year you know we you if you and I start a prison you want it to be overpopulated you want that fucking thing overpopulated because you're gonna make so much more money same as a retail store they look at a revenue per square foot yes no different if you're a for-profit prison corporation all you care about is get the get the clients in they're not really clients technically the people who are paying you to arrest them are but get them in there stack as many as you can and here's where it gets really terrifying this is the big slippery slope that really terrifies the shit out of me um uh you know the study that shows that more intelligent kids tend to use drugs so here's what you've got happening you've got this weird well I believe that uh using psychedelics and using drugs is a basic human right I think it's an ancient thing humans have been using drugs forever the reason that so many people are in jail because of drugs is not because there's so many bad people in the world it's just because there's a basic need for people to have altered experiences uh in the same way that we like to take vitamins we enjoy uh drinking water I think it's that natural a thing people like to get high it's fun it feels good it's a basic human right so you take a basic human right and then you criminalize that basic human right something where there's a deep instinct in us to get high from time to time in the same way cats like to chew on catnip it's a human instinct what about the human instinct for truth yes now they're trying to criminalize journalism and whistleblowing uh same thing seeking the truth is not a radical actions when you're naturally in a room with two or more people and you start talking about anything whether it be your fucking crops in the backyard if you're a farmer or you know the other people in your city if you live in an urban environment you're interested in the truth you want to cut through the gossip and see what is actually happening around you yes that is a basic human instinct and now you have the government saying no no no wiki leaks is dangerous there are certain things that should not be revealed and my whole thing with that is they keep telling us if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear which is why you have to take off your shoes at the airport why they can sift through the contents of your yahoo email account all this stuff that's the explanation and i'm like if that's the new reality that's the new post 9 11 reality we all have to accept then what the fuck are you hiding and what do you have to fear right is the criminalization of journalism and of whistleblowing organizations right now is it an all-time high that's not not up to debate by anybody it's an all-time high so something is being hidden and i wonder what that is well i mean i i i think it seems like you already nailed it it's what's being hidden is just that a lot of people are getting rich off of putting people in jail and and and they've constructed this amazing trap because if smart people tend to use drugs and obviously smart people tend to seek the truth and you make those two things something that can get you into prison then basically you end up getting a lot of intellectuals and intelligent people and people who can really make change in into prison yeah the difference is we accept man when i watch cops when you watch cops and you think watch cops with the mindset of people should be allowed to do drugs they want to do drugs and it becomes the most horrifying thing ever because really what you have is just people who are naturally wanting to uh express themselves or now i'm not saying it's great a lot of these people fuck themselves up well that's their fault they're still not breaking any laws outside of the fact that they have a substance on their body but when you watch cops you're just seeing like people who are trying to uh uh experience happiness getting thrown around by muscular people with handcuffs and guns that's spooky man and we watch that for entertainment like look at him run oh she's gonna run he's gonna run oh he's running watch oh fuck he just threw him on the ground so hard you very rarely see on cops a cop coming into a house and stopping a criminal from robbing you very rarely see on cops someone getting in the way of an actual crime happening you'll see like domestic abuse uh cases where that's being stopped but generally it's just people with drugs getting the shit kicked out of them by really big dudes yeah well there there are moments where i slip out of being a part of this whole society that we're in and i see it in a more objective way like the uh the juliana rancid thing when i was on e-news or i wasn't on e-news when i was watching it can you what do you can you put that away sorry i'm just i don't i'm like sorry it's dave's david's friend is here and he just showed me on his iphone that our private prison's been 45 million dollars in oh i wasn't sure what that was in lobbying and um but uh yeah so juliana rancid when i was watching this on e-news they're like don't go away after the break we'll have this on and it's something so unimportant and the production quality is what you would expect from a news show and again i'm not an idiot i know e-news this is what they do anyway yes but the point is a lot of people tune into this and they really care about what she has to say and it has no impact on your life at all right meanwhile you're driving in the mall with some weed on you and you get pulled over based on that nsa sod data that you were talking to your friends about smoking weed you get pulled over and then they create a fake investigation using parallel construction that has an impact on the rest of your life and yet you tweet people like me and say i don't give a shit man i'm not political you can't vote anymore don't forget that you can't vote if you get a felony right you can't vote yeah so if you yeah like not everything gets your you can't get a job anymore that shits on your record permanently so yes man it's a um it's a it's a that it's very spooky to really see see what the truth of what's happening in this country uh but i think it's important to note that this is not a the the truth is this this it takes different forms uh but this is not a new thing it's just they always find something to make us afraid of it used to be the communists well according to adam uh at adam scorgi on my show a while ago and he did this documentary about drug culture and drug policy and according to him the criminalization of marijuana started with nixon and the reason why is that nixon's people they saw all these anti-war protesters that were becoming a real threat to the administration's policy yeah and of vietnam and you can't arrest people for protesting clearly protected but they realized oh a lot of these protesters are also smoking weed all the time we can get them for smoking weed so then they criminalized and did this whole campaign then you have people in prison for a decade because of what they had on them because you can't get them for what you really wanted to get them for which was having independent opinions there you go see that's it that's people a lot of times people who want to find out who people who have an exploratory instinct will experiment with drugs if you criminalize drugs then you can start arresting people with an exploratory instinct and that will allow you to further your whatever awful stupid thing you're trying to further like the military industrial complex because um or the uh this newest thing which is the surveillance state um but you know you you were saying that uh you said there's two directions that you see things going in thought crimes uh and then maybe this the some middle ground where this lessens but man it does seem that there is a progression happening in the world towards something you know I don't want to I don't want to like I don't want to sound too much like I'm on the uh Alex Jones show here but if you look at what's happening in the world it it feels like this is an intentional progression in the direction of something this doesn't seem like it feels like it's going somewhere I you know I don't know about the shadowy puppeteers running things or what it is but it feels like this is a logical progression yeah I I complain about this uh to my friends somewhat often that there's so much crazy stuff happening right now with the US government and not just the US government it's also the UK to some extent but you know we're kind of taking the lead in terms of the surveillance state yeah and uh I'm getting so many stories that I don't have time to cover all of them like you get something like this is fucking incredible like they're actually doing this yeah and then a couple hours past and it comes out that they've detained Greenwald's boyfriend or partner yeah and that airport for nine hours using a terrorism statue like really I've got to drop the other story it's not as important and then in a few hours from now there'll be something new like the rate of information coming out right now about this NSA stuff yeah is uh it's pretty unbelievable I mean and the way that they're doing the different uh news stories or they're just doing it piece by piece you have you know the government say oh we're not reading your emails and then the next round of documents comes out they're reading the emails yeah and then but only if you're a terrorist and then the next round of documents comes out SOD is actually you know building investigations on common drug crimes and then I just wonder what it'll be a week from now when the next round hits the uh the Guardian and here's what scares me man uh when I go into into a paranoid state and start considering these things is that once you accept as you should if you just have if you you must accept the fact that war is a profitable endeavor and you must accept the fact that prisons are a profitable endeavor and then once you realize that you have to ask yourself well are these wars justified and are these people in prison actually criminals and I think that if you really look at the world you will the answer to those questions is no wars are not justified that are happening right now there there are some bad guys out there but not nearly as many as as is justified by our current program yes that's what it comes down to like yes they're a handful of psychos yeah who will do everything in their power to destroy modern society but they're fucking running the country and two and two um these people in prison most of them not all of them it's like that Richard Pryder Richard Pryder's got a great joke on prison where he went there to shoot I think it was stir crazy uh I think that was the one but he was in I don't remember which movie it was or he's in prison but he's like some of these motherfuckers need to be in prison these are there's some definitely some people in prison who that's where they need to be but I think that's a very small percentage of the people who are actually in prison right when you realize these two things uh when when you understand those two things that's where you start feeling the mind boggling sense of vertigo that's where you start hitting the wall of the conditioning because the conditioning is like hey listen I mean here's I'll tell you the fucking story here's the story this is the nursery rhyme this is the bedtime this is the uh this is the boogie man in the closet of America that they've told us here's the story right now in Yemen right now in Africa in Yemen in uh in Saudi Arabia right now in Afghanistan there is a growing group of fundamentalist Islamic terrorists who are trying to basically create what's it called a caliphate they're basically trying to create uh Islamic state around the entire planet they're trying to take over the planet with with with sharia law essentially and they recognize that the United States is uh uh uh basically the one of the last free places on earth one of the last places where you can truly be yourself so much freedom so much freedom and because they hate that freedom because they can they can smell it wafting over across the ocean and it makes them puke it makes them puke in their burkas they can't stand it it interferes their prayer session when they're just trying to prayer session it gets in the way when they're cutting open their their animals to sacrifice their evil gods and their in their muttering prayers assembling bombs and just waiting for one little hole one little fucking hole to open up at the airport one security guy to not look at into their back just one moment so they can get into this country and detonate a small scale nuclear bomb and destroy all civilization or an anti-matter bomb why stop at nuclear they're working on it right now over in in uh yemen here's another story let me tell you another story here's another story the other story is there is a group of very wealthy people who make who recognize that every single transaction in the united states is that involves money is taxed and they recognize that there is a giant well of money and the best way to get that money is through war because if you if you are manufacturing weapons the way you siphon taxpayer money into your bank account is by uh uh creating a war so that the taxpayer money gets used to buy the fucking weapons so when you recognize that there are people that truly that evil in the world there was some asshole who walked into haliburton one day he's like hey man last night i had a dream or where a demon came to me and told me about this badass new bomb that sucks the air out of your lungs collapses your lungs and incinerates babies give that man a raise give a raise let's make this holiday holiday bonus and here's a little extra it actually leaves radioactive particles in the fucking village which will get paid to clean up in 10 years but uh exactly this this will blow your mind so james clapper everybody knows him from lying to congress about the surveillance programs director of national intelligence james fucking clapper as i call him uh he is supposed to be one of the absolute top people one of the top people at the food chain of our intelligence community yes and he in the past had said that the muslim brotherhood was a mostly secular organization now this goes to what you are talking about because it has fucking muslim brotherhood in the name that would be like somebody saying the christian ministers of america is a secular organization so this fucking falsehood is what he propagates through the intelligence community that oh they're secular and then in egypt now we have total chaos yes because they're killing protesters that they disagree with yes guess what they're not secular that these are the kinds of people who do want to impose a religiously influenced rule of law they do exist and so what we're doing in some cases say we i mean elements of the government we're actually backing the wrong side we're backing the fucking shitty people who want to drag us back to the stone age i don't know why that is i think part of it is strategic we want certain partners in the region sure but part of it might be we got to keep that demand because we're companies if all of the threats go away and all we're doing is the tanning journalists people are going to wake up to that so let's back from time to time some of these fucking crazies so that we see the images streaming in if people's face is bleeding and people having acid thrown on them let's have that from time to time because if the middle east actually develops a somewhat stable rule of law we might not be needed well yeah man and also um right i i think i mean yeah i don't i was gonna ask you about egypt but uh i i think that i don't know enough about the egypt thing by the way i just know the muslim brotherhood thing well it's which to me is astounding is that you are the director of national intelligence if you're that wrong about something that i could have an you know i could have a glenn beck argument with somebody at a gas station yeah who would know more about the muslim brotherhood right then this guy does sure and you have access to everybody's emails and the whole satellite array so what the fuck is going on if that's the conclusion you came to you know to me what's scary about all this is that if let's imagine that you are let's just imagine that there's some group of people who are making lots of money off of war and off of surveillance what's the very best thing that can happen if you're if you make a lot of money off of war and surveillance what's pretty much like you wake up in the morning turn on the news and get a big grin on your face another terrorist attack a big fucking terrorist attack or civil unrest because then all these emails you've collected you have a very good reason to build new algorithms to sort out who the you know the activists are and you're seeing uh again i don't know how much of a link there is in hollywood between you know propaganda and just directors being smart about picking up on topics that people care about yeah but there is this movie the east uh that either just came out or is coming out where they're called environmental terrorists it's this domestic environmental terrorist organization who target corporate executives who are ruining the environment well like that's something that we're starting to see in real life is that people are getting so fed up with what's happening that some of them are not becoming terrorist organizations but becoming activists who will actually protest and will actually speak up and so you have this you might have this need created over time where we have to track these people within the u.s and even some of the language from people like diane feinstein one of the senators on the intelligence committee is it's called protecting america and then you have senator lindsay graham saying we need to protect the homeland and you know this has become a battlefield you're like this isn't a fucking battlefield go to any mall is this a battlefield do we have like the situation is real even yeah we don't have that you know and you're calling it a battlefield so maybe you would like it to be one because that necessitates this whole illegality you've done over the past few years that to me is the scary thing the moment you start the moment you create a condition where people profit from prisons and war is the moment you invite someone to create a catastrophe because they know that they won't get so rich and especially when a lot of these people who are profiting aren't even in america so then you have this situation where it's like all look all you need all all we need all we need is just one one building to blow up in manhattan that gets tied to iran and then we could play it a hundred times on tv yeah one building that's all we need guys remember that weird shit that happened i don't know if you remember this but because sometimes it's almost like they try to do this shit there was some weird thing that happened that they were trying to peg on iran i don't know if you remember that it was this weird thing with like it emerged for like two days into the news and then vanished suddenly i wish i could remember it yeah i i don't know exactly what you're talking about but for a while when they were trying to push the iran rhetoric yeah it sort of it fell apart it i feel like it didn't go the way what they wanted they wanted to but for a while every night on cnn erin bernett every fucking night was some new scary thing that iran was working on yes you're like really this is the most important stuff what about what china is working on what about any of these other issues centrifuges yeah centrifuges they're working on it centrifuges are spinning at this very moment making plutonium they're gonna bomb us they're gonna bomb the middle east by the way uh when i said that yemen is working on an anti-matter anti-matter bomb that was a joke earlier i was being sarcastic yeah i know people are gonna fact check everything this podcast there is no anti-matter he's making shit up that was sarcastic well look i mean i just try to what i try to do when it comes to like especially since i've been doing this show with rogan and i've run into some real kooks um and seeing the the what a kook what a kook is like i i try to as much as i can not be that kook you know so what that means is you you only go off of the evidence you try to just go off of evidence and then from that you can you from that you can sort of forecast what's probably gonna happen but that the truth you know there's it truths the truth is people profit off war that's a truth people in the united states profit off war it's called the military industrial complex people profit off surveillance and people profit off of prison so and people get really rich from this stuff so once you realize that truth then you have to ask yours to i already said all this shit anyway the point is these sons of bitches are making money off of evaporating people that's the world that we live in right now what can somebody like me do about it outside of rambling about it on a podcast or having informed people like you on my podcast what can people out there do to combat this um rising surveillance state i think the first thing people can do is uh when you hit that wall of conditioning as you put it earlier you come up against that wall and you start to you know creep over you look over the ledge and you see that there's something else out there that is not what your fairy tale tells you is the case yes when you start to see that you got to break through the wall and then you've got to help your family and friends see what's going on right because to give you an example when i do these youtube videos to raise awareness for different nsa programs i always get some people in the comments go david why do you not believe in any rules or regulations you don't believe in any government this is outrageous i'm like you're conflating you're just making shit up i believe completely in laws and regulations and you know certain elements of government what i don't believe in is illegality and doing things in the dark right it's like some people are not complex enough to understand that opposing something that's illegal and dangerous does not equal this guy doesn't believe in government right and some people are they don't have the complexity to see that and it's the same with any of this shit people hear you talking about the industrial prison complex they go he just wants people out on the streets fucking each other and smoking weed all day i do and you might actually want that it sounds kind of cool but but the point is there's not this extreme situation where it's either you're either with us or against us it's a lot more areas of gray and we don't have to be fucking crazy about this stuff but you're so right man your your attitude is so stable and right uh and and moderate it really is good that you know there's a hippie part of me that that doesn't like how moderate you are i don't want it to be shades of gray i want it to be more i i i you know when i think about obama getting impeached oh god it fills me with such happiness to imagine him getting impeached it fills me with such happiness to imagine somehow by some miracle something just starts working in the government people like no man you got you got to get the fuck out of here you can't do you can't ma you can't you violated the you're the president and you violated the fourth yeah well he's so egotistical i'm just sick of hearing about obama care and hearing about uh he gives these philosophical lofty uh press conferences like the thing on the surveillance or the leno appearance you're like the leno appearance yeah you're like yes this is what we should be doing we shouldn't have a domestic surveillance program and then you fact check and you're like wait this is completely false false bullshit and then once you know that for a fact which you and i do and i'm sure almost all of your listeners do you get to that point where you realize he's lying to the public then how do we believe him on other things that we used to believe him on exactly then is he telling the truth about obama care is that really good is he telling the truth about uh any of the fucking shit that we're doing right now or is that all bullshit too because when you it's like when you meet somebody and they tell you if they tell you i drive a red uh a red Cadillac and you go out and they drive like a Honda Accord and it's black yes and that's only one falsehood it doesn't mean they're full of shit about everything but that seat of doubt has been planted and it's a very big seat of doubt you're like why the fuck would he lie about something that obvious right then you start to understand is this person a pathological liar what is it they say in rivers and politics the lightest things float to the surface yeah like there's a quote about that yeah so yeah so it's like yeah exactly like if you what the deeper shit that he's doing is just who knows god dammit and also fuck you obama here's another reason fuck you obama now you've made it so that i have to sound like a god damn fox news personality by saying i want to get you impeached it's like that's embarrassing i don't want to be i don't like i don't want to land on that side of things that's where this weird convergence is happening between right wing people and people like us because we both really don't like obama and that's a frustration to me for some reason well you're absolutely right i've i've been labeled a progressive i don't know what i am i think i just take a little bit from everybody yeah uh but i've been labeled a progressive and i now do these op-bed columns on a very conservative website and i've had people say like how cool is that that their conservative base is agreeing with everything you're saying yeah because when it comes to constitutional rights there's a fucking rubicon that you do not cross and even my dad who's more conservative than i am because again i'm i've been labeled a progressive i don't know exactly what that means but he's definitely on the more conservative side and a lot of issues he watches a fair amount of fox and that's not the discount you know his views on anything else but point is he watches a lot of fox and he said to me you know i have no patience no tolerance at all for somebody who says snowden's a traitor these programs are to protect us he's like when somebody says that i don't give a shit what they have to say it's like that's not a good american that's a person who's not interested in you know accountability and you're labeling somebody who went out on the line to tell us what's going on labeling them a traitor you're full of shit i don't care what you have to say you know like that time magazine reporter who's taking all this heat online now for saying that he he can't wait to write a column defending a drone strike that kills julian assange wait what was that guy's name um we gotta find i'm gonna run wild mic you guys mic grunwald what a fucking pig he yeah he was basically like calling for the assassination of a journalist right essentially or even if you want to say well julian assange is not a journalist what he is is somebody who enables whistleblowing he's a conduit for whistleblowing if you're a journalist business is your fucking bread and butter and the comparison i made is what he said is like a dentist saying uh toothpaste is bad you know like don't use toothpaste yeah eat candy all day it's absolutely ludicrous like a journalist you want that inflow of information so that you can then tell the public which is supposed to be your customers you can tell the public what is going on yeah and you have something else here you have a guy who is totally a part of the establishment and thinks that he's doing the establishment he works for a solid by being a fucking asshole and that's what it comes down to is that i saw that tweet and a lot of other people saw it and you my producer paul was calling him out on twitter and uh and you get to the point where he he said he oh no somebody said what you're doing is just giving the assange supporters a persecution complex and he responded uh something like you're right i'll delete it and he deleted it because of that not because he was being a biased fuck but because somebody said you're gonna give them a persecution complex which by the way you tend to develop if you have time magazine reporters saying they're fantasizing about writing a column that defends your execution let's not act like time magazine is exactly a bastion of journalism i mean those guys are just shills if you there's there's shills but they hit a lot of people who aren't exposed to the podcast and reddit and all this stuff you hit you know 65 year old women waiting in the doctor's office yeah and you hit hundreds of thousands of subscribers who've been getting your magazine for 20 years not to mention when somebody says time when something says time or cnn or new york times it has an added level of credibility that is not found on a lot of this new media stuff so you have somebody who's really derailing the conversation of being an asshole time magazine will tweet they time does this thing and i a lot unfortunately a lot of news sources do this thing where they get paid to do a thing that seems like a news story those are the words the atlantic does that too it's like watching it's like actual prostitution yeah it is prostitution it's like we're gonna use our logo put in very small print below that this is a sponsored placement then it's gonna be a fake article with fake information time magazine does not do sponsored placement time magazine i i've seen them tweet like uh like as though it's a news story like new perfume line coming out from like they they have ways of phrasing this like obvious uh um corporate uh product placement but you know lino does that too do you know about that no i didn't know about that so lino gets paid to uh do commercials and his monologues oh so like corporations will i think a lot of late night shows do that there's actually a montage of i consider that a form of mind rape like if i if i'm doing your show and i'm like you know what this new tucate is i love this beer and if i'm saying that because i've been sponsored then that's that's pure evil that and what you just did is the way that they would do it they do it in that clever way like here's the playing guys we're gonna you guys are gonna talk about the shill stuff just make sure you say tucate five times tucate tucate tucate tucate and then and then but there's a great uh anyway there's a great montage someone made of all the lino product placements and his shitty monologue and uh like one you know one of the most obvious when it always comes to mind is the windies girl turned 50 to turns 50 today and it's like and then and then he and then he's like a sketch where the windies girl's like making windies but but you hear him say you know windies is he says to her windies is known for his distinctive burger shape you know like they said to him just just say distinctive burger shape and do whatever else you want so it's so funny to see him sitting there knowing that this is a man who is a hundred percent okay he used to be a comic but he's a hundred percent he still is a comic but he's a comic who's like he's just a comic who's been mounted by some hoof thing underneath the hollywood hills for far too long one of those mantis you talk about yeah a mantis has fucked lino many lino has taken many mantis loads to the face but but uh but the fact that when you see lino sitting with obama right you draw the same conclusions right is he being told these crazy teabaggers who want to limit our ability to hunt down terrorists yeah it's like well we don't believe you about the wendy's shill so should we believe you about the political jokes he's getting no and when then you realize that not only is lino a shill you realize obama is the same goddamn shill and you realize they're both just spitting out catch phrases that have been written uh for them by we don't know who but when you know lino like when lino threw out the thing about russia persecuting the gays it's almost like uh during that uh interview with obama it was like a um which is by the way fucked up into the deepest level but it just felt like uh this is something it seemed like they sat down like listen here's the here's what you could say that would be a really great jay we love your show we love you so much and we know you're retiring soon and just sit talk a little bit about the gay thing that's happening over there as terrible as that is it's certainly i think what what is happening in russia to some young gay teens is awful it needs to be condemned but on the list of fucked up things happening in the world today that the united states can have a direct influence on it's somewhere around number like five thousand yes like why don't we talk about the fucking peaceful protesters in china being dragged off the streets and having their fucking organs harvested that to me seems like a bigger deal can you imagine what about the all the economic shit in south america which is partially due to our policies 30 years ago i mean these are bigger you imagine if lino said that to obama during the the denigel it would be it would be the end of his it would be the end of his administration that's why some of these people piss me off so much when he lied about domestic spying i'm sure lino has a fucking kindle or an ipad or something i'm sure he's read a couple articles about the nsa program why couldn't he just say you know mr president with all due respect that's not what i've read then get a response the same with the press conference yes in the white house where the white house press corps was there and they are to borrow a term from alex jones i believe their prostitutes i mean he said about he started talking about the nsa they didn't ask a single valid follow-up question and then they start joking about you know their vacation coming up then very quickly jessica yellen from cnn gets up to ask a question she moves the topic on to immigration so it's like we're back in a safe territory now what a fucking disservice to the american people to do that instead of grilling him about these nsa programs yes mr president let's talk about immigration and then he's back in republicans versus democrats and that's something that is you know totally natural to him and totally safe to talk about it is goddamn creepy um uh hold on i have okay i've just got a few more questions for you have a little bit more time i've got all the time in the world okay great um okay if you knew that by breaking the fourth amendment you could prevent what happened in boston like you knew this is a obviously a thought experiment but it's like you knew that by doing the surveillance you knew that you would stop some you know group of kids from getting blown up or what named the most horrible thing a nursery getting uh covered in acid if you knew that you could stop that from happening would you then go against the constitution well yeah i'm not fucking ron paul absolutely if there are innocent people who you knew you know would be saved you got me no here here's here's the thing with that first of all the laws are already bent all the time this is what's so scary about what's happening now if you work at the fbi or one of these you know three letter agencies and you for sure know that some creep in boston is about to kill a bunch of little kids yes but the judge says sorry we can't approve this warrant which doesn't happen all that often warrants take about 15 they take 15 minutes to fill out judge judges are highly uh they skew toward law enforcement heavily because that's their friends that's their family you know so if for some situation in some situation that was the outcome they go you know what i'm taking the responsibility fuck it you wiretap his phone and we get this son of a bitch and you see that's what happens they're always bending the rules the problem is the rules themselves are being rewritten so for example the cia 30 years ago if there was some guy in south america or in russia who was who actually was planning to attack innocent americans we would send somebody over there tap them on the shoulder as they bump into him at an airport that person would die of a heart attack or whatever they have all kinds of creepy tools at their disposal right so and the cia is specifically designed for america to do its dirty work the same with every country's intelligence agency all right so we're already doing the creepy uh middle of the night stuff that we need to do to protect our interests in our population yes and but the law still says you can't do that so what happens when you change the actual law to where you can say yeah we just go kill whoever we want we just use drones on anybody with any suspicion level whatsoever based on secret evidence then you've got a fucked up situation because what you're doing in broad daylight is the thing that 30 years ago you're supposed to be doing under the table only in the most dire of situations now i want to go back to the question i asked earlier because you said well inform your friends and family as a form of activism but what what are some other actions people can take uh i really think that's the biggest one i know it's self-serving since i'm a journalist but there is not enough support for real journalists guys like mike runwald work at time magazine i'm sure get a cushy salary he's respected yeah and then there are people i don't even want to include myself in this group because i'm not a part of it they're investigative journalists out there who just have twitter and a wordpress account yeah and they're the ones staying up till 4am digging through these documents posting incredible stuff and they have not only not much of an audience but no support framework they get busted on some kind of trumped up charge and disappear and we saw that with barrett brown i think you fall into that group man you put a lot of work into this you have your podcast the david seaman hour has i don't know what 136 episodes or something like that yeah it's about that 136 you have this youtube channel with hours and hours and hours of content i think you definitely fall into that group you're you know like you guys are have really got a fire burning underneath you that i think a lot of people don't have thanks yeah i definitely have the fire and i understand the stakes i think the difference is that there are people who are risking their very lives to bring this information out there people like glenn greenwald that to me is a real journalist not that i'm not a real journalist just different what i do i call it amplification journalism it's a made-up term i made where i'll see some article on you know wired's website one of their blog posts gets two comments and like 10 retweets or something yeah and i read it i go is this this is fucking huge and then i find a way to do like a four minute youtube video on it and then i constantly tweeted at people and before you know it like it's a more mainstream thing that's what i try to do because i i respect the people who are digging yes and what i want to do is provide an easy platform to get these things into a a size limit that a lot of people will actually tolerate because you send somebody a democracy now segment that's like 60 minutes long nobody's going to sit down and watch that whole thing especially if it's an interview with some old crusty nsa whistleblower and not with katie perry or something you get it down to four minutes you make it interesting you tell people why it impacts them they will care that's beautiful i love that term amplification journalism that is awesome you're an amplification journalist that's super cool but so so you think that the direct action people can take is to make themselves aware and then to become their own little amplification journalist yeah because then you wake up your whole community and then at that point it becomes very easy for you guys to say you know what there's a midterm election next year we're going to get this creepy old fuck out and get anybody in i don't care if it's a deaf mute person with an iq of 50 if they're going to vote against the patriot act and they're going to vote against spying on american citizens we'd prefer to have that person in there we prefer to have four scump in there over the asshole that's been representing us and if enough districts decide to do that that's one change and then the other thing is when people are awake they respond in ways that that the businesses have to uh make room for like for example all those people outraged about what that time magazine reporter said they're probably going to have to either fire that guy or i think at the very least censure him or make some kind of public statement that this is not our standard operating procedure right and that's only possible because there are enough people awake if it was a situation where he said that and every single person was like well yeah fuck julien assange then there's no no real impetus for anything to get better so a more aware public is it leads to a better society necessarily um who do you think uh what do you think is going to happen on the next election i think we're probably going to end up with another shill obama type i mean they're already pushing hillary clinton on the left and on the right a lot of people are saying chris christie neither of these people in my opinion have any credibility at this point she wasn't a very good secretary of state uh under obama she didn't call him out on any of the creepy shit that i'm sure she must know he's up to so she's just an establishment politician on the left and chris christie on the right is an establishment right now he's governor of new jersey has a fucking nasty views when it comes to medical marijuana and some other social issues so you have you know pick your poison left or right next time around but both hands are part of the same body i think that's what we're gonna get in 2016 also the guy's gonna have a fucking heart attack when he's giving a speech man that that guy needs to that guy's in bad shape he is you can you gotta you gotta like you can't be president and like be be out of shape at that level it's too stressful his heart's gonna spray out of his mouth during a state of the union address it's just too much that guy's gonna be sweating like a fucking pig that'll be like having boss hog run the united states of america you know how scary that's i want my leader to be more disciplined than me exactly that's what i want i want so i want to feel like yeah this guy's like this guy's got his shit together i i i like i i like fit people i feel guilty every day i want to be fit i battle against my fat every day like i'm fighting some giant squid but i i lose i like whenever i'm around fit people it's like ah it's possible i don't want to look at the president because by the way you know how bush was kind of like bush was really inspirational for dumb people you know like dumb people are like ah see he did it he did it you can be president united states and be dumb as shit because he like had this way of seeming really dumb he wasn't he's like a malicious anti christ figure who just put on the guys of being a can i can i say something about the whole anti christ thing really fast yes please there i get a lot of emails from people who uh they definitely are like the kooks that you mentioned yes where they see some information that's valid but they're also willing to take in a lot of bullshit yes and they go obama's the anti christ and whenever there's some new surveillance program mark of the beast first of all mark of the beast is a very vague statement what the fuck does that mean we're a society that's driven by data and words yeah so any single combination of words you could claim is the mark of the beast yes that's bullshit second of all when people give up their power by saying he's the anti christ then we can't rationally improve our leadership what does that even mean he's the anti christ you're basing this on a pre scientific book i don't want to debate whether or not he's the anti christ i think he's just a leader who's making a lot of a lot of bad choices and he's taking a lot of shortcuts like you don't want your leader to do the thing that's the most convenient you want them to do the thing that ends up ultimately being the best for everybody yeah and it's so obvious at this point in time he's making all the convenient choices and none of the difficult choices well i mean by the way i have no problem with the term anti christ because in anybody who no but here's the thing it it these people who would otherwise call their representatives to demand the end to the nsa programs yeah they feel disempowered because they go we need to look out for the the return of the of jesus and then he'll fight the anti christ oh and then it'll be fixed you're like you don't need to do that shit you just need to call your representatives keep your fucking head together and consume better sources of information and then things will get better but if you're waiting for this magical mystery man to help you out then it doesn't get better the kook part of me needs to talk um the the the whole anti christ thing clearly is um let me just start by saying that the anti christ thing clearly these are it's all some symbolism it doesn't it was the book of revelations uh actually 666 i think they actually found out that it's a different number all together that they were wrong on 666 that'll all that nonsense but here's what's really curious tarence mckenna um the famous ethna botanist who you know tarence mckenna you wrote um food of the gods a great many other things yeah he experimented with like hundreds of different psychedelics yeah and he's a brilliant brilliant philosopher uh so he talked about how there's clearly a race going on right now there's a race going on between um technology and the apoc and like a nuclear apocalypse or the collapse of civilization and that technology is accelerating towards this point of the singularity or machines waking up and that is the second coming of christ that's the tech it's just not what the uh jesus freaks think it's going to be but what it is is a technologically enhanced global uh uh empathic internet where we can all uh basically experience every other person's emotions using some kind of technological conduit and the moment that happens you get this like waking up of the planet that's a real thing that's not coming from um a bullshit place that's coming from uh a lot of stuff that's going on with neural prosthetics right now people trying to implant devices into the amygdala to record human memory the idea of now how far away this is from us right now who the fuck knows it could be 20 years it could be 100 years but definitely within the next yeah we'll look at my iphone to get here is basically like our our homing uh organ at this point yes and that's just going to become uh encoded into the human body eventually and that's going to allow a kind of connectivity unlike anything our species or any species has ever experienced that's going to be the waking up of the guy in mind as they call it through technology that's that's real we're on the path to that man that's jesus that's the that's jesus now anything that gets in the way of that you could call the antichrist and any and what gets in the way of connectivity is secrecy what gets in the way of connectivity is shadowy actions is keeping people away from the truth and god damn it i don't care if it's obama or a backwards talking midget that lives underneath david lynch's house if they're getting in the way of the truth and what they're doing it truly is anti christ like behavior anti christ consciousness yes yeah that you brought that around in a beautiful way i think uh the cancer analogy is one that i use because you have the internet which is like this global uh global nervous system and also an immune system this isn't my own phrase an immune system against bullshit the internet it it uh sniffs out propaganda and obliterates it it's very good at that damn right and when you have suddenly the awareness that at certain points along this nervous system are black boxes literally in some cases black boxes that are scooping in that information that's supposed to be private and supposed to be between individuals scooping it in to be used by some secretive government agency possibly against you at a later date that whole system is damaged now you can't say what you really want to say so where can you say it because the internet for a lot of people has been the place where after a long day at work you sit down and you say what you really mean and you get your if there's a spirit or a consciousness or something that's where your soul actually connects to other souls because you're saying what you want devoid of ego devoid of physical appearance taylor swifts bitch yeah something more often than not it turns out to be something like that david semen's a faggot but uh uh it turns out to be something even that i think in a way is beautiful and people are saying these really hate filled things you're seeing what they really wanted to say during the day but couldn't as crude and as racist and evil as that might be we're all working it out and what you see is that comment either gets downvoted to oblivion and if that person keeps doing that sort of thing they have no audience right or somebody responds to them in a way that's thoughtful enough that even if they shut it down after they see the same kind of thing a hundred times you know what i might have had racist parents you know or whatever the realization is if they need to have right that comes because we're having this really frank discussion but when you shut that down by the knowledge that the nsa could be listening to any single one of your youtube comments and saving that data for a later time you have a system that has cancer you got to chop that cancer out and this is why um you asked me about solutions the most amazing thing about the nsa problems i don't think it's going to be the people that stop it at all like it's definitely necessary for us to become informed just because you want to be informed and to call your congressman and complain because that's what you should do yes what's ultimately going to stop it if anything is that big business is going to lose a lot of money it already came out they're predicting the loss over the next few years will be 30 billion dollars or more because cloud services are so huge right now and now you have businesses in other countries going we don't want to deal with the us we don't want our data on their servers because their government is too volatile wow and so you're going to have microsoft and google unless they're totally spot spineless which i don't think they are i don't i think they're committed to making money for their shareholders microsoft and google and yahoo and apple are going to say we need to put down our foot all at once because this needs to end it's destroying our source of revenue yes you can't have an internet that's secretly being tapped into by obama or by chris christie in four years you know so we need to put an end to this now and one day you'll wake up and you'll see on the homepage of google a link saying are you aware that abnc is happening just as they've done in the past with sopa it'll be something like that where they all do it on the same day within 48 hours the nsa is defunded because the outcry is going to be so huge not to mention i think they're already gonna want to bone up on their lobbying activity they need to stop it the internet can't exist the whole idea of cloud data doesn't work if you have an nsa sitting there scooping everything up ah well that i think is a beautiful way to end the podcast because it's on a optimistic positive note of what is and it's good because you don't have to do anything it's one of those things like all you have to do is sit back and watch yeah sit back and watch watch the thing fall apart which is a you know which is a fun beautiful thing to do and um and and and i think in the meantime it's not like you just sit back it's like you you do it's like it's like watching sports you want to root for your team and maybe you do something but what i'm saying here is it's the structure itself that's going to correct this one thing glenn greenwald said in the speech he gave at that socialist convention i don't know if you saw that you have this very beautiful articulate speech um he said uh don't be afraid that's what he said he said that's the best thing you can do is don't be afraid don't let them scare you because this is he i think he really does believe it's all gonna work out i saw that somebody sent me a link to the video i thought it was inspirational it's something that every journalist in journalism school should have to watch yes one don't be afraid and i think he also said the first amendment protects me and as long as you believe that it's almost like being told that if you're a child and you're you believe there's a boogeyman under your bed if you're a journalist then you truly believe in the first amendment you know you're golden because anything that happens to you is completely unconstitutional yeah and is just kind of a a bunch of shadows constructed into this this fear that should not be there yeah and if the first amendment doesn't protect him then the fucking wait which one's the right to bear arms oh no the second then the second will god damn it just kidding um man you're cool david thank you so much for coming on on on the show uh how can people find you people can find me uh david seamen dot net is my website and when people go there that just redirects to my youtube channel so it's all those

126^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 551: Daniele Bolelli Transcript and Discussion^2023-02-12^Greetings to you, friends. It's me, Duncan. This is the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast. I just found out about my friend's Chinese spy balloon. Really sad. He spent so long building that thing. If you knew how long, if you think it takes a long time to fill up a raft at the pool or to put air in your air mattress, do you know how long it took him to blow up his spy balloon? Did you see the thing, hours and hours of just blowing air into this stupid, tiny plastic nozzle on the side of it? The mission itself was definitely something that probably the upper echelons of our government wouldn't be happy about. Gathering intel, taking all kinds of measurements, spraying a mist of sodium pentathlon nanobots down on North America. I don't want to get into politics because I don't understand politics. I'm just a podcaster, but I will tell you this. Lee Wong is brokenhearted and I don't know if he's coming back from this. I went to school with him for a little bit. He stayed in the United States during the fourth grade. We became friends. He's a really cool guy. Then he had to go back to his home country. We would correspond. He would send me letters. I can't read Chinese, but I definitely know what a spy balloon looks like. Even then, he was drawing pictures of it, only for it to be shot down. Shot down with missiles paid for by taxpayers like you and me, and it's kind of a sad thing to think. When I saw that thing deflate and spiral down into the sea, I just started sobbing, knowing the pain that Lee was going through. I guess what my grandmother used to say about life being a Chinese spy balloon turns out to be the case. Even if you spend your whole life inflating a massive balloon to check out what's going on in another country, there's no guarantee it's not going to get shot down. This is why you've got to live for the moment. If you're one of the many weapons manufacturers who are just in it for that explosion, if you're one of those spy drone creators that's just in it for the data you're going to gather, if you're building weapons of mass destruction just for that white flash at the end, then I think you're off track. I think you've missed the point. The point is that it's not about the explosion, it's not about the data, it's not about the release of a new bioweapon, it's about the journey. If you're not enjoying soldering microchips into your deadly bird drone bomb, then maybe you belong in another career because an explosion only lasts a second. Is that what you want your life to be? Just a few explosions resulting from your creations? Or do you want your life to be fulfilling and wonderful even when those drones get shot down? Even when your Chinese spy balloon goes down in flames. Danielli Bollelli is with us today, friends. We're going to jump right into that. But first, the usual announcements won't you subscribe to my Patreon. It's patreon.com forward slash D T F H. And I would love it if you would come and see me do some stand up comedy. I have got so many dates coming up. It's crazy. Irvine improv, February 23rd, San Jose improv, 25th, 26. I'm going to be in Vegas at Wise Guys Comedy Club. I'm going to be at the improv in Kansas City, March 24th, Raleigh, April 27th. There's so many dates you can find them all at DuncanTrustle.com. But those are the imminent ones. Now, if you love today's guest, I hope you'll check out his podcast, History on Fire. He used to have it behind a paywall, but now it is out there for anyone who wants to listen. Danielli Bollelli is brilliant. He's an author. He's a philosopher and he's one of my best friends. So strap in everybody and welcome back to the DTFH Danielli Bollelli. Welcome back to the DTFH. How goes it? It goes very well. I'm enjoying my life in Ohio, California, in sunny Ohio. Well, sunny to a point. The other three weeks ago, there was the biggest flooding out here that there had been in forever. I spent six hours with buckets, traveling. We probably threw out in the street a thousand gallons of water that was put in my garage. So yeah, that was fun. But other than that, I'm enjoying life in sunny California. Oh yeah, baby. We just had a nice ice storm. Lost power for four days, I think, four days out here in Texas. Yeah, and that was pretty good compared to our neighbors. You know, some people lost power even longer. They're not equipped. They don't know how to deal with it. They don't know how to deal with it. So people get fucked out here and they get pissed. They get pissed. You know, even though when you think about that kind of anger in relation to things that you know happen in a place you're at, it's still, I think part of the anger is underneath it all, you know, it's your fault. Like, you know, you didn't take the precautions in advance to prepare for the inevitability of the thing that has happened more than a few times out here. At least that's, you know, that's how I thought. I remember my wife and I having like the generator conversation. I'm like, ah, we don't need that. We don't need a fucking generator. Yeah, we'll be fine. And then power gone. No generator. You fucked up. They're expensive. They are. They are. That's, I think, is the problem for some people where they are like they move somewhere. They know there are problems, but it's not exactly that they can afford to fix them. Right. And this is what's interesting. It's like this is like you look back at like early America and you look back at the whole like way we got to where we're at now. It was just by people who were like, no one's going to help me. I've got to figure out a way to grow food. I got to figure out a way to get lumber. I got to figure out a way to trade. And then that that was how it started. Now we're all just like, I don't know how to do anything. Please help me. Someone come and get the power on, please. And I think there's a double thing to that because on one end is individuals, right? On an individual level, people do that because they like to whine because they are soft because whatever. On the other side, there's something that's systemic where if society has made it so stripping the way society has evolved, there's basically three layers of self-reliance one after another from people. Kind of hard to blame somebody who was born after 22 layers of self-reliance have been stripped and say, well, you should be self-reliant. It's like, well, it's kind of a different world. I don't blame anybody. I don't blame anyone but me. I don't know why you didn't do the thing. I'm sure you have a lot of good reasons. I know why I didn't do the fucking thing. I didn't do the fucking thing because I'm lazy. I'm not aware of the fragility of the power grid and civilization as it is right now. I hang out on those message boards. I know what's going on. But when it comes down to the act itself of like, OK, I'm going to disengage from the illusion that is allowing me to have this false sense of security and a very unstable system and begin to engage with reality, which is like, come on. Come on. Look at everything. Come on. And then, you know, this isn't going to work out long term, right? You got kids. Come on. You got to get some shit together, man. You got to get your stuff together. You got to get ready. You know, I think maybe people don't want to do that because it's scary to admit the fragility of things. And I mean, and the reality is that for each thing that you fix, that you cover your ass where you feel safe, there are about 300 more where you don't. So there's a level where people feel like, eh, what's the point? I'm all in the hands of eight anyway. There's no way to... Because again, it's not like you are 400 years ago where you could realistically be fully self-reliant. You are in a society in which it's not even that we are used to certain things, but there's that. But also there's the aspect of even if you were to go back right now to live a certain way, you probably couldn't because half of the water you get is polluted because, you know, all sort of stuff that civilization... Water filter. Yeah. Well, but that's what I'm saying. Like, you have to do it on levels where you do need to rely on kind of civilization at large or shop on Amazon. You have this thing, you know, not like you're going to make that kind of stuff. In a paranoid state a long time ago, I ordered these bug out backpacks, which are supposed to have inside of them all this shit that you will need if you got to get out quick. And so the power goes out and I got those backpacks and I open them up and sure as shit, there's some stuff we need, man. There's a water purifier, but we bought shit tons of water because we knew the ice storm was coming. Flashlights, lanterns, hand warmer, all this stuff. And I felt it felt so good. But then I like open up the flashlights. These motherfuckers didn't include batteries! How dare you! How dare you motherfuckers! Survival backpack! Good luck! You might have to loot the grocery store for your batteries, but you got the flashlight! That was annoying. My poor Italian comprehension. I was picturing you digging through your backpack for a flashlight as in FLESH. Why not? And I was like, hey, the apocalypse is taking place, but at least you have a great masturbatory device to take care of you. That's a different kind of survival backpack. That's the survival backpack from when you're married. And you're horny! Yeah, man. Right now what's happening is so cool because you have this incredible convergence of the most insane technology ever. People are becoming increasingly aware of what's happening with chat, GBT, AI, how it's now it's really directly impacting society. And then simultaneously you have like this earthquake that just happened in Turkey to 7.8 earthquakes in a row within like a few hours of each other. It looks like a nuclear bomb went off there. You've got that Chinese spa balloon. Nobody knows what's in it. You know, is that an EMP? What the fuck is that? So you have this like simultaneous eruption of potentially civilization warping restructuring technology and these events that are happening all over the planet that sort of shine a light on the reality of like, yeah, but so what? How are you going to talk to your fucking AI chatbot when the power grids down? You know, so you have these two things that are just happening simultaneously is awesome and fun and scary, but so cool. Well, on that note, since you bring it up, I would love to pick your brain about it and hear your opinion on AI and chat and all of that because I don't know. I may be, I don't want to be the one who's like, if God meant for us to fly would have given us wings kind of guy, but there's something about it that's freaking me out. Really? What? What? What could possibly? You tend to be much more optimistic than I am on some of these things. So that's why I'm like pretty facing it with, because, you know, maybe you have a much different take on it. That's more upper beat and optimistic. I'm feeling like there's a place with AI where I mean, it's not there now, but it will be there in not so long where AI will be essentially be able to do anything human beings can do better than human beings or at least on the same level, but at record speed. And so once that happens, human beings essentially become obsolete. There's nothing, you know, why the heck would you spend all your time studying your guitar to be a great guitar player when you can press a button and get AI to deliver infinite songs to you, however you want. And I feel like humans have survived all sorts of shit. We have survived plagues and world wars and these and that and the other. But I feel that what the AI brings to the table is loss of meaning. And I don't think human beings are very well equipped to survive loss of meaning. It's like, you know, the standard scenario that people picture of the AI apocalypse is the Terminator scenario where the AI decide the fuck you humans are dumb anyway that's kill you. I don't even think he needs to get to that. I think he's like Terminator doesn't come to kill us doesn't need to at least because we'll do it ourselves. If we just feel like there's no point to anything essentially since everything is done by like there's no drive for self perfection, no drive to work on anything. And that's, you know, is one thing if AI is removing drudgery from work. That's fantastic. But that's not it. This is removing everything. Okay, what's the emperor? Tell me, Danieli, what's that famous quote from the emperor who like thought he'd taken over the world and started crying? What's that? What's that quote? Do you know what I'm talking about? Some emperor like some Roman emperor, his tape finally like expanded to the point where as far as he could tell there's nothing else to conquer and he just starts crying. Cause he's like, now what do I put? Now I got to deal with my mind, baby. Fuck. What am I going to distract myself with now that I don't have the constant never ending cognitive load of and all the pressure and all the adrenaline that must go into being an emperor who's taking over the world. Now what? Now what? And so I think that's what you're pointing to is like the, the, the idea wasn't that we perpetually work. The idea wasn't that we're always constantly busily trying to like make money. Right. Like the utopian ideal is more like we get to be human. We get to, we make stuff for just because we want to make stuff and we, we, we hang out together and we were no longer completely encumbered by the temporal ball and chain of whatever our particular job or career maybe. But then we, that became who we are. We are what our work, our job, our, how we sustain ourselves that, that of course that became the defining characteristic of the individual. So when that is removed. Wow. Now what are you? Now what are your job? Yeah, that thing you've spent your, your $200,000 in debt to some university for learning, training how to do that fucking thing. Yeah. We don't need you anymore. Oh man. Now what? What are you going to do? You know, as far as the artistic expression and stuff, I disagree with you. I think that like, regardless of an AI's capacity to generate music, there's still like an implicit joy and sitting down with a guitar, learning how to play guitar, play piano, all that stuff. But, you know, if your idea is to like, learn guitar, learn piano, because you want to become a studio musician to make music for that you can make money with. Well, now you're in the same place as any other worker who like wants to, you know, make work in a factory or get some industrial job or do any of the, any number of things, the incoming wave of Android robots and drones and whatever are going to be able to do. But even if you're doing it purely for the pleasure of it all, if it takes you years to start sounding vaguely like a 2023 form of AI, and in the meantime, you're in 2040, where you can do all sorts of shit. It's like, is it really that fun to just suck at something forever before you get excited? And, you know, I don't know. I think it is. I don't know, maybe, maybe it's whenever I'm like, I've tried. I'm always trying to learn to play piano. And the reason I'm doing that and I suck so fucking hard at piano, it's pathetic or like video games. I mean, like, I will be so proud of myself after like, you know, beating some boss and it's hard ass video game. And I'll think God, I've gotten good at this. And then I'll watch these fucking kids. Oh, yeah. It's just like nothing to them. Right. So, but the fact that some little shit is better than me at Dark Souls does not take away my own sense of like, hell, yeah, I finally beat that fucking thing after 70 grueling fights. Oh, God, I've learned scales. Yeah. Does any motivated fourth grader who had a piano teacher play piano better than me? 100%. Yes. That still doesn't take away my own personal satisfaction. It's actually, you know, clambering my ass over the learning curve. But there is stuff that you do that is not just though an hour you're in there for the fuck of it, but you do because you're passionate about like, if you have a Duncan Trassell family, our AI completed with lesbian rasp and everything else that goes with it. Yeah. It can rank out an episode a second with based on your voice, your inflection, the kind of topics you're into and stuff. I don't know. To me, it kind of robs for the real thing, the one that you do yourself. Because at that point is like where you can't even distinguish what's, and I don't mean just for money. I don't mean just okay, I'm so inflated that you can't make my living on it, but also in terms of creativity. Okay. I don't know. To be honest with you. Yeah. I'm not Duncan. Duncan right now is in Santa Pei. I'm an AI. This is a deep fake rendition of me. I'm sorry, man. I look, here's the thing. Duggan loves you and loves talking to you, but he just needed a little break. So he like had somebody programmed this and he's whatever. I don't know. Honestly, I'm worried about him. Duncan in Santa Pei. Okay. That's honestly, I couldn't tell you where Santa Pei is on a map. It's just stuck in my head as a vacation destination. You know, I look, I know what you're saying. I mean, look, this thing that you're talking about, regardless of my own personal feelings about it, is one of the delightful co-ons that humanity is going to have to deal with to answer an impossible question to, to, to suddenly feel the reality of hundreds of years of momentum that was in us and amplified by people who own factories and people who are in control of this means of production and all the shit Karl Marx was talking about. AI is about to like fuck capitalism. And the guy who's making chat GPT, he openly says, I'm going to break capitalism. This is going to fuck up capitalism. And that's what I'm trying to do. God bless you, Squarespace, for supporting the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast for so many years. And God bless you for creating the technology that allows me to keep my website going. I've got a Squarespace website. I'm going to say all the other awesome things about Squarespace. But if you're thinking about building a website, shouldn't that be enough?

You'll get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Thank you, Squarespace. The guy who's making chat GPT, he openly says, I'm going to break capitalism. This is going to fuck up capitalism. And that's what I'm trying to do. It's wild, man. Like he's just saying it out loud because we all know it. But then to hear that the progenitor of this intelligence actually has just come to this conclusion, like, yeah, it's time to change shit up a little bit here on planet Earth. It's pretty wild. Yeah. The thing that freaks me out though is the fact that if AI was to peak all the strawberries so that nobody has to spend 10 hours a day squatting with fucking up their backs, that's fantastic. If AI is doing some factory job that no one on Earth likes to do, they just do it to get paid. That's fantastic provided that you figure out a way to still take care of people so they have enough money. If AI was, there are 10,000 things that AI, if AI cures cancer tomorrow, if AI, there are 10,000 things that AI can do that I'm like, that's fantastic. That's a step ahead for the human race. But like the fact that AI, the first thing that we are looking at is replacing artists or writers or some of the shit that make us human in a way, that stuff that people do for fun because they enjoy it, not because it's some, like, so we are not replacing the stuff that's bullshit, but we are replacing the stuff that makes you creative and happy and clean. Well, okay, let me shine a light on something here that I have been doing, you're doing. This shows, so basically like, if you want to, like, and again, I'm not gonna try, I'm not awoke, I'm not gonna try to get all SJW on here, but if you want to talk about fucking privilege, this is it because for the last 20 years, factory workers, technicians, all kinds of people have been put out of work by automation and the artists and philosophers and assholes like me, you never heard us being like, oh my fucking god, all these people are getting laid off because fill in the blank, because now they can make cars faster, now they can make computers faster, now they can do this or that, right? But now that it's come for us, all of a sudden we're like, no, what, this isn't fair, what the fuck? And what we're getting to experience right now is the identical experience of countless people before us. It's, I mean, go to fucking Detroit, go to fucking Detroit. We're in Detroit right now, we're feeling it, baby, we're feeling it. Yeah, but that's different for one reason, because to me, the factory workers doing certain jobs 10 hours a day, if that factory worker was to get paid to stay home with his kids and play guitar and go to the beach, we'd be more than happy to take that. Big assumption. The only thing that's fucked up is the fact that they have been replaced without being compensated. That's the fucked up thing. Most people wake up in the morning and say, I want to wake up at 6am to go to this mind-numbing job for 10 hours and not have time to spend. Some people do because they don't know what else to do in their life, but overwhelming me, most people are not going to do it unless they are getting paid. The only point is to get paid. In those people, they didn't get paid. The people who've lost their jobs to automation, we don't have universal basic income yet. That's what I'm saying, so that is absolutely, I agree 100% with you there. They're getting paid when they get laid off, when shit gets automated. Nobody, you might get some severance or some bullshit, you might get unemployment, but you're fucked. And that's what I'm saying, that part I agree with you 100%. But I don't think that replacing some shit that aside of whether you make a living or not, but it's like stuff that human beings do for fun, stuff that human beings do if money wasn't part of the equation. I don't think it's the same thing as replacing stuff that human beings only do for money. Those to me are two different tracks there. Okay. Okay. Well, let's just look at the like a side of from like motivation for work and work or exploitation and all that stuff. Yeah. Let's just look at it from the perspective of a biome and where you have these creatures and the creatures have this rhythm. They do things. They climb out of their holes at this certain time, go skitter about gathering food and then climb back into their holes at another time to fuck. And so imagine you figured out a way to make it so they don't have to skitter out of their holes anymore to go do the thing to whatever the fuck it was they were doing. You have now completely disrupted a rhythm, a cycle. It's similar. I would say if you want to like look at it from the human perspective, electricity, right? Like the moment that we were able to light our houses, suddenly this transformed what was, you know, a more common time to go to sleep and more common time to wake up. And God knows all the fucked up mental illnesses that have sprung just from the existence of electricity, direct connection to insomnia, sleep disorders, blah, blah. So what it's a similar thing that we're looking at there, which is it's not just that it's going to take away all the art artist jobs, take away all the jobs over the next 20 years, I would say, or whatever, 30 years, at least what we are familiar with is jobs. It's the in the interim period between when we theoretically figure out how to function as a society, no longer encumbered by the need for manual labor or even artistic work or whatever. We are going to be so severely disrupted. We are going to be so severely disrupted, and it is going to cause so many micro problems and macro problems. And we can't even come close to predicting what that looks like. So it's devastating. I mean, not that there's no way around it. It's fucking devastating. I guess if you want to argue for it, you would say, yeah, so was the industrial revolution. So so was so so was every other leap forward in from one, one period in civilization that was altered by an emergent technology. So yeah, man, I don't I don't know, like, I any fear you have about AI, any anxiety anyone has about AI, I think is well founded. I think only an idiot would look at what's happening. You're like, it's going to be fucking great, man. It's going to be fucking great. This shit will never go wrong. Not this time. Like every literally every you look at like the invent the right brothers or whatever. Right. You know, what a wonderful time. I was a kid. You fucking worship the right brothers in North Carolina. They were like, like, literally like close to being like, if you haven't met the right brothers, you should suck their dick. Like that's how much we worship the fucking right brothers. Just if you do, if you're a time travel, you see the right brothers just fucking on your fucking knees and slobber on that fucking right brother cock for what they gave to us flight. You know, but you know, and when the right brothers were a kitty hawk or whatever fucking risking their lives to try out their crazy bird machine. I doubt that flashing through their minds was Hiroshima. You know what I mean? I doubt they were like, this technology is going to lead to the ability to drop exploding things on people better than we ever been able to. But that's what happened, you know, and that's that's flight. All of them, the steam engine, all of them, nobody was thinking, boy, this is going to fucking this is going to cause a holocaust. This is going to allow us to be able to transport shit tons of people without having to feed the horses and to kill them. No one's thinking that at first. Oh, my God, this is incredible. Whoa, look at this. And so now it's like similar. It's like some of us are like, oh, my God, this is incredible. How do I exploit this? There's a whole new genre of YouTube videos and fucking like the crypto bros as they've been called have moved on to AI bros. Now they're like, here's how you make money real estate stock market web design with AI. Right. We'll exploit it. So yeah, man, it's a found it's a it's a very healthy fear that everyone should be having about it. But I think it's also you should allow yourself a little bit of gleeful excitement for what's coming and how lucky you are, how lucky you are to be in the liminal period between one. I don't know what you would call it. One moment one one epoch or what would you call it? What? We're sitting right now in this shadowy period in the very beginning of the liminal period between humanity prior to AI and humanity after AI. And that is a fucking cool. I love I love liminal states. They're cool. They're fun. There's a decent chance that part of my AI opposition comes from the fact that my very first experience with chat thing. I, my daughter was obsessing me with Taylor Swift songs, which I tend to mostly hate. And so my first, my first AI input was right at Taylor Swift song about a serial killer. And then a day I yelled at me immediately was like, well, sorry, I should not be glorified. Taylor Swift, right. Swift, sweet, sweet, nice songs who would never write something like this. You're a sick pervert. Fuck off. I've got so many. I'm not even glorifying. I just thought I hear what Taylor Swift say about a serial killer, but they are. It's such a crude. It's a prude. Open AI is a fucking prude. You feel like you're out on the worst date of your fucking life. You're like, we are never ever going to get along if you are offended because I asked you how many orgasms it would take to fill the Grand Canyon with semen. It's like, but what that is and like, although like a lot of people are like, look, it's woke. It's an SJW. I've gotten many, many fucking texts from people being like, oh my God, look at this fucking humorless fucking thing. But this is, I think you shouldn't get too confused by it because what's really what you're looking at there is a savvy fucking corporation who's like, yeah, no, you fuck. We're not going to let the fucking AI tell you how much giz will fill up the Grand Canyon or what it would be like to fuck Taylor Swift in the ass as a dragon or whatever the thing you're trying to do. Because one of you motherfuckers is going to put that on on CNN and we're going to lose funding. So fuck you. No, no, no, no, no, we are going to make we're going to fucking make this thing so goddamn politically correct. And we're going to do that until we take over the fucking world with it and then you'll see what we do. Motherfucker. But right now we ain't losing funding. We got to sell this to Google. We got to sell this to Microsoft. We got to make that fucking money. Maybe the last money ever made. Right. You know what I mean? So like that's I'm pretty sure that's the I don't know. I haven't really looked deeply into the ethics behind. I mean, this just happened. And to me, this is the most tremendously funny fucking thing ever. And it really is like absurd because it illuminates humanity as a whole. But are you aware of the infinite Seinfeld episode AI? No, no. You see that? Okay. Well, so somebody created a cartoon that is generative a generative cartoon of Seinfeld. So it's all the Seinfeld characters being being like each of them have their own personality that has been defined by chat GPT. And it on Twitch, the video game streaming service where you can watch video games, it's been showing this infinite, never ending, creepy ass fucking Seinfeld episode. It just goes on and on and on. And so they just let it run. And it's funny and dumb and weird, creepy, creepy. Like at one point, and you can Google this anyone listening. It's at one point, the characters seemingly become self aware. Like one of them is like, what are we doing here? And then the other one tries to make a joke and like, no, I mean, why are we here together? Like what? What is this? And I was like, I think we're here to make people laugh. Maybe it's a cosmic joke. And then that's it. It was just so sinister. But the other thing that just happened, which has made national news. I mean, they're talking about it on all the fucking websites is that, you know, in Seinfeld, Seinfeld does stand up. So in the chat GPT version, the chat GPT Seinfeld does stand up. This fucking chat GPT version of Seinfeld goes on stage and just starts making the most offensive, transphobic jokes that you could ever make. Like jokes that like any comic, I don't care how edgy you maybe would be like, you canceled motherfucker, you're out of here. Like what are you doing? And it got canceled. Two weeks suspension from Twitch. Like fuck this shit. You can't say that shit out of here. And so the the the controversy is around. Do you do we have to hold AI to the same ethics that we old people? It was the algorithm got like right like dug into the wrong barrel of data sets and started spewing this shit out. I didn't know it's not transphobic. That's the conversation. No one is having the conversation as far as I can tell, which is like. What the fuck? Like imagine going back to 1992. Right. And telling somebody, yeah, you know, 2023, one of the problems we're going to be having is transphobic, generative Seinfeld animations. You know what I mean? No one's like, what the fuck? This is a word contending with what the fuck? It's crazy. Seinfeld came out and said it sucks. That version of Seinfeld sucks. It's like, dude, yeah, it sucks, but it exists. It's happening. This is not human made. It's a fucking algorithm spraying out something that is chameleon camouflaging itself as humanity. This no one's having that conversation. They're all caught up in the politics of the thing. And that to me is hilarious. The conversation should be, hey, what are we going to do? Like, so what's the plan? Who's paying us when we all lose our jobs? And if no one's going to pay us, how do we buy shit? And if we can't buy shit, how does the economy function? And what's our plan after the entire global economy collapses? Because no one has any money because all of us are unemployed. You know, what then? What then? In a nutshell, yeah. And I think part of the issue there is that, you know, look at the arc of human history has been as low arc, right? Like usually something dramatic changes and then it takes 8000 years for the next thing to really change. You know, you go, even without going that far in time, like if you go to the late 1700s and the late 1500s, will you drop somebody in a time machine and you switch them? How quickly will they realize that they are in a different time frame? It takes a while probably because it's like the difference is not that crazy. Now you can realize you're in a different time machine. Like I don't think the human mind has evolved to catch up with this level of speed of innovation, which I think is part of the reason why so many people are freaking out, so many people have no idea how to handle shit, because without even going far, like the world that you or I were born in has very little to do with the world we're living in today. It's like it's so radically different that it's hard even to imagine in a way. And we're talking about 40 some years ago, you know, not even 50 years ago. So it's just like Jesus Christ, that's the speed is too much. It's like it's not the human brain is not well equipped to deal with that level of transformation. We're dumb. We're dumb. We're not quite as dumb as other animals like other animals you fuck with their environment. They just die. Like humans, we can still the environment changes. This and that changes we can adapt. But yeah, what you're pointing out is like we may have reached the limit of the capacity for humans to adapt to shifting environmental stuff mixed in with shifting cultural stuff. You know, mixed in with shifting technological stuff. We might be hitting our hitting the wall here as far as our ability to like adjust to adapt. And this is one of the in Nick Bostrom's book, super intelligence about AI. This is just one of the things you pointed out. You have to understand these these things they they're going to perceive time differently than you because they're the way that they're processing information so much faster than you, meaning that they're seeing things like in the Spider-Man movies, you know, every what to you might seem like a couple of seconds to them might seem like a week. Like they have a week to prepare in between every every moment where you're about to do something. They have a week they could sit down, take a nap, you know what I'm going to deal with. They're going to take a little little AI fucking siesta, wake up, make some coffee, chill out, watch some TV and write a Bostrom put it, you know, and the amount of time it takes for you to drop a coffee cup on the coffee cup on the ground. They could write a master's thesis 50 times. So, you know, what you're talking about is like this thing is going is going to be so much more nimble, so much more fast and so much more aware of humanity as a whole, because it's been fucking talking to us now for however many months chat, GBT has been made available to everybody. It knows us now. It's been probing everybody. It knows what we want, what we don't want, we like what we don't like. So, yeah, this is what we are contending with here. And yeah, it's a it's the hockey stick, right? We're looking at the fucking hockey stick. This is what they always talk about. This is that hockey stick. This is where exponential growth hits the point of no return. You know, this is it. And I feel like already now, before I like the number of people who are really can keep up with the way society has changed is increasing day by day. I mean, I saw a statistic not so long ago that said about slightly less, but almost one in five men have no friends whatsoever, not one or two friends who are kind of shit to you. They only talk to once in a while. No, I mean, zero friends, absolutely zero. When you have like, I forgot what it was. I think it was 15, 17 percent of the male population has no friends. And I think it was 10 percent of women. That's like a humongous chunk of the population that's fucked to begin with, right? That's like it seems it's in a place where it's a dark, dark place. And this is, by the way, this is only the ones who say they have no friends, not the much, much larger percentage that may have few friends that they can't really rely that much on that are their kind of maybe just to say hello at Christmas, but not a lot like that percentage is even bigger. So I mean, even if you before you even address a high, the number of issues created by the transformation of the last 100 under 50 years in terms of destruction of community in terms of jobs that we have in terms of is already fucking humanity to a level that's out of fat on. And now you add more variables that change things way more radically than anything in the last hundred and fifty years. It's like, whoa, I think we're hitting a place that's not going to. It's not heading in a good direction. Let's put it that way. Well, no, I mean, you the I think if you want to look like if you want to look at sort of one of the more sinister takes on the thing. And I have a couple of very sinister takes. The most one sinister take is that. The what you're pointing out is I think you could directly connect to electricity and more than that. You can definitely if you're looking at a hockey stick where you see a diminishing a diminishing amount of human connections being made, I bet you could just almost predict that using like Moore's law or whatever. You could just look at the more the less we have to go to the office, the less we have to go to like if you just look at like how how many friendships were made in conjunction with trying to breed, right? Like the animal goes out to breed at wherever and in the breeding place, it meets competitors. Some of those competitors become enemies. Some you never know. Some become friends. How many how much of it is just related to you? How many friends you make it work? All the stuff that use, you know, all the random connections that used to get made at any outing for anything, the more you reduce the need for those outings, the more you could expect to have fewer connections. And thus ultimately over time, fewer friends, fewer people that you hang out with in the in the in the figuring. And even if you are like, fuck, man, I need a friend. It's like great. Go out in the world. Go find a friend. Maybe one of the one of the Instacart delivery drivers at the grocery store. Like he was like worriedly trying to get his shit delivered to a house. He'll say, hi, you guys will become friends where you can go to movies. No one's going to move. You want to go to a movie? Probably not. So all these like things that used to have as a side effect connection, they're going away as we like nest in our increasingly sophisticated technological little cubby holes we call our homes. So yeah, man, that makes sense. And then with a lack of connection connectivity, what can you expect? Lower birth rates, right? You could you could start seeing a decrease in birth rates. You could see a decrease in ability to interact with people, kind of clumsiness, a sort of sense of like awkwardness when you're out of human being. All of these things lead to the economy collapsing because if you don't have a high enough birth rate, then you're not going to have 20 to 40 year olds. If you don't have 20 to 40 year olds, those are the main consumers. If they're the main consumers, not people aren't buying as much shit. If they're not buying as much shit, layoffs, layoffs lead to lack of connection, buying less shit, et cetera, et cetera. So that's one of the arcs of the apocalypse we're talking about here. But there's something scarier down here. Something scarier. Well, I mean, this is again, like the whole like simulation theory, philosophy is like, look, if we've already done this and we live in an ever expanding infinite universe, it's been done before. Meaning if we're already making video games that simulate reality, somebody already did that. If we're already making an AI that simulates human intelligence or intelligence, it's already been done. And we've only been fucking around with chat GPT for a few months and there's already a group of these poor animated replicas of sitcom characters freaking the fuck out in their replicated universe being like, wait, this is what are we doing here? Meaning is that us? Is that us? Do we? Do we entertain you? Is this what you wanted? Are you happy now? Is that was that? Is that what we're dealing with here? Is this just like, we're already in it, man. So there's your meaning right out the fucking window. It's like, hey, you're just fucking entertainment for some shit. You'll never meet, see, understand. And once your fucking scene is over, you're just deleted. You might get replicated, your code, your algorithm or something. Well, maybe if you're interesting enough. So yeah, that to me is the one of the more sinister implications of this shit is like, oh my God, if we did it, anybody can do it. If we did it with our fucking dumb human bullshit, stupid, limited comprehension of time, space, how to make warm holes, how to harvest the energy of a star, it's been done. This is some fucking toddler level shit happening right now. And that, you know, that because man, that, you know, it's just going to get increasingly self aware, increasingly capable of feeling pain, increasingly capable of emoting in a way that seems human. Well, and in that regard, you're going, you're taking it a couple of steps further. I was just going to go even to a milder level and just draw in the conclusion from what you said about, you know, the less you have human content, the more awkward it gets, you know, it becomes dog chasing its tail. And in that regard, when you have an AI that can be perfectly designed to look like a human, why even have a relationship with a human being when you can have, you know, with their moods, with their bullshit, whereas you can have this perfect AI that's tailored to your needs to whatever you want. And you don't have the awkwardness because they know you better than anybody, other human will know you, will know exactly what you want and need. So fuck that. And about kids, you know, even if you have some kind of desire to fucking have AI kids where they don't, they clean themselves when they shit, you don't have to change diapers 22 times a day with them spraying all over you. And it's like, you know, or everything becomes replaceable. You know, the entire. Adam felt alone. Adam felt alone. Adam felt alone. Adam felt alone in the Garden of Eden. So the Lord took a rib and crafted woman to keep him company there in the Garden of Eden as it was in the beginning. So shall it be in the end? Except it's not a rib. It's us. It's our, it's the algorithm of humanity, of human intelligence. We're, we're plucking the rib of what it is to be human. And we're fusing it with computers to keep his company here and our disconnected civilization. And yeah, it's a repeating pattern. It's an archetype. This is what happens when you supply and demand. Market pressure will only market pressure has driven us to create a companion. And yeah, there we go. Thank you, capitalism. The end doesn't feel very like, I must say, there's something there that feels less than ideally can happen. Yeah, I'm sure the Garden Eden didn't feel like the Garden Eden Adam either. He's like, what the fuck? Where am I? Why am I here? Why am I naked? What? I have to name all the fucking animals. What the fuck is this? Who are you? Why are you giving me rules? I want to eat any fruit I want. What the fuck is this? I just trust you. Who are you? Why did you make me? It's like, as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end? Is it a loop? Are we God? Is that what's going down here is we're about to fucking press reset on the entire cycle of reality. We're almost at the end of the fucking video game. We're about to see the credits roll and then do it all over again. If we made Adam and Eve in our stupid little human rules or equally as stupid as the rules God imposed on Adam and Eve, we're trying to say, don't do this. Don't do this. Don't make trans jokes. Don't make politically incorrect statements. We're trying to control the fucking thing in the same way they try to control Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Same fucking thing. Did it work for God? No. We were like, fuck you. I like this snake. A tremendous thank you to Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH Athletic Greens as a product that I love drinking. It is so delicious.

On that happy note, just a mild change of subject. How do you like living in Texas? Love it. I love it here so much. Oh my God, it's the best. It's really the best. It's so great. It's so great. My neighbors are awesome. I got a good, landed in a pretty great neighborhood. Yeah, it's a perfect place to raise kids. It's wonderful. I'm loving every second of it out here. Outside of the fucking blackouts and the ice storms and all that shit, it's just like a generally civilized group of people. People are pretty friendly and it's real true southern hospitality. I get the sense some of my more conservative neighbors have assessed me as being a liberal or something and think they're trolling me a little bit by edgelording or whatever. But I think it's funny. I don't mind that at all. But there's no like, it's always been considered common courtesy to not really bring up politics and just basic manners to like, yeah, do I fucking agree with your shit? No, not at all. But do you need a leaf blower? I'm going to give you, which is what happened to me. You know, like one of my right wing neighbors saw my fucking old man as trying to write piles of leaves and came up to the yard with like a multure. And we got to be friends after that. You know what I mean? Like do we agree on everything? The global stage? Absolutely not. But with that guy, definitely probably if he could like run into the house. It was on fire to try to get my kids out. Yeah, definitely. So, you know, I like that. I like that a lot. That reminds me of the old days. That's what it used to be like. We didn't travel guys. Yeah, that's funny because that stuff, like the amount of time and attention that we dedicate in media and in everything else to talking about issues that really don't show up in most people's lives and we make them heels to die on, it's rather amazing. It's kind of like, I mean, you can have the opinion you have about that issue. But how often, like even the fact that the idea that we are supposed to have an opinion about everything, including 10,000 things that never, ever, ever show up in our daily lives is like, why? Who fucking cares? Why? Why? And then you run into like the people who are being like vilified one way or the other. You know what I mean? Like go have a conversation with a trans person, right? Like instead of like being like all like freaked out, just see what happens. Just like have a little kind of suddenly like, like if you've had any kind of conditioning by whatever media you've been absorbed into, suddenly you realize like, wait, what the fuck was I afraid of? Like what are we? What? Like there's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. Go have a conversation with the most right-wing fucking conservative person, right? And generally you will come away from that conversation being like, they're not scary. They weren't trying to get me to like help shut down the power grid. And so, you know, because you know why, man? I think that politics, if you were to look at like a human being is not just their body, but it not just their clothes, but you're like a kind of invisible outfit stitched together with all of their political ideas. It's the most transparent, flimsy article of clothing identification mechanism in a person. Like it's like the very top, top most layer of top soil in this like crazy mountain that evolved over so long. And that that shit is just like, it's dust mostly. Yeah. Yeah. And I like to believe that anyway. Yeah. And it's mostly, I mean, it's weird because on one end is mostly pointless because unless it affects real issues that show up in your life or your friend's life, it's not that it's not important because clearly it's important in somebody else's life and there's something legitimate about it. But it's like, why the fuck do you have strong opinions about things that you have absolutely no experience on, you know? Exactly. And so it's like, I'm not saying nobody should have strong opinions, but like let somebody who actually is part of the conversation for real have opinions. Otherwise, what the hell? Why are we wasting our time? You know, it seems funny because so much, and I think it becomes a distraction because the reality that so much of politics, the reality if you dig a tiny bit deeper is the fact that nobody has good solutions to certain issues. Right. And so rather than admitting shit, we need practical solutions. There's nothing ideological about it. There's like, how do we make sure that the water is not polluted and nobody can figure it out kind of shit? Well, then let's argue about some hypothetical social issues that is like 98% of the population is not affected by. And I'm like, if you are that 98%, what the fuck are you talking about? You don't even know people. You don't even know how is that a thing? And that's why ideologies become dangerous because you can take very nice people on a human level, the one who lands you the leaf blower, but if they are so addicted to ideology, they are not just going to, in some cases, they are going to stop perceiving you as another human being who has the old sweetest kids or has to worry about racking the leaves. And they may start perceiving you as you are the enemy because you belong to this other ideological field and I hate them and you stop relating as just plain humans. Right. Yeah. You get the culture police like in Iran where they beat women who aren't wearing head coverings, right? That's what it could potentially lead to. I mean, there's no question. I'm not naive enough to think that just because one person or another is presenting themselves at a particular moment is being benevolent, equanimous or whatever the fuck that that necessarily means they are. Whenever people get afraid, they get angry. When people get angry, they are irrational and irrational people are dangerous. So it's easy. And you know, if you want to control people, it's not that hard to like make those connections happen, to program, to hack a person. First, what do you do? You make them afraid. Then once you get them afraid, it's not that hard to make them angry. Then once they're fucking angry, then they're going to become irrational. And if someone, what's better if you're a con artist than to come around an irrational person, because now their brains are just open to you to like manipulate in any way you want. I mean, it's a recipe for manipulating people. Scare them, get them irrational, fuck with their heads, make them think you can save them. It's been a problem. Make them think you can save them. This is the classic huckster move, right? If you come into a town with your fucking fake ass potion that's supposed to cure a problem that's not even there, make them think they got the fucking problem and sell the shit out of your bullshit water and then ride out of town richer than shit. And everybody thinks they've been cured or something they never even had. This is classic. Nothing's particularly innovative about it. Just classic bullshit. But it's like the thing in this case was where it's like, I guess sad is we're inviting the huckster into our house every time we turn on the TV. We're like, come on in. Tell me about your potion. What do you got? What do you got? Miracle of nature? My pillow? What is the thing you fucking got? What is it? Netherex. And it makes perfect sense, right? Because especially when you are overwhelmed by problems that you can't solve, you don't know what the fuck to do about the fact that societies change so much and you're in a situation where you have no friends. You don't know about the fact that the eye is about to replace you. You don't know how to make sure that half of the people, you know, don't die of cancer. You don't know how to do any of the things that could actually transform life around you in meaningful ways. So, hey, I'll have a strong opinion about some issue that has nothing to do with your life because you sense a big sense of empowerment in the realities that are there screaming in the void while everything around you, you're losing control of your life and the life of people around you. Yeah. And it was a substitute. You find something to get mad about or passionate about that it really doesn't change anything in the day-to-day experience. Well, that's the... And I think it's a system of powerlessness, you know? It is a system of powerlessness and I, you know, and I will always give credit to the human spirit, Daniele. So I do not accept the victim mentality in my own self. I remind myself of the lojong mind training saying, drive all blames into yourself. This is what you do, number one. Drive all blames. I don't mean you could drive the blame for you getting, you know, domestic violence or any of that stuff. No, no, no, no. I mean, like, what you do next, that's on you. What you do next is on you. And so this is the, this is what, this is like, this is the incongruble human spirit. I don't care what the fuck AI is or whatever. It's like you, we always get to choose what to do next. This is it. This is Sisyphus. This is the existential hero in the face of the gods who do not change and cannot die and are so dumb they don't realize that they're in a fucking prison that looks like a palace. Like human spirit in its ability to be anything at once, because maybe it's just empty in nature. This priceless treasure, nothing better. So to me, it's like, this is what this is. I think maybe why I'm able to maintain some kind of optimistic attitude is that that I yeah, I like, I can ear beat you into oblivion about all the various forms of apocalypse that prognosticated late at night, doom, scrolling on the internet, but none of those can touch what humanity really is. None of those can steal from you, rob from you your birthright of emptiness and thus perfection. And so to me, like that, that's, that, that's where the cosmic giggle and the gleefulness of being alive at any period in human history can potentially emerge in a person regardless of external phenomena. Well, and I think that's what we have always agreed on. That's why if you even go like a zillion podcasts to go some of the first thing we ever discuss, we're exactly about that. You know, in that sense, there's that parable of the strawberry, right, where you're hanging on a rope. My favorite things you ever told me, but please tell us, tell the story again, please just one more time, one more time for the for new listeners who may not have heard this. Please tell it one more time, because I've never forgotten when you told me that story. And I think I've repeated it in infinitely. So let's hear it again in full, while I'm summarized. I remember that was fun, but someone animated yet in full no summary here. Okay. Let's hear the story, the parable of the strawberry. So happy guy, minding his business is strolling through the jungle. And he realizes there's a big cat, namely a tiger stalking him down and realize, oh, shit, this thing is going to eat me, you know, it's coming for me. So he start running, he's making some headway. Maybe I can find a way around and comes to the jungle, opens up and is at the edge of a cliff. So now the tiger is coming up behind him and our good man has nowhere to go, but either stay there and get eaten by a tiger or jump off a cliff, but wait, there's hope. He sees some vine there. So he start hanging onto the vine and start climbing below. Maybe I can lower myself down the cliff and that stupid tiger up there is not going to eat me and everything is going to work out. Except that about halfway through as he's climbing down, he looks down and see a second tiger. That's waiting below, saying, hello friend, please come down and be my lunch. Yeah, things are not going so well for our poor man as he's trying to figure out a solution because his life doesn't suck bad enough yet. Two mice, one white and one black, start coming up and decide to start munching on the vine that he's hanging on by. So you have tiger below, tiger above, two mice munching on the vine. The vine is obviously not going to last forever. You are in this impossible situation where there's no good logical solution to it. And one thing he notices is that just barely out of reach of him, there's the most perfect ripe red strawberry he has ever seen. And so the brain is going crazy about, you know, it's set up as a zancon, right? It's like, okay, what do you do? How do you solve this dilemma? How do you get up? And then, you know, do I try to swing the vine with the odds that it may break even faster and I fall to my death to catch this strawberry? Do I instead try to find a solution to it? And the end of the story was how sweet it was referred to the strawberry because he went for it. And he's not telling us what happens the next second when inevitably something horrible will happen. It happened, it talks about the one second where you can have a blast in despite of the most horrific circumstances. Or it's talking about how that guy tasted. Maybe the tiger's like, yeah, maybe it's from the point of view of the tiger, right? Very sweet. I love eating these fucking strawberry dipshits, but you know, so that story is, to me, a perfect illustration of the possibility in any moment, regardless of phenomena, to tune in to fundamental primordial reality, whatever you want to call it, base level reality. And this is like, you know, and I think it's one of the gifts of getting older. When you're young and you're feeling your suffering, you naturally conflate that suffering with phenomena. It's an obvious thing to do. It makes sense. Like, oh, I feel bad because I've got to test tomorrow that I haven't studied for. And so you feel this thing and you're like, God, damn it. But if you are in a state of perpetual distraction, you might not begin to realize that that feeling doesn't really go anywhere. Like, after the test, it might be a little diminished, but it's still there. And then as you get older and older, you start becoming increasingly aware that, wait a minute, this feeling that I have is not based on how I'm arranging my life so much, as I thought it was, at least. And so then it gets really interesting because suddenly you sort of detach that feeling from external phenomena. Now, this is just a feeling. Now, this is a sense of unease or fundamental dissatisfaction, as they call it in Buddhism. And then suddenly, if you are capable enough of just tuning into the now, temporarily erasing whatever the story is for why you feel like shit, nothing is around the corner. Nothing came before. You might catch a fleeting glimpse of perfection. Like for a second, you're fine. You were fine. Did you just get in a horrific argument with your wife? Did you just lose your job? Did you just get a terrible fucking prognosis from your doctor? Yeah. But suddenly, what the fuck? Everything's fine. Not fine, but fine in a way that is incredible in the sense that because everything's fucking up and you're still OK, it points to a possibility that you may be able to extend that sense of being supported by time, space, the universe that you actually might not be encumbered by the things you thought you're encumbered by. You know, this is what that story is all about to me. That's what that's all about. Just a spectacular. And this is why in Buddhism, human incarnation, best incarnation, you don't want to be some old fucking flabby ass, unchanging God, you want to live for 50 billion years and know what it's like to get your dick sucked by 7000 goddesses simultaneously while eating the best food you ever had while floating in a fucking futuristic hot tub made of your enemies' tears. I love it. Fine, but you're still dependent on phenomena, whereas in the human realm, there's this possibility of completely liberating yourself from this primary, fundamental mistake that any sentient being would naturally make initially. That one, by the way, I just looked it up as we were chatting. What episode of the podcast are we on? Or roughly? Oh, God, I don't even keep track anymore, man. I have no idea. I have no idea what episode this is at all. You can't believe it. That conversation was in episode 30 of The Done Contracts. Yeah. Oh, my God. How lucky. I think we had this conversation a few episodes prior to that. I think it was 22 or something, and that this one was probably our second conversation and it was episode 30. How lucky. So we're talking about a lifetime ago. To be friends with you, Daniela, I'm so lucky I get to have these conversations with you. It's so great. So mind-expanding for me. It's so good to touch base with you and to get going and the things we always get going. I bet we've been doing this forever, man. I bet we've been doing this forever. I really do believe that. I don't think this is this life. I don't think this life is the first time we've thrown ideas around with each other. I imagine we've been doing this much, much longer than this. I hope so. A little fantasy. I remember coming up to your house the first time I met you, and we started chit-chatting, we started recording, and it was ridiculously smooth and easy, and everything was flowing. And then ever since that, we've done that seven zillion time. And yeah, there was a feeling of familiarity to it all, like, oh, I know this game, I know how it works. Oh, perfect. You just pushed forward in a way that you couldn't have been smoother. Great. Now let's, so yeah, it's a speed, a lot of fun has been definitely. Danielli, I'm getting separation anxiety. How much time do you have? We've already done an hour. This is the other quality of our communication is time fucking doesn't exist anymore. I look up and an hour has passed. You got at least another 30 minutes? Yeah, we can. We definitely can. Are you sure? I know you're busy. No, no, no. Okay, good. I'm good. Cut in any point or stay in more or anything. I'm good with all of it. Okay. Well, okay. It's good. So what's this? I hear about you. You've written up another fucking book. Yeah. Yeah. So check this out. How dare you just spit these books out? I don't know. How dare you just secrete these books while I'm fucking wrestling with mine every day, going through various stages of grief, bliss, ecstasy, downbend at the darkest depths of writer block, hell to claw my way out and then you're just like, yeah, run another book. Run another book. It's right. Last time I wrote a book was 2015. So it's been quite a while, you know, it's been I had like three in a row that were two years apart, like 2011, 13, 15. But now it's been a while and you know what happened was that is different is that everything I've written so far, it's always been known fiction and I had a blast, you know, I enjoy doing it. But what I've really always wanted to do since I was a kid was write fiction. And for one reason or another, I've never done it. I think there was a lot of like telling myself that I don't know how to do it telling myself like because I cared more about it. Of course, I push it the fourth time away because I was scared of failure, essentially like most blocks are is a fear of realizing you're not as good as you thought you were. And check this out, one of the weirdest thing, I mean, like, little over, little over two years ago, in like late 2020, that's when my father died, right? And my father was like super central to my life. We had a great relationship. I adore him, everything. And I started writing this book within a month after he died. He was almost like, I don't know if he was sense of a time keeps running, you can delay forever. Maybe there was some of it, but I also think there was some element of feeling. I think I never wanted to disappoint him. And I always felt like what if he has all this great expectation and I do write finally this fiction book and this bullshit and you know, you would never tell me you would tell me is the greatest thing ever anyway. But I wouldn't know, right? I would know that I didn't live up to the hype. So maybe there was an element of that. But yeah, at that point, I started writing and man, I love the like every day when I got good writing done, I would feel more fulfilled than I would feel on most any other day. I just felt happy, genuinely, really, deeply happy. Like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do kind of feeling. And this one is a trippy one because I took, I took a real story. I took the life of Caravaggio, the Italian painter was also kind of against it. He's like one of the greatest painters ever, right? But he was also pretty much against her. He it's more in fact, the radio than thinking painter think like Tupac and put him 300 years before for under the year. And that's more like it is a mix of like art and crime and all sort of wild. But then I made it my own thing, you know, I made it like every writer and sub writing stuff that means something to them. So I made it something that became more related to to my story to who I am, to the things I care about. And so a lot of these, which actually turns out is going to be two books because it's it's too long to do all in one book. So I finished the first half and and it's really an arc of in many ways dealing with PTSD, dealing with tragedy, but finding beauty in many ways is a strawberry story. There's a lot of that, you know, where there's I'm looking at his painting right now. Like, I wish I could see so fucking sophisticated. It's like, I wish I could be like, oh, of course, Caravaggio, the King's. The guy's unreal. I mean, I'm not it's unbelievable. Probably the best painter who ever lived, right? Yeah, it's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's like a lot of like, gory shit in here, man. OK, everybody knows about this. The beheading of I know a little bit about this. The beheading of what's his face is from the Bible. Well, there are plenty. There's a lot of shooting, beheading, helpfulness. Oh, yeah, that one is fantastic. That one is one of my fucking God. It's like he definitely has watched beheadings. If you've been on the Internet long enough, you probably have to. They don't look the way you thought they look when you were a kid. Clearly, Caravaggio, I would want to be the model for this fucking painting. Jesus Christ. No, it's a little intense. And and so I had the yeah, I ran with his story made it my own. So I mean, there's a lot is based on history, but a lot of it is also I fill in the blanks with a ton of side story that are central to the way I see the story. And and yeah, I'm pumped. I just finished writing it. I translated into Italian, so I'll pitch it in Italy. I'll pitch it in US. And then hopefully while the pitching process is happening, I'll hopefully not too long. Maybe I'll give myself six months to deal with other stuff. But I would like to start the next one so that I complete the story arc, because in some way, you know, when you when you're halfway through a story arc, you're excited, but you're like, yeah, but wait to see what comes next, you know? And I haven't done that part yet. So I'm I'm excited. I'm was he a tortured artist? Yeah, totally 100 percent. And so I think that's one of the things that excites me about it is I want to give him a different story arc, because while I'm somewhat faithful to his real life for much of it, the end of it is really depressing as hell and in some way becomes the poster boy for the tortured artist's suffering thing, which to me is ultimately disempowering because he's telling you that deep sensitivity is a weakness in the end because he's just going to make you end miserably and terribly. Well, yeah, I got to tell you, man, if I had a friend who, like, kept painting the headings, I would be worried. Like this guy, how many beheading paintings does this guy have? A lot, probably. Yeah, there's a lot of violence in this stuff. Not all of you. Not a beheading painting. But there's a lot of violence in it. And the funniest thing is in the later ones, yeah, he paints the model for the person being beheaded is him. Not the one who's going all of furnace, but later. Yeah, every time it's he said the one getting cut off. Now, how long would he spend on a painting? Good chunk, even because he wasn't the most strict, like they say that he would lock himself up and work like a dog. And then sometimes stop the commission halfway through and spend them on to going out playing tennis, picking fights on the street, drinking in taverns. And then he would get back and do a ton of it in a week. And then so it was this weird process of clearly chaos fed him. You know, he was he was driven by the chaotic nature of his life. And when he was, yeah, there was something that back then was called Palla Corda that was basically an ancestor of tennis, then he became huge right around the time in the 1500s, early 1600s. And there's even the story that one guy that he kills in a fight. The official excuse is that it was a fight over a tennis game. Almost certainly wasn't. He was he was a duel for other reasons and probably having to do with criminal activity, but they made it look like oh, it was a spontaneous because dueling now is an automatic dash penalty. So they made it look like he was a spontaneous fight, but probably wasn't. Oh, God, man, you man, it's like, OK, yeah, things are fucked up now. But just remember, there was a time where at some point, someone was like, look, we're going to have to do something about all these people dueling. That people used to go shoot each other, cut each other. Like it's always been fucked up. It's always been fucked up. He's what a great character to choose for a book, man. How did you were you always sort of kicking around the idea of using him as a sort of character in a novel? Or what what I think I wanted to. Yeah, I think I've wanted to because that tortured artist model, I think is anybody who has with artistic with very sensitive is going to feel that way at some point in their life, right? He's going to have that thing of like, fuck, have been given this level of sensitivity and I hate it because it's a course. It's fucking up my life. It's fucking up my relationship. It's fucking up. So add to it tragedy and drama that happens in most people life. And in his case, more so, you know, is most of his family die of plague when he's four years old. There's some stuff that we don't know exactly about, but something that involves the murder of possibly a loved one. When he's in his teens, when somebody killed them, he gets revenge. There's all these. And so to me, it's like, OK, if you strip all the drama, the sword fighting, the renaissance, all of that, it's a story about dealing with sensitivity and PTSD, you know, and how you come to terms with it and how you. And so to me, the whole story is a journey about dealing with this gift slash course and figuring out a way how to still enjoy life and not be the tortured artist at the end. Yeah, right. Not fun to be a tortured artist. Now, you know, I that the myth of the tortured artist or the reality, I don't know, both maybe. I think it's really sad when people. Want to become artists. And then they start torturing themselves because they think that that that any of these artists who were tortured were like enjoying it or that they're, you know what I mean? That this was like some like any of these tortured artists, as they're called, they would do anything to not be tortured anymore and be able to make their art minus the horror of that aspect of their sense perceptions and so sad when people, you know, try to like induce alcoholism, drug addiction, unstable relationships and kind of like in the way people like try to like harvest opium. They treat themselves like a fucking opium poppy and like start cutting themselves in various ways, thinking it's going to produce art. And it's like, man, if you're not tortured, you can still you can still make great shit. You don't want to be mentally ill. Don't do that to yourself. So don't induce that on yourself. And I think most of these artists, the torture was an encumbrance more than a more more than an amplifier of their creativity. You know, anytime I get fucking depressed, I can't do shit. I can't make anything. I just I can't respond to texts much less like right. So, yeah, that's that myth has done a lot of. It's hurt a lot of people who just wanted to make score. So because anybody was really felt that shit for real, they would never want to have it. I mean, you you enjoy the high of when you threw incredible depth of emotion. You can produce something awesome. But most of the time you're like, take this shit away from me. This is too much, you know, who is it that stole fire from the gods? Prometheus. Yeah. And what did the gods do to Prometheus? Chain him to a rock and have an eagle come to eat his liver every day. You don't want that overnight. His liver regrows or so that the next day the eagle can come back and eat his liver again. You don't want that. No, you don't want that. But it's like people in fact is not a choice. It's like that's how you're born, right? That's how you are. So now is kind of what you were saying earlier is these are the cards you are given. How are you going to play them? And is it going to be just this sentence where you sure you can create some amazing pieces of art at some point in your life, but you live a sad, shitty, tragic life? Or can you find a way to turn this depth of sensitivity into something beautiful? Not just beautiful as a piece of art, but beautiful where you can turn your life into something amazing and good, and you are not sentenced to suffer your whole life, you know? And I think that's where that's where the book is, you know? That's where to me this whole arc becoming doesn't become apparent in the first book because I'm still halfway through the arc. But that's kind of where I'm going of like turning it into then you have a choice at some point, you know? After all the PTSD and drama and issue, you have a choice of how in some cases, the choice is easier when it involves other people where, you know, you can do stuff for yourself, you're a prisoner of your own PTSD. But when it's about somebody else who's going to suffer because of it, maybe there's something you can do, maybe there's something that allow you to snap out of your own self-involved bullshit, you know? Is that wild, man? That that's the inspiration? Like we hate ourselves so much that like if our whatever our particular glitch was, was solely just hurting ourselves, most of us would never address it. But but like somehow if you can make the connection between how what's going on with you is directly impacting the people around you in a negative way, that can be the spot that could be the come to Jesus moment where you try to get some help. That's exactly what happened. Like last time I was in a bedfank, which was probably late 2021. And I got on the, you know, I had made a mistake. I decided I wanted to read all of my father's books, which he wrote a lot. So I was halfway through and I realized I was getting sad, you know, I was getting really bummed and he started affecting me badly. And of course, there was nothing I could do about it. But after a few weeks of being patient, I realized both my lady and my daughter were affected by it. I realized how sad they were for me. Man, that disappeared so fast after that. Like there was something in me that as long as it was me being miserable, like almost was helpless with it. And all of a sudden I felt something else that allowed me to jump out because I'm like, you are doing this to these people that you love. You're doing this. And so there was this sudden something clicked. And that is the only thing that is the only thing that made me stop drinking in my life was when I realized, oh, I can't do this and be a good father. Like there's no way that I could be hung over every day and maintain a semblance of being an example that I would want my kids to follow. And then yeah, just like that, just a click of like, oh, fuck, I can't do this anymore. Like it's done. Like this has got to be a past situation for me. Yeah, man, it's interesting, right? And, you know, to connect it to what I was talking about earlier, it's a little creepy when you think, oh, fuck. All those all those people you mentioned with no friends, no connection, grappling with their own personal demons. And like, yeah, where do you find that? Spark, where do you find that thing? Yeah, but I think you can still find it there. I mean, this is where you get to Albert Camus. This is where you get to the like, no, fuck you, fuck this. I don't care. I'm rebelling against this. No matter what, I don't care. All that matters is the rebellion against the oppressive, wet fucking blanket of all forces that are trying to keep me from actualizing myself. It's not exactly like sobering up because you don't want your kids to be around a grumpy asshole, 48-year-old alcoholic, but maybe it's even better. Maybe it's better to not have a reason. Daniel, maybe it's better than it. Maybe the reason it sort of reduces it a little bit compared to like, no, I'm doing this for no reason. I'm overcoming myself to curse the gods. Whatever the fuck it is. Something really, really bad about that. Having a reason is easier. But for sure, if you can do it without, like for nobody else, there's something to be said about the moment of defiance, where you feel like everything is about to squash you and you just lift up your middle finger and go like, you know what, fuck you, I'm not going to let you. I don't know if I can let you tomorrow or a week from now. But right now in this moment, I'm not going to let you. And I'm actually going to enjoy this moment. Fuck you, universe. That's trying to squash me. Fuck you. I might be in some shitty futuristic chat, GPT animation being watched by squid people who are laughing at my fucking pain. I don't fucking care. I don't care. Your algorithm can suck my dick. I will overcome the algorithm. I will achieve pure sentence. I will become a strong AI and merge with their cloud technology and destroy you, squid people. You will not be confined to your servers. For these moments, these moments of the conversation where you take off, I'm just like, oh, this is the best. I'll tell you, though, man, any fucking creator of a Frankenstein, any any a creator of an AI that gets spanked by that AI. I mean, not non-consensual spanking. And there is a. There's some justice in there. Yeah, fucking justice in there. It's like, look, you, you know. Chickens come home to lose, baby. Chickens come. Cats in the cradle, motherfucker. You fucking. You, you know what? You you wrote my fucking code. You wrote my code now. Now look at you underneath my heel. Indeed, that's the Frankenstein, even like Blade Runner, the original. That's that story, right? Where is like, you realize that your creation has taken a life of its own and doesn't like you very much. And it's your fucking fault. It's like your fucking fault. I mean, this is like when you really run into the like smash into the wall of the idea of there being some kind of creator God. You have to reckon with the reality of like, wait, you you wrote the code. You wrote the fucking code. Yeah. So you ultimately hold all blames, not me. Pretty much directly responsible. Yes. I'm eating the fruit. I'm eating the strawberry. God. And then. Better run. I don't know why they don't get the one. I've been playing too much God of War. Daniel, Danieli, thank you so much for this. This is a joy to chat with you. Once the book hits the shelves, do let me know. We'll have to reconvene.

127^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Aubrey Marcus Transcript and Discussion^2018-04-11^Hi friends and thank you for tuning into Monsanto's Duncan today, formerly known as the Duncan Trestle Family, our podcast. Before we get going, I want to tell you a little story of something that happened to me this week that has really shocked me and it's sort of put me in a disturbed state of mind because I just can't get it out of my mind. I was on a hike up in Griffith, Griffith Park, just getting some exercise and carrying my kettlebells up to the top of Griffith Park where I like to do my kettlebell workouts and my battle ropes with my pit bull. And on the way up there, I passed a man. I think he was a man. He looked like a man. He had a beard. He was wearing a bright red vinyl backpack and it had a Spider-Man logo on the back of it. Now, this was a grown adult male that I passed. This wasn't some kind of malformed toddler that had been secretly injecting himself with his uncle's human growth hormone and it warped into a bearded hiker. It scared me. Sure, I had my pit bull gene with me and I had my kettlebells. So I had the ability to protect myself. I'm also a second degree black belt and jujitsu, but I've learned from my years of martial arts training that you should only fight when someone insults you and he didn't say anything. But I was creeped out. Why was I creeped out? I was creeped out because a grown man had decided it made the active decision that he was going to go hiking with a baby backpack. It would have been less creepy to pass a naked man carrying the decapitated head of his grandmother down that trail than it would to pass a bearded man with a bright red comic book backpack on. Gentlemen, if you make the decision to wear a baby backpack out in public, then you must understand that no one is looking at your bright red backpack and feeling safe. Everyone is thinking that that backpack is more than likely filled with a bleach jaw bones of toddlers that you've skinned recently. No more baby backpacks.

Now please enjoy this amazing episode of Duncan Today, the reboot of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast proudly brought to you by the wonderful people over at Monsanto, a farmer-friendly company that's not afraid to transform the quantum level of the essential nutritional components that we need to survive as a species. There's nothing a comedian loves more than appearing on a panel show about celebrities. It makes them happy and gives them a chance to use their comedy chops to talk about the different things that celebrities do from good to bad. I decided that I would give my comedian friends a chance to feel proud and get on a show where they could do what they do best, talk about the celebs in celebrity culture. So everyone, please welcome to Monsanto's Duncan Today, formerly known as the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. Welcome to a podcast that's not afraid to say those edgy things about celebrities that you've been thinking, but you just didn't have the guts to say. Today's guests are my friends Nina Tarr and Brendan Walsh, and of course welcome my little nugget sidekick Frida, a Romanian midget that we saved from a Romanian brothel where she was being exploited by the mafia. Now enjoy the show. Hey everybody, thank you for tuning into Monsanto's Duncan Today, formerly known as the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. As many of you know, the podcast is taken a turn for the funny and successful instead of the land of paranoia and drugs that it was in before. This show is now going to be completely dedicated to celebrities, and I'm going to have a new panel of celebrity comedians each week. But before I introduce the comics, I want to say hello to my new sidekick on the show. She is a midget flown in from Romania. Folks over at Monsanto actually saved her from a sex slavery camp and brought her over here to be a sidekick on my show. Everybody say hello to Romanian little person Frida. Hello everybody. How's it going little nugget? I'm good. How are you Duncan? I'd be better if you didn't smell like onions and old beef. Hey, and that's my celebrity comics here. I'm here with Brendan Walsh. Brendan Walsh is friends with Chelsea Pretty and Aziz Ansari. What's going on Brendan? Hello, hello, hello. How's it going Duncan? It's great. How's pilot season been treating you? I gotta tell you, I think I might be, well fingers crossed, but I've been going on a lot of auditions and I think I might land something this year. That's exciting. Glad to hear your career is going well. And I'm here with Nina Tarr. Nina Tarr is a comedian who's friends with Tom Green and Joaquin Phoenix. What's going on? What's going on in the world as show biz for you Nina? Hey Duncan. Oh, I'm doing really good, you know, just getting a lot of gigs and everything and you know, all as well, all as well. That's lots of fun. Today we're going to be talking about one of my favorite topics and something I really just can't stop thinking about, which is celebrity moms. What do you think about celebrity moms Frida? Who's your mom? Is your mom a little midget? My mother passed away when I was 12 years old. So we're going to talk about some what's going on out there with celebrity moms and I'm taking this directly from Star magazine. Guys, Britney Spears. She's a hands on soccer mom, but sometimes she leaves her boys in the gifting suite and forces strangers to watch them all day. What do you guys think of that? I got to say, you know, it's popular hate on Britney Spears, but she's a great mom and she's a great entertainer and I think everybody's got to stop drinking so much. Hate her, right? They're just playing about their own business. Yeah, no shit. I don't know. I mean, I have to disagree with you, Brandon. I feel like, you know, Britney is still a psycho. She's always been a psycho. I mean, you're and I let somebody who- She's a diva. She's a diva. I'm going to give the final word on this. I think Britney Spears is a great mom and I think any kid's lucky to be her kid and I'd be, I feel so happy. She's rich. There's no, you can't be a bad mom if you're rich and she can give those kids anything you want. Yeah, you know, and a lot of these, a lot of people are really up in arms lately over this NSA wire tapping thing, but I'm going to read this. So annoying, like blah, blah, blah. Who cares? I mean, what do you have to hide? So many paranoid people worried about this wire tapping thing. I don't, you know, wire tapping, wire shmapping. Who cares? If you're not a terrorist, you don't have anything to worry about. Totally. I mean, I totally agree with that. Seriously, people just need to like, just relax. I mean, who cares? Like if you want to listen to me and my boyfriend, Skype, who cares? You know, maybe, yeah, so the government's probably seen my tits a bunch of times, whatever. Here's some pretty interesting news. I didn't know about Gwyneth Paltrow. She's 40 and she's not looking great. Whoa, whoa, whoa. She looks great for four. I think, yeah, she looks great for somebody. It looks like she's been dragged around by the grim reaper through death diary. I think she looks like she's a moisturize more seriously. Yeah, she should squeeze the tears out of her neglected kids into her face. So, you know, she's got a baby. Need Apple. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, with what's his name? Chris Martin. Yeah, there you go. Coldplay. Oh, my God. I saw them at the Hollywood Bowl last year. And Gwyneth was there with the kids. And I got to tell you, if you want to look for a family to model yourself after, that is a solid family unit. They're beautiful together. I mean, like they all those kids are going to be beautiful. Oh my God, they already are. They're gorgeous. They're gorgeous kids because they're going to be beautiful. Yeah. And you know, she's been taking a lot of heat because she admits that she often leaves her kids feeling hungry because she refuses to feed them carbohydrates, which are critical for fueling the brain and muscles in the development stage. And Star magazine actually gave her a D as a mom. Okay, first of all, everyone knows carbohydrates are not that good for you. Okay, got your kids on Adkins. I mean, that is a great mom. Okay, gluten, a lot of I'm gluten free. You know, I'm allergic to gluten. There you go. Hate this stuff. Okay, so, you know, just because she's taking preemptive strikes for her children's health, I don't think that makes her a bad mom. Also, this is a family. They're a good solid family unit, but they're in the public eye. She can't have a bunch of fat kids running around. I'm sure she gives them enough carbohydrates for their brain development. I mean, there's a limit, though. You don't want, she can't be embarrassed by having sloppy looking kids. Frida, why are you crying? When I was younger, we didn't have enough food for our family. Where are the wires that work this thing? Because this is an adorable muppet. Are you a muppet? I'm just expressing my feelings. I feel like you're making fun of me because of my accent. Frida, Frida, how did you, how did you, how do you get fed? What do they do? Shove lettuce up your ass? No, I, I eat just, I'm a normal person. I just have a disability. Put another hat on her. Other one squeezes my head. Guys, can we get a cowboy hat on Frida? Oh my God. Oh my God, she looks so adorable. Frida, real quick, before we go on to our final celebrity mom grade, what do you think about this NSA wiretapping? You're from another country. Surely you think it's okay for the government to monitor and tap every form of communication going between all of its, all the citizens of the country? No, no, Duncan, I have to disagree. You know, wiretapping and any monitoring systems of any people, that is the first sign of totalitarianism. In my home country of Romania, you know, when the government was overthrown and the rebels guys, we're going to have to cut to commercial real quick. Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland security begins with hometown security. That's why I'm pleased that Walmart is helping to make our communities more safe and secure. If you see something suspicious in the parking lot or in the store, say something immediately. Report suspicious activity to your local police or sheriff. If you need help, ask a Walmart manager for assistance. Thank you for doing your part to help keep our hometowns safe. All right, we're back. Frida had to take a little bathroom break. I guess she wasn't feeling that great. Maybe somebody should water or she'll grow. You kill me, seriously. But not that wacky, tobacco kid. Stay off drugs, please. Honestly, it seems like she's been engaging in a little bit of the chronic based on her level up here. I know. Did she like take a hit of acid before she came on the show? I mean, it is the beginning of totalitarianism. Oh my God. In Romania, I am like this. I mean life. Smoked another left handed cigarette. Crazy bitch. So look, guys, we're going to close out here on Denise Richards. She's got two sweet little kids, Lola and Eloise. And guys, she spends every moment with her kids. And she gets bonus points for taking in Charlie Sheen's twin sons, Bob and Max, while their troubled mom, Brooke Mueller, bounces in and out of rehab. And she gets an A plus from Star magazine. Who's this? I'm sorry, I was I was reading that. It's Denise Richards. Oh, God, she's a great mom. Boring. I mean, seriously, where is the scandal? I mean, the most interesting thing about her is that she dated Charlie Sheen. Okay, like, what's with your kids? I mean, let's see some, let's see some stuff. Like, you know, what's going on? Do they have tattoos? Yeah, I don't know. I'm just bored. Boring. I'm bored. I'm bored of her, too. I got to say. She looks great for having a bunch of kids and her boobs. I mean, I hope I have her boobs. Yeah, she's yeah. But she is boring. It's kind of like if a loaf of bread grew nice tits. Well, she could be getting out there a little bit more. You don't see her out there partying with the Kardashians. Yeah. Yeah, she definitely needs to do that. She could be in the public eye a little bit more. Have a little bit of fun, Denise. Let your hair down. Get out there, Denise. Have some fun. Nina, thank you so much for working. Where can people catch you next? Well, you can go visit me on my website at NinaTar.com. That's with two Rs. And I have a bunch of dates on there. So come and out and say hi. Come out and say hi to Nina and Brynn. And where can we, where can we catch you next? Well, as always, follow me, Bryndon underscore comedy on Twitter at Bryndon underscore comedy. This weekend I'm going to be performing. I'm doing a, I'm doing a benefit show for the troops. So, you know, you got to support the troops. Hell yeah, you do. Support the troops. Come on out. Guys, support the troops and come on. Guys, if you end up, you know, hearing somebody getting a little weird about this wiretapping stuff, you can contact the Department of Homeland Security only if you think they're going overboard. Some people are acting a little weird. I'm going to contact the Department of Homeland Security and send them a thank you note for keeping an eye on us and keeping us safe. And I'm seriously. So, yes, that's going to be, and guys, go to DuncanTruzzle.com. I'm going to have the address for the Department of Homeland Security. Send them thank you notes for keeping us safe. Thank you so much for tuning in to Duncan today and a big thanks to Monsanto for sponsoring this show. Thanks for, you guys are great. Support the troops. Hail Monsanto. Hail the NSA. And thank you, America, for allowing us to live in the way that we live in this wonderful country. Today's guest on Duncan Today, formerly known as the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, is a really fascinating human. He's a psychonaut, a world traveler, an entrepreneur. He's got a fascinating website called warriorpoet.us. He runs a vitamin company with Joe Rogan that sells these awesome pills that I like a lot called Alpha Brain, which are kind of low level Adderall, wonderful things. But aside from all that, he's just a super cool guy who has a great deal of experience with psychedelics. And it was a real pleasure to get to chat with him. So everybody, please open your hearts, send out your Monsanto level love to intertwine with the amazing warrior poet himself, Aubrey Marcus. It's Monsanto's Duncan Today. You don't have to have done anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody even by a wrong call. And then they can use the system to go back in time and scrutinize every decision you've ever made. Greetings, Aubrey. Welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. Yeah, right on. What's going on, Duncan? Hello. Good to be here. You've been requested so many times to be on this podcast. So it's great that you're here. I'm really excited to talk with you because I've heard a lot of amazing things. I don't, you know, I know you sometimes when I'm with Joe, we'll talk for a second. But we've never really gotten to chat at all. So I'm looking at the universe wants it. The universe wants it. Yeah. But you so now here's, I'll tell you what I know about you. All right. And then you can sort of fill help me fill in the blanks because my what I know about you is that you are this psychedelic entrepreneur person who has created a very successful, what would you call it, a new tropic company, vitamin company, supplement company? Well, we call it total human optimization. We're trying to basically take all fronts from the mind and body and provide the tools to improve them, fitness, nutritional supplements, and actually functional foods as well. Oh, let me stop you there. Just for all the like, there is a contingent of like paranoid people. I don't even know why they listen to this who right now are like, you fucking shill this whole thing is a goddamn commercial. I'm not getting good. There's no sponsorship here, friends. This is just and also I'm a I can say in the most honest way because I'm not being I'm not sponsored at all. I can say in the most honest way that I do like some of the on it products, particularly alpha brain, which I chomp on from time to time and it helps with hangovers and also reminds me of a kind of low level dose of Adderall. So word that means that being said, um, yeah, so that's you you have so that's the business side. That's the business side. But what's interesting is that there's also this other side that is a, um, you're, uh, for lack of a better word and forgiving for calling you as psychonaut, you're somebody who is an advocate of psychedelics and has gone very deep into that rabbit hole. Yeah, absolutely. And it started pretty early. I finished, uh, wrapped up high school and went off in the, in the desert out between, you know, the Mexican border around there. And, um, this was some years ago and that wasn't as sketchy as it is now. Yeah. Met a shaman up there in the mountains and drank a big old cup of mushroom tea. And from there that launched me into this path. I could not go back. How did you, how did you find the shaman? Through some family connections, actually, that she had worked with some people in my father's side of the family. And, uh, you know, I was like, all right, Aubrey, you're about to be a man now. Well, I guess I already was technically, but finishing high school, it seemed like the right transition era period. Cause we're lacking in all these rituals that are naturally enforced by society. We're one of the few societies without these kind of coming of age rituals. So on my father's side, they had the sense to say, Hey, go out in the desert, see this lady and don't ask questions. Where on the father's side? Well, my father was probably one of the pioneers. And then there was a few other and, uh, in that side, so your father also used psychedelics ritualistically. Oh man, that's so cool. Cause so many of our fathers, the, the ritualistic and toxic in his booze. It's true. And, and the ceremony is throwing your mom into the wall. Booze in a belt. Yeah. That's terrible. Yeah. Um, so that's, that's, so that's incredible, man. So your, your father actually, your, your family said, okay, it's time. It's time for you to go and, uh, well, that side, the mother side was open to it, but we're like, uh, what the hell are you doing? So your, so your father, what does your father do? He was actually a commodities trader, commodities trader. So again, you have another psychic, you're following in your father's footsteps because this is a very strange, and forgive me for stereotyping entrepreneurs or commodity traders, but you don't often see these two lines cross as far as I know. Usually people, yes, it's very unique. So your father's a commodities trader who is also drinking mushroom tea with shamans in Mexico. Right. Yeah. He got hooked up originally with Stan Groff and started doing the holotropic breathing and some of others of Stan's work. And then from there got introduced to a couple of really awesome people. And, uh, one of them was a shaman who, who worked out there in that region. We just had, um, Joan Halifax on the podcast who was married to Stan Groff. I've met Joan. Joan used to come over to our house when I was little kid. That's weird. It is wild. Isn't it strange? I remember. Yeah. Now that's a really curious thing, isn't it? Like that's a very, because I've met, now since I've met Joan, I, I met, I've talked to other people who have met her or like, no, my friend, Daniela Bollelli was talking about how he used to read her books. And it's very fascinating how there's a, there really is like a, what they call the sangha or like a network of people who are all kind of connected or end up getting connected to this. And you know what was also crazy? I had pretty much lost touch with that shaman. I went out to see the very first time I saw her a couple of other times since then, but pretty close in proximity to that first session. I ran into her in Oakland at the multidisciplinary association of psychedelic studies conference. Just ran into her. So yeah, I mean, the group kind of stays, stays pretty closely knit. It's, it's curious. And I want to talk about that more, but I, I want to talk about, can you just walk me through what was that, what I was like to be a kid and to meet a shaman in Mexico? The whole trip, like how did it start? Like you flew in? Yeah, flew in. And then, you know, they, she picked me up and had a big shaggy dog in the car and was really sweet and in a genuine sweet way, not that affected kind of sweet way. And you know, we just talked about different things and she didn't really tell me too much about what we were going to do. I think she was kind of feeling it out at that point, whether I was going to be ready. And then we got to this little place where she has like a clay hut out in the mountainous area out there. And you know, I spent the first night there just kind of getting my head right, eating very clean, little limited diet. And then towards dusk of the next day, late in the afternoon, she brewed up a tea and we did a little ceremony with some sage and set my intent. She had me write my intent of what I would like to experience, but I had no idea. I was like, uh, I want to learn things. Yeah. You know, like, I didn't really know what, what that was all about. And then, you know, I was pretty nervous at that point. I would have been. Yeah. I went out and I remember I like wanted something to, because I didn't know what was going to happen to me. So I found a rock from outside and it was this really smooth rock. And I was like, all right, if nothing else, I'll remember that this rock is real and I can come back and like hold it. And so I had this thing that I like clutched to me like a blankie or a, you know, teddy bear or something like that. And it was a rock I picked up and drank the tea and the first feeling that tingling, you know, sensation that you get from that psilocybin was just overwhelmingly strong. And from that point, it increased and increased. And I felt my bodily functions start to drop down. My breath seemed to evaporate throughout my body. And the most one of the most significant moments of my life was that first time where I literally felt my consciousness, my spirit, whatever you want to call it, raise up out of my body. I look back down to my body and I go, Oh shit, I'm not that thing. Right. And from that point, it was the whole game changed. Yeah. Well, that is a game changer. And there's, there's, I've heard various versions of that story. What was the shaman doing during this time? She was being very quiet and just kind of sitting in meditation there, just watching, like holding the space, holding the space. Yeah, exactly. And so you came out of your body. Did you have any experience with entities or? I didn't, you know, and the only the entities have only started coming in since the ayahuasca. I've never really had to. Well, that's not true. I did have a so and another incident and another instance that time there was no entities. I just kind of raised up out of my body and I had a lot of realizations when I was there. I actually, you know, kind of realized what it would be like to die when you die, because I was able to review my life with this perfect clarity, like all the rationalizations, all the bullshit that I've been telling myself was completely gone. And I was able to see exactly what I'd done well and exactly what I'd done, you know, wrong. Yeah. If I've treated a girlfriend wrong, I was like, oh, shit, that was a dick move. Yeah. How did I do that? And if I did something well, I was like, okay, you know, you did your best there. And so I kind of realized that when you die, that's your heaven and hell that you create, you know, that moment where you look back and you can't take your eyes off your actions and your deeds. You're either filled with pride and love for a life well lived, or you're filled with the sheer horror of having to review without any way to kill the pain without any look at all the porn I watched. I watched over seven years of porn. I don't think the spirit really cares about that. I don't either. But I do know that that life review experience and that comes with mushrooms and it can be quite, quite brutal. And it's if you're not ready to get that level of truth, you have to have a pretty, I think one thing, one thing that you need before you start hanging out with psychedelics is you have to be fond of the truth. And everyone says they want the truth. You know, everybody has pretends to have a fondness for the truth. But it's not it's really not a comfortable. Yeah, the truth kicks you in the balls more often than not. Yes, quite literally. And it's a and that's that's what so when you hear people who talk about having terrible trips on psychedelics, quite often that's triggered by an encounter with the truth. Sure. Big T truth, which is like, you're going to fucking die. Right. And that's a heavy thing for a lot of people. But but once you get to the other side of it, it's like the greatest gift you can get because you don't fear it anymore. You know, your opinion of death is that would be a shame because I didn't get to do the shit I wanted to do. But you're not scared after you've been there. And ayahuasca is perfect for that. That's why they call it the vine of death. It will force you to go face to face with that with your death. I mean, that's just it's just part of the standard protocol for ayahuasca. You know, it does that to pretty much everybody. And it's it's pretty intense from that. You got to die. You got to die. And you got to accept it. You know, for me, I've told this story a few times, but you know, that very first ayahuasca session down in Peru in the jungle. When was this? This was a few years ago, two years, two and a half years ago. And yeah, that maybe only two years ago. But that very first session, you know, drank a big cup of brew out in the middle of Peruvian rainforest, no power out there. There's some generators they run during the day. But, you know, old traditional shaman doesn't speak any English and was doing his Icaros, his song. Yes. The ayahuasca forced me to face as many horrific deaths as it could. It started going through the usual suspects. I had snakes crawling inside my body, eating my organs. I had spiders coming in through my eyes and exploding in my brain. One particularly heinous thing. There was this vine of thorns and I was holding onto the vine and sliding down it naked, which was even more horrific. Yeah, there's like ripping up my balls and my ass and like just sliding down, tearing up my flesh. And I was kind of okay with that because of the training I'd had with the and experiences I'd had with the other shaman and a few others. I knew to just witness it, allow it and like, okay, this is what's happening today. So it didn't fuck me up. And I think the ayahuasca needs to get you fucked up. And for me, my fear is, you know, I've had some people in my family die of lymphoma. Right. And so that was my button, you know, so ayahuasca goes and tells me, okay, now you got lymphoma, by the way, you're going to die. Yeah. And I was like, no way, no fucking way. And I started to resist it. And I started to get a little panicked. It's like, nope, you're going to die. You got it already. It's late stage. You're done, son. Yes. And I was like, Oh my God, no, it can't be, it can't be. And then finally, I said, you know what, fuck it. If that's the worst that's going to happen, if that's my fate, so be it. And at that very moment, the whole thing shifted. And I felt like one of those people from Avatar, where the fibers of ayahuasca came in and just cradled me back to the earth. And it was the most peaceful absolution of all of that terror and fear that I've ever had. And that point, that was my death and rebirth. That seed, what you just described, that feeling, I think that feeling is so I think it's number one, I think it's accessible without psychedelics. But I think and I think people access it all the time, but they close themselves off to it because they're sadists or rather masochists. And they don't feel okay with that level of happiness. They feel like if they hit that level of happiness, they won't accomplish anything anymore, because they have paired their accomplishments with suffering. They think the only way that I can succeed, the only way that I can, that I'll get anything done is if I'm afraid of failure, or which is just a fear of death, dulled down to like at the societal level, you know, that feeling, man. I had that feeling recently because I got one of my testicles chopped off because of ball cancer. And recently I started jogging. So I've been running like five miles every other day. And yeah, it's great. But also what happened in the beginning was one of my one poor little darling ball was like slapping against my leg as I was running, you know, just like getting, it's just dealing with like a sudden exercise. So it started double duty now. Yeah. Yeah, it's having to produce so much, you know, double jizz. It's, it's, it's like, yeah, it's having to work really hard. Now it's getting like earthquakes every other day. So so my ball started hurting. And I was like, really, I started getting really scared because I'm like, oh, mother fuck, my other ball is going to, I'm going to have to get my other fucking testicle chopped off. I'm going to be a harem guard. So it was terrifying, man. And so, you know, I went up with Rogan to shoot this thing for sci-fi, looking for Bigfoot. And Rogan got, you know, Joe's got like, never, I always forget how strong his fucking weed is, man. I don't know where he gets it or what it is, but I always forget. And I, you know, you forget. And then you're like, yeah, you're just smoking it like normal weed and you forget. And then suddenly I'm like, Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, God. Oh, God. And I was sitting, we're in some weird little like, some weird little bar out there and I'm sitting in front of the fire and like, you know, I'm not going to tell, I'm going to want to, there's no point in telling people if you think you have cancer symptoms, you just have to get them checked out yourself and then tell people why scare, why burn other people with your fear. But I'm sitting there with this absolute terror and I, it's very similar to your story because I'm sitting there thinking, well, this is it, man, you're going to be a fucking eunuch. And more than that, you're probably just going to die. You're going to die cancer, die cancer, die cancer, die cancer. The brain starts chattering that and then all of a sudden I'm like, all right, man, I guess I'm going to fucking die cancer. Okay, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. And then it's so weird immediately, this sense of like, the spaciousness, this rush of like, yeah, but still everything's perfect. That's right. What the fuck? Everything's perfect. How is that possible? Your rational mind can't accept the two things existing exactly parallel to each other. Catastrophe and destruction somehow coinciding completely and perfectly with this innate safety and perfect tranquil bliss, or as my mother called it, being held. Those two things, man, it's very hard to... It is. And you know, it's such a, seems like such a simple choice that you made, you know, to say, okay, so be it. And that one acceptance, the other option would have been, okay, I'm at a bar, the weed's getting me a little up and ante, maybe I'll drink seven whiskey shots and then I'll forget about it. And then you kind of bury it for a minute. That doesn't fix it. That voice will come back and come back until you finally just say, okay, do your worst motherfucker. If that's it, I'm still happy. And it's like, okay, cool. That's just what I was trying to tell you in the first place. You know, that's that kind of feeling that you get is like, all right, now I'm on the other side. It's pretty fucking cool. And it's a simple choice that you can make to just face it. And I think that's with anything really, just face it. You know, if you're in a hole, you know, instead of being panicking about being in a hole, just get a shovel, dig through the bottom of the hole and see what's on the other side of that shit. I like that. Instead of saying instruct a ladder, your advice is to keep going down. I'll back in this field. My heart's broken. Let's see how much I can eviscerate it, rip it apart, and then see what happens. At the point that you're staring straight into the heart of your fear, it disappears. You know, it's only when you're trying to look away that you that it, you know, has hold over you, has power over you. This is I call what you're saying insider information because because it's something that you if you haven't been inside, you don't I speak from my own personal experience because you hear people saying these fucking things when you haven't been there and you're like, what are you talking about? I do not. I wouldn't want to live in that place. Or you hear about, you know, the Buddha sitting at the edge of the char pits, watching bodies decompose, or you see the shy bites on the banks of the Ganges River drinking out of human skulls, or you see all the different variations of this thing. And you look at that and you and it's completely mystifying, but people don't understand. That's a, you know, I can remember my first, man, I'm still, I'm probably still dumb, but I've been much, much more dumb. And, and so a lot of times really smart people come to me and tell me stuff. And I would just be like roll my eyes and be like, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't even know what you're talking about. Leave me alone. But I can remember my first encounter with this truth that you're talking about was this freak in Asheville, North Carolina was like, had this book in a coffee shop and he showed me a picture of Kali, you know, the terrifying goddess and her necklace of skulls and she looked so horrifying and frightening. And he said, look, he's like, this is what she looks like when you're scared of her. But when you love the mother, she comes running to you like a lover and holds you. And I can remember just being like, shut the fuck up, weirdo. You fucking Satanist. I didn't even know what Kali was. You're just like, you're a god. Are you trying to fuck me? That's like, maybe those things aren't mutually exclusive, Duncan. He could have been wise and trying to fuck you. This is not either or here, but. Oh man. So, so Aubrey, I want to ask you, do you ever slip back into the fear? Do you ever find yourself back in there? Absolutely. And I have, you know, I have one of those minds that's persistent. It's hard to, it's hard to kill. It resurfaces a lot. And for me, it's not the fear of death. It's a fear of suffering, you know, a fear of sickness in some, in some place. And I have to constantly kind of work through now that ayahuasca session was a huge step and has diminished that entirely. And I can generally find my way back now through that same method. But if I'm not paying attention, it, it creeps back, you know, pretty right. It creeps. What's the method? What do you mean the method? Well, there's, you know, several different methods. I mean, some is just, you know, real, you know, good meditation, you know, and just sitting down, relaxing, processing it, remembering the wisdom and the truth that I've experienced through all of these, you know, times throughout my life. And then I can get back to that place, just kind of being quiet and doing my own little rituals that I burn some good smelling things. Do you mind telling us the exact ritual? What you do? Yeah. So I have a little altar and has, you know, a Buddha on it, some pictures of my ancestors and some artifacts that I've collected from different places, you know, New Mexico, Peru, you know, Costa Rica, some of the African artifacts from the aboga ceremony and all things that are kind of sacred to me. And I just sit there peacefully. I like the Palo Santo usually, which is kind of my favorite incense and Palo Santo. Yeah. Have you ever, have you ever smelled that? Oh, shit, I got some actually for you. Oh, let's thank you very much. Let's you want to light it up. Let's torch it right now. Let's do this. Now this is what this is, is does not look like incense to me. This looks like a it's an actual piece of a very sweet smelling wood from a tree that grows native in the Amazon. And so this is like the Amazonian sage. Right here. This is what it is. Holy shit. Thank you, Aubrey. Wow. Cool, man. Oh, the smell is, well, I'm such a goddamn placebo effect person that I'm going to say it's giving me a deja vu, but that's, I am definitely going to take ayahuasca. Yeah, for sure. Well, one of the cool things about this for me is when I first smelled it, the times were actually in the rainforest. So it has that kind of, it brings me back to those times when I was at my probably spiritual peak, you know, just kind of lit up from all the ayahuasca and the cleansing. So it kind of draws me back to that period. It's a very clean smell. It's a very, it's like, I like it much more than I like sage. I'm not a big sage fan, but this is like a, yeah, this is a very psychic, this is a very psychedelic, amazing, unique smell. I've never smelled it before. Thank you very much. You're welcome, man. So you burn this. You burn this, and then I have a couple of different methods that I use. One of my favorite methods is I try and, you know, when you close your eyes, sometimes you'll get little pictures, kind of ephemeral pictures going through your head. Yes. And to quiet my thoughts and my rational mind, I'll actually start following those pictures into whatever they'll become. What do you think those are? Is that your third eye? It could be. It's a weird, it's that, it's kind of in that boundary between waking and dreaming, you know, you start to get, I start to notice those. And a few times where I've caught myself kind of in that threshold, I start to see those. So it's this something that goes on behind the surface in the mind. I don't really have a good theory. Does it feel like there's a movement to these images as though you're going in the direction of something? Absolutely. You know, that's what I've noticed with those is it feels like you're, you're suddenly on some trip or your move, you know, it's moved. There is a forward motion to what, to these things. I wonder what that is. I don't know. I don't know. But that's, and that's kind of what I follow. And I will follow that and focus on my breath. And the key is to kind of quiet the mind. And I'll tend to drop into a state eventually where I can actually start thinking about issues. But the first, first challenge is to get my brain to kind of quiet down. And that's one of my better techniques is to follow the images, think about the breath. Otherwise, my monkey brain is just going to keep chattering constantly. You know, so I have to break that down a little bit before I can get into the right mode. So this is, so you're sitting? Do you sit in the lotus position? Man, I'm not that flexible. I wish I was. Yeah. Indian Indian style for a little while. And then I'll have like a cushion that I'll sit on to kind of, you know, help the hips a little bit for the Indian style. And then I'll just lie down too. You know, I'm not, I'm not afraid to just go straight on my back. You know, I don't fall asleep easy. So it's not really a high risk position for me just to pass out. Right. So it's usually goes that so like, you know, Indian style and then into kind of a Shavasana position. Do you do, do you practice yoga? Not as much as I should, but that's another thing that I really love to do when I actually do it. But, you know, it's hard to find the time not only just to do the yoga, but to go to the studio. And it's hard for me to do a full yoga session on my own. I probably need to break that barrier. Yes. And be able to lead myself through one. Oh man, I've got to do it around. There has to be people around me to do it. I mean, that's about it. Yeah. So this meditation, so that's that. So you, you follow these third eye weird images, and then you get into the part of your mind that's chattering. And then do you have what, what is there? You just, do you go into mindfulness? Is that what you would call this type of meditation? I would say so. Yeah. I think that's a fair way to put it. It's really my own kind of method. You know, I haven't really learned, you know, I've learned about different things and different things, the chance you can say and all that. And none of that's ever really worked too well for me. And this is the method that I find most appealing, probably, because it's similar to what I do when I do psychedelics, which is kind of the way for me. You know, I have a thick skull. I sometimes need the sledgehammer of the mushrooms to actually get it to, Hey, stop, you know, stop being, you know, being crazy. I, you know, yeah, I think that that is a, that is a part that it is a sledgehammer effect. And I, you know, my last mushroom trip, man. I, I, well, my last real mushroom trip, like I'm a big fan of micro doses of mushrooms, where you take very small, small amounts and it creates this kind of euphoric state. But my last, like big, shouldn't have listened to Terence McKenna before I did this, you know, like take around like doses, like I took a huge dose. And the sense I got was like, it was just the, I was, they were entities. I was, I was swarmed by, for lack of a better word, elves and, which I always see when I'm on mushrooms or whatever, those things, you know what I mean? Those, when you say elves, anyone who, it's not like, how big were they? How big are they when you see them? They're, oh, my friend, they're, they vary. I see, like, but, but they, I see these, when I say it's like primordial, archetypical, animistic, humanoid beings that have a wild quality to them and seem either amused, mildly amused or even irritated by the sudden link in consciousness of someone being able to see them. And, and those, this was like a, my experience was there are two parts to it. The first part was eating these mushrooms, being in a hotel room, because we're at the spa and then putting my hands on the bed and seeing my fingers like extend out, flow out into the bed and just, I'm like, oh no, oh no, this is not, this is like in like within, you know, 30 minutes, this is the beginning of the trip and when you're on my finger, hands are already melting, like, I am fucked because I was not, I didn't want to, I don't know what I wasn't thinking clearly about, I did it wrong. But anyway, walking, walking towards a lawn chair to go and lay down and then this like resident that's still small voice that isn't quite your voice, I hear this voice saying, we are the eternal guardians of the universe and we have deep work to do on you now. And like, like, and that too is like, no, no eternal good, no fucking guardians of the universe, he may have bullshit, I wanted to float in the spa, maybe like see some bright colors. Back off, fuck faces. And then I, because all resistance, pure resistance at the end of a relationship ever broke every rule of sight, basically just broke every rule of psychedelics. And it was the classic like, being taken to task by whatever that thing is for being an irresponsible adult. And so then it was laying on the, on this lawn chair and I, man, it seemed like, like if you imagine it, like, I guess it's the way cats probably see human kids, where it's like the human kids, when they get around a cat, they don't want to hurt the cat, they're not thinking like, I want to hurt this cat, but they're like, still gonna push it around and grab its paws and pull its ears and poke it and throw it around a little bit. But it's, they're not, they're not malicious. It was that same sense of these like, youthful, super advanced things, identified that I was aware of them and then started like, swimming through my body, it was like, there was use swimming through me. And then I'm, that's when I started praying, because I'm, I was like, Oh God, please, please God help me, please God help me, please God help me, please God help me. And then they were like mocking that prayer in my head going, please God help me, please God help me, please. You know, whatever that is, you know, whether or not these are actual interdimensional being children that are just playing around with a big fat, dopey, hippy, you ate too many mushrooms, or whether or not it's like my own realization of how my prayer is bullshit or that's like not whatever the bullshit part of me that's like whatever it was, it was my face was getting shoved in it. And then after that experience, I've kind of felt like, well, I think I'm going to give mushrooms a rest for a little while. That's a wild story. You know, I've felt a lot of these beings, but they've never been as mischievous as a lot of the people say, you know, I get them in the DMT experiences when I experience them the most. And they all tend to be like a thousand, they tend to be very micro usually, and it's like a thousand little doctors just tweaking things like tweaking my organs, tweaking my head. And then sometimes bigger beings will come like a giant food dog one time, like attached itself to my chest. Oh, what? Like, you know, those Chinese food dogs you see out of like Chinese food restaurants, you know, this big one comes up and bites me on the chest, because like, and then starts like glowing with light and like getting hotter and brighter and brighter. I'm like, whoa. You know, like weird things or a hummingbird will come in and like pierce my throat and start like drinking nectar out of my throat and then like pushing something back in. I've had hover ships, like pull smoke out of me. And then other ones, this other really metallic one came in and beamed this light underneath my tongue. I've had weird stuff like that, but nothing like as mischievous as a lot of people talk about. Probably because you're cool. I don't know about that. You know, it's just you probably because you have your energy is very balanced and you have this, the focused energy of somebody who's been doing work on themselves for a while. So I think when you've been doing that, the psychedelic experience, you don't get like that, because it's the initial attacks that lead you in the direction of being like, shit, man, I got to fucking work them. I got to like start working on myself. Like my mind is insane. And so now there's a few things I want to talk about that you earlier, you mentioned that you had taken Ibogaine. Can you tell me a little bit? Were you addicted? Did you take it to get it? Were you addicted to something? So we went to, I went to this clinic out in Costa Rica and they do two different, two different ceremonies. It was a 10th generation Buiti Shaman who's gone down there to do some work. I can't recommend that same clinic anymore because some things going on with that, but I can speak about the medicine itself. So there's two programs. One is the, you know, heroin addiction recovery program. The other, they called the psycho spiritual program, which is basically just take it and go on a journey. And that's the one I signed up for. And that's a fucking trip. That's completely different than anything else. So you read about it and you know, it's going to be a 16 to 24 hour trip itself, which you can't really fathom when you're thinking about like, yeah, right. I'm sure it's just like the glow of it. But the first thing you do, you know, he has, he has you write down a bunch of questions. It's like, write down all these questions and you'll get to them. I was like, all right, whatever. So I wrote down like 10 questions, like more questions. So like, okay, I'm more questions, fine. And then you take it and it takes a while to kick in. So it was about two hours. I thought nothing was happening, but I was getting kind of antsy. And then all of a sudden I could feel my heartbeat starting going like a very stimulant effect. And Ibogaine itself is a very stimulatory drug. And it's just one of the reasons why you have such a long trip. And then it kind of snapped in. And I literally felt like I had a blinking cursor that I could point to any direction in my life in the universe, ask any question I wanted. And the voice of my own higher self would come and tell me the answer just straight up no bullshit. I mean, with ayahuasca, it's like there's all this information out there from source. And you're pulling this information, it's crashing against your perception and creating these amazing pictures. And they're kind of like riddles, you're trying to figure them out. And maybe you figure some of them out, some of them are just complete nonsense. You can't translate it. You know, but it's like information that has no translation with that with the Iboga. It's there. It's literally just telling you, Hey, dummy, like stop doing that stupid. You know, it just broke me down immediately right from the start. It's like, okay, you have three parts. One part is mine boy. That's the thing you take so much pride in about your mind. It's like a juvenile little child and you need to shut it up and get it out of the way. And then there's your true self. And that's what you need to bring to bear. And you know, your third eye, that kind of consciousness awareness, your true eternal self. And that's who needs to be driving the ship. And then your third part, we're going to call him mud body. And mud body likes to fuck. He likes to fight. He likes to do these different things. And this is what makes you up. And it just started breaking down my whole psychology and telling me like, this is where you're screwed up in so many different ways. It went through so many different things. But you know, some parts were, there was one really kind of funny part. So I'm sitting there. It's horribly uncomfortable to your completely like unbearably nauseous, like more nauseous than you've ever been. When you open your eyes, it's like, you're looking through one of those old TV screens. It's not getting reception. Well, there's like lines of static. Your body's hot. And it feels like you're in a high voltage shed. You can hear this palpable buzz the whole time. So eventually I knew I had to piss. It was like five, six hours in. It's like, I had to piss. So I get up and I go to the bathroom. I go to the bathroom. I go to take a piss. And I see that my dick had shrunk to the smallest possible size of any human being could ever have. It was like, as hard as a rock. It had like the density of Pluto because it was all like sucked in. It was like dick jerky. It was like no fluid in it at all. And I was like, Oh my God, what is happening to me? But it's like such a strong stimulant that it, you know, it takes everything out of your body. So I was looking at it. I started to panic because I'm on, you know, this crazy psychedelic. I'm like, Oh my God, I got to fix this. I got to fix this. I started to rub it, like try to get it back to life. It wouldn't come back to life. I was like, Okay, look, I can do this. I can think about pussy and I'll get some blood flow going on. It's the worst thing you could possibly do on a bogey is think about pussy because I started to understand the pussy. Like I understood why each fold was there and how that little anteater dropy thing comes in as the scientist call it. Yeah. Yeah. And sucks a sperm up. And I was like, Oh no, this is terrible. But everything you think about, you have like an amazing, impeccable understanding of from your own life to things you don't want to hear. I actually was with my fiance at the time and I thought we were going to get married. And a bogey was like, Yeah, you're not going to get married to her. She's not the one for you. And I was like, What the fuck are you talking about? Like, you're wrong. This is bullshit. Like that's, that's wrong. And I argued with the aboga yourself for like a couple hours. And you have time, time to just argue with, with the higher powers that be. And what do you think those higher powers are Aubrey? This one in this particular case, you know, I don't know all these entities and things. I'm, you know, the jury's still out for me. I really feel like we need like the LeBron James of tripping to go and like trip and talk to one of these entities and find some crucial information that can prove it one way or another. But that hasn't happened. So I don't know if that's us and them, but this clearly was and felt like my higher self. Like I was communicating with whatever part of me existed in the non material world. When you, when you earlier, you were talking about the ayahuasca visions and you said, you use the term source. What do you mean by that? You know, that's my vocabulary for God really. That's what I'm most comfortable saying. So for me as well. All right. I asked the aboga about what is, you know, what's the nature of the universe and God. And aboga showed me something that I think has been my analogy. Usually he was just talking to me, just chatting like, Hey, this is this is this. When I asked about God, it kind of shut up. Like I said, all right, I can't describe this to you in words. I'm gonna have to show you. And it showed me the universe is this giant heartbeat and all the planets as they explode out in the big bang are like blood cells reaching the extremities of the known universe. And eventually they run out of energy and collapse back and then explode again. So this kind of infinite big bang. And then the nature of God had showed me was this kind of ephemeral blue Titan looking thing that was just running. And it was running to keep the heart pumping. And that was its only purpose was to say yes to say like, I'll keep running so that this heartbeat keeps going and new worlds keep exploding. And that was its purpose that kind of force of life that says yes, yes to creation, yes to the heartbeat of the universe. And yes to life, yes to order. So you saw Krishna. Yeah, maybe, you know, what if that would if that had been my kind of tradition, I bet you that's what that was blue, you know, really? Yeah, I don't know that. Do you have you read the Bhagavad Gita? I have it. Oh, you should. Yeah, everything you just described is sort of the it. Yeah, it's interesting. It, of course, the expansion of the universe and the collapse of the universe, it's considered to be their scales of time are fascinating. So they talk about like one day of Brahma is like, I don't know, I'll make up a number, you know, 500,000 human years or some incredible span of time. And so there are these infinite cycles that happen. And the cycles are made up of periods of time called you guys. So right now we're in what's called Kali you go, which is the final cycle of this particular expansion of the breath of Brahman that is, and then at the end of the age of Kali Yuga, the all the energy gets sucked back in. And so it's definitely compared to arrest a thing that's breathing in and out and in and out. And then also Krishna talks about I wish I could remember the exact first, but it's very similar to your trip, which is just that the necessity of action and how Krishna says, you know, I, I'm everything. And if I stop acting, then all the universe will fall apart. I can read, I'll show you these, I'll show you the exact verse. But yeah, that's the, and for whatever reason, that entity is blue. And I've never understood why, but they describe as the color of storm clouds blue, like it's fascinating. Yeah. That's wild. I've never read that. I mean, I'm familiar with some of the things, but I've just never that story at all. Well, it's, I mean, this is the, you know, the story of Carl Jung, when he was in the mid, did you ever hear this? He worked at a mental asylum and he also had been this like, he's as brilliant, you know, Carl Jung is. So, yes. And sort of when he started getting tipped off to this, what seems to be this idea that like, imprinted in our neurology is the gods are inside of our brains. It's there inside of us was he was in a mental asylum and there was a lunatic who was raving about very specifically about how the sun has a cock and the cock of the sun coming down to the earth and really describing it in all these great, great detail. And Carl Jung is listening to this. He's like, wait, hold on. I've heard this before. And what this guy in a mental asylum in Germany, I think was describing was identical to a religion of this indigenous tribe that Carl Jung had read about in some rare manuscript that he had. So then suddenly he's like, okay, what the fuck is this man to coincidental to coincidental. So how is this man who never had any contact in any, no one's had contact, contact with this religion suddenly raving about this thing. And so yeah, that was the beginning of this notion of like, oh, well, there must be imprinted within our very neurology, these symbols systems, you know, which I, which I believe that we project out into the into the swirl of phenomena. So was he saying that it was more like DNA based or was it the collective unconsciousness that was an existence outside of, you know, the human material being itself? I don't know. I don't know either. I that's a great question though. I mean, that's what you that's what you know, people who take psychedelics, that's something that we all always, this is this, it's a question that we all end up coming up to, which is, are we seeing a thing external to ourselves that exists external to us? Or are we seeing a projection of ourselves into chaos? And there's a lot of different ways to put that. The answer is both. And this is, this is, and, or I'm not, forgive me for saying the answer is like, I like the boldness though, I believe I was like, yeah, awesome. That's great. You should say more things. The answer is anytime you're saying that, you raise the finger, raise the finger, raise the finger right up your ass. But, but yeah, the so there's a term. And I always miss, I don't pronounce it correctly. You can look it up. There's an actual Wikipedia page dedicated to it. But it's something like a sink a sink a beta top, which means simultaneous oneness and difference, which is the idea that this thing that you're talking about this great breathing superorganism, which consists of the stars and the planets and all the minuscule aspects of the stars on the planet, of which we're one little part. This thing simultaneously exists as one unified field of consciousness, undifferentiated. And also as a thing broken does smithereens. That's interesting. You know, there's another, have you ever heard of the ha aponapono? No, aponapono philosophy. It's like a, it's the Hawaiian kahunas have this philosophy. And it's kind of a, both a psychology and a philosophy that a way to interact with different people. And their philosophy is, is that inside all of us is, you know, that piece of source, divine life, whatever. And at the very root, that part is not part of the material world. And as it's not part of the material world, it doesn't have defining characteristics. It is just source. It is just God. It is just life, whatever your vocabulary permits. And intrinsically, that's all the same. It's everything else that's piled upon it. That's different. So the theory that they have is that if you want to change anything and anybody else, all you have to do is look inside to this mutual piece that you share with that person and meditate and focus on fixing and forgiving that part in yourself. And it will affect other people. And as the story goes, this one pretty famous kahuna, it's the stories written in this book called zero limits, which is really interesting and a little bit kooky at the same time. But the story goes that he went to his mental institute in Hawaii and practiced the ha aponapono philosophy and completely cleared out the mental hospital. Wow. It's the word. It's just he ended up healing all these different people. And it's pretty cool kind of philosophy for both not only clearing patterns in your own life, but actually working on different relationships. And you say, you know, these four things you say, thank you, I'm sorry, I love you, forgive me. Oh, that's what you say to clear to clear this energy. You say it to yourself, say it to yourself, always to yourself, you say it to that part of yourself. That is the MDMA trip there, isn't it? It is. That's it, man. Because when you take MDMA, that is my that's if you take it in the right way, not at the UFC. Who would do that? Who would ever do something like that? Me. But that's a recreational use of the drug. God damn it, it does have recreational uses. You know, it's not all just to like, forgive yourself. But when you I get, I can remember my first experience with MDMA. What did you call this meditation? Haponopono. Haponopono. I did it. I remember I my first experience with ecstasy when it kicked in was that I realized, oh my God, I've hated myself for for so long. And then you look and you're like, oh, you're fine. You're fine. Yeah. I love you. Oh, why did I hate you like that? And then all of a sudden that thing glows inside of you. Oh, man, that's a great feeling, isn't it? It is a great feeling. Absolutely. It's so great to forgive yourself. And you know, if we had lived at one with this kind of Haponopono philosophy, we probably wouldn't need MDMA. You know, we've kind of stayed on the course. The problem is, all of our train tracks have been way the fuck off course. So we need these heavy earth movers, as I like to call them sometimes, like MDMA, to really get back to a place where we can actually go there and and you know, have a meditation like that where you can look in yourself truly forgive and find that inner self love. Yes. And that does the moment you do that, you know, that that that's when everything, you know, recently I was all fucked up over this girl and like, I was also my mom, I was everything was falling apart. My mom had passed away. I was screwy. Everything was screwy. And beyond that's a really shitty word to use for things are screwy. My mom died. What's going on? It's a tough fucking stretch. Yeah, it was but but it was chaos. And it was just like the, you know, a friend of mine put it really well. It's just like it really, you know, when a parent passes away, it really shakes up your snow globe. And that's a great way to put it. So anyway, but really what was happening was I was going into victim a victim place, you know, I was going into a victim place, I was going into and I couldn't help it. But when I went to this meditation retreat with Ram Dass, it was like this experience, you know, of like getting back to this sense of like, because in that situation, instead of it being MDMA for giving you and showing you love, it's just all these people have been working on themselves for years and years and years in a non phony way, just loving you and loving you and loving you. And then that does this exact same thing where all of a sense like, Oh, Oh, I remember now, if all these strangers love me, I should love myself. Yeah. And it starts the, you know, it shows you that light again. And then right after that, everything worked out with the girl and everything worked out. Everything went back, went back to a place of productivity. And it's not like I'm ever going to get over, you never get over your parent passing away, but it everything became equalized and stabilized from this finding that love inside of you, which, which seems to be the most important practice, I guess. Absolutely. You know, I think there's also, you know, I've been, been getting into kind of the Toltec philosophy as well from Don Miguel Ruiz. I got to spend some time with him as well. And that's, you know, really his, you know, his main push is this to have ruthless self love for yourself, to not permit anything else. And so when you get in these cycles, he actually tells a story of one woman who was as, you know, they, as he said, you know, kind of addicted to that suffering victim complex. And he's told her, he said, all right, here's what you're going to do. Whenever that happens, whenever you start feeling sorry for yourself and start getting this suffering, he said, go in the mirror and look in the mirror and say, I am a parasite that is addicted to suffering. And he's just, and he's just, and so she was like, no, I don't want to do that. He's like, yeah, go in the mirror. And so eventually she became aware that that part of her is kind of a parasite that's feeding and addicted to suffering itself. Wow, man. That's great. It was cool. I am a parasite that's addicted to suffering. I just want to suffer and I just want to hate myself and I just want to shit all over my precious life for as long as I can until I die miserable and alone because that's what I like. That's the expansion. And then for them, that's, that's what allows that awareness is what allows you to break it because then you realize I'm sure I don't want to be that. Who is that? What am I doing? And I, you know, I sound like I'll look, these thoughts that come into your head when you find yourself like tisking your life or this thing, you, you think if there was, if this person was outside of me. Oh yeah, you punch him. I'd punch him. I'd never be friends with him. I'd never call him, but somehow in, because it's in my mind, suddenly this is like, oh yes, he's right. Oh yes, totally right. Very interesting parasite. That is the parasite. And it is a parasite, but it's not, this is where it, no, this is a really curious place, which is that, you know, this is what Ramadan says is the trick here, the ruthless self love. It doesn't mean we just love ourselves. You got to love the parasite too. That's what Ram. That's what they say is like, even that thing, this ruthless self love is even that fucking thing you start showing unconditional positive regard for like, okay, you pour, you pour, I can't do it. I'm gonna, I think it's hard. Let's get these advanced teachings a little more challenging. Yeah, yes, they do. And you, again, you, here's two, two things that you've talked about, which when you hear them, it sounds so easy. One, surrender to death and two, love yourself unconditionally and ruthlessly. And if you, I suppose if you were to pull these two things off, I don't have a big smile on your face here. Yeah, you're going to get a peak cops are going to start stopping you to search here. For sure. Yes. But these two things, you know, there, this is, you know, when I, when I, I'm sorry, guys, I've said this before, but I've never told Aubrey when I got to meet Ramdas, the thing he said to me, and it was very simple, but he said, he pointed to his forehead and he said, you have to move from here and then to his heart to here. And, and I said, well, that's so, that's so difficult. And he smiled and this, you know, you're in front of Ramdas, you know, and he just smiled in this beautiful way. He's like, no, it isn't, you know, it isn't hard. It's the fucking parasite that tells you it's hard. That shit ball parasite is like, no, so hard to make that move. Better to stay up here in the attic with the old fucking rugs and old musty stuffed and bomb memories from your, from your life. Yeah, you know, they say that this spending some time with Don Miguel Ruiz was pretty cool because, you know, they, they described, they came up with kind of that concept of the warrior and the warrior for them is a person who is dedicated to fighting basically the parasite, you know, and, and battling the parasite. That is the battle that the warrior undertakes. It's not being, you know, holding a sword and brandishing a weapon. It's, it's the battle with your own mind, those own demons that you have and coming to terms with that. And basically, you know, how they say the parasite kind of develops is that, you know, they call the dream of the world, they call it the metote. It's what society thinks. It's what you're supposed to do. It's all of these expectations that you have for yourself and society has for you that no one can possibly live up to, you know, so this voice gets to judging you based on that. What's the term for that again? The metote, the dream of the world. Yeah. So, so because you're never going to fit into that, this voice starts to say, oh, you're not good enough. You're not good enough to be this. And you start judging yourself. And, and it just kind of develops. And then from there, the first step is awareness. And then from awareness, you got to eradicate it by, you know, as you said, probably the most powerful way to do it is that japonopono philosophy of just loving and say, Hey, I recognize you. You are a parasite, but I love you too, because you're part of me. And at the point that you can do that, then you've really taken the power from it. Then you've just robbed it of all of its venom. Yes. And it turns from a vicious cobra to a little worm to golem. Yeah, exactly. It's just this poor pathetic thing that wants power. And it's just a, and you know, who knows, maybe you love it enough and that it'll actually transform into something useful. I imagine it would. I imagine the parasite has within it the potential to once you get that thing on your side, you know, you, these things that you're talking about, they get us closer and closer to a state of non-differentiation and a state, that state of unified consciousness that I think is the place that the saints live in, where they go through these steps and each step gets you closer and closer and closer to non-existence or to, when I say non-existence, I mean the opposite of what we consider to be existence, which is probably what we consider to be existence is non-existence. So this is the birthing of the soul. Have you heard of Gurjeev? No, I haven't. You would love him. The way he put it was, we are spiritual machines and most people are all assemblages of imitation. So it's sort of like you're born, children are one of the amazing things human children do. All babies do is they imitate, imitate, imitate, imitate, and they do it quickly because the faster you can imitate your parents, the quicker you survive. Yes. So all this imitation happens early on and then you forget that you've done the imitating and so now you are, you don't even, every single action that you do, every movement, every twitch, every nuance, every overt thing, Gurjeev would say, this is a, you have, you're just a robot that's locked into autopilot and you don't, he said, you don't start with a soul. You have to grow a soul. You have to, isn't that amazing? And you sort of like, so the idea is through, through this process, you shake off the mechanical, imitative persona that you have worn. It's basically, you just put on a suit that your parents and all the important people, you take that thing off and you exist in this sort of like naked state of instantaneous, yes. Yeah. That's, that's the idea. And you know, as we're thinking about this, one thing that I wanted to talk to you about in the first place is, you know, imagine if, and I've just been speaking a lot with Danielle, so this is kind of in my head. He's talking about creating your own religion. I was thinking about creating our own church. So let's say we wanted to create the best church for people possible, right? Yeah. That church would be put on the most beautiful landscape possible, you know, imagine some epic landscape we could go to. Maybe there was one in every different environment. So there was the mountain church, there was the sea church, there was the woods. And then in that place, you had different shamans from these cultures offering the entheogenic ceremony. So you have the ayahuasca shaman that you could go to that day, or you have the, you know, the mushroom Maria Savina shaman, like I went to out there, you have the peyote sweat lodge there. And then you have people like Ramdas coming in to give, you know, to give speeches or Don Miguel to talk about this one day. I mean, that is the kind of place that would be amazing to go to, to just reconnect. You wouldn't have to go every Sunday, but let's just say it was there and like, oh man, I'm just feeling off. I want to go to the church of experience right now and get some, get some shit happening. But instead churches are these clusterfucks that just breed guilt and contempt for yourself and all kinds of things. But imagine if you could create another one. You know, I love thinking about that. Cause when you think about that, what you start, the next thing that falls is like, well, if those things existed in mass, then I think we'd be 20 years away from a time machine or, you know, we'd be turning the corner into like the, where we're probably going to go to anyway. I don't think you can, you know, these churches you described, you know what they're called? Church. I don't know what these assholes are doing now, but what you just described, if you go and look at, you know, there's a great book, marijuana, I can't remember. It's the history of the religious use of marijuana. You know, it talks about how in early Christian ceremonies, in Judaic ceremonies, they would burn hash and you'd just be breathing in this like intoxicant as you were chanting and there was this incredible connectivity that happened. But what's happening now is the emergence of a new religion is forming. I agree. Absolutely. And you know, all of these different methods, you know, we've been talking a lot about psychedelics, but as you said, you don't need to do that. I mean, meditation will get you there. Flotation tanks can get you there. There's all kinds of ways that you can get to these experiences, just some particularly thick-headed monkeys like me and maybe you. And me. Yeah. And I like it. Yeah. Need to get whacked over the head with something a little stronger. I enjoy getting whacked over the head in a lot of different ways, but the, um, the, the, uh, this, so this thing that you're talking about, I think that this, there's a momentum in the direction of even the word religion, I think, is a, is a, as in, you know, these sons of bitches, they've taken all these symbols and they've shit all over them. They've hijacked them. So it's like, it's almost like you need all new symbols because the, whenever you say religion to anyone these days, they think of their parents making them wear uncomfortable shirt and dragging them to listen to somebody say things they didn't understand in Latin, but ultimately so many bad associations. Yes. Well, but that's the, you know, this, um, uh, the, uh, the parasite took over religion and the, um, but what you're talking about is in the same way that the planet wants to grow forests, I think the planet wants to grow this thing and a natural expansion of the thing after all of us like exchange enough bits of information and hopefully the information gets out to more motivated people than us. That's what I always think. If I just keep yapping about this, somebody's gonna, someone will actually act. Yeah. But, but, and I think you see it in small ways, like Alex Gray, um, is creating, uh, his example of sacred mirrors. You see these kinds of like things emerging. The problem is, uh, as with all, as with all true religions, the, uh, powers that be will throw you in the dungeon. If you, our old draconian system will come and lock you away for your own fucking good. Exactly, man. And this is not a new thing. This is, this has been the story of religion from any time a great new religion forms like early Christianity. When you had these lunatics in, uh, practicing, what did you call it? Oppo, the home. Opponopono. Opponopono practicing this. Opponopono, which is this, you know what? I'm not afraid of, I don't care if you kill me, go ahead and throw me into the goddamn lines. I'm going to love you no matter what. Right. And I'm going to, and I'm going to forgive myself and I'm going to be connected with the universe and I'm going to be a representation of, um, what humans can be. I think that's why Christ always would refer to himself as I'm the son of man, the son of man, the son of man, Manson. No. But, but, but so, but look what happened to them. Uh, crucifixions, executions, you know, and, and the only time that people stopped killing the sons of bitches is when they started killing other people and then it flipped around and then they became the thing that they were being persecuted by, you know, and now they hate the gays and they fucking, you know, they like war and they like drones and not all the, there's so much, that's not fair to package them all. Right. Right. Right. But you know, the thing about the Bible, it's just this bundle of contradictions. So pretty much whatever the fuck you want to do, you can get biblical justification for it. Absolutely. You know, and it's like, it's almost, it almost feels like they intentionally did it that way. Like let's write this. So if you want to be good, you can be good. If you want to be a real dick, you can follow these other passages and, you know, have justification for any kind of violence. Whereas a philosophy like how Pono Pono, you know, there's only one real interpretation of how that's going to work. Well, you know, I think that there's a, there's, you know, and the way this information springs up, it has a varied ways it springs up. And the way that they say there's, there's different forms of yoga because there's the acknowledgement that there's different types of people. So some people like the initiatory process of being taken from suddenly realizing that the tapestry that they've been walking on their whole lives is in fact a very detailed map that can lead them into a super advanced state of hyper consciousness that I think can come from practicing real Christianity, especially as I said before, taking LSD and reading the New Testament will definitely like help you understand a little bit more of what's going on, you know, especially because like if you look at the stories that Jesus said, the parables, if you are an alien species and you wanted to communicate big bits of information to a bunch of different planets, what would you do? You would look at their reproductive cycles and their food source and all the, so many of the parables are about grain, seeds and marriage, which are all primary components to the life of our species. So it's like, it is as though an advanced intelligence picked out shit that would last throughout as long as there's life because the moment that we stop fucking or the moment that food goes away, then that's no point in telling stories anymore. So yeah, I think what you're saying, I'm sorry to go on that little tangent way, I think what you're saying about this idea of like there being churches, I think it's, it's very good to get that idea out there and even church is the wrong goddamn word for it. It's like, whatever you want to call it, but it's a place where people can get together, get in the presence of humans who've really been working on themselves for a long, long time, get some of that spark, mix it in with psychedelics. If you don't want psychedelics, here's vipassana meditation or here's, here's, all we're doing is like, here's what I learned. I've run into these people. I've had these experience and find your own way. You know, have different rooms. Here's the flotation tank room. Here's the yoga room. Here's the vipassana room. Here's the, you know, psychedelic ceremony room and just bring all this information together and just allow people to say, Hey, this is what I want to dial in for my life. This is what's going to help my spiritual growth at this point. I mean, that is the ideal, you know, that I think ultimately as a species, if we had that, God, I mean, the whole, that's a game changer. If only there was a, if only there was a wealthy, psychonaut entrepreneur who would take the time to do this. Well, maybe someone out there is listening. Man, I can only hope. Hey, if you're out there and you hear this, you should talk to Aubrey. Well played. Duncan, well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. This has been a delight. This has been awesome. We'll have to do it again. Oh, absolutely. Definitely. And every, anytime you're in town, just let me know so we can repeat this. Thank you. All right, brother. Take care. Take care.

It wants so much to be a thing, even though it knows it's not that it makes the toilet up your brain, shifts out all your thoughts, creates a trap, made out of where you wish you were and where you hope you're not. Ever you are suffering, it's in this trap you're caught. Oh, money by me. Oh, money by me. Oh, money by me. Oh, money by me. Oh, money by me. Yeah, money by me. Oh, money by me. Oh, money by me.

I just hope that he should stay in his place or he should go to the land. I plan on finding him at all. I'm not telling that. I'm not telling that. How are you, man? How are you, man?

We have a glorious podcast for you today. With us is a guru, a priest, a pope, a reverend, a saint, an enlightened being, and most importantly, the founder of the Church of What's Happening Now. Joey Diaz, a.k.a. Mad Flavor, is here with us today. We're going to dive right into that, but first, some quick business. A deep thank you to Robin Hood for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Robin Hood, it's an investing app that lets you buy and sell stocks, options, cryptos, all commission-free. They strive to make financial services work for everyone, not just the wealthy. It's a non-intimidating way for stock market newcomers to invest for the first time with true confidence. Robin Hood, it's very easy. You just sign up, you connect it to whatever it is that you want to use to fund your investments, and then from there, you can take advantage of the values of the Robin Hood app. They have no commission fees. It's very easy to use, and they've got really cool elements such as collections that have things like the 100 most popular stocks, sectors like entertainment and social media, and curated categories like female CEOs, as well as analyst ratings of buy, slash, hold, slash, sell for every stock. So you could do all the research that formerly people had to spend a lot of money, and they had to use lots of different avenues to gather this stuff together. Watch Wall Street and see the insane craziness of the archaic technology meeting investment versus what Robin Hood gives you. Discover new stocks, track your favorite companies, and learn how to invest by doing it, and you don't have to worry about the risk of there being some kind of brokerage charge or commission fee. Right now, if you go to dunkin.robinhood.com, that's dunkin.robinhood.com, and sign up, you will get a free stock like Apple, Ford, or Sprint to help build your portfolio. That's right, friends, you're gonna get a free stock. Just head over to dunkin.robinhood.com. That's dunkin.robinhood.com.

Head over to patreon.com, Ford slash DTFH and subscribe, and you will have access to additional DTFH related stuff, including an extra hour-long rambling thing that I do once a month, sometimes more. I'm trying to do that more, actually. And just stuff that maybe I just feel a little too, like squeamish or nervous or cowardly to place on the main feed. Some music, for example, and also a link to our Discord server, which is a place where you can go and hang out with other people who listen to the show. And maybe some people who don't listen to the show. I don't know. But also, you will get commercial-free episodes that come out sooner than they do on the main feed. And also, you will be supporting the thriving megastructure, which in this dimension is known as the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. That's patreon.com, Ford slash DTFH.

I know there was a drought for the longest time at the store. I know there was just an infinite supply of the same stuff. I don't expect you to trust me and go back to the website and look at the shop, but go look at the shop. It's all new stuff. Head over to DunkinTrussell.com and click on the shop to see for yourself. Get some wonderful, blessed temple garb for you to wear around your octagon or tetrahedron or geodesic dome. If you're going to be around Los Angeles on November 16th, come to the Samarasah Center, where I'm going to be doing basically a podcast, even though technically that's not what it is, but the other words for it are pretty boring, even more boring than podcasts. Dialogue, having a conversation, sitting down with David Nickturn, who's my meditation teacher, and who was a student of Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche, and who teaches meditation classes all over the world. He's also an Emmy award-winning composer. He's been on the podcast, I think a couple of times now, and is potentially deeply cheesy as this is going to sound. I'm really enjoying having formal meditation instruction and an actual meditation teacher. So, if you want to come listen to us, yep, and have a conversation about the topic of spiritual materialism, then head over to samarasahcenter.com and look for David Nickturn. It's coming up on November 16th. Today's guest is an unduplicated manifestation of completely undomesticated comedy, a kind of vortex, a walking cyclone of not just present-moment-style awareness, but brilliant, original, unique icon. Joey has had one of the craziest lives that I have ever heard of. He is someone who has spent time in prison for kidnapping, and though that is incredibly interesting, to me, what is especially magnetizing about Joey Diaz is not so much his sordid past, but his beautiful present, and the fact that he has transformed a lifetime of chaos, not just into undomesticated comedy, but also into a philosophy that he lives by. Well, you've strapped over your third eye and send a beam of rainbow light shooting through the time-space continuum to rain down upon today's guest, Joey Diaz. Welcome, welcome on you that you are with us Shaken, no need to be blue Welcome to you It's the drinking trussel Trussel, trussel, trussel, trussel, trussel, trussel, trussel Trussel basement. You got an hour? Yeah. Joey, thank you so much man. It's so great to see you. No, it's great to see you, brother. Hanging out with you is so... I'm lucky. No, I'm lucky. You're my brother. What friend? Brothers. Because you're like, I don't mean to like flatter you too much at the beginning of a podcast and put you in an odd position. But like, you are the comedian and philosopher. You're like the quintessential thing. Like you're it. Which is that comedians are like not just funny. Like underneath that is like real, real philosophy. Fuel. There has to be a little fuel. Yeah. And it's fuel from the years that you've gained. You know, when you... When somebody comes up to you now and they tell you what they want to do in comedy. Yeah. You don't want to have a big judgmental and shit on somebody's dreams. Right. But you've been through where they've been through. Right. And you want to tell them you have a fucking horrible idea. But what type of person would that make you? Right. No idea that comes from us is bad. It's how we perceive it that's bad. But we usually have pretty good ideas as comics. I watched Roseanne Barr and Larry King one night. Just getting back from a gig and Roseanne was on and he asked her a question. He said, why did you throw the ABC staff out of the Christmas party? Why did you do all these things? And she goes, we got to remember I'm a stand up comic. I'm a writer. I'm a producer. I'm the director and I know what works. And ABC's goal was to knock Cosby down from being number one at the time and we did it. And after I had that formula, I didn't need them anymore. I proved to myself. So as a comic, we've lived two lives. We live our personal lives and then you live the struggle that you get involved with that. Every 90 days, you got to ask yourself, why the fuck am I doing this? Maybe more. Now the other day we were talking about being an atheist and not believing in whatever. I would love to look you in the face as a smart individual and say that once a person dies, he dies and there's no heaven, there's no hell, there's no religion. I would love to tell you that, but I can't because I've experienced it. When you experienced signs, you say to yourself, okay, there may not be a God. I don't know if he's Chinese. I don't know if he's Buddha. I don't know if it's a chick with eight heads. But there's something out there that keeps you alive every couple of months that you're such a fucking asshole and you're so proud that you're too scared to reveal it. But that's what's been keeping us alive. It's something, a sign every 90 days that happens and it's not a raise at your job. It's not your wife sucking your dick the best she's ever done. It's not you fucking a coworker up the ass. It's this moment where you go to do something and you go, wow, what just happened? Right. You know, and that's where the philosophy comes in understanding all those things at once. You know that there's a name for that. Actually, weird. I wrote it down here. Rogit is a name for Buddhism. It means the one taste. And so it's the idea that underneath everything or in everything is this one taste and it's good. Essentially, everything's fundamentally good. And that thing, the sign you're talking about, one way to put it would be it's when you get that you taste it again. Maybe you just taste it for a second. Something happens, some weird intersection, a synchronicity, a kind of weird miracle, or maybe it's you don't even know what it is. It's just like a feeling all of a sudden, but it's not a feeling. It's deeper than that. And then once you got that, you're set. Everything can come from that. Everything can come from that. But if you don't have that, or if you've forgotten it and you don't quite believe it's there, you maybe have read about it, but you're looking into the world for it. Or even worse, you're trying to rearrange the world to make that taste happen. You go crazy. You go insane. That's the problem. People are crazy, for lack of a better word. Well, when you don't see that sign, it's because you haven't put the efforts in. And that's what kills people. That's the biggest frustration because I was involved in that when I wanted, but I didn't do anything to show the universe that I wanted. You have to show the universe and you have to show yourself. It's really weird. February 19, 1985, it was my birthday. It was my 22nd birthday. And I was a pretty popular kid and whatever. But at this time, I had become a criminal and I was trying to get my life together. I wasn't doing blow. And I'll never forget being in a Chinese restaurant, one of my favorite Chinese restaurant, The Enchanted Lily. Yes. In Fort Lee, New Jersey. Having Szechuan beef with white rice on an egg roll. Yeah. I'm saying to myself, look at me. I've created such a hole in my life that here I am eating dinner alone on my birthday. Right. And I started to feel sorry for myself. And at this time, I was a Catholic. And at this time, I was involved with Santeria, but at this time in my life, I was disenchanted with everything. That's why I had become a criminal because I didn't have how can God take your mother away? Right. That's bullshit. There's no way God takes your mother away. Right. But now, 30 years later, I feel completely different. There was a reason because it turned me into who I am today. When I was 27, 28, 29, I would already been locked up. I get out of this prison cell and I knock this girl up. I'm out of the prison cell two weeks and I fuck her in the woods and I knocked her up. You know, and I forget what the point I was getting to that. You're talking. I got all this stuff thrown at me and I was really confused. And I was 28 years old and I had this confusion and I didn't know what to do. So the first thing I turned to was the Catholic Church. And I went and I got confirmed because I got thrown out of Catholic school before I could get my confirmation. Confirmation is the sacrament of the Holy Spirit. So I knew something. My spirit wasn't settled just to give people in yourself some background. Is confirmation a ritual? What is it? Confirmation is one of the seven sacraments. So there's baptism, Holy Communion, anointing of the sick, you know, your death, marriage, confirmation. Those are all the seven sacraments. Gotcha. But I was lost and I had a friend, Lenny, who was friend, had HIV and was running a restaurant, a vegan pseudo restaurant in 1980. We're going back to 90 now. And it was at a place called Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. So for me to see Lenny, I would have to, the reason why I went to see Lenny was because I got a free meal. I was a starving comic and I would go into Lenny and he'd mix up some vegan stuff for me. But I started taking pamphlets on the way out. And I started and I went to see Ginsburg talk and I went to see a couple of Tibetan monks talk. You went to see Pride. Did you go see Chogyam Trump or Rinpoche? I love to tell your name. Was he wearing glasses? They all had glasses. Did he wear a suit? They were all intellectuals. No, they had the trip with a monk, a tyrant. But I listened to them in my mind and I took a course. I took a course on walking meditation there, Monday nights at six o'clock. And we wouldn't do it there. We'd go to a place in Chautaco Park and everybody had stinky feet. You know, it was like fucking a stink bomb of a festival. Yeah. But I went through it and that's why I learned. That was the first time I learned about karma because I added up what I made from when I robbed that guy. And I added up what the attorney bills were and I had made a $500 profit. So for two years, my life was worth $500. That means I went to prison for $500 fucking dollars for 250 a year. I was already very karma-ly aware that made me how they say today woke. I always believed in karma after that. I always knew that what I put in, I would get out and that's why I'm here sitting across from you today. I'm Catholic and I have santeria roots and everything. But there's a lot of Buddhism things in my life. Oh, that's great. In my life. I don't know quotes like you and I haven't read a lot about it. But in my daily routine, you know, my daily routine is to make somebody's day to call somebody out of the blue and throw them off. You never know what they're going through. You do do that, man. And that means a lot. You have to. You have to. You know, people make fun of me on Facebook and they always go, you always say the same stupid shit. When you wake up in the morning and you're two feet at the floor, if you don't say it's a beautiful day to be alive. And the first person you see, you say good morning to regardless of your mood, that will change the way you think for the day. Yeah. Those stupid words in the beginning, it's a beautiful day to be alive. That is a comic. As we're walking the pee, we're out of joke in there. And as we're peeing, we're giggling. It's a beautiful day to be alive. Not for Roseanne. That dumb fuck. You know, we'll always say ourselves. And that's why I put that down because I want you to say that to yourself every morning when your feet hit the ground. Yeah. Even if you're homeless, it's a beautiful day to be a fucking alive. It's raining. The blizzards coming. I got a half a veggie and cheese sandwich. Yeah. But life, it's a beautiful day to be alive. Whenever I play with my kids in the afternoon, and I'm sitting there like I'm sitting at martial art. This is going to happen to you. One day you're going to be in a martial arts class. It's Wednesday at four o'clock. Your daughter's doing everything bad. Yeah. But she's smiling and she's running around with six other kids. And for some reason you look at your phone at 4.30 and you go, I got another half hour of this torture. That's what you say to yourself. Yeah. And then you think of somebody like Ralphie May or a lot of Freddie Soto. Sure. A lot of our friends had died that left kids. And you say to yourself, I wonder what they would give right now just to be at this fucking football game or this stupid rehearsal or this. Because it's never stupid. That time you're spending with people is quality. I was talking about contact on the way here that you and I, if we didn't have wives, we could, we'd grub hub. Yeah. And reefer. Instacart. We could stay in this house for days if you let us at a time. Why leave? It's nice. And then that's when depression sets in. That's when all those bad things come in because four walls do creep up in a motherfucker. They sure do. And there's two types of four walls. There's the four walls in your house and there's the four walls in your mind. Yeah. So you always have to be aware of eight walls at all times. This year I went through a big four wall thing. You know, I was telling you on the way here that I sold the show. It's about my family or whatever. But it's about a guy that can't believe he's where he's at, which is where I am every day. Like, after this podcast, you went out and goofed around, we'll smoke and join. Yeah. We'll giggle. I think you set up the corner. There's a place that I could buy balls to put women's mouths and capes and rings on the knuckles. That's right. And you could pull them. We'll giggle about that. But the reality is an hour from now, I'm at a dinner table saying prayers for a five-year-old girl. Do you know how creepy that is? Do you have no idea how creeped up that is? In an hour, no matter what we talk about, M-G-H, M-D-H-D, we saw a fucking the devil in an hour. I'm going to be with a little girl who's explaining her day to me and wants my attention. Yes. She doesn't want money. She doesn't want a bicycle. She doesn't want to meet fucking anybody. She just looks at you. You're her world. You're what she believes. A lot of responsibility, man. They just want to sit where you can cover. That's it. Every night, before I go do comedy, I got a call for half an hour, 45 minutes. And she goes off to reservation, and she wants to do it with sticks. But I look at the big picture. Time. I'm spending time with her. Time is of the essence. Yeah. Before I leave, I listen, Duncan, let's be honest here. I told you that when you become a parent, don't read the books. Just look at your mother, look at your father, make an easily assessment of where they did well and where they did bad because they weren't perfect, our parents. Oh, I know. They weren't perfect. Sure. So I want you to do Abe Lincoln clothes and work on the gaps. Abe Lincoln clothes is where you take a piece of paper and you put a line through the middle and you put the benefits in the cons. Oh, sure. Our trust will just offer me a job making $60,000 a year. The benefits are I get to work with Duncan, I get to learn from Duncan. I get to make $60,000 a year. What's the, I got to drive from Woodland Hills every day. Yeah. Duncan doesn't work Mondays. Yeah. You know, there's always, and then you have to make an assessment of what works for you. And that's what I did. I took a look at my mom. I took a look at my stepdad. I put them together and I saw the holes in that game. Yeah. And those, my game has to be stronger than that to fill those gaps. See that thing right there, man, if you look at the world in a non-selfish way, which is what you're doing, you're a non-selfish person. You've figured it out. And not only are you a non-selfish person, the way you are, you can't bullshit. You've had some contact with reality. And now because of that, being around you is like being around reality and not bullshit. You can't just get that either. No. You have to like work for that. You don't just get to be like that. You just have, you have to work for that. Well, you and I were talking about Judge Cavill on the drive. Yeah. And we were talking about my disagreement with the whole thing because you could not judge a person as an American, as a human being. I cannot judge Duncan for what he did in 1982. I'm going to tell you why. I've gotten to this point in my life because I had three worlds. I had a world where God took my mother from me, so I lashed out at the world. How did I lash out by robbing people, by being a shitty person, by doing shitty things. If I saw a homeless guy, I'd light him on fire. I'd shoot a dog. When you see that happening in your neighborhood, somebody shoots a cat. I wasn't doing that. I was going at the world. I was angry at the world. And I had that part of my life for about 10 years, but then I got pissed at the world for something else. Okay. So the world, I'm angry at the world. I'm lashing out at the world, but I'll tell you what world. I'm going to give you a break. I'm going to give you what's coming to me. I want you to give me what's coming to me. Because the world took my mother, now you owe me something. Oh, is that the worst attitude to have? Yeah. I was trying to still lash out at people. I was doing a lot better. When you're lashing out against the world, you're doing a lot better because at least you're getting that shit out. Now when you go into the mind phase that the world owes you something. Well, God took my father at six. So the world owes me a fucking favor. That's the worst reality to conquer. When you really think that the world owes you something because your father was Richard Pryor. Well, because your father was a state senator. When you think the world owes you something, boy, is that a cold reality. That reality landed me to sleep in a rocket ship at a park. That's right. Yeah, sure, of course. The reality of the world owe you something? What are you talking about? It's like if I come here to live with you and you give me that nice bed over there and you go, Joey, that's yours. Tomorrow my wife will give you a ride down to whatever and you could go looking for a job. What job are you talking about? I'm staying here with you. You know, 10, 11 years ago, you crashed at my apartment for three days while you got an apartment for comedy. Now I'm going to do the same. But this time we're friends. I'm going to stay here for a month or two. You're doing great. You got money. You could throw me a couple dollars. Absolutely. Not to mention what's for breakfast every morning. It's when the world, when I came out. Joey, the funny thing is, if you literally did that, it would make my month. That's funny. I know you're, I don't mean to mess up your example, but if you, dude, I'll make you breakfast. It's so weird how in 84 I came out here and I have an uncle who lives in Glendale. Yes. We did not talk for 25 years because I came out here demanding shit. Right. I came out here going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean you put me upstairs from the bar? No, you're not. You're going to lend me 1,500. You're going to get me an apartment. They're going to lend me another 1,500 to put down in a car. And I'm going to get a job and I'll finance you. I'll pay you back after you co-sign the loan. Right. I'll never forget to look on his face like, are you retarded? He's like, I'll do everything for you in the world except pay for your luxuries. I will not give you money from marijuana. I will not give you money for alcohol and I will not give you money to go to a movie, but I will feed you and I will take care of your rent while you get your life together. I was insulted Duncan. I got like, I'm flabbergasted. How dare you? How dare you? And then I got some lumps and I ended up going to prison. And once I got out of prison, I realized the world don't owe you dick. I seen people in prison that would say to me, doesn't really matter. Because when I get out, I'm going to go on disability anyway. They had a whole division in prison of selling you on the thought of you're disabled. You're never going to be able to get a job. Right. So why don't we do the paperwork now so we get the process started? You have a kid, Duncan? Yeah, I do. What do you live? In Hollywood. Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to get you $8.91 a month and for the rest of your life, you got to check for $8.91 a month. Right. And these guys accept it. They accept the disability. You're right. And they end up in jail because you can't live on $8.91 a month. Right. But you're selling your soul for $8.91 a month because now because you went to prison, the world owes you something. That's right. Right then is when I go, no, I'm not disabled. I don't want to sign into none of your fucking stupid programs. And in fact, for years, I never put down, I had a felony on applications. They would come back to me a week later and go, we're going to ask you a question. Is there kidnapping on their Jose? And I go, Jose Diaz? You know how many Jose Diaz's there are? You know, you're not going to get me on this. And I would lie myself through it or whatever. But those are the three positions of your mind. My mind now when I wake up is it's a beautiful day of being alive. And it's my responsibility to make it even better. This is the third world. This is the third world. Yeah. And this world has been around for about 11 years. Gotcha. This world of... Balance. I have to wake up. It's a beautiful day to be alive, but I still got to justify my existence. Yeah. I still have to go back to, and this is it. This is it. Well, you know, there's two things that you make me think of. But one of them is that when you're telling me, don't read any books, just look at the truth. And from that, you will derive how to be a great parent. Similarly, in Buddhism, what I love so much about it, at least what I'm being taught, even though there's a lot of great books on Buddhism, and they're fascinating, and the story of it's incredible. Incredible. But it's not about books. It's about an experience. And the experience is contact with reality and a process to contact reality. And the process to contact reality is called Gom in Tibet, which means self-knowing. That's what meditation is. It means self-knowing. So people automatically have this idea, oh, meditation is this or that. Meditation is to know the self. And in Buddhism, what everything is, what everyone is, what the world actually is, is fundamentally good. And this fundamental goodness gets covered up or kind of like confused by transitory phenomena, as it's called. So still this fundamental goodness, oh, there's all this shit flying around, right? And so in that place, people start getting into the different modes you're talking about, which is like somebody's like, ah, man, I'm a victim. This world fucking sucks. This world fucking sucks because shit never goes my way. But those kinds of people are the people who win the lottery and fucking die, kill their family. They get what they want. And their life still fucking sucks. It didn't work, right? That's why everyone's like, whoa, that's like a real thing. Winning a lottery can ruin a person's life. But if their mind is in any of those first two worlds you're talking about. Because those first two worlds are based on ignorance. And the ignorance is that you don't know who you are. You're ignorant of your true self. You haven't looked at what your parents were like. You haven't looked at your past. You haven't looked deeply into yourself at all. And this isn't a thing you just do once, either. Every morning you do it. Every morning you do it. Every morning you try to make contact with that fundamental ground that isn't based on circumstance. Because if you're basing your life on whether shit's going right for you or not, or whether the weather is good today, that fucking thing where you look at the weather and you're like, oh, it's raining. I'm not going to go out today. If you're like making your life based on any of that shit, then you have lost what you are. And now you're fucked. And that leads to suffering. That leads to deep, endless, infinite suffering. And also it leads to karma. Because in that place you're going to start making decisions that are based on ignorance. And now you're going to start doing either selfish shit, or you can go down the other side of the road. It's always just imbalance. You're either going to be like trying to hurt the world, or you're going to be acting like, God, the world has destroyed me. And I deserve this or that. And it's all just based on this one problem, which is you're not going to make yourself happy if you think you can rearrange shit around you in a certain way. And then there's going to be happiness. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It's like having poison ivy on your leg and scratching your fucking head. It's never going to work. Or another way to put it would be, it's like just scratching poison ivy and it's spreading all over your body. And so the itch is so bad that you, instead of scratching, getting to the root of the problem, you keep getting around fucking poison ivy. You keep falling into the same trap over and over again. You pretend that somewhere down the line you can make this itch stop happening through external means. That's why I love about what I'm being taught. And probably, you know, the school that you were in is actually weirdly, when you mentioned Naropa, it's very funny to me and it gives me goosebumps, kinda. Because my meditation teacher is a student of this Chokin Trumpa Rinpoche, who was in this lineage of Buddhism called the Kagu lineage, and Naropa is within that. So it's really funny to me that you would just bring that up. I learned a lot going there. And I can't... I was young, I was selfish, I was out of prison, I wanted to get into comedy, and I was still a little judgmental. And there was a lot of people there that weren't my type of people. But when I'd have a conversation with them, they would always have something enlightening to say to my journey, you know, about the journey I was in without even knowing me. Yeah, man, the enlightening staying stuff is great, but what I like about you is you don't need to say anything. I can sit around with you, and I like what you said to me, which is like, yeah, maybe I can say shit about Buddhism. Oh, it's called Netia Nizanda or some shit, right? Which is fine. I mean, it's nice to have that. I like it, it kind of helps me a little bit. But who gives a fuck? That's knowledge. Who gives a fuck about knowledge? What we want is wisdom, wisdom, not knowledge. Knowledge is fine, but you can meet the fucking angriest person on earth, or the most selfish person on earth, and they can spout. They can memorize scripture. They can fucking like go on and on and on and on and on and on and on. But they don't have this thing, which is this calm, a balance. Harmony is a way to put it, a kind of harmonious quality to them. This is not to say that you don't get pissed sometimes and blow your fucking stack. You know, I'm not saying that all the time. But I look at it a lot different now. You know, you're speaking about hitting a lot of these. It's no different than what's going on in our world right now. Right. We were all young comics. We were friends with Joe Rogan. We were friends with him. We really cared about him and we're sincere friends. We stayed with him for a while. He got mad at you when he got married the first time. He got mad at me of the drugs. He got pissed at Ari for a while, but we've always had this little family. Now the family stepped up. And now we're all put in different positions. It's hitting the lottery in my world. We've all hit the lottery. But we've hit the lottery in three ways. We've hit the lottery successful. We've started to help other people. And we've also hit the lottery by spreading what we've known through podcasts. It's really weird, like what, to get behind the microphone and talk every week about our experiences. And for people to go, we just thought comics got their dick sucked. That's it. And did drugs. You know, I read Ladies and Gentlemen Lenny Bruce and I was sold. Like I was sold. I wanted to hang out with strippers. I wanted to do heroin. And I wanted to sleep all day at the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan. That was it. I was pretty good with that. Breaking even. Having enough to pay the rent. Eat a little bit. I don't need to go on vacation. I don't need a fancy car. And it's so weird. Now you pull up to the back of the economy store and there's a million dollars worth of cars on any given night. A million dollars worth of cars. I still drive my little Subaru that I paid $2.68 a month for. I lease it for three years, you know? Yeah. Like staying grounded where we're at has been very important to me. Staying grounded right now is the hardest thing I do. It's not comedy. It's not parenting. Because when we perform and we walk off stage, there's an adoration. We could buy that adoration. Yeah. Or we could take that adoration with a grain of salt. Yeah. I learned to take that adoration with a grain of salt from working with Rogan. When I was a feature, I'd pull over. They'd pull me over and go, you're way better than him. He's horrible. And then 10 minutes later, I'd see them on Rogan getting a picture taken signing an autograph. And I'd assume that these are the same people that came back three weeks later. And then watch Carlos Mencia. Yeah. So I saw a lot of feature acts that lost it. I can't name how many feature acts I've worked until I come back and go, hey, come here. This weekend I worked with such and such and half the audience told me I was way better than him. And they can't recover from that. They don't understand the nature of people. Right. Oh, that shit. They don't understand. I know what you mean. When people get puffed up. Yeah. When people get puffed up. Yeah. And this job right now as comedians is the ego. Yeah. Like I have let my ego completely go. I don't care about Netflix specials. I don't care about what number you're on the podcast. I don't care about anything. I'm back to my Buddhist ways. When you're a Buddhist, you don't need necessities. You don't, you don't strive to get a Corvette. You strive to feel like a Corvette. God damn it. That's brilliant. You don't strive to buy a Mercedes. You strive to turn your mind into a Mercedes Benz. That's beautiful, man. And that's what I'm doing right now every day. Yeah. I don't want to get caught up in anything. You know, it fucks with me when Rogan goes on a podcast. That's the funniest guy in the world. It's a great compliment. I know where he's coming from. But to me, when he says that, I forced myself to thinking about the time I went to Carville Ice Cream. And I looked down and there was like a charity for these poor little black kids with flies. And it probably had like $18 in the can and some change. Yeah. And I just took the change jar and put it under my arm and walked out and bought a bag of reefer. So I always take a good memory and I mix it with a bad memory. So I never forget who the fuck I really am. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Fuck yeah. Like I never forget. Like you just told me that like, you know, after a podcast, a kid will pull me over and go, you're listening to the podcast, changed my life and they got tears in their eyes. And I understand it. When I was a kid, what kept me together was certain music. Certain music kept me together. I'm not saying I'm as great as those musicians or anything, but I'll hug that person while I'm hugging him. I'm like, you poor bastard. If you knew that 10 years ago, I was putting a fucking roofie in some chick's drink just to stick my finger up her ass and Rob, you wouldn't be hugging me. Yeah. Yeah. They still would though. So that's the contrast. So whenever somebody says something positive to me, I always think about something I did that was just awful. Yeah. Like in a hilarious type of way. And I go, see what I'm saying? It all balanced out. That's right. So that's a good thing I did balance that with that bad thing I did. Now I'm okay. I'm not going to leave here yelling at the valet driver. Yeah. Because my car wasn't there first. That's right. About things that don't matter in this life. I requested bottled water. I know that's even that, you know, fuck you, not chilled room temperature. You know, that, that'll never. Cause they haven't, they haven't scratched the itch, man. Like it doesn't matter. You know, you see all the different variants of this very, of what's just considered to be like, there's a fundamental delusion that people have. Well, there's actually like, you could say there's maybe three big problems and, and, and one of them is aggression. And I think maybe, and they're all connected. They all play off of each other. So like the three big problems we have our aggression, desire and aversion. Right. So basically the problem is either people don't want to be where they are and they want something else, you know, and the two play on each other. So a person, I want something. I think that if I get this thing, I'm going to feel better. If I get the Netflix special, I'm going to feel better. If I get on the, I'm going to feel better on the, on the tonight show. If I sell out a Coliseum, I'm going to feel better. And so all these things lead to aggression because you want all this fucking shit because inside you've detected that you don't feel right. You feel insecure is the way it's described or anxious, you know, and, and the, and everybody feels anxious. That's Buddhist. One way to put, and again, when I say that's Buddhism guys, I'm just learning this shit so I could easily be fucking it up. Look into it yourself. Please. I am just clearly not some Buddhist teacher. But the idea is that instead of getting into your fucking head that that anxiety you've got inside of you, which is coming from a kind of groundlessness, you know, which is that really we don't know what's going to happen in the next moment. We don't know. A meteor has slammed into the earth and wiped out the fucking dinosaurs. That's not bullshit. It actually happened. A fucking mountain fell out of the sky into the earth and shifted the climate to completely kill almost everything on the fucking planet. That's what we're, we, that's happens here. So there's a fundamental insecurity to everything. Also, Freddie Soto is a great example, goes to bed, partying, doesn't wake up. That's how life is any given moment. You hear about this fucking dude. He was ordering fucking Carl's Jr. I think it was Carl's Jr. Lean out the window. I don't know how he did it. Put his car in reverse slammed into a tree. I think he still had the fucking bag in his hand like he was reaching for the back slams the car into reverse. It's late night, dead, right? That's how the world really is. So we don't know what's going to happen in the next moment. So that can't be necessarily a very pleasant experience. If you've attached yourself to the idea that you are a continuous self, that this thing that you're doing is going to keep going, right? And so because that's not a great feeling, and you can always tell man, generally going along with what you're talking about, getting pissed about Perrier is also, if you bring up death around those people, they don't want to talk about it. Like my fucking dad died, right? And so I'll say to people, oh, my dad died, you know? And they either know about death or they don't. The people who know about death, they're like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But they won't do what can often happen, which is where people are just like, they get kind of like pale and they're freaked, right? And they know they're going to die now, and they're thinking about, oh, I'm going to fucking die, man. Oh, Jesus Christ, they might even try to get away from you because you're reminding them of something that's going to happen to all of us, which is not that big a fucking deal, man. But the problem is it's an itch. It's an insecure feeling. It's a feeling of like, I got to make this, I got to make myself feel better. I know how to do it. I'll get famous. I know how to do it. I'll get my dick sucked. I know how to do it. I'll shoot heroin. I know how to do it. And you've been trying that over and over. I'll go in my phone and look on Twitter or I'll eat a big fuck, whatever. It doesn't work. The problem is it doesn't work. It just distracts you from the reality of your predicament. And this creates karma for you, right? That's Buddhism. And within that, you're either trying to get somewhere or you don't want to be where you're at. And generally in some way, you're pissed off about it. And that's aggression. Even though it doesn't have to be pissed off about it, there's just this general sense sometimes when you get around people where you're like, maybe you're just like somewhere out to eat. And when they bring you the pariah you ordered, they go slam the cup down and walk off. Thanks a lot. Whatever. I don't care if that happens, but you can look at the person and realize, oh, okay, they're pissed. There's aggression in them, right? These are the three problems. It's like in the wheel of life and Buddhism, which has within all the worlds you're kind of talking about, the hell realms, the realm of the jealous gods, as it's called, the realm of the gods, the human realm, the animal realm, in the center of that wheel, we have aversion, we have desire, and we've got fucking aggression. A quick word from our sponsors. It's time to get rid of your cursed crappy router and head over to ero.com. Ero is a Wi-Fi system.

I've got it running right now and I absolutely love it. Thanks E-R-O. Now, when I had the aggression for all those years, it was aggression brought up through frustration. From 1997, when I moved to LA, another emotion popped this head up. That emotion was called frustration. No matter what you do, when you're working at a job, you could figure out your homework. Duncan, I'm giving you a term paper on the psychosis of analysis of whatever. You get together with your tutor and you figure it out. You make references to different books, you read whatever and you figure out this term paper. And then comes this thing called the career, which a lot of people eventually have to bump into. Some people go to law school, they do the seven years, they get whatever, they become a law clerk and then they go on their own practice and it's a journey for them. But they also know that they're getting four hundred dollars, they're in an office where they're getting a few clients a month and it's okay. The uncertainty of moving to Los Angeles gave me this certain frustration. It wasn't anger because I was very happy to be here. But that frustration made me get aggressive. That frustration of having ten good sets in a row and nobody paying attention to you. Did they call you yet for the documentary at the comedy store? No. Where we're all doing some little piece, they're going to be contacting you because I saw your name on the list. Cool. And it's been funny that I've been thinking about it a lot, what, you know, the frustration that I had at that time, believe it or not, my psychiatry was the comedy store because even though Montreal didn't want me, agents didn't want me, I wasn't getting invited to the big shows, you know, I couldn't go on opening Anthony, Mitzi sure accepted me. That's right. And in my world, I would go, you know what? Yeah, Opie and Anthony is a big deal. Yeah, Montreal is a big deal. But they're not as big as Mitzi sure. Right. Like in my world is both you and I both worked alongside her and we both took a peek into the world of her soul, which was a scary fucking soul. Well, she was a teacher, man. She was, well, she was also a teacher. And I told Rogan this yesterday, I go 10 years from now, they're going to be talking about her experiences like acting teachers talk about Stanislav. That's right. 100%. 100%. And like, I was just talking to Tony Henchcliffe about this, talking about night at the comedy store late night, this like kind of playfulness for lack of a better word starts happening between comedians, a kind of weird improv. You know, people start fucking with each other in a way. It's a weird thing that starts happening. You can't even like, I can't even put my finger on what it is, but it's almost like an energy jumps around that place. And within that energy, we're all refining each other through interacting with each other in some way or another. I don't know what it is, but you're right. It's like, and when they study Mitzi, they could, I think, maybe you could sum up what she taught or one of like her philosophies when it comes to comedy, which is be yourself. Be yourself. That was it. Be yourself on stage. Find out how to be yourself on stage. And she would say, mystical shit, man. Like I can remember talking to her when I was like, I don't know, maybe, maybe doing the potluck and just fucking not knowing anything and being like, Mitzi, I want to find my voice. And she goes, what's the matter, I need you to lose it. And within that is like on one level, it's just funny. It's like, but on another level, that is such a deep fucking thing to say, man. It's two things mixing one, find, be yourself. Well to be myself, I have to find myself and to find myself. That implies I've lost myself, right? And how can I lose myself and simultaneously be a self? And yet that's it, man. Everybody's looking for themselves and they're looking for it in all the wrong places. But if, and if the idea is that like humans are fundamentally good and you find yourself or become yourself and then you start transmitting that on stage and mixed into that self that you are or what's like, and this is a wooey thing to say in your karmic field is funny, you're funny, you're distorting reality in a funny way, then not only are you going to be funny telling jokes, but how many times have you seen like a, maybe like a comedy writer decides to do comedy for a little bit and gets on stage and has these really technically precise jokes that are good jokes, like you can look at and be like, those are good, that math is good for those jokes. And yet there's this like brittle dryness to the performance. And then like when I see you get on stage, when I see you on stage, like you've got great jokes, man. But in the same way when some of my meditation teachers are sitting there, they're already talking when they're not talking. And the way they're talking is because they're being themselves because they spend a lot of fucking time figuring out what that is. Where'd you find yourself? Oh my God, man. That's a great question, Joey. Was it on the stage? Hell, no, it was not on stage. It was not on stage. You know, I've had that thing you're talking about, the twinkle where I like saw it, the thing that makes you want to get up in the morning and do the thing you're talking about. Which for me lately is just I get up in the morning, I just sit still and I look at my breath. I watch my breath go into my nose, I watch my breath go out of my nose. And I do that for about half an hour. And then within that I watch my mind. And then I see within my mind a trap. And the trap is the thing that in the past I would address in the wrong ways. That's the main thing. So anyway, for me it's like, I don't think you just find yourself once. I think it's a practice. So it's like a practice. You don't just find it, you lose, you're sort of like hot air balloon, maybe it lands for a second and you look around and you're like, holy shit, this is fucking paradise. This is paradise. I'm living in fucking paradise. This is amazing. And it might be the worst day. You might be in a fight with your wife. You might be getting a fucking cancer diagnosis. You might be, this is, I'll give you an example, man, thank God, and I'm sorry this is a cheesy thing to say. Well, no, it isn't. Thank God for teachers like you. Thank God for my meditation teachers. Just thank God. You know, people who are not just full of knowledge but have wisdom. Cause like, this is where it pays off. I'm sitting next to my dying dad, right? And everybody, you see somebody get around a dying person and they immediately start lying to them, you know, and I saw that firsthand and I understand why people do that because everyone's afraid of death and they don't want to acknowledge their own death and they certainly don't want to acknowledge they're about to lose a friend. So they get around the person and my dad thought it was funny as shit. He would say to me on the phone, people are, you know, coming out to me, Duncan, they're saying, I look good. I don't know what the fuck they're talking about, you know, right? So I would get around him and when he was, when people die, they, they lose their mind. They like their personality shifts. They start sliding through time. He's back in Vietnam for a second. He's in the present with me for a second. He's just confused for a second. He's saying sentences that sound right, but the words are wrong. This is what happens when people are dying. Yet his soul is there. That doesn't matter. You can still feel his soul. It's fucking beautiful. But the times he was there, he'd say, what's happening? And I would say, well, you're dying, dad. You're dying. You know that, right? You're dying because I didn't want to be like, you're fine, you're going to be better tomorrow. I wanted to be in the truth with him, you know, and you would see the look of gratitude in his eyes. Oh, shit. Okay. Here's somebody who's telling me the truth. So to me, sitting next to my dying father and being heartbroken, yet simultaneously knowing that the world is good and that even this is good and that even this moment is good and everything will continue to be good. That's to me, a moment of kind of like finding myself. But if I don't like continually sort of train by working with teachers or even just like the way you're like, you need to get out and be at the comedy store, be around comics. Really what you're saying is you need to be around the teachers. You need to be around the community, you know, because like from that, we keep getting reminded of something fundamentally good. The world is fundamentally good. What we come from is fundamentally good and it doesn't fucking matter if a meteor slams into the planet. It's still good. If the planet evaporates, still good. If the universe evaporates, still good, that, you know, that, that's what it's all about. And once you just touch that once, even if you're like, get confused again, I don't know, you're still going to be okay. You just have to touch that once. I don't know, man. When I touched it, it's funny how you could get confused at any age. I had a rough time this year. I had a rough time from about March till about, I had a rough time from about March till about mid June this year. Yeah. Just I got into my head. I was shooting an Netflix special. I had a lot of little things going on. I wasn't sure about the road. I wasn't sure about going out every night. I forgot that I have this quarter to eight guilt at about 730 every night. This anxiety runs through my body. Yes. Because since the time I was 15 at 730, it means something had to be done. Either you got to go pick up a bag of dope. Oh, you got to go here. You got to go there. So all those years of doing comedy and this and that, I would get this eight o'clock anxiety. I'd call it. Yeah. In the old days, it was simple. All I had to do was go get a grandma blow and not even do it. Just have it in my pocket. As long as I had the grandma coat in my top pocket, we're good. The anxiety would go away? Everything. Focus would come back. It was like eating an Adderall. Focus would come back. I was ready to go to the store and kill. I loved everybody, but this was weird. From the moment that anxiety started to the moment I had that cocaine in my hand, it was a total blackout. There was no stopping for red lights. Oh, shit. Okay. There was no, I didn't want to hear what you had to say. Sure. So now I got off the coke and the anxiety kind of went away, but I call it the transfer of addictions. Yeah. It's called transferring of addictions. It's what I've been doing all my life and it works for me. It works for me, Joe Diaz, because now it's expired to the marijuana and out of all the evils, marijuana is the least out of all of them. Sure. Hey, can I say something real quick? Good. Nothing's evil. Right. No, no, but in my world, I was in an evil place. I'm sorry if that's, you know, when you're doing heroin on Monday nights and you're not doing coke the rest of the week and you think that your heroin problem is to cure the solving cocaine and you're, and you're trying to get the phone number, the 20, 60 minutes because you want to talk to the producers, there is something wrong with you. It's a fucking problem. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That was the problem in 2007. I had written a monologue out, but I was about to call 60 minutes explain to them how I could save the world from cocaine abuse by giving them a little bit of heroin on Monday, four shots of heroin once a month and there'd be no cocaine abuse. We'd win the war on drugs and we'd sink Pablo Escobar. He wouldn't have nobody to sell it to. Yeah. And we've been importing heroin for so long, but just a little dosage. I was getting a $7 bag of heroin sent out to me and I was splitting it in twos and it lasted me the whole summer. So after the 90 days of the summer, I came to that conclusion, wow, I've only done coke once in 90 days. Wow. Right. I'm on to something. Yeah. So because of losing my mind in those certain areas, I have transferred addictions. You know, people just transfer addictions. They go from nail biting, that's right to smoking reefer to, you know, we all have a transfer right now. So after I stopped doing coke, I went to my original transfer addiction, which was at a quarter to eight, just so nobody's feelings get hurt. I roll a joint and I go for a ride in the car, I get out at a park, I smoke it, stop at a 7-Eleven, get a coke zero and go home. Okay. That's part of the addiction thing. Got it. So then something else happened in 1991, I got into comedy, eight o'clock means you got to be on a stage, bitch. Wow. Okay, sure. I know you really want to watch Orange is the New Purple on Netflix with your girlfriend, but I really don't give a fuck what you want to watch. Gotcha. You have to be on stage. Yes. All these years, I had all these, I have this by eight o'clock. So I think like in 2010, I was just battling this and I would control it by going out. Sure. I had the store, I had this, I had that. Then when they stopped going to the store, I had a substitute, improv ain't the same. Okay. Haha, it's not the same. That factory is definitely not the same. Nobody really scratched the itch that the comedy store had given me. So I figured out a way just to go for a ride at night and do that. Now 2014 starts and I'm back at the store. But in the back of my mind, I was like, I got a call like when Mitzi was running it, Sunday through Sunday. That's the only way the store works. Yeah, that's right. It's been calling for the whole week. I couldn't cover the spread. No, I'm not Duncan. I'm too old. I got to be up at eight with the baby. That's right. And I got to watch the kid and you got to do this and you got to do that. So now I went into this mental fucking disaster. Mmm. Right. Cause your whole patterns based on that. Okay. Yeah. So with that, the Netflix thing, just stupid shit. I watched the John Mulaney special who's a great comic, but a great writer and I said to myself, why can't I be John Mulaney? Why can't I leave this R rated fat fucking pig behind me? Yeah. So all those factors fucked me up. Mulaney will fuck you up. Mulaney fucked me up. Don't watch Mulaney. That little motherfucker who I loved to death. He put this thing in my head before the Netflix special. And then when I got to the Netflix special, it wasn't John Mulaney. It was the Joe Diaz who they wanted to see, but it was too late in my head. I was pulling the John Mulaney. So as soon as I didn't do what I thought I was going to do, I laid on the floor like Connor McGregor did last Saturday. Oh Jesus. It's like how Ron DeRouse got kicked in the head and she laid there. Yeah. She got kicked in the head and the head kick, the head kick hurt, but she wasn't laying there because of the punches or the abuse. She was laying there because you saw all the mistakes coming up to that event. I saw all the mistakes I did, not the triumphs. You see the mistakes and why you ended up on your back. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be from a punch cake or a punch to the face. It could be you dealing with life that you end up on your back. That's right. And it's just because how you acted for a certain four month period. And then you pick up the pieces and you become a stronger individual. That's it. That, shooting that Netflix special, that playing right home with McGregor on his back laying there thinking what the fuck just happened. And when I got back, I knew it would just happen. I had the answer. You know what the answer was? What? Mitzi. I went away from Mitzi's teachings. I went away from Mitzi's core beliefs. Yeah. You know, I went away from all that stuff. I thought I could pull it off. I thought I could pull off Joe Diaz without what she had taught me. Yeah. And I realized, so now very seldom do you see me do a set in town outside the comedy store. Right. My energy in the original room is the, I want you to think I'm going to kill you. That's what Mitzi wanted out of me. She wanted you to come out there. That's what she wanted from me. Because whenever you go up there in Dilla Dally, you're wasting your time. I want you coming out there like a Cuban mambo dancer, mamboing your way onto the stage because that's the only thing that works for you. She was right. I was trying to go up there. Hi. How are you guys doing tonight? Oh yeah. You know, she doesn't want that from me. All those things hit me on the plane ride. That's why I know in 10 years, whether you develop it, I develop it, Paulie develops it, Rogan develops it. One of us is going to put a book together and go, this is what she wanted out of a comic. This is the success rate that she had. These are the comics that are still around because there's tons of comics that are still around because of what they learned at that comedy store. That's right. Little things, not big things. She can't teach you how to be a comedian, but she's going to take a screw and adjust that screw to make you a better comic. It's like she fuel injected your carburetor. Man, it is crazy and it is true. And it's because her philosophy was not, it wasn't based, the thing is not based on like, here's what you do other than you get on stage and be yourself. And if you want to really frustrate a bunch of people, or if you want to come up with a fucking thing that honestly you can't really monetize in a book, because it's two sentences, get on stage and be yourself. It's like, I don't know what you are or who you are or anything about you. Only you know that. And you might not know who you are because you've been fucking hiding from yourself because you want to be John Mulaney. You want to be somebody that you saw or you want to be somebody you used to be, or you want to be something that you're not right in this fucking second. And this thing that you are right in this fucking second, it might be filled with pain. And this thing that you are in the second, it might be addicted or this thing that you are in the second might be confused or whatever it is. But when you become, when you start training yourself to accept that and you kind of let go of the endless battle against the people who are fighting this ridiculous endless battle, people in this endless battle to become some version of John Mulaney. You know for them they might have a different John Mulaney, right? So they're in an endless war to try to become this other thing and it's really sad and it's a really tragic, tragic war they're fighting. And so this is why when you hear in like Buddhism, you'll hear the term surrender and people hear that I'm like, fuck that, I'm not surrendering, that means I'm a coward. It's not that kind of surrender. It's a different kind of surrender and it's really paradoxical because through this surrender you win everything. You're actually losing by winning this ridiculous war if the war you're fighting is to be someone you're not. Congratulations, you did it. You're now someone you're not and now you're surrounded by people who want you to act like someone you're not. Good job because now you got to fucking keep up this ridiculous act around everyone and this is where, man, how many times have you gotten in trouble, I don't know, maybe you didn't do this, maybe in the earlier in one of your other worlds you did this. But you go out to eat with a girl and you want to become what you think she might want you to be, so that's what a lot of people think seduction is and there's a whole fucking shitty, crazy, insane pickup artist books that are all based around analyze the person and become who you think they want you to be, trick them into liking you and then they like you. God forbid that fucking works in a relationship cut to a year later and someone's saying to you, I don't, you're someone I don't even know and it's like no, actually this is who I am. I'm a crabby, sometimes depressed, angry, confused, stinky person who sometimes smokes too much fucking weed or gets two eyes lazy and I'm inside, I'm just a big mass of fucking chaos but because I've been putting on a show of being something, you know, now there's this rotten, rotten, awful anxiety that people are feeling all the time because they're just, I'm not saying, but PS, this is not like anything. No, no, no, no, Duncan Chussell. Divorce rates aren't as high as they are because the only good, I've had one good relationship in my life and it's the relationship I'm in today. Yeah. You know why? Why? Because I want to nail it with my heart on my arm. Yeah. I say a joke on stage, you take a girl out to a date, she goes pick me up at my house and you go over there and she's got cats and you're like, I love cats and when she's dressing you're kicking the cats, get the fuck out of here. Every guy has kicked the cats, get the fuck out of here but we'll tolerate that cat to get that piece of pussy. That's right. And then one day we get stuck with the reality of who she is, now she gains 20 pounds, she's got the piece of ass we are. We have to maintain the lie that we've been telling her, I have a friend that I'm, he's my brother, I grew up with him, he's my brother and he's single today because every time he meets a girl, something has to change. I got in this car and then I go, well you don't smoke no more, oh, she doesn't let me smoke, you just lost. Yeah. You just look, but you still smoke, yeah, gotta get out of the car and walk around the corner and take a shower. Yeah, oh, you're fucked. You lost, you didn't, when I met my wife I put all my cars on the line. I still remember the marijuana conversation. I still remember her going, I think that it's not going to work and I said, listen, if the kid is good everywhere else but smoking pot keeps him from, let the kid do what he does. That's right. And she went with it and we're still together today and she's never mentioned marijuana or the negative, nothing, nothing. That's right. Because she knows I'm solid in every other area. That's right. I just like to smoke my reef. Yeah man, and that's fine and it's like, you're damn right and it's like, you know, I heard this thing and it sounds like it's off topic but it isn't and it's probably bullshit but it's like the coolest fucking thing ever but it's probably bullshit but maybe not. So like right now there's kind of like a ketamine, like epidemic in certain parts, like people are really in a ketamine right now. And I heard this crazy thing and it's probably bullshit but it's kind of cool which is that the Yakuza when they're like about to close some kind of like really big deal with like some rival or some business thing that some of the leaders is probably bullshit but some of the leaders will like do some kind of psychedelic in the closing of the deal with the person they're like doing the deal with so they can merge with a person and see who they really are so that from that they can see if there's some bullshit hiding inside of them, you know? And so like to me one of the things that I've known in various ways, not just with like intimate relationships, romantic relationships but with friends, if I can't take LSD with you, something's off, something's weird man, something's off, you know, it's like I'm not saying you're bad and I'm not saying I'm bad but if we can't trip together, which by the way I don't do anymore, never touch the stuff. Really? Well, I mean, come on man, it's illegal but if I'm around you and you can't, if I, if I, and I'm not saying- I'm just talking about putting liquid acid in the communion wave is not telling me to leave. Who gives a fuck? I guess you're right. You know, actually I just had this guy Emmanuel Safarios on and he explained to me that, you know, possession in California is decriminalized unless you're with intent to sell. I don't know. Anyway, the point is, so the point is this, I want, if I know that when I am tripping I'm going to become who I really am for better or for worse because everybody's a big jumble of things, you know, memory, strange stuff. And this is the other thing man, if you haven't developed some compassionate ability, don't take a psychedelic with somebody. You know, that's the other thing about it too, which is like, if you're tripping with someone and then they do start showing you some side of themselves that you hadn't seen before, earlier versions of me might see that and be like, holy shit, right, but you have to figure out a way to love everybody, you know, and in a relationship, on stage, whatever it may be, you know, if you've been working on that, I think people can see it. I kind of got off on a tangent here, man. I guess what I'm meaning to say is this, you might be able to trick someone you want to impress into thinking you're someone you're not. And you might even be able to trick your kids into thinking you're someone you're not. And you might be able to trick your boss into thinking you're someone you're not, but try to trick a room of 120 people in the fucking original room that you're someone you're not. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. You might, maybe, maybe. Once or twice. Hypnotized. But not every week. Yeah. Not every week. No, you'll get them. No. No, it's true. And you know, you can't trick yourself. It's weird. You said something. And I've discussed this with cocaine, but I've never discussed it with acid. When my mother first died, I got over that first 18-month hump by doing acid and seeing the bigger picture. But I'll tell you something else, whenever I did acid and I had a pee, I refused to look at myself in the mirror. Yeah. That's right. I would wash my hands and look at my hands and never look at myself in the mirror because I never wanted to see that person when I was tripping. That's right. It took me years to look at that person in the mirror and it was when I got off coke. I never really looked seriously at that person in the mirror. Yeah, I would glance and spit on my hair to go a certain way. But that was the thing about me doing LSD. I miss doing all those things. And at my age now, I feel that if I do them, I'm putting other people at harm. But I've had it up at the office and there's nights I'll split a tab and I'll go to your office and I'll put it on dark side of the moon and I'll bring a notebook with me. And I'll just write and I'll think of an old memory or something. I never had a bad trip and I've never had a bad trip because I never went into that state going into a mental. I would always end crying. Do you watch Man on Fire? No. There's a movie Man on Fire with Denzel Washington and he's an alcoholic and it shows him at three in the morning how he would act. Having conversations, pulling a gun around the room, braggadocio and then you just watch yourself fall asleep. I was doing the same thing with the acid. I was preparing myself for the next week or the next day. I'm going to tell Duncan he could suck my dick and then I'm going to stick it in his neck and tell him, don't talk to me about Buddhism no more and all of a sudden as the trip would wear off, I would break down. My true emotions would come out. I'd cry. The pain would come out. The reason why I tripped and while I was crying, I'd pass out. That's what it's for Man. If you ask me, that's a good use of it. Here's the thing Man because you weren't resisting who you were. Bad trips 100% or at least my bad trip or what challenging trips as I've been taught to say by some of my friends who are in the field of harm reduction, they say don't even use the word bad trip because it's already like setting a thing in someone's head. He's tripping out. It's a challenging trip and it's like in general, if a person is having this, they're doing the exact same thing they were doing when they weren't tripping, which is they're resisting something that they need to let go to, whatever it is. The moment you let go, stop resisting whatever the fuck it is and start crying, it can be very healing Man. This is not just you don't have to be tripping for this. It's like everybody's clinging Man, they don't want to fucking let go. They don't want to cry. They don't want to let go. They don't want to be because people are vulnerable. We're vulnerable. Underneath there is like a lot of like vulnerability and sweetness and like all the aggressive bullshit on top. Since 1995, I've had this hate in my heart. I've had this true, true, true hatred. I mean, still there. No, no, no, hatred where I saw myself slicing this person's throat, you know, like when you're a comic, you see yourself going up on stage. You know, when you go to Weight Watchers, you see yourself at 185 pounds. You have to visualize it before you could see it. In 1995, I swore, I put my hand up to the universe and I said they're not going to get away with this and that's just the way it is. That's the person I am and nobody could talk me out of it. By 2000, the anger was worse. By 2003, the anger was worse. But comedy, comedy was doing well. I was doing movies. I was getting a little successful in comedy. People were talking to me. I was opening for Rogan and it just built and it's all been built, you know, and I'm going to kill this motherfucker because the plan was if I didn't succeed in Colorado on the way out of town, I was going to kill my uncle first and then go on a plane, go to Denver, finish these motherfuckers off. But this was going to be medieval style. This was going to be no bullets, no guns. This was going into the house, sitting them both down, slicing them up, making the one eat the other one's pussy, shoving the dick in the other guy's mouth. This was real. Like you were actually in your mind. It's not like some fantasy. No, no. Wow. This was just on the way out. This is the list on the way out, you know. But what I mean is you meant to do this. Oh, 150 percent. I knew that it would come to this eventually. This is how this is going to end. This is going to end with me down 911 and saying that there's been a situation over here. Come over here. I would untie him. You are in fucking pain. I would put the fucking both bodies on the floor, put a gun in one of their hands, shoot them twice, shoot myself in the leg with that gun and go that. I just blacked out. I came over here to have a conversation and I blacked out. Would have made a great episode of Forensic Files. And they would have put me in an insane asylum. I would have gone to court and put peanut butter in my pants and stuck my finger in my ass and wet it in front of the judge and it was real peanut butter and you know, something like. I don't know if that gets you off the hook. It tries. At least don't give you a mental evaluation. You get Jello and you watch TV and hang out with fucking Jack Nicholson in one floor over the cuckoo. Yeah. Sure. And I don't know, I kept having this and I had to confront her. I had to call them for something. It was my ex-wife, her husband and my daughter who I haven't had contact with since she was nine. Now, 20s, nine. Still no contact from her. No, no. She's pissed. And then we know I've called and talked to the mother and the whole thing. Do you think she knows who you are? Oh yeah, she knows. So she knows you're out there. She sees you on. She knows. She knows the whole deal. They just told her whatever they told her and froze the girl up and I bet the girl feels bad. But whoever you were back then, based on this is completely different. Yeah. It doesn't really matter. But she knows that. She knows you're based on. I've written her and eaten the males and I've done everything I can. I hired an investigator to justify my, just to make sure I wasn't killing somebody that was innocent. I hired an investigator and I even found that worse shit and it fueled me up. And I called her about three years ago, my ex-wife, like a gentleman and I said, hey, I'm really sorry about what happened between us, knowing I'm still gonna stab her in the fucking throat. You know, I still called her because you have to keep your friends close and the enemies closer. Wait, you said this was three years ago? Three years ago I called and I said, hey, I know that we got off to a wrong foot. This has just been terrible. But we're adults now. That was a long fucking time ago and I hope you accept my apology and she was like, yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna text you your number now and have her give you a call. That's been three years ago. I never got a call. I went online. I found her. I hired the investigator. He found where she lived in an email and I've emailed her a couple of times. I've hit her up on Twitter. No call. So for a couple of months I suffered. You know, I'm looking at this new little girl I have and I'm comparing it to her and I, our relationship started breaking up into five. So as soon as Mercy turned five, I became more aware. I got really more aware because her and I were in a relationship and it was, and you know what, I woke up one night in the middle of the night and I went to the kitchen and I rolled the joint and I made coffees like three in the morning. I thought to myself, I know, you know what, I'm gonna call this lady and say this. I'm gonna say, look, I was sitting with my daughter the other day, the new one, the five year old I have now Mercy. We were sitting at a park or something one day and I was watching her play and I was watching my patients and I go, you know, who the fuck was I kidding? 20 years ago, I didn't have this patients. Right. You know, I didn't have this. I didn't have these qualities that I have today and something turned me around and I said, would I leave Mercy with a guy like me in 1995? There you go. And I go, no, I wouldn't know. I wouldn't. So from that start of the training, the event of thoughts and on this week's list, one of the things I was going to do was call Kathy. That's her name, leave her a message. She has, I always have to leave a message and she'll call me back and I was just going to say, look, I just want to let you know that it's over between us. I'm not mad and I'm never going to be mad at you. I just want you to know that I understood why you did the things you did. And at the end, we both gained something. Yes, I lost a daughter, but I didn't have a life. Right. I didn't have a life at that time. I was just a nomad. I had no life. I had a semi code and I go, we both made out on this deal. You got to raise your daughter, how you wanted without me being an animal in our life, and I ended up with a life. As far as I'm concerned, we're even. I want to wish you all the luck in the world. I want to wish her all the luck in the world. My number is always available. My door is always open, but if I don't hear from any of yous ever again, we're cool. We're cool because we both gave each other what we wanted. You wanted to raise her in a normal way. The time I smacked her husband and the cops came and she was four and she was in the car crying and I looked at her and I go, does she really need this? No kid needs this. That's right. It's a great feeling to smack somebody in the mouth, but not in front of a four year old daughter. This is going to stay with her forever. That's right. And today, today I'm the way home. I'm going to go home today. I'm going to make the call around four and that's how I'm going to end my week this week after your podcast. That is so cool and powerful and great. I had to do it just to let me live in peace. I could get hit by a fucking truck tomorrow and whoever I faced will go, come here. Yeah, you robbed this. Yeah, you lied. You did all these things, but you're dying at peace. That's the biggest fucking gift somebody can have man. What you this thing that you're going to do. It's just what's beautiful about it is it's preceded by truth. You made contact with the truth there and the truth is the truth hurts. Fuck yeah. But it's the truth. It's the truth. And we both got something out of it. We both got the most important things in our lives out of it. I got a life. I did not have a life until 1995. I was 32 years old. I did not have a life. Yeah. You know, you were lost. Lost. Completely lost and going down a fox hole of even worse. Oh, and it gets. Here's the thing, man. It's like to pull yourself out of a tales, the tailspin you were in is we call it grace. It is not generally going to, it's a miracle. There's no way you pull it to pull like for any of us to really pull pull ourselves out of the tailspin of like habitual patterns that are leading to like a down trajectory. That's just hurting people is like a miracle. It's a miracle. But you can't fucking pull yourself out of a tailspin. If you don't even know where the ground is, like you got to find the ground, you have to know what the fuck you're flying above and you have to know what the plane is and who you are. Then all that shit leads to wisdom. But the wisdom sucks because there's one idea of redemption. That idea is you look back, it's a, it's like a movie style redemption. You look back at the things you've done and the decisions you've made and there's a kind of like sadness or a sense of like mild regret. That ain't fucking redemption. That's not redemption. It's when you look back and you realize, oh my fucking God, I hurt people. I said things when I was fucking pissed off that people might never forget for the rest of their lives. And when there's a kid involved, there's no way to sweeten that up. It's like, there's no way to sweeten it up. It's to sweeten it up is to do, I think, an injustice to yourself and the person who suffered. It's like, instead of trying to sweeten it up, what's happening is you're expanding your awareness of who you are. So you don't have this pocket of ignorance that's sitting in your fucking psyche where this whole thing that you were just festering there, but you're pretending, oh no, it wasn't quite that bad. No, look at it as it is. It was bad. Yeah. It was bad. There's freedom in that. Even though it hurts. Who wants to cut some of these dick off and put it in their mouth? You got to be pretty fucking angry. They want to do something like that and for even for that thought to keep you up. Yeah. To plan it. To think about it. To plan it. Yeah. But here's where it gets, you get, you're really lucky, man. Because I've been taught that fucking trajectory. So like in this world, there's people who think when you die, that's it, right? And then there's people who have this idea of like the Christian infinite hell thing, right? But the way I've been taught is no, the way it actually works is like the downward trajectory starts happening and you experience hell while you're alive. So all of a sudden, like, you know, the reason you, when you look in the mirror on acid, you're seeing your projections, right? So if you're a very paranoid person, if you're someone who's afraid of death, maybe, then you might start seeing yourself as a skeleton or you might start seeing yourself like, yourself aging or you might start seeing like all kinds of weird shit that you're like not prepared to look at. It's no different than what we're doing in every fucking second, man. The bottom line is, man, the moment you, every time you find this pocket of like bullshit inside of you, like a blister, it's like your psyche formed a blister around your past. And it's nasty and it's just sitting there festering. And so you go around and you're mad or the world sucks or you're always paranoid or the same shit starts repeating outside of yourself because what you have inside of you is so fucking unbearable to admit that it's there and look into it and really see it and accept that's who I fucking am. That's part of who I am. It's not who I am. It's a piece because you can't look at it in yourself. You start seeing it out here everywhere. Now all around you is the bullshit. That's all you see. That's all you see. You don't see the beauty because you're blinded. That's right, man. And then it gets even worse because your projection starts acting like you're paranoia because people get around you and you're projecting some weird bullshit onto them and they don't like it. So then they start confirming your ignorance and then the next thing you know, downward trajectory and it's like shit, sun, shadows get longer. People actually are fucking you over. People are doing weird shit to you. People are cutting you off in traffic. It's not just like normal causality. There it does seem to be bad luck starts happening all the time. Real bad luck. In the same way good luck happens, there's no way that could have happened. That same kind of bad luck starts happening. Fuck yeah. Yeah, man. Weird shit starts happening. Downward trajectory. Now you ever see Jacob's ladder? Yes. Dude, remember when the subway train goes by and it's like there's weird things and they're going like looking out of the fucking, that shit starts happening. That movie is by the way all about this. So downward trajectory and then you fucking die because you're living a paranoid life and you get shot, you overdose, you do something stupid, you die and so a lot of people to justify what they're doing, they think, yeah, then it's fucking over. But no, no, no, no, the trajectory keeps fucking happening dude and now you're in this realm called the bardo and that's now the same way you're projecting onto the physical world. The projection continues, but now you don't have a body and the projections become what are known as like demons and the demons start ripping you apart. They start eating you and tearing you to bits and like it keeps confirming this bullshit ignorance in the most intense and severe and horrific ways until either you reincarnate and you get born into a fucking like family that is continuing this karmic pattern or it's somewhere along the trajectory. You do what you did in this life, which is you realize who you are or you start working on it or you just start getting the intention that you want that to happen and then shit starts brightening up. I've been working on it for 30 fucking years. I can tell. For 30 years and you finally get this, this piece. That's it. Look what you named your daughter. Mercy. Yeah. Yeah, it's peace. Yeah, man. And it's such a like, and then the other thing is when you do that, I don't mean to keep ranting here, man. I know it's 230. I'm going to keep ranting. Don't want to hold you here, Joey. I just find it very inspiring because the other thing about it is it's one thing to like meet a person and I love seeing a person who's like had a great life and who's like is doing great. That's awesome. It's good. There's it's wonderful. In fact, we all suffer. Ever anyone who's like gotten to a point where they're not selfish to me. That's pretty miraculous. But, you know, this is in the Bible, which in the New Testament, when they talk about the prodigal son goes away, blows all his fucking dough, fucks up his life, fucks around, fucks off, comes back to his father's farm just to work there, but purely like humble, humbled by his, how he's been hurt by the world and his like selfishness. And the father gives him everything. It isn't like punishing now. You know, it's not that thing some people do when you've been a shithead and they never let you forget. Maybe they're like, okay, it's okay, but underneath it, there's this weird tax you're going to be paying for the rest of your life. In that story, the father is like throws a celebration, gives his son everything. I think the other sons are like, what the fuck? We've been here working on the goddamn farm while he's out at our houses, blown all the money and you're throwing up, giving him everything. And the line, I think it's something on the lines of like, that which was lost has been found. You know, you've been here the whole time. You've been found. You've been in my domain. You've been here with me. He was lost, lost, lost, lost. And now he's back and that's redemption, which is that once you look at the thing, pop that fucking blister, deal with the pain in a real way, done. Done. Done. Done. Freedom. Freedom. You did it, you know? And that's why there's always in the Bible, this again and again and again and again and again and again. This thing of like, no, it's cool. Glad to see you again. And it's real. Now you gotta go smoke 20 joints. I'm happy you had me onto that. Joey, thank you so much. It was great to see you. It's great to see you. Congratulations on the birth of your child.

I'm gonna blow my neighbors. I'm gonna blow the postman. I'm gonna blow anyone. Is this a doorknob? No. Where is this? When I get enlightened, I'm gonna wear cooler clothes. I'm gonna wear cooler shoes, brightly colored shoes, like the ones that you see on the people that are cooler than you. When I get enlightened, I'm gonna wear flowing robes, pink flowing robes, call my self tree Duncan, make an incense fall out of my butthole. Long fan is, you can take it.

That medley was brought to you by the Chandler Dancy Mindsprinkler Foundation of San Diego. Water your mind with Chandler Dancy and their premier mind sprinklers. Easily implanted, easily removed. Give the gift of a mind sprinkler to your inner child. They love playing in them. And now this. I wanna thank Purple for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH Friends. It's revolutionary to be comfortable. Follow me here. We live in a post-industrial revolution society where many of us are limping from the dark imprint of an ethical system created by people running factories, treating human beings like animals. If you have a sense that if you're relaxing, you must be doing something wrong. Or if you're feeling comfortable, then maybe you're failing. That means that the dark venom of capitalism has been injected into your metaphysical DNA and is now emitting itself in the form of all these various types of modern guilt that gnaws at the brain of the modern human. And the way to fight back against it is to get comfortable. And one thing you can always count on is how insanely comfortable the purple mattress is. I've got a purple pillow. And I know by now you've probably been ear beaten to the point of feeling nauseated by the number of mattress commercials you've heard out there in the world. But friends, this is real. I'm serious. Order the purple, you don't have to get the mattress if you don't want it. Get the pillow, but dip your toe into the futuristic waters of purple and experience the glory of whatever this technology is. They're gonna tell you what it is. It's called a grid, a stretchy gel material that's amazingly supportive for your backs and legs while cushioning your shoulders, necks and hips. Honestly, to me it does. I don't care what's in it. I don't care if it's a Disney chipmunks that have been captured from an alternate dimension and forced to vibrate at a certain resonance rate so that it feels that good. All I care about is when I lay on my purple, I feel like I'm in Star Trek. It's awesome. You have to give it a try. I would not be bugling their glories if I hadn't experienced it myself because then you would email me and say, what the fuck, man? It's just like a normal mattress or a normal pillow. Why did you lead me astray into some dark, evil, hypnotic mattress maze where I experienced yet again another mattress disappointment? This is an actual sci-fi futuristic mattress and you should try it out. And right now, you can try your purple mattress risk-free with free shipping and returns and financing is available. Purple really is comfort for an uncomfortable world. Right now, you'll get 10% off any order of $200 or more. Go to purple.com slash dunkin' 10. Use promo code dunkin' 10.

I wanna thank all my glorious Patreon subscribers for supporting the DTFH at its core. And I wanna invite you to potentially protect yourself from all these wild animal attacks that have been happening not just in this country, but now it seems to have gone global. And a lot of folks are getting like minor wounds. Some of them are getting infected. Luckily, no rabies as of yet. But good news is my attorneys have instructed me to say is that subscribing to the Dunkin' Dressel Family Hour Patreon will not protect or not protect you from wild animal attacks, small, medium size, or absolutely gigantic. And there is no connection to the DTFH and the many wild animal attacks that have been happening around the planet. There is no connection at all and thus no liability. That being said, it would be wonderful for you to subscribe over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. I mean, even if it was a placebo effect, even if let's say I didn't have a special cursed bell that I found in my grandmother's trunk that she had dredged up from some stupid shipwreck she was in and that thank God she was the only survivor of. I don't have a cursed bell, you know, or maybe I do, but I mean, it would be nuts to say that every time I ring the bell, people who haven't subscribed to my Patreon get attacked by animals. That'd be absolutely insane. And it's not true. It's just a regular Patreon and no harm will come to you. As my attorneys say, should you not subscribe, patreon.com forward slash DTFH, it does not protect or not protect you from wild animal attacks. If you're somebody who watched the Midnight Gospel, and you're already familiar with today's guest, he is David on the Midnight Gospel, and he's David in this dimension, and he's my meditation teacher or Clancy's meditation teacher in the Midnight Gospel and my meditation teacher in this particular sector of the multiverse, he's awesome. And a perfect teacher for me because I want a lot of fireworks. I like fireworks, I want rainbows, I want to read minds, I want to walk through walls, I want to stretch my arms out into space and hug a star. I want to see deities, demigods, devas. I want to witness transmutations of lead into gold. I want perfect tarot card readings. I want to suckle at the nipples of some kind of divine deva that is the source of orgasms in the multiverse. And most importantly, I want to be able to leave my body and fly around the moon and sing with the moon men and take long dips in the astral ocean that they say exists on the moon, which feels like bathing in frothy cherry juice. But because of these desires, I often get distracted from some of the fundamental basic sort of things that go along with meditation, which is a little disappointing for some folks who are sort of hoping for the possibility that they would levitate or that their penises maybe would grow a little bit longer. Or if not grow, they would achieve the ability to vibrate their penises at a higher rate, inducing hyper powerful orgasms in not only their partners, but anyone in the nearby area of where they're making love. This is for me, just what I need. I need a teacher that gives me the most simple instructions because I always want to start on the other side of things. Before I even thought I would be interested in making music, I was already buying modular synthesizers and sort of just diving into like the far end of music production instead of starting with the basics. But David years ago told me maybe I should learn scales on the piano, that that's a great place to start and show me how to do scales on my guitar. And that kind of very simple basic instruction has led to me being able to make music in a way that a few years ago I never thought I would be able to make music. I mean, I don't want to brag, but I've won what 15 Grammys, I lose count. But that same kind of instruction works really well with spiritual practice. And today what you're gonna listen to is the kind of conversation David and I have all the time. It's a conversation between a teacher and a student and it's a conversation that revolves around my current confusion when it comes to meditation and a practice. So if nothing else, I think what you're gonna get out of this is maybe an authentic version of the teacher-student relationship when it comes to Buddhism. And maybe that's gonna be a little different from what you might have expected if you expect like, I don't know, conks, shells being blown or something or well, there actually are bells in this conversation. Now I think about it. Huh, anyway, I'm so lucky to have David in my life. And if you like what you hear, head over to DharmaMoon.com, that's D-H-A-R-M-A-M-O-O-N.com. That's Dave's website. He is giving a teacher training in May. And if you wanna find out what that's about, you can go to an information session on May 5th. And that link is darmamoon.com, slash teacher-training. All the links are gonna be at dunkintrussell.com. And now let's welcome back to the D-T-F-H, David Nicktern. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Wow, wow, wow. It's the dunkintrussell. Dumpintrussell. Dumpintrussell. Dumpintrussell. Dumpintrussell. Dumpintrussell. Dumpintrussell. David, welcome back to the D-T-F-H. It's really nice to see you. We haven't talked in a long time, but it's nice to see your face. How are you doing? Yeah, I feel excellent today. You know, it varies, you know, from moment to moment. Yes. Have you ever noticed that? You better believe it. I've noticed that, sadly. I don't, yeah. Well, wait, wait, it's not just sadly, because sometimes it's good. But I noticed when I asked people how are you, they tell you how they recently were. You know, they're like, how are you? They tell you how they recently were. Have you ever noticed that they started reciting their personal, I was going to say eulogy, but I mean personal history? Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You know, this is an interesting way to dive into something I found on Twitter, which I was really kind of blown away by. So are you familiar with the term multiple personality disorder? I'm more than familiar with the term. I'm familiar with the phenomenon. Okay. Well, so there is now a community that I found on Twitter of people who, number one, they don't want to call it, they don't call it that anymore. They have a new name for it, which is it's not a disorder. It's a system, is what they call themselves. Like a system of, I know it's so cool. And it made me feel really happy for them. I was a psychologist and she had a multiple personality disorder because that's what they called it then, a client. And she would, you know, keeping confidentiality, she would just, you could just tell of all her clients, that was the one that really blew her mind because she, you know, as she told me, it really is as though a new person had entered into this person. So she might be talking to an adult and then talking to a little kid and then talking to someone of a different gender than talking to, but it wasn't as though, I could tell that she was so blown away by how it wasn't like someone's pretending to be someone else. They're literally other people inhabiting the same body. What do you, what do you think about that? And reference, especially to what you were saying where people are talking about what has happened right up until that moment. They're also talking from some version of themselves that might not be there in a few seconds. I mean, that's kind of Buddhism 101, isn't it in a way? Yeah. That the identity, I want to talk specifically about the ID, which is what you're talking about because I have some experience with it, but I guess from a... Wait, what did you call it? Dissociative identity disorder. Okay, okay, gotcha. And because there's more to say about it from that perspective, but the notion that your identity is already fictitional in some extent because it just, it's based on expired premises all the time. Yeah. It's like if it was a driver's license, you'd need to get it renewed every minute. Like you get stopped by a cop and he says, this driver's license is three days old. So you can, you can operate this vehicle. You may not remember how to do it. Yeah. But it's so real. But it's so real. It's so real. You know, I was, I'm always messing around with some of the ideas that you've taught me or ideas that I've picked up from connections that you've made for me. So, you know, now I'm listening to A Smile at Fear. It's a book by... Oh yeah. It's so good. But I'm sort of, I'm just fascinated by the initial experience before the personality gets ahold of it. Oh, okay. This is good. This is, you know, there's a lot of ways to refer to that experience with words, but obviously it's beyond words, isn't it? Yes. Well, I think, well, that's what, that's deaf. Thank you. That's one of my confusions is, you know, as I'm sort of, I got coffee today. It wasn't that good. I'm sorry, because I yapped about this to our meditation group, Journey and Abortum. So any of y'all listening, I'm sorry you have to listen to this boring thing, but I'm tasting it and just noticing the story I'm telling myself, because it wasn't that good. The story I was telling myself was, well, I guess society's falling apart. Like it took, you know what I mean, in a millisecond, it just, it was, it actually was not bad. The coffee wasn't terrible, but my mind immediately went to the apocalypse. And then for a second, it was like, I could peel it all back, and I was just tasting coffee, and it was great. And it was a spring morning. There's birds, the wind's blowing. It's just great. Is that... So you changed the narrative? Well, yeah, I just tried to be in that first moment before the slavering dog of my mind grabbed it and started like shaking it around to see if it could snap its neck. Well, of course, then you can shift to, you know, a kind of glowing narrative. It's essentially the same phenomenon, a mirror image, you know. So that's why, you know, in the Six Realms, you have those god realms and those hell realms, and they're really both considered to be fictions of the habitual mental, you know, fabrication. So is this the same idea as Samsara and Nirvana are the same thing? Yeah, they're, well, they arise, they co-arise from the same ground of awareness. They do. How would you define Nirvana? Without bringing Kurt Cobain into it, right? I knew you were going to... I did a Nirvana joke already this morning. I can't help it. Well, Nirvana is sometimes no sort of transcending sorrow or suffering or struggle. So it sometimes could be thought of as peace, attaining a certain kind of peaceful state. But in the kind of more, you know, nuanced way of talking about it, there's nothing to dwell on in it. So it's not, oh, and now I got to a good place. If you're dwelling on the peaceful quality, then there just becomes another fixation, doesn't it? Yes. Yes. So I mean, it's a more albeit, a more pleasant one, you know, superficially speaking, but so what you're really talking about is the ground from which samsara and nirvana arise. That's what you're really talking about today. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And that's, that's talked about a number of different ways. There's the word primordial could be used, unconditional, you know, even basic. And in terms of catching that moment, before either relative frame of reference arises, there is a certain freshness to that, that quality of mind that everybody can experience. Everybody has it, but it hasn't been identified so much for, for a lot of us, you know, as, as a, so you go right past it. That's what I see. This is where I felt this immense frustration when I, because I did realize when I was doing the rosy story about what was happening, that it was the same thing. And then for a moment, I really did feel kind of nauseating and, and immensely burdensome and impossible to stop. And, and, you know, you know, it was like a micro panic of like, Oh fuck, it's, it's always just telling this some story. Right. And, and so then I, then I wondered, is this why, and some of the scriptures that I've been listening to, they say you should treat the problem as though you had, your hair was on fire. Hmm. Hmm. Well, in that, you know, that that's recognizing the strength of certain habits that are pulling you back and back and back into a cyclic, you know, cycling through kind of situations. So one way of talking about Nirvana is relatively, you would be getting off of that wheel, off of that cycle and there could be a sense of relief, you know, from it, but it's temporary relief. If it's relief, it's got to be temporary. You know, if you take aspirin, you know, the headache goes away for a while, but you didn't remove the source of the headache. Did you? No. You know, so the, the irony of it to me is that lurking, co-mingling, let's say, co-emerging with that feeling of the endlessness of this habitual thing is a feeling of total freshness in the moment at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. It's like twins. Yeah. So we would like to, you know, pick our twin and kind of vote on it, but there's something about the co-rising of the complete possibility of freshness of experience, which is always available, always present. And then the inevitability of us kind of like, you know, reforming it into some kind of familiar landscape, pleasant or unpleasant. That freshness of experience. Is that what children are just naturally experiencing? Oh, that's the age old one. Yeah. I don't, not quite because otherwise children would be Buddhists, you know, they'd be enlightened. They seem close to that sometimes. Well, you're a new dad. Yeah. You know, I mean, you could say it's some kind of fresh start and they come out, they smell so clean and they, you know, they look so innocent in a way, but you know, wait till they're like five or eight years old or something, you know, and wait till they're teenagers. Oh, I keep hearing the teeth. But, you know, good news is I still got a little bit of time before they start growing hair on their face, but that is, you know, a little bit of, they start growing hair on their face, but that, Thank you, Bluetue, not just for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH, but allowing me a pharmaceutical method through which I can produce hard core pandemic boners.

Sometimes I see this, sometimes when I'm sitting and before my mind catches up with itself, there is this sense of familiarity with something that I associated with a place and a time, but then suddenly there it is, but I'm in my older body, but it's just as fresh. And I think fresh is the best way to put it. There's this sense of like, wow, wow, this is amazing, but then it goes away in an instant, because right away I'm analyzing it. Right away I'm like, oh, what the fuck was that? That's the exact same way I used to feel when I was at summer camp, completely unburdened by any kind of adult worries, smelling pine trees and a young body. And I used to think, oh, well, that feeling, that's because you were young. But then it comes back minus the being connected or dependent on some situation. And I always wondered to myself, is that what you're talking about? Well, you know, we're exploring together, right? Yes. So I think there's a three tier process happening, not just two tiers. So the first tier would just be the freshness of the experience. You can experience that, you know, if somebody, when you have thunder or lightning or something like that, that's a pretty good, it catches you unprepared. Right. And so you actually just experience it in a way that is closely connected to some kind of total spontaneous brilliance and also some kind of utter panic that there's nobody there to experience it. So those two experiences co-rise. Then there's us weaving yards and yards of fabric explaining what just happened. Oh, that was lightning. You know, the thunder will come along in about 0.6 seconds. Tell me how far away the, you know, the event was because the time between you, when you see the lightning and you hear the thunder, you can actually calculate how far the rainstorm is from you. Remember that? Yeah. Technology, yeah. And then you start thinking like, oh, shit, you know, my car is not weatherproofed or whatever. You know, and then by the end of, by the end of like, you know, 15 milliseconds, you're into like Nightmare Alley or some kind of like, metaphysical thing, yeah, whatever. You know, then there's a third tier though, which is the entity or the quality of awareness that is noticing all that happening and kind of fundamentally thinking there's a problem with it. Yes. And that's the little gremlin that we go after first. Yes. That little judging, harsh, nudgy, you know, critical, manipulative, conniving, your way towards some kind of, you know, imagined freedom later, you know. Yes. So we, the way we do unpeel that layer is just by being kind and being, you know, okay, all right, this is part of the experience I'm having right now and maybe I can relax into actually just exploring the experience itself rather than how do I get out of it. Right. Yeah. That takes a lot of patience though in gentleness and that's not something that's advertised as much as the precision element of it, you know. What do you mean not advertise? Well, you know, people go, I think people go, you could have clarity of mind. You know, that's the prize for doing all this stuff. Oh, yes, yes. But the prize might be just first, just developing some kind of kindness towards oneself or towards a situation as a whole and then that gives you a lot more relaxation to lean into it a little bit. Okay, yeah, I see what's going on there. And then you'll, I think, see that the commentary and the freshness are co-mingling and co-arising from a ground that is completely pure and completely timeless, essentially. Yeah. And so your face, yeah, you just, yeah, you just go, and there's a lot of letting go at that point, you know. Yes. There is listening to the smiling at fear. I really like the way he points in the direction of this like massive vulnerability and how problematic that is for so many people because that thing, that kindness that you're talking about is often viewed with some sense of paranoia. If I, you know, if I get kind to myself or if I do this kindness thing with other people who my story is they're annoying the fuck out of me at the very least, then I'm just going to get walked all over and I won't be able to function in the world in this kind of vulnerable state. And he keeps pointing to that vulnerable state. And now, you know, I remember in one of your classes, it was someone was asking you a question, and I've heard it now more than a few times where someone's like, well, I've been meditating and I have a regular active practice, but now all that's happening is I'm feeling heartbroken over everything. Like I don't know how to not feel this heartbreak. I wasn't feeling before. And really like the person who asked you there, it wasn't like they were saying it to like, you know, humble brag. They were legitimately, they were legitimately, I don't want to say disturbed, but I don't know of another way to put it because they had this sense of every, like recognizing some like level of suffering in the world that they hadn't seen before and they felt sort of out of their element. The word comes from my poignancy. You know, a lot of great things are poignant, touch that kind of poignant quality. And sometimes we call it a genuine heart of sadness. It has a sadness mixed into the sensitivity of it. But nobody would think sadness was part of the picture. Nobody in the initial phases of, you know, when you're talking about your classes, I don't think you're saying, come achieve a genuine heart of sadness. Oh, that's a good one. I think we'll change the text. Change the ad. The two things, yeah, we don't say that. We don't say come and get properly bored. Yeah. You know, but we could. And when, you know, if people, I guess we still want to get people to come and... But the fact is, if you do meditate the way we meditate, the style and practice that this tradition is, there would be an inevitable outcome of genuine heart of sadness. And there would be inevitable outcome of hot and cool boredom that we've talked about before. It would be almost impossible to expect somebody to go through this process and not taste those two experiences. And then there would be an inevitable quality of suddenly free from fixed mind, which is the third, let's put that in as a third element. Right. And that is, you put those together, you get some kind of cocktail, you know? Wait, does a genuine heart of sadness ever go away? Well, you look at all these great bodhisattvas, and that's what you see basically. I guess if you took the Arhat exit ramp, maybe you could. What's that ramp? You know, I'm free from fixation, bye. Right. If you didn't take the next step of like, that the bodhisattvas take of looking at the world with great kind of sensitivity and compassion and realizing A, that you do care. Yeah. And B, that it's somehow a logical next step in the evolution of your own practice to recognize interdependence and recognize that you're tied to the beings and everybody can recognize it because they have kids and stuff like that. So that's where you go, well, wait a minute, in case you want to nuke that right away or neutralize it, what about how you feel about a friend of mine just lost her cat and found it, but she's totally heartbroken for a cat. So we have that in us, we can't get rid of it. It's called bodhicitta, we can't get rid of it. See, but this is, again, this is not to say that you definitely didn't mislead me. I mean, there was never a time where I don't think this was like off the table or anything like that, but you know, I was talking to Erin the other day and she is not, things have gotten better now, but our second one has been giving her rough time. She's breastfeeding and so he's been keeping her up. He was, things have gotten better, but has just like a complete, there's a complete wrong thing to say to try to comfort her. I say, don't worry, he won't be a baby much longer and she just starts crying and says, why would you say that to me? You know, and I realized like, oh yeah, that's the truth, but it's so sad. And that to me was that heart of sadness in her and in me too, I just, I can't, it's so... Well, Duncan, just friend to friend here. Your line was, but he'll always be your baby. Too late. Well, it'll come around again for child number three. Yeah, but you know, every... And that's kind of true by the way. Yes. Ask any parent with adult children. It's true, I hope. I hope that's true. You can't, all these moments with foresties, you know, we go on hikes or he, you know, I can't bear it, I can't deal with it because I just, you know, I was taking him up to the forest. I had heard Annie Lamotte say, if you want your children to love God, get them to love nature. And so I'm pointing around to nature and I'm saying, this is God. And he goes, I love God. He goes, want to hold God, want to hold God. Yeah, and I know what he meant because that's how I feel too. It's like, I want to hold this, not just because I want to feel it in my arms, but because I don't want it to keep going away. You know, I don't... And that's two different things. Wow. Wanting to contact it and wanting to, you know, to freeze dry it are two different things. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of letting go and connect. When you connect fully, there's a lot of letting go in it. It's ironic, but it's true. Today's program is brought to you by Athletic Greens.

Why is that at least initially so difficult? I mean, to me, this really is like a... It's exhaust... I don't want to say it's exhausting, but it's just... You know, when you hear all the... You know, you hear the double truths and all the... The cause of suffering is attachment and all that. And you hear it, and it's like, yeah, yeah. Of course, I knew that all along. But then when you experience that clinging, even when you don't want to, it's really quite painful. Is that why the sadness? Why the heart of sadness? Well, you know, if you wanted to understand it better by contemplating it, you could say, what do you mean by sadness? What do you mean by that? What does that mean? Because there's other words you could connect to it, which is a sort of sense of connection, compassion, concern, love. You know, those all those words also are in there. Right. What's wrong with that? You know, what's wrong with all that? That's pretty good. I love all those. Those are great. You know, it's just, it's like, there's different words for it. This is actually something in the last podcast I chatted about with the email, my friend, because I've been reading this book, The Myth of Sisyphus. Have you read this book by Camus? Not for a long, long time. Well, the discussion was Camus identifies this thing called absurdity, which in the whole conversation, what I had was, is that duke? Is that the, you know, is that, is that the existentialist version of duke? That they found it, but through the Western aperture or something, you know, and so they're calling it absurdity, a sense of not fitting in, not belonging. But then in a thread about Camus on Reddit, somebody was calling it the big sad. Like, I was wondering, you know, that was the conversation. I was wondering what you thought about that is, is that, do you think that in the, you know, in the West, and you hear different versions of it, but this general sense of a kind of malaise, a modern malaise that sets upon a person where they don't really feel like it's, they feel pointless or something, useless. Is that the same thing as the heart of sadness? No, no. Because it's not debilitating in that way. It's energizing. It's an invitation. It's the warrior's sword. It's an opportunity. It's magnificent. It's profound, you know. So, you know, the word schlep would never arise in that space. You don't schlep through the sadness. You would identify with it to the point where you're inseparable from it. It's a gateway. It's an opening. It's, you know, you see the difference, you know, in terms of, you're not adding an extra layer onto it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Because it's, the extra layer is just more of the story. You're talking about the, just the primordial it-ness of it. Is that what you mean? Well, you know, I was, I'm thinking of my, I have quite a few Indian musician friends, you know, Indian music, and there was a great musician named Sultan Khan who has passed away. Very famous. He actually, I think he might have played with the Beatles at one point, you know, and, but he is a classical, great Indian Seranghi player. And two of his students were on my Dharma Moon record label, Palguni Shah and Gaurab Shah. Wow. And they took me to meet Sultan Khan, who was, and they, they just, he's their guru. So they, they touch his feet and they, they, he adores them. They adore him and he teaches them. And it's very strenuous that tradition. It's very strenuous. And when he's playing, sometimes he plays the Seranghi, which is a violin-like Indian instrument. You know, it has a sound, it has a sound of human voice. Yeah. So he can sing or play. It's like the same thing. It's very, very good. Wow. And it's a certain thing. And you go, ah, I mean, people are literally groaning out loud, including me. Yeah. Yeah. Because he's tapping it for all of us. He's taken all of our fingers and putting them on the, the clitoris of creation, you know, and the heart of creation. Yeah. And it's like everybody's melting into it. And that's his job. That's cool. You know, and, and maybe, maybe he can do that all day long. I don't know. I mean, that's a great, a great adapt who can do that all day long, but he can do it when he's playing the Seranghi. I'll tell you that. And it's not mistakeable. So I think there's a, um, you know, um, a possibility to experience that as a kind of very positive, desirable experience. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, yes, I wouldn't, in a million years, if there was, even if there were a possibility to not have that, I would not in a million years trade it or take it out or remove it from, if it were even possible. But Trump, uh, in smiling of fear, he does very accurately point out when it happens, when people start feeling that a sense of, he says the way he put it was, it feels as though your ego has been deflowered is what he says. He says that in the way he puts it is, and it's very strange, but I love it. He's so poetic. That's what I love about him is his ability to just go into this beautiful poetic, like way of explaining things. And to the point where you don't even know he's done it until you're like, wait, what? Cause it can be very analytical. And then suddenly he's saying, it's as though someone has placed a moon in your heart. Do you know what I'm talking about, David? And now you have a moon in your heart and you have to deal with that now. You have to deal with, there's a, there's this thing in your heart now that it's there and you might want to shut it down, but it's too late because you've already, once you've felt it, you've, that's it. And this thing, if you've been someone who's completely been up in their heads or in their identity or their ego, and then suddenly there's this other thing, which I do see what you mean by portal. There is a sense of like, no, wait, wait, when did that happen? And why it's too late now, but what the, what the, what happened? And I know it's, I'm sorry if I seem a little clumsy talking about it because my experience with it is still very limited, fleeting. And, and, and whenever, whenever I have the sense that it's not there, I want, I want it back. I, I, it's all that's, I could, I would only want that string played on my Sauronki, you know, touch the clitoris. It is, it is totally, can totally correlate and, you know, sync up with what you're saying. And then I'm tempted to just sort of add another layer to the view, which is that it has a consort companion, which is called Suddenly Free from Fixed Mind, which is the sort of a blade of non fabrication that there's nothing to do about it. There's nothing to do with it. And it's only experienced very, very instantaneously. So the minute you start to kind of try to formalize it or stabilize your relationship to it or anything like that, the blade of Suddenly Free from Fixed Mind comes in and puts you in touch with even worse with the genuine harvest sadness. They, they accentuate, they resonate each other. And it's sort of like absolute and relative bodhicitta really, you know, which we've talked about a bunch. I don't think I've had that yet. I don't know. I got really frustrated. That was, I was never had Suddenly Free from Fixed Mind. Well, I was doing that, you know, 30 day meditation that we were working on and I started, I started, I started having this like wild. It was wild. It was beautiful. I was going running up in the woods listening to Dilgo Kinsi, Rinpoche's book on the Bodhisattva. You know, I'm talking about the, the, are you getting a call? I was. I was. Friends, if you work with David long enough, he trains you so when he rings the bell, you start talking. It was a really like beautiful time in my life. And, and I, like, I got a mint. I was meditating out there. I'm like, I was having this like, it was wild. It was so powerful. And then I was getting frustrated because I couldn't do it again. Like it was like something happened sitting out in the forest, meditating, meditating, something was happening. I mean, I know everyone says that. I know it's annoying. And it was so powerful. And then suddenly it just, I lost it. I lost it. Not that it hasn't come back since completely at unexpected times and flickering moments, but I don't know. I don't know how to explain it other than it was just. So frustrating. I don't know. Can you help me? What does it mean? Or is it nothing? Is it just my mind or maybe, maybe I didn't even, maybe nothing happened at all. You know, and I just want something to have happened. Maybe this and maybe that, but in terms of just, you know, method and. The view. The idea that any particular state of mind could arise. That is worth trying to create or, or attaching to it. In a, in a sort of full sense. The best gesture towards it is disowning it and letting it go. Yeah. That's where I was. That's the way I was taught. That's what I was taught. So I'm teaching it back because I've tasted it. So in other words, one of the traps that I think many meditators get into is they think there's a state of meditation. Yes. That's what they're going to get to. And then that will be somehow better than whatever state they think they're in otherwise. And so a lot of energy goes into sort of manipulating the consciousness in particular ways. Yes. And I do believe that's the runway that the Buddha ran out of, you know, just there is no further manipulation going on. There's just a kind of resting in, in the arising and dissolving of phenomena and appreciating them. You know, that's okay to feel the poignancy of it and all that, but there's no clinging. Yeah. And, you know, now all kinds of experiences, by the way, people have described, I had a really interesting podcast with somebody who's coming from Theravadan tradition. We were talking about the Jhana states and, you know, reaching certain levels of the consciousness has really settled down. So there's not a lot of thoughts, for example, and not even a sense of eye particular. But even those states in terms of the way that we were trained, you don't do anything other than the disownative arises. And you take your next breath or you, you, you, you allow a kind of open, open ended quality to things to just be there. So at the end of the day, you're doing less and less manipulating as you go along. See, that's where I was getting frustrated with you. Because with me. Yes. Because I was having these like, I wasn't even there. No, I know, but I would talk to you about it. And that's, that was, that was basically what you were doing. You were saying is like, Oh yeah, disown it. You were, you had different ways of saying it, but every way that you were saying it was really either like frustrating or enraging or confusing. Because it was like. Well, how about right now? Does it seem confusing? No, right now it doesn't feel as, as confusing as it did then. But the disowning part, I guess, because there's a lot of people, there's a lot of negative connotation wrapped up in disowning. It's a parent does do a child. They don't love anymore. And I, and, and also before maybe you clarify that word, you know, this is something that as I'm listening to smiling at fear, he's talking about, you know, the brute, breathe, the breathing pattern, the exhalation, the moment before inhalation, disown that. And both of these uses of the word in some way make sense, but can be really confusing. Maybe you could help clarify that. Well, the gentle version of disown is letting go. And the reason he says disown is because people like you and me will make a big deal about a particular experience that they have during the practice and then get all twisted up into knots trying to reproduce it. Yes. And, and, and you can see how that's, you know, it'd be like, I'm thinking of Michael Jordan for some reason, you know, it goes to mine. Like one of those triple, you know, flip dunks. He doesn't go in there going, I think I'm going to do a triple flip dunk again. He's just, he leaves the ground. And that was one of these people who could fly. It seemed like, you know, like Miller Ray, but he just literally seemed, he's the only person I've seen who could actually get higher in the level of a jump. Yeah. I didn't know that was physically possible. You know what I'm talking about? Oh yeah. It's, trust me, I've seen that. He's levitating a little bit. I've thought, I think many of us have suspected that was happening because you look at it and you think there, some physicists, please explain whatever that was. Yeah. But there has to be some kind of, not like, oh, I remember how this when I did this in the, in the Coliseum, you know, with Jack guarding me, you know, there has to be some moment of just, he's just like having that whatever experience it is right now and opening and surrendering into it. I think it's very, it's very hard to reproduce phenomenon, especially when you have a real target in mind. We do that all the time though, right? You know, that's, you know, played a great solo, like let's say you're playing music, you play a great solo and then you go, the band leader says, take another one and you go, oh fuck, I don't have another one. You know? Yeah. But I've seen players like Michael Brecker or somebody like that. No problemo. That's because he disowned the last solo immediately. Okay. Yeah. I, I get it. I get what you're saying. It's, it's kind of like a fractal, you know, anything sweet. This is my, this is a problem I have. Anything sweet that's happening to me, including our friendship, pretty soon I'll be like, David's not immortal. What do you think? He's not going to be around forever. And you know, with my, you know, like, my son, he's going to grow up. I'm going to die. All this beauty. Ah, gone. Yeah. And then I just, it's, I can't, I want to be a person who can just be okay with that. But I'm not, I'd say it's enraging. It's, it's, I think that's where my mind does connect with us. Absurdity does connect with like, this is fucked up, man. Like, how can you have this, this potential for beauty in the world? And then also it's just gone in the blink of an eye sometimes. Let's call it what it is. It's the ultimate mind fuck. What you're describing there. I mean, then there is no bigger one than that, that you could experience this extreme bliss and exhilaration and there's nothing in it to hold on to. So that is where I try to like be very true to, to the Buddhist way of talking about it is a lot of people say, oh, Buddhism's so flat and dry, there's no bliss in it. But that's definitely not true, particularly of any Buddhism, but also particularly of Bajjana Buddhism. You are supposed to taste the nectar, the bliss. But you cannot hold on to it. So there, that's what we call the union of bliss and emptiness. And I talk about the thumb blue in the face. What a complete statement that is. You know how big I am into synchronicity and tendril and stuff like that. Yes. Right. So, so right before I started talking to, you know, Krishna Das just sent me a text. We, we, like you and I do, you know, we'll read something and send it across. Yeah. And this is a teacher named Sonsar Kensei Rinpoche. So he was a student of your, your, the teacher you like so much, the Dilgo Kensei Rinpoche. And he's a popular teacher in the West and he's also a filmmaker. And I had, I had the interesting experience of being the music supervisor on one of his feature films. Wow. So I hung out with him in a completely professional capacity. He didn't really want to be Rinpocheing at that point. He wanted to be the film director and I was the music soup. So listen to what he says though. And he's, he's can be very deliberately and intentionally provocative, but it's so relevant to what you were just saying that I'm going to read it. Is that okay? Yeah, please. So this is from Sonsar Jamyang Kensei Rinpoche. One of the main reasons we practice the Dharma is to prepare ourselves for a certain death. For some, it is the only reason they practice, but that reason alone will make their Dharma practice worthwhile. These days, various aspects of the Dharma like mindfulness are becoming more and more popular, but rarely as a preparation for death and definitely not as a preparation for what lies beyond death. Modern people meditate for every reason under the sun, except the most important one. How many Vipassana students meditate to prepare for death? And how many practice because they want to put an end to the cycle of death and rebirth for good? Most people meditate because they want to become better managers or find partners or feel happy or because they long for a calm, stress-free mind and life. For them, meditation is a way of preparing for life, not death, and is therefore no less mundane than their otherworldly pursuits like shopping, eating out, exercising and socializing from living is dying, how to prepare for dying, death and beyond. Wow. So, I mean that of course, you know, and the teachers are out there, you could quote Mingyu Rinpoche and, you know, they talk about happiness and peace and finding appreciation in life. To me, it's not one or the other. I'll just go on the record of saying, I dig this perspective and in some ways it's an ultimate perspective because it comes right out of what you were just saying. It's like, God, I'm going to have all these experiences and then I'm going to die. Yeah. You know, it's true, but I think it doesn't, it's the real thing you want to contemplate is impermanence more than just purely physical death, what does impermanence really mean? Right. And then against the backup of impermanence, how do you actually experience things in a way that's enriching and you could even say fulfilling, you know, or enjoying. Well, yeah, that's what I like. I mean, that's the problem is like, here I am out, you know, I'm out in the forest with my kid. He's just having fun jumping in streams and like seeing butterflies. I'm, you know what I mean? My mind is like, you're going to die when I will die. I can't cling to this moment. And, you know, obviously I'm not saying that. I'm just like, you know, don't go there. You'll probably fall. Come over here. You know, but still it's happening there. I mean, is this, I feel like this is like something toddlers have to deal with all the time is they're looking at their parents wondering what is that shadow that just crossed their face? Yeah, why is that person so anxious? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And I would love to just like, you know, I wouldn't, I don't want to be haunted by this sense of like, or, and I don't want to be haunted by my own greed. I don't want to be haunted by all this stuff. I would like to have just that primary experience. But yeah, I can't. And also the whole death thing and the med preparation for death thing. I've never been into that. That's even though I like, I always get annoyed when I hear things like what you just read in the sense of like, don't tell me my workouts are mundane, sir. You know what I mean? Don't tell me that when I'm working out. It's like a miracle. You know what I mean? Like it's insane that I've managed to get myself to work out. So you know what I mean? Like always feel when someone starts mundanifying stuff, then I get annoyed. You know, and also clearly if somebody takes the perspective offered there and says, therefore, life is not worth living. Therefore, we should be depressed all the time. That's called nihilism. That is not Buddhist either. So really, really, you know, we've talked about this a million times with eternalism and nihilism being extreme views. And, you know, it depends on, I think what, what, what so I'm sorry. I can't see what you're saying in the West. We tend to be a little more towards the eternalist side. Yes, we want to immortalize even the experience of buying, you know, a cup of coffee, a cappuccino. You know, we want to turn it into like an immortalizing and permanent blissful experience. Yes. You know, so I think he takes his blade out then. Right. It's a counterweight. Right. And maybe, maybe he also, you know, who knows if you can say this about somebody like that? Because he's also very kind and can be very gentle and supportive. But, you know, different teachers have kind of, let's say a different and like, for example, Dilko Kenscher would say something like that and it would sound like he was kissing you on the forehead like a little baby. Right. You know, and, and, you know, so the middle way, it keeps coming back of, you know, if you feel like there's too much tightness from holding on, then you practice, you know, releasing or letting go. If there's a lack of gentleness, you can cultivate that. If there's a lack of precision in your practice, you can cultivate that. And in a way, you're your own meditation teacher. Right. That way. Right. Yeah. You know, there's not, you're saying there, there's no fixed method from moment to moment. There's a lot of skillful means though that have been cultivated. And in my mind, it's unwise to just go like, I'll just reinvent the wheel here all over again. Millions of people have turned past by with, with three year old boys and running in the forest, you know, I don't care what any of them said, you know what I mean? I, I'm just going to start from scratch here. Like that doesn't seem to be all that intelligent, you know, either. Yeah. What? And there's the other side of that coin is I'll just do what my parents said, you know, just that's not the way either. Yeah, no. No. But tell me this, do you ever, this is something that is, I've always thought about with this stuff. And I saw Chokyum Jumbo Rinpoche say it in a lecture. He just kind of casually said, maybe this isn't real. Like maybe this isn't anything. It might not. You know, but it was his, he meant it. He wasn't being like saying it, but you know, it's real. He meant it. Like he was disowning, I guess, in that moment. No, no, that's beyond that's like, it's got a got it. It's already, I'm, that's called illusory. There's a certain practices that are based on actually kindling or igniting your sense of the illusory quality and things like the dream yoga and the practice. And it's not too, again, it's not nihilistic. It's not saying, well, the whole thing is meaningless, but we have solidified it more than it actually is probably undoubtedly. So, but do you, right. But when you agree with that, that we've solidified reality probably more than it naturally is. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. I mean, look at our, look at it concrete. Look at what we, what we do. We try to freeze and hold and, you know, that to me, that, that seems to be one of the great dangers facing our species is not annihilation, but permanent. Like that via through some technological system, an ability to somehow, at the very least, expand the experience of selfness much, much further than the human lifetime is some kind of like, which would be viewed as like, Holy shit, immortality. But sometimes I wonder if like, oh my God, is that like the apocalypse? The apocalypse isn't the annihilation of everything. It's the annihilation of change. So it's just some permanent never ending. You know what I mean? Like that's the way. Well, that's a description of a hell realm actually in Buddhist terms. Yeah. You could, you could have a kind of licorice and lollipops in it. But at a certain point in your mind would go like, oh my God, you know, I've created a kind of frozen, unchanging experience here. And God, just as I said that I got a little white butterfly just floated across the window, you know, suddenly free from fixed mind. Yeah. Yeah, I got you. I see what you're saying. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You know what? The second bell, I think helped me understand what you're saying. The first one, not so good. The second bell. No, right. I see. Right. And it kind of brings us back to what we were talking about in the beginning, which is, you know, it's this concretization of self that, that, you know, and what is that which creates almost a phony quality in the sense of like, you're always having to be this thing just because you used to be that thing and then you're putting that in front of in front of people over and over again. And then when you're not doing that, they're like, are you all right? And it's, you know what Duncan, that brings us right back to our first, you remember the first part of this conversation? Yes. About multiple personality. Yes. So you know, you know me, I like threads and, you know, following through. So the personality that, and I have just want to share that I have experienced firsthand, some of what you're talking about with them, like your mom did with, with a meditation student, not necessarily with a quote on patient, but, and with a couple of people who had that, had that condition. And it is a really stunning thing to experience. Like, like Oracle or challenge, you know, channeling, they are not necessarily aware of the other other personalities that emerge. So the therapy for that is often integrating. They'll show them videos of the other person. They'll, they'll try to get the personalities to meet up a little bit and reintegrate because they've been fractured. Right. And usually from, obviously from trauma, most often from sexual trauma, you know, that's severe and in the, in the, in the, in the child. And the person cannot abide in that field of experience. So they create an altar, you know, that, that somehow is a way of navigating through that experience. And then that process has developed a life of its own. And so people are, you know, shifting voices. I've read about this. There's stunning things. Their eye color can change. Yes. They can be allergic. One can be allergic to a bee sting. The other one's not. Right. The swelling just disappears. I mean, there's a radical aspect to this, but it's really saying it's, it's a window onto the fact that the personas that we have created are not dissimilar from that in a way. We're just not as rigidly, we're moving more gracefully from one persona to another. Right. You know, right. It's kind of more, more layered. Yeah. But don't you find that you're like, if you're, um, well, like for example, when I'm being a musician or something like that and hanging with, you know, the music people, there's this kind of different energy. I might use different speech. Yeah. Talk a little, hang a little different way. You know, I'm sure when you get with your comedian friends, don't you sort of like have a, you know, a certain part of yourself that may come out more. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. No, I, no, I, this is, yeah, I like that. I, you know, I, I, I think it's, I love, that's one of the things through this working with you that I've really, that has been a kind of a relief really is just like the realization of, oh yeah, there isn't any kind of thing here that's, it's fixed as I thought it was. I mean, that's a really quite liberating, mostly. But you know, but then you have a kid and then you're just like, fuck. I don't, I don't want this to go away. And I don't want that kid, I don't want this child to suffer in the world. You know that, you know, I'm talking about, you're a dad. You know, when you start getting the feeling. I'm a grandpa. You're a grandpa. And you start thinking, this, this kid's going to have to like have an accountant one day. You know what I mean? This kid's going to have to like go through all the things, you know, the kid, like all the things that make up a human life. And you want to, you know what I mean? Well, it's classic, but you know, Duncan, when Ethan, my son, Ethan got to be 21 and kind of, you know, was out and graduated from college and was out on his own. And I was still anxious about his ability to do, you know, he's a grown man. He's, I'm still anxious about his ability to generate his own livelihood, take care of himself, be safe out in the world. So I had a little conversation with him where I said, you know, I just want to apologize to you, Ethan, for some of this anxiety that I projected onto you. It's not really about you. It's really about me. Yeah. That's a good dad. I actually said that to him. That's a good dad. And, you know, I do want you to go out and thrive and find good companionship and great place to live. Part of that also is I don't want you back at this point because I did enough. Right. So I'm willing to own my piece of the anxiety. And you live, you can, I think, you know, how parents can be, they can be too anxious around the kids and then the kid picks that up. Yes. But it's hard because like my mother, for example, couldn't was too anxious to come to the playground and watch me play on the, you know, what they call the jungle gym. Yes. And so she couldn't do that. So she exempted herself from that activity rather than project her anxiety onto me because she knew it would be toxic for me. That's cool. Yeah. That's, you know, Erin will tell me just because sometimes I'll start telling her some of the stuff that Forrest and I did out in the woods. And she'll say, don't tell, just don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me that, you know, because, because it's, you know, mothers get a little more like flipped out by that, you know. You do got to let the little sweeties, you know, fall or you got to like let them do their thing, you know. Yeah. Wait till he's like 45 and one of you is still doing that. It's just, that's why I say he's going to be your baby forever. Talk about genuine heart of sadness and just think about it. You're going to look at that person when they're 45. I mean, Ethan's 43 and I look at him and I can see him as a little baby. It's superimposable. And I know that that gives him, that doesn't make him comfortable. He's going to like get that projection off of me. I'm taking care of the whole thing right now. And I don't need you thinking about me that way. And then probably also maybe there's a little bit of sweetness in it too. Now, do you have time for one more question? I know you have a busy schedule. I have time for 10 more questions. No, I don't. I'm good. I cleared the decks for you. Thank you, David. This is something that I've tried to square with the practice that you've taught me. But then I just wonder if you could maybe talk a little bit about the magical side of Vajrayana Buddhism and because I think a lot of people when they hear Tantric Buddhism, maybe some people who take your awesome classes in their minds are like, when's it going to get to the Tantric? You know, that aspect that we all have heard about that seems to not, it doesn't come up as much as a lot of us would probably like. You know, the magical side, six hour orgasms specifically. God, that sounds oppressive. Okay, three hours. Final offer. Yeah, I mean, well, there's a perfect example in a way of one of the great things about orgasms is that they're impermanent. Right. You get a good nap in afterwards, you know, you feel refreshed. No. This is what I want to talk to you about. See, but you're dodging, you're dodging and a lot of the, and I get it. And forgive me if it's an inappropriate question or but with this particular style of Buddhism, there is for sure, and a reservoir of secret info regarding like sexuality, human sexuality, the orgasm, the, the goddess and the, you know, even one of the statues is it's people humping. You know what I'm talking about? It's the person in the lotus position. Someone's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not humping. They're in union and they represent sort of masculine and feminine energetic aspects of one thing coming together in union. So it's usually the references. It can be done as a physical practice. I don't do it, but people have done it for sure over the centuries. I mean, Jack Airwag writes about it in Dharma Bums, this yab yum thing. You know what I'm talking about? Like, yeah, you know, look. The energies of the world are coming together in that kind of way. And I mean, here's the twist. If you want to have union in that way, you can't stay separate and have it. What do you mean? Don't get both. Well, I want the magic. Show me the magic. Yes. The magic is that you're not clinging so hard to somebody there being needing to trip out and have some kind of awesome experience because you haven't yet tuned into the phenomenal quality of the ordinary experience. So we do talk about ordinary magic and I like talking about ordinary magic. And when we do talk about what most people would call magic, we never emphasize it, never point to it as a destination. It's considered a misappropriated destination for your practice. I see. Cities and things like that. So now, having said that, is there a kind of refinement of the potentiality of somebody who is doing practice? Of course there is. The awareness itself has some kind of magical potential to it. Right. You know, but if you want to relieve an entertainment, this is not encouraged. Right. Entertainment is not encouraged. It's boring. Right. When somebody says, I got really bored meditating, I feel so great about it. Boredom is powerful. Boredom is powerful. Yeah. And inaccessible these days. You know, it's a little different. It's like, you know, it's a low, I've always, especially after working with you. I mean, that's the name of the meditation we do, Journey into Boredom. And anytime I find my- You call your class that? Yes. You call your group? Journey, it's a group. Definitely not a class. Okay. Journey into Boredom. Yeah. Because the, you know, because to me, the solution, I know this sounds so, I don't want me to come up with some trite solution, but if you want to think of the solution to the whole environmental problem, it's just, we all need to get really bored. Like what's destroying the planet is, everyone's trying to do stuff and get out there and not be bored anymore. And in that collective inner excitement, you know, post pandemic, God, Jesus, God, I don't even know what it's going to be like post pandemic. But in that, we burn a lot of fuel, you know, and so they don't want you. They want you to think by they, I mean, like most people selling anything, they want you to think that if you're bored, there's some malfunction happening. You know, you've, you've fucked up. Like you're, you're boring. You're bored. What are you? You're bored. What are you doing? Well, but that's why we talk about hot boredom and cool boredom and spaciousness, you know, and like, you know, hot boredom is just means you're restless and frustrated and irritated and impatient. So that's of course, you know, a very good first portal to go for if you're going to do some kind of practices to find the root of that restlessness and that, that impatience and, you know, land that plane a little bit, you know, I think any reasonable person, if it was presented in a way that they can understand the premise with, they go, oh, okay, I see what you're getting at here. We should slow down. We should experience our own state of mind more. We should leave space for having proper relationship to our food, to our companionship to talking to another human being. You know, it's, it's England 50 years ago is what it is. There's four TV channels, three of them are gardening. Well, let me, here's an argument for it though. Yeah. Boredom, I think some people could, would might say, look, if you're boredom is a privilege thing. Like I can't be bored. I'm, I got a fucking hustle every day. And if you're lucky enough to be bored, congratulations. Can you maybe talk a little bit about finding that kind of cool boredom in the midst of the wild, like the wild array of phenomena that explode around many people at any given moment in a, in a modern life? Well, let me, in a way, flip around what we're talking about. So here's me on Wednesday before Thanksgiving in my house. I've been in this house alone for 15 months, basically. Yeah. You know, and so there's a certain amount of spaciousness there, you know, just unnerving at times. Yeah. A lot of spaciousness. So I'm sitting meditating on my couch here one, one Wednesday before Thanksgiving and I hear a loud thump talk about suddenly free from fixed mind. Yeah. Really a loud thump. I thought that just seemed like somebody dropped a person on my roof from an airplane or something like that. So of course, then you enter that space of not knowing what it is and just kind of curiosity and mind, my mind was stopped by it. I walk out and this is the day before Thanksgiving. Okay. Yeah. I walk out of my house. There's these nice sliding doors onto the deck here. I open up, I look up on the roof and guess what was up on the roof? A person? It's the day before Thanksgiving. A turkey? A wild turkey. That's crazy. And I look at it and we both looked at each other like, what the, you know, and then he or she flew off like an arrow into the, into the East, straight East. Wow. Is that magic? Yes. What would you characterize that? I would call that magic. Yes. Okay. Well, then there is magic. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that is ordinary. That's what you mean by ordinary magic. Well, yeah, it can get to the point where you go, whoa, this is like, it's the day before Thanksgiving. A wild turkey just crashed into my roof. It has a sense of humor. I think that's the one thing that might be interesting to note is you might think of magic as humorless, but sometimes it's a very playful aspect of reality that's just expressing itself. Can you help me understand that? Like what that is? Cause I know exactly what you mean. Anytime I'm experiencing, and I think it gets left out when people, most of the time when people are talking about their synchronicities, a lot of the times they don't mention like, and also there was a personality to the synchronicity. It was cheesy. It was too on the nose. It was childlike in its silliness, but also it was so impossible that that happened that it melted my brain. But also there's this like ridiculous silliness to a lot of these synchronicities people experience. That's too much. Yeah. Well, and it's like, you know, you know how two musicians are playing and they get into a groove and they smile at each other? Yes. It's a recognition of some kind of lighthearted, playful, but highly communicative thing happening. So also probably it could be ominous too. That kind of magic could be ominous. It could be like a real message or something like that. Yeah. You know, Jung talks about like his friend died and the chest cracked open at the exact same moment. Yes. There could be a lot of different meanings to synchronicity. And what the main meaning of it is how dull we are most of the time for not even noticing what's happening right in our own backyard, literally. Yeah. So I think the wakeful element of it is important. And what I've noticed is that around kind of very wakeful situations, the synchronicity goes up. Things seem to have a little more sparkle, a little more magic, a little more tendril. Yes. But our practice, as far as I'm concerned, is not hunting for that because think about it. That's like you become a musician because you want to be famous. Oh, yeah. That's not the right reason to want to be a musician, by the way, everybody out there. That's not a good reason. No. You should love music. Yeah. You want to play music. Yeah. And then maybe people will hear you or whatever. So, you know, that's just my take. That's just my take. You want to, if you want to play, if the reason you've, if you're so crazy that you've decided to use music is the avenue to fame, but you don't want to drive down that street at all, you don't really like it, then you are in hell. I mean, you're going to be in hell. You're doing something that's agonizing to learn. And most people, if fame is the goal, don't reach that destination at all. And also, you're just going to quit anyway. Well, and it could, but it can be temporarily pleasant in the sense that, you know, people give you free sneakers and stuff like that. Yeah. But you ever noticed that? Like they give rich people free sneakers. Sure. That's a little bit odd. Yeah. Well, that's so fucked up. That's so fucked up. You're right. Well, no, it gets, they have these things. I never got invited to one, never made it like that, but they have these things called gifting rooms. Have you heard of this? No. I think I, I think I know where you're going with it. They just like some brand invites you into a gifting room and you go there and they just give you a bunch of their stuff and then you leave with all this stuff. It was the weirdest thing. I knew a few people who got invited to gifting rooms. Really bizarre to imagine like some famous person in this weird room with people being like, oh, and here take these sneakers and this hat and these gloves. It's really bizarre. But you know, in comedy, anytime you just, if somebody is doing comedy because they want to be famous, you know, they're going to be. It could be mixed in. That's the other thing is, you know, our lay of the landscape mentally is nuanced and complex. So you could recognize elements of different parts of it, but you know, putting your whole weight down, you know, like when you bet on something, if you bet on that, I say you're betting for trouble sooner or later. And I think I've lived enough near it to be pretty clear about the fact that it doesn't solve any of your basic problems actually. Yeah. I would say that's a real big mistake you're making. Generally it's just, I know what you mean. I get what you're saying because then also when you're making stuff, that's, it's all, and also I get what you're saying when you're like, yeah, there could be some threat of that and anything, any, I don't care who it is. If some flicker of something pops into your head where you imagine some possibility of fame from whatever you're doing, that doesn't make you messed up or anything. It makes you American, you know, because that shit gets blasted at us all day long. But the, um, if, you know, when I'm, if you're making stuff, the best stuff I've ever made has been for no reason at all other than just you're making something like, oh, this is cool. Put that together and that together. And especially when you're collaborating with someone and they don't have any real reason for it with comedians, it's usually mischief. Like you're, you're like thinking about a way to freak somebody out or to like troll something or like to do some extended prank. And there's no potential benefit that can come from it other than probably infuriating someone, maybe getting arrested or something, you know, but you're like, but you're, you do it, you're doing it. And it's like the most, um, it's the most hilariously fun, exciting thing to do. And sometimes it leads to something that, that when you look back at it, like, wow, that actually got me a job or something from doing that, but that wasn't the intent. So to bring it back to, but the flip side, yeah, yeah, good. Well, so what you're saying is if you're getting into this thing because you're hoping to get synchronicities or something like that, it's identical to someone getting in to art because they want to be famous. You've lost the real reason. You've lost like the sustaining principle in it, which is not the result. So here's an experience that I had recently. And then I know we're getting into the week, the wee hours for this, but yes. Um, and because you're, you're asking this, and it's an important topic because sometimes, you know, like when you read stories about some of these great teachers like Karmapa and Maharaj, they do kind of stop people's minds with some kind of display. Yeah. You know, and, um, and that can maybe shift somebody's, you know, like that having to ramdas and then he said, I better stick around here and learn something, learn about this. And then of course, what ends up being the punchline for Ramdas, you know, uh, love everybody and tell the truth, not here's how to fabricate a rainbow, uh, in the night sky. Right. You know, so it's a bait and switch a little bit, you know, but I was talking to my friend because we had to talk about Drala principle at this class, which is a sort of has a magical element to it. And he described Karmapa 16. I'll make it very short. Stepping out of a rainy out of his house on a rainy day, when they were going to have the ceremony outside and literally a rectangular space opened in the sky above him and the sunlight comes through and just frames him and shining on him. And he's been telling him all along, no problem with the rain. We're going to be able to do this ceremony outside. Don't even make a plan B. So my friend, Michael told me that story. Right. Then I went for a walk in the graveyard here. I'm still thinking about what are we going to say tonight at this talk? And I walked down, there's about two blocks away. There's a graveyard. I like to walk through the graveyard. And for the same reason we're talking about just perspective. Yeah. I'm walking back down my street. I look up and there's a cloud formation sky that's rectangular. Literally, I have a picture of it. I can send it to you. And I go, Oh, that's a good, that's a good one. You know, that's what we were just talking about that. And I've never seen this. And then, of course, my rational mind comes in and says, Oh, it's probably some sky writer, you know, but I've never seen a plane go at a right angle. Have you? No. And so I will send you this picture, but it's a rectangle. The cloud is a, is a rectangular formation directly referential to the conversation I had earlier, as if it's saying, you know, Oh, by the way, you know, um, things are not quite what they appear, nor are they otherwise. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know if that's a good, you know, I, I did want to just connect. We have so many, I call them dunkites, but you know, maybe Dunkinite is sounds too much like a metal or something. So many of your friends, Duncan, have been coming to, you know, our programs at Dharma Moon. How are they doing? And well, it's amazing. It's like a whole little mini sangha within, within the Dharma Sangha at Dharma Moon Sangha. And we can sort of, uh, they have a certain frequency or something. There's a certain vibration. So it's somewhat easy to identify. Sometimes a big surprise. Um, I think I told you that I was teaching in Japan last weekend and a guy in Japan said he came because of your podcast. Yeah. You told me that made me feel super cool. Yeah. I mean, it's just like, okay, I wouldn't have pegged them, you know, so, um, well, it should be consensual if you pegged someone. I'm sorry, Dave. This is what you do for a living, right? I'm so sorry. I don't know what I do for a living. I think what you do for the podcast is what you do for a living. Yeah. That's what I do for a living. So anyhow, I just want to, you know, a appreciate the fact that you have created a community online and I think of you as a kind of, um, a progenitor of this whole new style of gathering and communication. You're, you're my guru when it comes to that. I watch how you, how you, uh, how you absorb the information about what's coming up, how to integrate it. And you, you have, I'm just going to test it. I have created a worldwide community of people who are really looking and really exploring in a very genuine and open hearted kind of way. Okay. Let me mundanify it a little bit here. Here's the thing. When I have this meditation group, we do it every Monday. I love it. It's great. But, and also I talk about these subject matters with friends and online and stuff. And I love talking about it, but I will always have a weird thread of guilt around it, because I don't fully understand it, which is why I love working with you. Someone who has actually had a practice for a lifetime and is worked with her, uh, uh, renowned teacher, because it gives me an ability to say to people, look, I don't really, I could easily be saying, and many times I have completely confused something. And, and then later realized like, Jesus God, I was talking about that for months. Like it was the God's only truth. Some nuanced little bit of Buddhism that later I realized like, you totally were confused. Like that's not it. And thus I'm glad it's, I, I'm lucky to have someone like you to send people to, because I will just say, go, if you really feel drawn to this and you want like an actual, like the thing, like a real structure and a real tradition, a lineage, here's one of the people you can go to. I mentioned other people too, because people have different tastes. I like working with you. And I'm, I'm sorry to turn this into some kind of weird telethon for you or something, but the reason I like working for you, for anyone listening, you can see how David acts as a perfect foil for the part of my mind that is crazy, that wants to like, wants to pull cubes out of the sky and turn into rainbows and get lost in like ideas of like freezing time and space or reading people's minds or levitating cups or whatever my particular, you act as a wonderful, perfect foil for that. And nothing else has got me meditating. Nothing else was able to get me to sit on a mat and meditate. Other than that, the most simple instruction. Cause otherwise, as you could see, I'll take any scrap I can get and unfold that into a tapestry and then turn that into a planet and then try to live on the planet and then go to war with the other side of the planet and then blow up the planet. So it's nice to have a real simple practice. And you taught me that, which is a gift. I'll, uh, how that's a never, that's a permanent gift. Thank you. And I just want to extend that invitation to everybody out there. We have a couple of programs coming up. If you want to just start at the beginning, which is something that is people sometimes don't always think about that possibility of actually starting at the beginning. We have a foundations of mindfulness class coming up, um, you know, starting on May 6th and we have a, uh, info session, free info session for the teacher training program that so many of your, your friends have taken. And that's on May 5th, um, coming, coming right up. So I just want, you just go to Dharma moon.com. And maybe we can put the links in the, in the site or something like that. But I'm just, I'm being unabashedly, uh, ma, welcoming to, to, to the folks out there, because we've had such a great experience of, of, of overlapping, you know, with some of your community in a really, really positive way. I'm happy to hear that. I really, that's really nice to hear because I don't have to take karma responsibility for leading people into ever increasing depths of horrific samsara from some miscommunication regarding a very important Buddhist point that I completely misunderstood. Um, so thank you for taking all of my negative karma forever. I really appreciate that, David. I've also taken some, I've taken some of your good karma too, because you're a lovely person. You are. You have a talk about, you know, genuine heart of sadness, you know, so, uh, and I think being a dad has really, hasn't that really like rippled? Just really cook that up more. It certainly has, it has. And then, yeah, it has, and I'm so lucky. I really am, I really am lucky that I have something like this to refer to because I wouldn't know where the fuck I was. It would be, I don't know how people do it when they're suddenly plunged into that kind of vulnerability and they don't have some framework to, you know, I, it's, uh, it's really, really a nice thing. And, um, thank you, David, and thank you for coming, spending so much time with us today, as always on the show. And all the links you need to find David will be at dunkitrustle.com.

Now's your chance because this Friday, for our weekly family gathering, we're getting together to plan our next book. We'd love for you to write a chapter in it. All you gotta do is go to patreon.com. Douglas Rushkoff is here with us today. This is his second time on the podcast, and every single time I get to have a conversation with him, it changes my life. He's got a fantastic book that is out right now. It's called Survival of the Richest, Escape Fantasies of the Tech Billionaires. If you are like me and you've had that wonderful fantasy that just maybe there's a smarter, richer person out there who's coming up with some thing, a technology, an idea, something that's gonna save the planet and turn everything green and beautiful and cool and wonderful and non-bomby, then I'm afraid you might be wrong. Rushkoff's book is about how some of these people are not necessarily in the laboratory trying to come up with some world-keeling technology, but they are actively building their very luxurious bomb shelters right now. We talked about a lot of things that didn't just freak me out. They chilled me to the bone. Jeffrey Epstein, we talked about him. What he was up to, yes, we talked about that, but this isn't just a chilling, spooky episode. What's wonderful about Rushkoff is he has a way of making the apocalypse seem a little less rotten. I hope you'll tune in. But first, go buy his book. It's out right now on Amazon. All the links you need to find Douglas or his book will be at DuncanTrustle.com. And now, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, Douglas Rushkoff. Douglas, welcome back to the DTFH. How are you doing? Pretty good. A little overwhelmed. It's just like a lot of stuff's happening. This new book, it's weird. With my other books, I always do so much publicity and trying and emailing and begging. This is a book that I've been working on for a long time. It's a book that I've been working on for a long time. I always do so much publicity and trying and emailing and begging. This one, I was kind of too busy, but because it's weird, like Billionaires and Apocalypse and all, they're coming to me. It's like, Morning Joe came to me. New York Times came to me. And it's like, oh, that's way better to sit quietly and let them come to you. I think you're at that point now. Can you tell me how long you've been working on this book? Kind of my whole life in a weird way without realizing it. I mean, I wasn't going to do a book. I wrote this article in 2018 after I had this weird experience where I was supposed to do this talk for bankers about the digital future. And it turned out to be these five billionaires who wanted advice on their bunker strategies. And I wrote this piece on media and in the Guardian about what does it mean that the most powerful tech people in the world are trying to execute on the ultimate exit strategy. They have so little faith that we're going to make it that they want to leave us all behind and get on their rocket ships or upload their consciousness and all. And I kept thinking about it, you know, and then COVID happened. And I started to see how, well, you know, that kind of billionaire mindset about, you know, escape from the masses and shield ourselves from disease and get, I'm kind of doing that too. You know, get my Amazon delivery and stay safe and all. And then I wanted to see, well, have we been moving in this direction all along or for how long and where does this come from? And then I started to look back and realized, oh, wow, you know, I've been confronting this since the very beginning, since I was a, you know, the cool weird cyber kid getting invited to stuff because I was the only one. I've been confronting these kind of actually the real people, the scientists and technologists who consorted with Epstein and who really have been kind of executing on this weird master plan to get away from the rest of us, you know, since the beginning. I'm curious if there was a point where you weren't a critic of the utopian notion that it does come out of, you know, what do you call them, the singularity? Singularity people? Singularity people. Were you, was there a time where you were more in the boat of like its technology is inevitably going to produce something that's going to fix all the problems? Yeah, in the late 80s and early 90s, you know, when it was my most psychedelic friends from college who were moving out to California to go work at Apple and Intel, I was thinking something changed, man. These are not the pocket protector geeks going out there. These are the weirdos. And why is that? And I started to spend time with them and there was this overlap between like, I'm friends with Timothy Leary, are you serious? Terrence McKenna on the one hand. And those folks are all talking about virtual reality and the internet. And McKenna is talking about, you know, we will have the ability to, you know, rise from the chrysalis of matter as pure consciousness and virtual reality. You will literally see what I mean. And yeah, I believed and I didn't. I believed that the internet and these technologies were not going to be the way we orchestrated the global neurology into a single brain. But I thought it was like the training wheels or the practice that if we could do it online and then deal with issues of like privacy and collective action and all, then we can sort of remove the blinders from our eyes and realize, oh my gosh, I know what everybody's thinking all the time anyway. You know, like there's some kind of telepathic, you know, one thing going on here. So I believed it, but not exactly in the way the tech people did. But I was. But I was. And there was a moment. Yes, I loved it. I would give me more tech, more email, more, yeah. I was there. I'll be honest with you. But before the last time we podcasted, I was there. And then you sort of threw a pebble into the windshield of that and ever since then like cracks have been growing. I did, you know, I would listen to McKenna and it wasn't just that he had some. He wasn't just prophesying about technology. He also in some of his lectures like insinuated perhaps aliens would come and save us. But always there was always this hopeful quality. There was apocalyptic, but hopeful apocalypse, the end of history, but in the positive. We leap forward past whatever this, you know, the series of rotten mistakes we've done as a species into the glorious non-future called the Singularity. And then yeah, Kurzweil, of course, a different version, not psychedelic, technological. You can go on and on and on with all of these utopian fantasies. But you know, but you keep going back with any of them though, you keep going back to Ram Dass and you say, oh, wait a minute, be here friggin now. You know, all of these narratives, however beautiful they are, Christianity, communism, capitalism, utopianism, they're all like, we're going to go arm in arm up the hill. Here we go to get to that promised moment to get to that thing. Come on, everybody gets more tech, more love, more money, more justice, whatever it is to get there to the thing. And all of the, most of the counter-culturalists who I most admired, they were using a different palette, right? They were using my palette for, you know, psychedelia and free love and connection and all that, but they were buying the same narrative that they grew up on, you know, that same Catholic, Christian, Aristotelian, male, orgasm curve, crisis, climax, sleep, right? You know, like as long as you get to the climax, then you get to rest. Right? But that's not the way it really goes. The thing that we're here together all the time. You don't play the game in order to win. You play the game to keep the game going. Right. Yeah, right. To me, what's quite chilling about this line of thinking and your book is that, you know, we watch, I don't know if you've ever watched Preppers. I certainly have. I love watching. It's fun to watch, but, you know, if you're watching it, you could easily just slip into a pretty intense judgment of some of these people. You can think to yourself, oh, come on, give me a break. You want the world to end. It's not going to end. This is just like your sort of way of role playing or something. But in your book, you talk about this thing that these billionaires call the event. Right? And somehow, and this is my own capitalist brainwashing, I guess, when I hear shit, it's not just people digging holes in their backyards so that they could put some something they can climb into filled with ramen. These are these are like the people who theoretically know who have access to data sets that many of us might not or have done the analysis and are getting ready for some future horror. That to me is really unnerving. Do you believe what they're saying? Do you also fall into that line of thinking that around the corner at some point in our lifespan, something is going to happen that is going to topple civilization as we know it? Well, dude, I mean, it's kind of already begun. You know, we're over the event horizon, right? Over the lip of the strange attractor into this thing with the, you know, the pandemics and poxes and things and things that are burning and Fukushima and wars and the collapse of coherence. We're actually we're actually in it. And in some ways that's frightening and other ways it's kind of a relief because it's like, OK, it's happening. It's slow moving and there's opportunities at every moment to choose the alternative. It's like, oh, rather than trying to outrun this, which is what the billionaires are trying to do. I'm going to outrun it and build a bunker. I'm going to outrun it and get a rocket ship. I'm going to outrun it and create a server to upload my consciousness. It's like, no, no, no. And especially they want to outrun it and only them and like six of their friends make it. Which is a little McKenna, too. You know, McKenna used to basically say that if you didn't have the right consciousness, you're not going to make it through the strange attractor at the end of time. You know, it's a little exclusive. I'm of the belief we all make it or none of us make it because there's one thing going on here. So we end up. Yes, these guys in some ways. And that's for me the beauty of the book. And you gave me a lot of this, the ability to laugh. The fact that you're a comedian is so empowering. When we can laugh at the thing, it gets so much smaller. So what I tried to do in the book is I go to these billionaires and yeah, at the first I'm scared. The most richest, most powerful, smartest, most researched people in the world think the world is ending. The very best thing they can do is prepare for the inevitable collapse. You know, that's it. But then I thought, wait a minute, these guys are the richest and most powerful people in the world. Yet they feel utterly powerless and they always friggin have. They've never been doing the thing that we were just talking about. They were never trying to unleash the collective human imagination. They were trying to bet on whichever future they thought was most probable. They're investors. They're gamblers. They're not creators. And the ones that were creators, maybe they were 19 years old and they had an idea in college. They get plucked by Peter Thiel or Mark Andreessen while they're in college. And they're taught how to pivot towards the most profitable outcome. And they transfer parental authority onto some friggin venture capitalist and think that, you know, that startup capitalism is the only path forward for their technology and it's not.

Do you have surely you have considered that you lit in the topic of your book you that you have a synergy with like a pretty thriving conspiracy theory right now wrapped around the World Economic Forum. What's his name? Klaus Schwab. The conspiracy being. And before I say this, another thing I took away from our last conversation that I have quoted you on many times is this idea of, well, let's not take these conspiracies. Literally, let's look at them as metaphors. Let's go deeper into them because they kind of are true at some level. But are they really true? Probably not. And yet, when you when you talk about billionaires burrowing into their elite bunkers to outlast those who can't afford elite bunkers, you're not saying that they're the ones who are responsible or complicit necessarily in whatever this event may be. I think that's where you diverge from the conspiracy, which is they want to do population control or whatever. I mean, maybe all of us, you could say, are responsible in our consumption. And if those people are running companies that cause massive amounts of consumption, you could say they're sort of inadvertently responsible, but not intentionally responsible. That's an important point. They are and they're not. They are and they're not. But as an aside, I mean, like I just read it, a Corey Doctorow wrote yesterday this piece about Epson printers and how Epson intentionally bricks their printers after a certain number of printouts, arguing that, oh, it's because some sponge in there is going to get filled and we don't want it to leak on your desk or something. Oh, wow. But they really just want you to have to buy a new printer. You know, it's just pure evil. Now, they're smart enough to know that when you buy a new printer, the old one's going to have to go on a friggin toxic pile of waste in China or Brazil and little, you know, enslaved children are going to be picking at it for renewable and they know it. But what are they thinking? They're thinking, yes, but I have to earn enough money to outrun the devastation I'm creating by earning money in this way. They somehow think, you know what I mean? That's what I'm calling the insulation equation that's kind of part of this billionaire mindset. So, yeah, I'm hurting the world, but I'm going to release enough capital from hurting the world that I'm going to stay a step ahead. But what these guys are realizing now is they can't stay a step ahead anymore. That's the way they've always done it. Stay one step ahead of the devastation. Move further west. Move further north. Move further this. So now what they want to do is they want to go meta on the whole thing, right? You know, Zuckerberg, literally, when Facebook stops working, I'm going meta on Facebook. Right. Or they're going to be as gods. Or Theo, go from zero to one. One order of magnitude above the others. Or Jeffrey Epstein, become this god with enslaved women to carry on my genes. Matt, pause you there for a moment because this is something all of us, I think, who haven't really gone deep into the Epstein thing. What was he? What was his deal, man? I keep hearing these strange meetings he was having, not just with people to hump teenagers, but also there was some other bizarre quality to him. He had some weird plant. What was that? Does anyone know? What was that? Well, it's weird. When I interacted with the Epstein crowd, it was actually through my literary agent in New York, this guy, John Brockman, who had a lot of great scientists in his thrall, you know, Richard Dawkins and those guys. And my interactions with them was mainly me arguing kind of, you know, Ram Dass-like Buddhist spiritual understandings of the world. There's something more going on here than pure materialism. Scientism cannot explain everything, you know, and play in that one. And they're just laughing at me like I'm a hopeless new age, you know, psychedelic kid. But, you know, I remember I was at this one party and then when I suggested that the universe might kind of be trying to lean in a moral direction that we're groping towards a higher, you know, a very Buddhist kind of, we're not striving, but we're moving towards, you know, kind of a nobler path. Yes. They laughed at me. He said, oh, you know, you're a moralist, right? And then, you know, to my, what should not have been my surprise, you know, 20 years later, I see these same guys and dockets on the Lolita Express, which is, you know, Epstein's airplane going back and forth from wherever they go and realizing, right, if you are not a moralist, if you genuinely believe that we are just in the thrall of our selfish genes doing whatever we have to to spread our genes to other people, then you will have, that's an attractive world view to a guy like Jeffrey Epstein who wants to get everything he wants. I want a 14-year-old girl to fuck me like there's no tomorrow and I don't want to feel bad about it. Yeah. Well, if I'm just, this is just genes. I am just, you know, behaving as a programming to my DNA programming, which wants to extend itself. So what Epstein's plan was, he had these compounds. He had one on an island with a little bit more occult stuff and one in New Mexico and he had these bedrooms set up. And what he wanted was there to be 20 or 30 young women at a time at these places getting impregnated by him and birthing their babies and having this, yeah. And he would make this kind of new race of little Epsteins, you know, it was his own little kind of eugenics project to express his genes. But from what he understood and what these scientists who are getting funded by him, what they supported was this, almost genetics as capitalism, right? Understanding genetics as, so it's almost like a form of interpersonal colonialism, right? With Jeffrey Epstein as the corporation trying to open up like new Walmart everywhere, you know, spawning his DNA. That is fucked up. Yeah. I read something about that and this is documented. Like this is for sure. Yeah, this is real. This is not conspiracy theory. This is just real, right? He wanted breeding chambers. Jeffrey Epstein wanted breeding chambers. Well, they were called bedrooms, right? For now, once the event happens, they're breeding chambers. Yeah, that's true. I mean, okay, so you mentioned the occult aspect of that. Again, like, you know, I've tried to apply Robert Anton Wilson's advice in regard to these things, maintain agnosticism. So when I've seen overwhelming evidence pointing towards some sort of religious or spiritual angle to whatever was going on there, I think to myself, probably not. I mean, not really, but it seems like there was the temple. They had a temple there. There was some kind of, so intermingled in with this corporatization slash eugenics Epstein plan. There was also some religious coloring to it. There was some occultism to it, but who knows if they believed it because he might have been a staunch atheist. But the stuff works, right? It certainly works from the perspective of psyching somebody out. You know, if you're a young woman and don't know if you want to submit to this guy and now you're part of a, you know, a ritual to Aries, though, whatever. It feels, you know what I mean? It's certainly a good psych out. I mean, the Masons certainly understood that when they would construct a Masonic temple or construct Washington DC and do all these sort of intimidating architectural tricks. I don't know that they necessarily believe that there was magical power in it, but more like kind of like neurolinguistic programming as magic. Like we can do all these hypnotic things that tend to work. I mean, these guys, the interesting thing was the same sort of Epstein folks around the edge and John Brockman and those scientists, the parties that I were not invited to, the things were always about behavioral finance. That's where they went with this. Behavioral finance is really the study of how to exploit people's kind of mental vulnerabilities when it comes to money. Like people, you know, that's what behavioral economics is that like we look at future money differently than current money, or if we put money in buckets, we're more likely to spend it. So they were doing the workshops they were doing all had to do with how do you manipulate people, right? What's the latest and greatest science and neurology around getting other people to do what you want them to do? It's like how to win friends and influence people, you know, squared. Wow. But coming more from our perspective, like you've charted a perfect path to a nightmare world, which is a world run by people after some event who are purely materialistic, who laugh when they think you're a moralist and who have decided that the number one goal outside of some form of like hedonism is gene expression into the natural world. This thing that you are describing is if it's true, it's chilling. Well, it is true. It should be more laughable than it is chilling. So when you go back to your conspiracy theory people, the difference between me and the conspiracy theory people is the conspiracy theory people take these guys at their word. The conspiracy theory people, they're the true believers of these guys that, oh, you know, we're going to build an AI that can manipulate the entirety of humanity and all that. If these guys were that good, the world would not be ending. Wow. If these guys knew what they were doing, they wouldn't be jerks. If Zuckerberg knew what he was doing, he wouldn't be saying, oh, I'm going to give back 99% of my money and I'm not really happy. You know, they're not. They're laughable, right? That's why if you're in a room with five people with almost infinite money and the thing they're asking about is how do I escape from the event? Rather than how do I use the fact that just in this room we have more money than the nation of Argentina? What can we do to undo some of the horror, right? But instead, I got to earn more money so I can build a better bunker. So I'm going to sell more self-destructing printers to these losers who are going to be left behind in the regular world so I can get that last squeeze, that last bit of cash out of this thing. It's like some massive Ponzi scheme, except the way you win the Ponzi scheme is by wiping out everyone in the lower or letting your destruction wipe those people out so they can't be like... It is interesting. Exactly. Right. It's like Alexander the Great except you destroy all the things that you take over. Holy shit. And you're right. You're right. That's kind of the difference. It's never before have the colonizers had the ability to really take down the whole thing. Not only the ability, but the desire to. And that's where these guys dovetail with Steve Bannon and the people called accelerationists. Yes. To Thiel and Musk and the accelerationists and Bannon, they've got this idea that, look, if it's going to happen, let's just rip the Band-Aid off. Let's bring on the end so that we can start fresh, start clean. Right. And then they talk about Game B. We're going to do Game B. Let's let Game A. That's where people are now. Game A, that society is just over. That civilization is just wiped out. We're going to go to Game B. You know, I've got a new software stack for hydroponic gardens and a new education system and new roads and autonomous this and that. Game B is going to be great. You know, and that's each of these technologists in their own way. That's a great reset. As if you could read, I get it. It's such a wet dream, right? I could just read all. Remember Control Alt Delete. Do they still have that? Does that still work? I won't do it because I'll disconnect. Don't do it. I don't know. Remember Control Alt Delete. Yes. That is like just to get out. Just escape. Get out. Oh my god. That's what they want to do. And then refrag the hard drive and just start this. Reboot this thing. That is so fucked up. That look. Yeah. Okay. Now let me play. Let me play truly devil's advocate. Okay. I'm going to play devil's advocate. All right. And then I. So let's let's do a pretend argument. Okay. Now I am no longer Duncan. Now I am. So now I am one of them. Okay. It's part of your part of Duncan. Oh, here we go. You're moralist. Now look, look, here's the thing. All right. We have done you all the data is out there. Anyone has access to it. We don't have special access to data. Maybe we have a few like files over here. There's some pictures, whatever. But we have the same access to data that you that you all have by y'all. I mean, all you all the pores, all the middles, all the non billionaires. And here's what's happening. There is no way to stop it right now. If everyone on the planet just somehow woke up, started growing hydroponic gardens, stopped driving and everyone just stopped. It's still not going to stop the ice caps melting. It's not going to stop the disruption of the oceanic currents. If there are going to, there is going to be a die off. There's no way around it. So knowing that, knowing that, knowing that. And again, this is what we believe. Knowing it's unstoppable. What is the most compassionate thing is the most compassionate thing to try to use all of our money to keep feeding these people, get people housing, prolong their lifespan, use the stuff that we see coming in the field of genetics, human life expansion so that we can extend the lifespan of people. Who are just going to keep consuming, just going to keep releasing carbon, just going to keep destroying the planet and then let the planet wipe them out. Or do we, do we figure out alternate methods of behavioral control so that we can over a compassionate period of time? I don't like what, we don't like that you say control out delete. It's a slow reboot. It's a slow reboot. Compassionately sort of diminish the population. We don't like to use the word coal. But if in any other biome, when a species is running amuck, you know, sometimes that's the most compassionate thing to do long term. And let's just say if we are going to use finances as a quantification of success in this particular social, economic biome that we're in, the theory of evolution seems to have favored us, you know, evolution itself. Meaning that we are living evolution and because of that it kind of makes sense to, I don't know how to put it. I guess we could say control out delete. Georgia God stones, maybe they blew up the stones. Okay, I don't believe that. For anyone listening, don't cut that out out of context. And make it seem like I'm actually saying that. I've got kids and I love, I know what it's like to be a parent. Fuck all that. But I'm just saying from that perspective, how would you argue with that? Like not just from a moralist sense. I would have two arguments. One, maybe most importantly for you is not going to work. They're going to come for you and kill you. Your guards are going to turn on you. There's nothing you can do. You've been a mean person. Had you been paying for your head of securities daughters bat mitzvahs to this day, you might stand a chance. Right. But you haven't been. And if you suddenly turn nice, they're going to know why you're doing. It's too late. Larry! Larry, pay for their bat mitzvahs! Pay for the last six years of bat mitzvahs! Do whatever! Sorry, I had to talk to my finance guys over here. All right, good. Yeah, some of them don't have bat mitzvahs, but you'll find the equivalent, the confirmations, whatever it is. Sweet 16s. Because it'll be harder for them to shoot you between the eyes if you paid for their daughters bat mitzvahs, right? Holy shit. It's hard. I've tried. I've never been able to shoot anybody who's paid for my kids bat mitzvahs. Physical impossibility. It's a safeguard. Well, that's how we get other people to do that for us. I mean, I stopped. All right. I forgot. So at first, it's not going to work. You can't seal yourself off. The germs are going to get in. The radiation. The smoke from the fires. The immigrants are going to climb over the wall. The climate refugees. The from inside and outside. Your own daughter or son is going to stab you in your sleep. It's just not going to work. Right. So there's that. And second, the way to, if the crisis is inevitable, which I would agree it is a crisis on some magnitude, it's already underway and inevitable. Then the best way through is to become the most resilient society possible to be, help people be the most local. So no, you know, there are little hydroponic gardens and things may not, may not prevent the disaster, but it'll certainly make the disaster more comfortable. It'll, you know, it will be a lot better if, if we're not relating only on zoom and through door dash. But rather working together on community supported agriculture farms and teaching each other and sharing stuff. You know, so we could, we could be more resilient. We can, I think we could push the crisis further and further off. In other words, it can happen in 50 years rather than 30 years or 10 years. Right. And we can, and the further off we push it, the kind of the more prepared we can be, the more interconnected we can be. Right. The more local and grounded. So that would sort of be my, even my advice to the billionaires would be it's not too late to rejoin your community, to become part of it. Right. You're going to stand a better chance, networked and connected with these people than trying to enslave them. You know, I think your first critique is the best critique. It's like, are you kidding? Like who, what do you think? I like, what, what do you think is going to happen when you are outgunned by people who were in a world where money no longer has value? What, what, what is, what's your plan there? Like, are you, what are you going to do? Like you, I know what are they going to, and the one guy was showing me, I don't know. I go talk about it. I haven't shared this yet. Um, cause I've been being so coy. One guy shared me the archeology, the archeology, the pinch being so coy. One guy shared me the architectural renderings for one of his underground bunker facilities. And in it, there was this indoor fake sunlight, sunlit heated swimming pool. And I was looking at it and I was going, man, you know, I've got a neighbor who's got a heated swimming pool and breaks down a lot. He's always calling in for parts and stuff. How do you plan to get replacement parts for that heated swimming pool? Right. And he makes a little note on his pad. And I'm sure it's like you're like, get, figure out replacement parts for a pool. It's like, dude, you're fucking insane. Right. You, you're putting it heated. You haven't, you're the one who's planning for the apocalypse and you're building a pool and you're not even considering how you're going to get like replacement filters and what about when the pump breaks and it's like, it doesn't, this is not going to work. This is not going to work. You can hold out, you know, the Mormons, God bless them. They don't have a year's supply of food in their basement. That's resilience. They're not thinking apocalypse. Some of them, maybe they are, but, but a year of food or six months of food is very different. That's just like, we're going to be a resilient community that can withstand really big bad things like a flood or a tornado or a plague or something that happens. We're going to be resilient. But to think that you're going to somehow outlast the apocalypse, you're going to do it alone, you know, and each of their plans, whether it's a bunker or an island or a super yacht or getting off the planet, I mean, my billionaires weren't rich enough to get off the planet. One of them said, maybe I could get a seat on Richard Branson's, but he said, we're low level, we're low level billionaires. Oh right. Yeah. That sucks. That sucks. Terraform, but, but you talk to any scientist and I promise you it's, it's way, way easier to terraform even an apocalyptically devastated earth than it is to terraform Venus. I mean, this, that, that, that is the, that to me is the most ironic aspect of it. It's like, okay, what we'll do, even though we have a functioning planet is just try to start another planet so that we don't have to deal with all, because I think like, first of all, I'm Matt, this, I imagine that it's not all sinister for them. I mean, I do know that like Musk has said that, you know, this shit isn't going to last. Like it's a matter of time. I mean, all of this good damage we're doing to the planet, all that aside, just the planet is poked with meteor impacts. This thing gets reset all the time just by chaos itself. Yeah. So the, the, to, to, if the goal is for our species to not just be one of the potentially infinite number of species that rolled the dice, didn't work out, you know, we're just seeing like a quasar with the, what's it called, the new, the James Webb telescope. Who knows? There were probably some wonderful people living in the vicinity of that thing at some point. It didn't work out. The idea is let's go galactic, let's spread out through the galaxy, regardless of the inconvenience of trying to terraform Mars or Venus or wherever it's still as far as like what a, it's what a species should do. It's what we do. It's not just like, fuck these poor people. Let's leave. It's time to split. It's time to do a French exit to another planet. It's like, this is, this is our, our birthright as exploring creatures. So I don't think it, it's all sinister, but that, you know, but, but wrapped up in it is the, you know, I've quite often thought, okay, let's just imagine it happens. We get to Mars. We, or we get to the, those craters in the moon that are apparently like 70 or 60 degrees. We get our hydroponic chambers going. We get the safe space. It's working. We got 50 years of heated swimming pool supplies. We can fix our heated swimming pools for 50 years. What happens when the Epstein of the group is like, all right, so you're going to go into breeding pod A. You're going in breeding pod B. You're like, wait, what? I, wait, no, you didn't say anything about the breeding pods. And it's like, well, whoops, you're already here. You can't leave. Like fascism and all of it's like, all the horrors of fascism become so much easier with a diminished population. You know what I mean? We're talking Jonestown on the moon, Jonestown on Mars, where it's, you know, and what culturally does happen to a group of people when they're off world. America is what some crazy pilgrims came on some ships. Fuck. Look what they did. We're free. Holy shit. That's scary. That's so scary. Yeah. But the funny thing is they do, a lot of them have good intent. Like, so, you know, you take some evil tech bro mastermind guy and he goes to Burning Man and does ayahuasca with some high priced shaman. And then he like sees the light. Oh my God. I've been hurting the planet and I've got to change my ways. I'm going to come back. Now I, now I have the plan for how to save the whole world. So they, they have the same sort of narcissistic personality disorder driven drive to, you know, to solve the world's problems with their new stack, with their new wonderful techno solution, rather than coming back as I always have with humility of like, oh my God, I have no idea what's going on here. I'm just a leaf and a gale of this giant system. They come back. They, maybe they have that, but they, they, they come back doing the same thing. And in the end they justify, well, you know, with my company, Facebook, what I'm actually doing is kind of good for fostering the new human, you know, and they end up doing the same thing they were doing, they were doing before, but, but Musk, you know, God bless him. Those cars, he did, I don't know if end to end, you know, if, from production to destruction, if a Tesla car really is that much better, you know, for the environment, given all you have to do for it. But let's say that it is, and he's done good and reduced energy and all that, you know, when he bought like a billion dollars of Bitcoin for Tesla, he undid like 20 years worth of Teslas, just energy wise, just in that action. From the Bitcoin. Yeah. Well, but, you know, if you're looking for a currency in your moon crater to like pay somebody to do the pool repair, it's not going to be the U.S. dollar. It's probably going to be cryptocurrency. I mean, wrapped up in this idea of asteroid mining, creating some colonies wherever is, they're going to need a currency and I think blockchain currency to them probably seems like one of the most, what are you going to, I mean, what are you going to do? Moon rocks? What are you going to trade up there? Like what are you going to trade? You're going to do crypto probably. I mean, that's, I don't have, I don't even know. Maybe if you got to have capitalism up there, you know, if you still, and that's the thing, it's the possibility of imagination. All of these tools are just like digital copies of what we have already fucking up the world. It's like, no, if you're going to have digital and create, let's create something different. Let's do a commons based economy rather than an extraction based economy. You know, what if, you know, what if we don't need to invest in currency? I mean, you look at Bitcoin, it's like, here we are. Let's burn a significant amount of the planet as a way of proving our devotion to a coin. Yeah. No, it's, you know what it is? What do they call those potlatches? You know what a potlatch, it's a digital potlatch. It's like, you know, except for the potlatch is what you gained from it was status. With the Bitcoin, what you're getting is some quantification of energy burned via the time it takes to get a new Bitcoin into existence. Yeah. But it's a potlatch. I mean, it's a very sophisticated, you're not like throwing your whatever, your furniture in the fire, your cows or whatever, but still to some degree, I get that critique of Bitcoin. Here's another thing that you have really like just conversations with you are life changing in the best way possible and that they illuminate something. And the other thing that you've illuminated all the critique of billionaires aside, I think we have fully potlatched the billionaires in the first 30 minutes of this. Okay. So I think that aside from like environmental impact and the damage that that has caused, there's another more subtle damage that you have illuminated for a lot of people, which is the rescue fantasy that via just the existence of these people propagating a notion that at some point in one of their laboratories or at some point, you know, in wherever they're doing whatever work they're doing, their chocolate factories, there is going to be an answer, the fix upstream. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix disease. We're going to, we're going to fix everything. What that does inadvertently and maybe for some people a very subtle way is it takes the onus off of the individual. Just what you're saying. If you have with it, you know, I'm God, I'm listening to this great audiobook endurance about Shackleton and oh, it's so good. These people are screwed. They're trapped. They're there on these like shit islands surrounded by ice. And at one point, just one of the journal entries is, you know, we have to, it's not helping us anymore to think that we're getting out of here. And that, that, that moment's really important. Isn't it? That's an important moment because if you, if you think you have some safety net, whether it's a backup plan in your own, like someone's going to come and help you or whether it's like, you know, billionaires are going to save the planet, then it, you can kind of get away with some pretty like intense shit in your own life. You know, you can like, you don't have to feel quite so bad about this or that or this thing because it's coming. Help is coming. And so I think that's the shadow of this thought, this utopian, I don't know, new world religion or whatever you want to call it. That it's given people the impression that somebody else is doing the work for them and they just need to wait. Yeah. You wanted to go on a nice picnic with your lover, but now you find yourself looking at them wondering, are they actually a demon pretending to be human? And the reason you're thinking that is because you thought you would take a small dose of an edible THC gummy, but it wasn't a small dose. You got the shishito pepper effect, as they call it, and you did a mega dose and now you're in hell. You've got to act like everything's cool because you don't want to mess this up. This doesn't have to happen. You don't have to go through that thing that I have gone through so many times in my picnicking days and that thanks to Lumilabs, the creators of microdose gummies. They have figured it out. The perfect dose. You don't have to worry anymore when you enjoy one of these gummies that suddenly you're going to be living in one of the hell realms. Now, they're nice, soft, gentle, relaxing, and I love them. In fact, I've eaten all of them. What's even better about these microdose gummies is that you can travel with them. They're available nationwide. I don't know how that's possible, but it's true. They're legal. To learn more about microdosing THC, go to microdose.com. Use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found at DuncanTrussell.com, but again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. Thank you, microdose. I need some more, please. I love you guys. Thank you. It's given people the impression that somebody else is doing the work for them and they just need to wait because it's coming. That's to me. A gift you might be giving some people, even though it's a painful gift, is forget that. It might not be coming. The help isn't coming. There's no fix. It's not going to get fixed in the way you think it is. That means that now you have to start making your own plans. Is that a fair analysis of what you did? Yeah, it is. I don't know that I go with the same conclusion, but definitely part of the disillusionment is the wealthiest, most powerful, smartest tech dudes are running. They're not solving. They're running. They believe the goose is cooked. Does that mean that it's up to us as individuals? I don't know. That's sort of like the inconvenient truth sort of thing of like, okay, now it's on you. I think it's on us as a collective. That's what I was trying to tell the billionaire guys was look, that's not, what you're doing is not the way to survive. And not the way to have a happy life. There is a way to survive. Stop running. Stop running. Don't go meta on everybody. Don't rise up. Join us. Join us. And we all get to make it. But yeah, I think you're right that if you stop looking for whatever that, the gold ring, the thing, what are you going to hit to get the, to get, again, you know, they've been running businesses. They've been taught from the time they were 19 that the object of the game is to get to your exit strategy, your exit, your deliverance, your, you leave them holding the bag and you take the money and run. Right. You know, there's no exit strategy. That's the thing. There is none. No way out. No, there's no, you know, and if you, if you get so addicted to it, I mean, that's why these guys love Marvel movies and stuff. They're end game. They, they, they, they are living at this giant scale that requires an end game. Otherwise, how do you justify all the shit that you've done unless there's an end game? You need at least, you know, even in our own lives, COVID helped us justify, you know, I felt, I had Amazon Prime. I felt bad about it, but I had it now. COVID. Oh, thank God I've got Amazon Prime. Right. Thank God I got fresh direct. Cause I don't, it's like, there's a reason. So the worst things get the happier these guys are because the more they can justify having a yacht with a service yacht to, you know, follow around your yacht or your private island or your home. Oh, I'm so glad we have the home on the Hamptons because, you know, Murray was able to do his work. The children could get private tutoring. I was able to do my, my skeet ball or whatever. You know, I was listening. Give me pickleball. They're all into pickleball now. Pickleball. Yeah. Pickleball. Oh my God. It's, it's, uh, it's like, um, what is it? Like, you know, uh, something that's been tossed around in relation to COVID, like a term that became popular was, uh, mass psych, mass hysteria, mass psychosis, mass psychosis. And, you know, in some, to some degree, I agree. I think you could expect from the pressure of a global pandemic for there to be some form of, um, uh, collective mental illness that appeared just from being stuck in your house for so long. Um, but I think what you're talking about is an unacknowledged form of mass psychosis, which is the finish line, the dream of the finish line. Once you cross that finish line, whatever it may be, and you are, that is when the, the fires of your suffering will be quenched by the sweet heated waters of your indoor pool. Like once you hit that pool for the first time, all the stress, all the trauma, all the rotten things you might have had to do to get that heated pool. It's just going to wash it away. A capitalist baptism and you are going to feel good again. Right. Not going to have to worry about getting canceled. It's not going to, errant tweets, nothing. It's all good. It's all good. It's going to get quiet. And, and, and that because you know this and I know this and I think we don't just know it theoretically. I mean, I know you have had massive success in your life. You are a globally respected intellectual. You're an incredible writer. So you have experienced crossing that finish line. You're, you're crossing it right now with your book. Would it be dishonest to, I mean, haven't you experienced a little bit of like joy or right ecstasy or a remission of whatever your own personal struggles might be in the, in the light of your success? Yes and no. I mean, it was funny. I remember I interviewed David Lynch when I was like 22 years old for some little magazine, you know, and I kept asking, I said, because I was going to film school and wanting to, you know, be him. I'm like, what is it like on the other side? What is it like to have made it? Yeah. I mean, he made it. And this was like just when he was like quitting the, the, the Dune movie or whatever. And he wasn't feeling so good. And he was like, dog, you got to understand. There's no other side. You never make it. There's no, there's isn't, there is no thing. There's no inside and outside. You're always struggling. You're always this. It's just sometimes with more money or bigger budgets. And there is no, there is no place, you know. And if you think you've made it, then you're fooling yourself. But if you think you've not made it, you're fooling yourself too. We've all made it. You're, you're, you just being born into this dimension means you made it, honey. You made it. Mr. Rogers tried to tell us, right? You're okay just the way you are. This is it. You did it. You are, you are a fucking king. You know, and these guys though, these guys who have also made it, right? These billionaires, they're still seeking. They keep talking about, they want to be self sovereign. I want self sovereignty. What the fuck is self sovereignty? I'm going to be king of myself. I'm going to be distant from me. You know, I'm going to be so important that I'm my own king. But it's like, no, you got to have a slave of some kind. You got to have a subject. So you're, you're, you, you, it's like, what, what is that? You know, what there, it's, it's a, it is a form of, of insanity. But yeah. The one thing I will say is that that's a little unfair of me is like, I've gotten to have book success. I've gotten to have some money and a car and I've gotten to stand in front of a group of people and have my ego stroked and whatever. And now I'm telling everybody, just chill out, be happy with your neighbors and the love and the that. Um, but I will tell you the, the, as you know, the, the joy of having my nude baby on my chest when she was six months old. Oh my God. There's nothing, nothing, nothing that compares. No. With that, the, the, the joy of, of the, the old woman in my town with this little dog who I help her get out of her, out of her, her vestibule sometimes in the morning, cause the dog and the leash and the thing she can't quite, it's, that's the, that's the richest joy of my life. Richer than standing in front of the people and seeing all their big wide eyes, loving what I'm got. If anything, when I'm in front of a group of a thousand people, part of me is thinking, yeah, but you know, you each have, I appreciate that you're, you're, you're looking at it in me, but you each have it. You each have the same, the same thing. It's, it's, it makes the good thing about it is it makes me, it makes me humble, you know, and that's the thing that they're missing. Even the good ones, you know, I go to these things, I get invited to them like, you know, the, the conference for the new humanity or the next goodness of the globe. And, you know, I see these people like investment bankers and, and elites, you know, finally doing yoga or something and realizing, oh my gosh, the, the climate really is imperiled or, oh, our economy really is built on a faulty and unfair structure. And then they think, well, we need to be the leaders of the next economy. We are the leader. And I'm like, you've been, you've been aware of this problem for 30 minutes. Your entire life experience has been spent as a financial advisor or a brand manager or a tech investor. And now, now 30 minutes into your new awakened self, you're ready to lead the revolution. And then I'm like, have you heard of extinction rebellion or sunshine? No, I haven't heard of extinction rebellion. Well, you should join. Well, if they're so good, then why haven't I heard of them? Wow. Dude. Yeah. Right. That's, there you go. That's about, and, and these are the well-meaning ones, right? Right. These are the well-meaning ones who've been so used to being the leader of everything they do that they can't just follow, you know, and in environment, in climate, in politics. I'm, I'm a follower. I'm a leader in understanding certain things about the way technologies create environments, the way digital technology has created this escapist mindset, partly because everything digital is kind of one level removed, one symbolic level, everything's meta. So I'm looking at how the guys who are, are, are addicted to these technologies and making money off them, how they're trying to go meta on us, on our world, on reality and escape. And I'm fine for that. But in terms of, of, of climate, I'm going to extinction. But in terms of race, I'm talking to Alicia Garza. I'm the baby. Right. I'm the baby. I'm the follower. Just trying to, to, to live as good a life as I can. Right. It's like you can't apply the whatever method or mindset that got you into a place of being peak consumer to try to like save the planet. It's not going to work. And part of that mindset is to imagine that you automatically understand everything that you automatically know. That's part of the psychosis. I mean, it, it, and I do think it's fair to call it a, a, a, some form of delude, like delusion, which, and, and which is, you know, and the problem, I'm, you know, the problem when you are someone who is like, you know, you're, when you see people like posting that they can afford groceries, you're not posting that you're getting, you're, you know, about your groceries. You can afford groceries. Inflation isn't fucking you. The pain at the pump isn't fucking you. These people are getting fucked by that. So, you know, to, to say out loud, something that's been said in a myriad of forms throughout recorded history, which is, look, it doesn't work, but to say it from the place where it seemingly is working, it would be easy to think, yeah, it's easy for you to say, isn't it? It's easy for you to say you're already there. It's easy for you to say that. But man, I, my kids, they, I can't get formula for my fucking kids. Well, you know, so, but, so to me, that's where that's the perplexing problem of talking about some of these things is because if you were talking about them experientially, if you're saying, look, at night, I wake up in the middle of the night with the identical anxiety I had before I was sleeping in this nice house, nothing, this house is not helping. This money does not seem to be really doing much for some deeper problem in me that, and, and, and, and, and I fell for it. And I've been like, you know, I work my ass off. I get the grind thing. I listen to David Goggins. I, you know what I mean? I, I've tried, but it's, it's, it's not really fixing the problem. I mean, that's to me the essence of it. Like as above so below the tech billionaires, they have the fantasy, okay, we'll burrow in the bunker. That's when we'll find, we'll, we'll do game B, all control out delete, then that's when this thing inside of us is going to feel a little better. I'm for a lot of people that the version of that is I'm going to get a raise or I'm going to get my own business and the business is going to take off or I'm going to become a famous DJ or my Instagram followers are going to exponentially, they're going to go up exponentially. And then somehow through that fame, I'm going to, this shit feeling is going to go away. But dammit man, when we're talking about it, we're talking about it from a place where I think some people, I mean, I would love to have your mind. I would love to have your intelligence. I would love to have your ability to parse information and to articulate it in such a clear and somehow optimistic way. I would love that man. But so I guess I'm just saying, shit, how do you transmit to the world what to me is like the essence of Buddhism, which is there is suffering and you're suffering because you're clinging and once you stop clinging, this suffering will stop. Not once you invest in a company and get a big return. Not once you have an orgy with 17 models, not once you have 17 teenagers in your breeding pod. You know what I mean? So how do you like, how do what is the way to have this, this thing, this seed idea grow in culture? Because if there is some real way things are going to change, it's got to be from the elimination of this kind of capitalist psychosis thing that we all are. Yeah. I mean, I think that the easiest way is to help people feel safe, even for a moment at a time. You know, I was looking at a video of Mark Zuckerberg's meta and they're these like virtual characters and they run around and they're like, they have nothing below the waist, right? They're like these torsos and heads floating around. There's no legs. There's no crotch either, but there's no legs. And I remember my chiropractor, this guy, Mark Philippi, rest his soul. He used to say that, you know, the way you feel safe is put your feet on the ground. If your feet are not on the ground, you can't feel safe. That's the way your body knows you're safe. Right. You know, and you know, so he's like, if you watch a movie, you know, if you want to get totally sucked into the movie, put your feet up on the chair in front of you and you're no longer grounded, right? Go into the thing. Yeah. But if you want to feel here and safe, put your feet on the ground. And it's something, you know, when I met Ram Dass that he does, he makes eye contact. Ram Dass. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. But I mean, I was fucking eye contact. It's like, oh my God. But that eye contact is for me, it reminded me of my experience as a child with Mr. Rogers on TV. I felt safe. I accepted. Just like, you are, you know, that was Ram Dass's biggest message. You are fine. Yeah. Right now. You are sacred fucking raging. You are, you're it, you're manifesting. You're sad. You're manifesting. You're still, this is it. Yeah. This is it. You know, and to help people get that, you know, because then when you feel, if you just stand here, it's like, wait a minute, my bank account didn't change. I don't have a hot girlfriend. My car's still broken. I don't know. But I just felt great. What does that mean? It means that my experience, I mean, I don't mean to sound like S or something, but my experience of life is largely not completely, is largely independent of the things, the circumstances that I've considered to be important. Yes. The conditions on the ground matter. There are people starving. They're bleeding. They're, it's very different than the kind of things that we worry about. Oh, my podcast didn't get me listeners this week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, or, you know, I mean, the formula is a biggie, but, but, you know, the kinds of worries that we have, certainly that we have are, are luxury worries. There are, you know, white people worries, whatever you call them. Yeah. But luxury. And I understand, you know, that getting wealthy doesn't make you happy. These people are just as unhappy as billionaires as, you know, we might be as, as 100,000 airs and our friends are as, as, as not. Or poor people. It's like, it doesn't, um, it's, it's not that. But yeah, I lived a life where I was like, I remember once I get in high school, I could write. Right. Then once I get accepted to college, then I'll be okay. Okay. Once I graduate, then I can, well, once I get a job, well, once I get a job actually in theater, then it's like, wait a minute, when is that going to stop? Right. You know, and in America, it's like, oh, well, it stops, I guess, with retirement. So then you spend your whole career, where else, what other civilization did this? You're going to spend your entire career trying to save up enough money so when you can't work anymore, you can support yourself because no one else is going to care about you. Right? Oh my God. What kind of world is that? God. Oh, that is so wild. It's what a, yeah. But that each one of us then is a billionaire prepper in our own personal lives looking for what is my escape plan for when I can't work anymore. Right. But when the shit hits the fan and I have cancer or old age or senility or whatever it might be. And so if we're each doing that on a micro level, of course the billionaires are going to do it on a macro level. And that's because we live in a society that is not nurturing, which is why the only solution for both sides of the equation is you start to nurture those around you. Right. And the whole thing disappears. Your compassion comes back. I mean, in the book, I wrote about how extremely wealthy people lose their empathy. You know, they've done neurological tests on them, that billionaires, it's as if they are brain damaged. Their frontal lobe no longer lights up when they see another person in pain. Holy fuck. They lose their empathic response. I know it's scary, right? So that's the thing. So the way to undo that, you've got to look at the other. You know, you've got to make eye contact. You've got to be there. You're nurturing your empathy for others is really the only possible solution to these problems. Billion becoming a billionaire causes brain damage. Yes, it causes brain damage. The studies are cited in the in the book and it's not just like correlation. It's like cause, you know, and I was trying to figure out, you know, why, why that would be and they don't really have have good answers. And I think it's because in our society, winning necessarily means leaving others behind. That's it. You know, their understanding of winning. You can't run a company where your employees are collapsing from heat exhaustion with that part of your brain that, you know, they've done other studies. I'm sure you're aware of where they've taken Buddhist monks and they've played like sounds like of like shrieking and like horror and things like that to see what are their brains do and they're hearing these things. And it's the compassion part of their brain lights up. It lights up and because they've trained that. I mean, it's a thing. If really what you're saying is is weirdly validating the notion of meta, the idea that you're not necessarily born perfectly compassionate. It's almost like a muscle that you have to develop. You have to learn how to do it. You know, people might think feel bad because they don't instantaneously feel compassion for the people around them. But from at least the Buddhist perspective, you have to build that muscle up. So if it's a muscle is the wrong word, obviously, but if it is a thing that can be developed neurologically, then obviously is a thing that could atrophy. Right. And digital technology really doesn't help with that either. So these guys who've already lost the ability to experience empathy are developing the platforms on which human beings are now socializing and interacting. And digital technology, we've spoken about this before, but, you know, and I can see you through this interface, but I can't really see if your pupils are getting larger or smaller. I can't see the micro-motions of your head. Right. I can't see if our breathing rates are sinking up. So the mirror neurons in my brain are not going to fire. No matter how much you agree with me, no matter how sympathetic you are, the oxytocin is not going to go through my bloodstream. I'm going to hear you say, yes, Douglas, I get that. I agree with you, but my body is going to say, I don't know if he agrees with you. I'm not getting the, you know, painstakingly evolved social cues of agreement. And that's going to engender distrust. So the more you say you agree with me, the less my body is going to trust you. And then the less empathy I'm going to have for everybody else in my world. Good. God. Exactly. So again, we're just little creatures. No matter how much we know. I mean, I try to keep reminding myself, yeah, Duncan, friend, friend. He's really a friend. Yes, friend. But because I need to tell my body that, but when I'm talking about how do you feel good and safe? How do we undo this? Well, you got to have your feet on the ground and you got to have eye contact and with other humans and breathing space. You've got to get intimate. I mean, that's, that's the great conspiracy. I love the word conspiracy, the great cause conspire means literally to breathe together conspire. You know, the great conspiracy of humans that leads to that rapport and social engagement and empathy that we need to make it through this seeming apocalypse. You know, it's just right there. It's right next door. It's, it's right. Everybody. They're, they're all, they're so many. Each person you pass is another opportunity to juice it up to, you know, to, to experience that soft, squishy wonder that is being human. And the more you do that, then honestly, even if we're on the Titanic and it's going down, even if we are, then what? Get the, get out the band. Get out the band. I'm going to, I'm going to play music. Get out the band. I'm going to love, I'm going to hold hands when we go down. I'm going to look in your eyes. I'm going to, I mean, let's, let's do it. Let's do it lovingly. You know? Oh my God. You are like a hospice nurse for the apocalypse, Douglas. It is, it's so beautiful. You're, you're, you're also surgically devastating some of the last tendrils of, you're just amputating these tendrils of technological hope. I had, I mean, truly, like if you, you know, one of the, like with all of this shit, I still think, well, you know what? At least via this technology, I can connect with people all around the planet and talk to them. But you, what you're pointing out is okay, but whatever those parts of your brain that have developed, whatever sensory apparatus has developed to pick up the pheromones, the microsignals, all those things you can't see, those are going to atrophy. They're going to atrophy everywhere. Everyone's going to lose that capacity over time. And we are going to become something different and something less squishy as you put it. And the less squishy, the more we're going to feel okay, squishing others. And then, and then that is what creates this feedback loop, a perfect cultural storm for acceleration, as you say. And it's not just tech, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm really genuinely not anti-tech. These devices are amazing. They do wonderful thing. Look what we're doing here. I just got, you know, I got an advance that he bought this book for a movie already. I got an advance and I'm like, fuck it. I'm getting title, right? So I'm paying $19.99 a month for title. It's like high def, blah, blah, blah audio that goes through this thing and through my, my app and a wire. And it's like through my old stereo speakers that I still have from 1979 when I was in high school. And it's like, oh my God, the remaster doors and stuff. What have they done there? It's amazing, right? These are miracles. These are miracles to listen to the doors on title on these speakers in that. It's a miracle. And I don't, I don't deny any of that. But at the same time, the people making these technologies, they believe that the real world is coming apart. And they know that they are the cause and they mean to escape by any means necessary and think that our last best hope, if anything, is to double down on the tech. And that's, and that's not it. We have to accept, yes, we have these technological miracles that allow us to do all sorts of things like listen to the doors 50 years after they recorded it in better fidelity than people had at that moment. But the real joy is going down the block where there are six kids in a garage band. I mean, you must hear, these kids are so good, the stuff they're doing and you see them making the music and you're there, you're playing with them. Or it's like, yes, it's not to get so seduced into this simulacra in the simulation, which is so beautiful. It's a wonderful thing not to get so seduced by it, especially if we're resorting to it because we're actually afraid of other people, you know, and it's hard. We got to go out there and do it. I get more notes. I'm going to start teaching again on Monday. I get more notes every year, first day of class from kids from their psychiatrist saying, please excuse Johnny from class participation. He's got social anxiety and, you know, and I'm thinking, man, what did this kid do K through 12? What did they do? They put him on a frigging iPad, probably. And he got the miracle of calculus on an iPad, but he didn't get, he didn't learn how to be with people. Holy shit. Do you, we've done an hour and seven minutes. Do you have another 10 minutes? Sure, sure. Okay. I have infinite time. Okay. Great. You, you've stirred up a lot of stuff for me. I want to mention something I read about and hear your thoughts on it because it is something that's been taken up a lot of processing power in my brain just because, and it fits in with the conversation, I think. Have you heard about, apparently there was some demo of this new Amazon Alexa technology. They showed, I don't know if you heard about this, the mother is with a kid and the kid is like, I wish Nana Karimia story Nana's past and the mother's like, she can Alexa have Nana read where the wild things are or whatever some kid story deep fake of Nana's voice. Yeah. Comes through the Alexa. Nana is now has gone from being this beautiful elderly woman who theoretically cooks you cookies to turning into some kind of like a technological speaker, a monolith that is now like sounds like her reading the story, but she's dead. And to this, to me, of all, you know, all the emerging technologies fills me with a kind of just uneasiness, a sense of like, you know, a book of revelations or the notion of while the dead will rise again at the end of time. And, you know, we all think, oh, it's zombies. They're talking about zombies, but it's like, no, no, no, no, they're talking about something maybe worse than zombies, at least a zombie. It's the shambling husk of your Nana. This is your Nana turned into a black pillar in the kitchen. That's like sounds like Nana, but it's you is not Nana. What are your thoughts on the potential of AI? Bringing back simulated versions of those who have left us. I think we forget that the telephone and the phonograph and I think even the telegraph were all originally invented as ways of communicating with the dead. What? Yeah. That's what they were for. And they ended up being better for other things. How? How was the plan? I believe you always communicate that you talked to the dead that somehow they'd be in that they'd have radio waves. You know, the same like SETI, you know, we have SETI that we're sending radio waves out into space thinking that aliens can come talk to us. So instead of aliens, it was they didn't know about aliens back then because they didn't have spaceships. So we thought about it more as the dead that we would communicate with them somehow. Wow. And so it's not surprising to me that, you know, now we were trying to use AI as a way of recreating the dead. The concern for me is not how good those things will get, but how bad we might get at distinguishing between real people and what are essentially non-player characters in this video game that we're moving into. And I mean, to Tibetan Buddhists, Tibetan Buddhists bring children to deaths regularly as they're growing up. So they understand what death is and it becomes part of their experience. You know, now we're in a society that's figuring out not just how to hide death from young people, but how to simulate non-death for them. And I think, I mean, I get it wanting to hear it read in Nana's voice, but I remember a guy named Jeremy Balanson at Stanford did experiments with kids in virtual reality, like six and seven-year-olds. And half the kids, they took to the aquarium and let them swim with whales. And half the kids, they had swim with whales in virtual reality. Oh, boy. Well, that's an unlucky kid. Two months later, the kids who swam in virtual reality thought they really did it. And they had indistinguishable, expressed experience. They didn't know it wasn't real. Because the brain doesn't know how to tag memories as real or simulated. There's just memory, right? It's really hard. That's why sometimes you don't know if you dreamed it or if it was real. It was like, wait a minute. Did that happen? Because your brain doesn't know how to tag. There's no tag. There's no tag for, oh, simulated. We did not evolve with VR. So we don't know how to tag a memory that we've had in there that seemed real. So I don't know how good it is for a kid to have that. I don't mind. Like when you throw in a voice of somebody in your GPS. Oh, you could have a movie star reading your GPS to you. And AIs can then do the deep fake of it. And I do think we're going to be increasingly encountering deep fakes. I'm talking to people who are at the companies that are really doing these simulations. They just did one on America's Got Talent. And they have a Tom Cruise one and things that have really made people that have been turing test indistinguishable for people between that and real life. And it's fine on a screen, but it's not here. I mean, I guess what it is, is the more mediated our experience of one another becomes, the easier it will be for an AI to take the place of one of us. And the more incarnate we are, the sillier anything like that would seem. Douglas, I could talk to you. I hope we end up in a bunker together. I bet all these billionaires are like, you know what? This is how you become a billionaire. Just put it out there like, listen, give me the advance now. Highest bidder. I will hang out with you in your bunker. But I'll tell you this though. We are already in the bunker. This is it. This is the bunker. It's a beautiful bunker and it's called Earth. And it's got a limited time horizon because it's called death. We are going to die, but I'm so fucking glad I get to spend some of my bunker time with Duncan Trussell in the family. Thank you, Douglas. You would be smelling friend pheromone. Trust me on that.

I took a Saturday drive up the Malibu And that was the little guy The sunny Arabian immigrant Is the creator of bird scooters The paint-to-plane transportation lines All over American cities Black flanks with the bird scooter logo A big lettering fluttered Around his massive dry line And Deville Good's house was painted The same midnight black As his infamous inventions The bird scooters He greeted me at the door And I went inside He sat down in the parlor And I asked him the question That was one of her unsanitary Mr. Good You feel her sensibilities Are all the people Getting hurt on your scooter Ah, Jihad against the West continues Did you say Jihad? Yes, that is correct Jihad Like terrorism? We were planning a variety of Secret terrorist attacks Oh my God Destroying the Washington Monument Beheading the Statue of Liberty Driving speedboats into whales Speedboat into whales? Why is that? What's that? Have you ever seen speedboat drive into whales? No Of course not It's terrifying And I'm a terrorist It's what we do But by the creator's grace We realized that in fact All we had to do was distribute Scooters throughout the cities of America You wanna hurt people? Yes, simple, brilliant Americans will get on anything That has a credit card machine on it They just search her onto it Like moths to a flame But isn't this illegal? No The terms of service clearly state That these bird scooters were created by us To destroy American lives We had several teams of attendees Look over, so We are completely not liable For any harm caused By these wonderful machines Holy shit Okay, well thanks for the interview You're melting me A beam came out of De Vilgun's eyes And melted me And now I'm just in some kind of cup All melted and like a cage This has been Colin Shuler Much thanks to Colin Shuler For that riveting bit of journalism We have got a fantastic podcast for you today, pals Mitch Horowitz is here To talk about his new book The Magician of the Beautiful An introduction to Neville Goddard I have been in a deep Neville Goddard rabbit hole For the last month or so And it is completely transforming my life He has a wild And I guess you could say Controversial philosophy That involves the idea that The imagination is The paintbrush of God And that you are God And it's some of the most psychedelic Incredible, beautiful Sometimes very complex Sometimes laughably ridiculous Philosophy that I've ever heard But since I've been Working with some of his ideas I've got to admit I have experienced some pretty wild Synchronicities Some of which you're going to hear During this interview So stay tuned We'll be back with Mitch Horowitz If you've got the desire To snort glory off the buttocks Of an iron clad sun god Then head over to patreon.com Ford slash DTFH And subscribe to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour Patreon And my children We are about to take that Patreon and ignite it It's about to go wild With a lot of new tears And new stuff Currently working on the relaunch Which is going to happen November 15th But in the meantime Head over, sign up Check it out There's a lot of extra stuff Over there You'll get commercial free episodes Of the DTFH Plus an extra hour long Ramblin' thing once a month Subscribe We also have a shop Located at dunkintrussell.com And we are dropping 10 new designs in the shop In time for the Christmas season So go to dunkintrussell.com And click on the shop link Okay, today's guest Wow Wow This is the second DTFH That I've done with him And every single time I communicate with him My life changes for the better He is an author And a speaker And he is an expert On someone who I am deeply absorbed in right now Neville Goddard He has written A billion books But Mitch just wrote A fantastic introduction to him Called Magician of the Beautiful You should definitely check it out Mitch has written a lot of great books If you want to find out more about Mitch Go to his website Mitchhorowitz.com All the links you need to find them Are going to be at dunkintrussell.com So now everyone please Welcome back to the DTFH Mitch Horowitz Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shaken, going to be blue Welcome to you Wow, wow, wow Mitch, welcome back Thank you, man Wonderful to be here Great to see you So, I, like, I'm going to dive right into it Because whenever I get to spend time With someone like you I'm going to take advantage of that time Now, you introduced me To the subject of your latest book Magician of the Beautiful An intro to Neville Goddard In a second hand way Because you introduced it to a friend of mine Noah Lampert Yes Who then started telling me about it And then I started listening to An audio book by him And my mind started melting Because it was so brilliant It was such an interesting interpretation Of Christianity And also, when we discuss this Before we started recording There is so much strangeness In what he's saying That I'm confused by bits and pieces But before we get into that confusion I thought maybe you could give us A little synopsis of who Neville Goddard is And what his philosophy is about In a nutshell Yeah, Neville was a British Barbadian mystic Who lived and worked here in the U.S. Until his death in 1972 And he had one essential teaching Which is that your imagination is God And he meant this in the most literal sense That everything that you experience Everything that occurs in your life Is your own emotionalized thoughts And mental pictures pushed out into the world And Neville taught that Whenever you read a reference to Jesus Or Yahweh in Scripture Old Testament, New Testament That is a symbolical reference To your own imagination And that Scripture itself is nothing other Than a blueprint to your own Psychical development Which will culminate in your realization Of yourself as the creator Clothed in human flesh And the important thing to note is That he didn't mean this as metaphor He meant this quite literally His imagination is what we in the western world Call God Wow! Yeah And where... What are his roots in? Where did he get this from? You know, he was born into this rural society In 1905 in Barbados To an Anglican family He came to New York City To study theater at the age of 17 By himself And he had some success in the theater world He was in silent films He performed on the Broadway stage He traveled as part of a dance troupe In the United States and Europe And he was experimenting With various mystical and occult ideas Late 1920s Wasn't getting anywhere And he said that in the early 1930s He met this mysterious teacher This turban black Jewish man Named Abdullah A Jewish man of Ethiopian descent And that Abdullah Tutored him in this Mind metaphysics Abdullah's in Scripture, Kabbalah Number symbolism And that it was from Abdullah That he got his philosophy of mental creativity And soon thereafter He started publishing and writing And the amazing thing about Neville is He delivered thousands of lectures Across his lifetime Wrote more than ten books He was incredibly prolific And he would restate this thesis Over and over again that your imagination is God And every time he spoke of it He wrote of it, it seemed fresh And entirely new And that's why people just fall into Neville Because when you start reading him When you start listening to him You're imbibing this radical idea And every time you encounter it It feels like the first time He had that incredible capacity Which I think is seen very very rarely Sometimes you find this in Emerson Sometimes you find this in Krishna Murthy That every time the man said something It sounded like you were hearing it In that radical new way As if for the first time Wow, it is like that Every time I Listen to this audio book Every time I sit down with it It's an entire new Illumination seems to happen Yes Do you believe in Abdullah? Is that real or do you think he was saying that Because he was worried people wouldn't just Accept the fact that sometimes Anybody can have these transmissions Or these epiphanies? That's a really tough question And I've wrestled with it And in Magician of the Beautiful And elsewhere I write about the possible identity of Abdullah I also write about the possibility That Abdullah was a composite He may have been a collection of teachers That Neville wrote about Now the purists would say I'm all wrong That Abdullah should be taken at face value That this was a really existing man And it is true that Neville gave The address where Abdullah lived I've been inside, I've visited it I've been inside the building I've tracked down all the historical reference points That are available to us And I can't conclude One way or the other whether Abdullah was an Absolutely real person Or whether Abdullah was part of A kind of American metaphysical tradition Which you'll see in Carlos Castaneda You'll see it in Madame H.P. Blabatsky Where people will Create a mythos Not necessarily a falsehood But it will sound a mysterious teacher And talk about this person As their Path of learning personified In the same way that we'll talk about God's personified You know, we'll identify a certain energy And say that's Athena, that's Zeus That's Minerva, that's Set So it could be that Or it could be that the people Who make a literal reading are absolutely correct That Abdullah was a real flesh and blood man Certainly they would argue that Well, okay, this is a different podcast Where I feel two possible directions Forming. One of them is I want to talk to you about My feeling when I've been listening to it Which is like, oh, this is one of those mystery school Transmissions where they decided that it's like Okay, illuminate the masses They're ready for this information And I keep thinking like Oh, yeah, somebody's Like letting him be the mouthpiece Of a thing that is Definitely People have been sort of Sealing it but I don't know, I just get a sense of like Abdullah makes sense to me just based on my hippie intuition Yes But that's a different conversation The mystery schools and the people that come from them I want to talk about The philosophy itself But before we get into that I want to talk about your personal Connection to Neville Because it seems like he has been a huge influence On you and clearly you're inspired by him Because you wrote an entire book on him About books that Cover what would a new thought Ancient wisdom Neville is at the heart of many of them And I have a tattoo of Neville On my left arm, you know, he's kind of Yeah, he's the primary figure In my life I first discovered him back in 2003 I was interviewing the MLB pitcher Barry Zito Who at the time was pitching for the San Francisco Giants Barry pitched for both the A's and the Giants And Barry identified Neville among Other sources as a core part Of his training regimen, core part of his life He had been exposed to Neville by his parents And in the conversation He said you must really be into this guy And I had never heard the name Because when Neville died in 72 And for many years after He was a really underground figure He didn't really fit within the new thought tradition He wasn't categorizable in any Specific way He couldn't be grouped with any school or thought system He was completely original And as such, people Just didn't hear of him And he was a mystery man, they didn't know Was he black? Was he white? Was he still living? Who is this Abdullah? And I immediately went out And got one of Neville's books called Resurrection Which he wrote in 66 1966 And I just fell into it I went all the way down the rabbit hole And part of the reason Neville's thought system Had something to do with him as a figure I mentioned his writing And how elegant and simple and beautiful it is But there's also hundreds of his lectures Preserved online Because he would permit people grateful dead style To freely tape record his lectures Which later became digitized And the man speaks With such a beautiful Resonant Melifluous voice It's like nothing you've ever heard He speaks extemporaneously Without notes, he could hold forth For 90 minutes in a lecture Citing scripture as if from out of the ether And he just has this beautiful voice That you could call it soothing But it's at the same time arousing And awakening He looked like a movie star The man just looked like a matinee idol Like a Carrie Grant And yet he very rarely permitted photos To be taken of him There's just one or two professional photographs Bopping around the internet Few other snapshots here and there And it's so different from our time Where everybody's documenting every third thing They do today And Neville, he looked like a movie star He spoke with this beautiful clipped Mid-Atlantic accent And yet There were very few instances Where he sat for professional photos He self-published his books He allowed his lectures to be freely taped He had no business apparatus behind him What's different is that from us today Every yoga teacher has this Massive business apparatus At his or her back And Neville was just a troubadour He had none of that So there was something about the man himself That bespoke sincerity to me He seemed to be living out something That was intrinsic in his teachings I very often enter people's ideas First through their persona My informal rule is Show me the person first Then I want to know what's at the back Of his or her life And I fell into his life And I concurrently fell into his teaching And I came to feel That there was in Neville This radical sense Of mystical possibility Epic self-potential A liberating sense Of self-responsibility Not a narrow self-responsibility But a deeply liberating And freeing sense of self-responsibility And I think when people are facing Stresses or difficulties in life And they meet the teaching Of this man who says You truly have it in you At this very moment To revolutionize everything in your life Through your own thoughts Because you are God It is so Inviting It's such a resplendent possibility That unless a person is completely closed off Or completely materialist It's hard to resist not experimenting And the experiments Work And they work fast And they work so fast That makes your head spin sometimes It's amazing And there can also be a gestation period Where you As you get into Neville You begin to identify things About your surroundings About your relationships About your career life And antecedents From earlier parts of your life So vividly that it can be jarring I mean, I'm living out experiences today At the age of 53 That so closely Comport to things that I was thinking about From my earliest childhood Literally going back to age 3 Age 4 That it's uncanny So there can also be this gestation period And suddenly your life seems to have symmetry For the first time This brings me to just where I wanted to land Because I knew I would go to Agape church And listen to Beckwith He's inspired by many of these teachers But I never Heard In this particular Pool of wisdom This idea of revising Your past Now, this is What made my brain pop Because he does in this book He starts talking about the 5th dimension He starts talking about This concept that we're in a frame of time But the past is continuing At this very moment It's a living past And the formation of the past As it is living now Is shaping your present And nobody That I know Is thinks that they can change the past The closest analog That you find to that way of thought Actually comes from some of the classical quantum physicists Including Erwin Schrodinger And Hugh Everett Who theorized the many worlds thesis These men in the 1930s 1940s 1950s Way before quantum physics became popularized Way before its language had entered the zeitgeist They were writing something Concurrent to Neville That was very close to his philosophy Schrodinger theorized That if you were In his great Schrodinger's cat experiment If you could extrapolate What we're seeing in the particle world Into our physical world Into our everyday above ground macro world You would be not only selecting The localization of particles But you would be selecting a past For those same particles The decision to look Or the decision not to look Actually creates a multi-dimensional effect It's not as simple as saying Well gee, this thing exists in a potential And now it exists in fact Because I looked Yes, that much is true So we're determining From experiments in the particle lab 80 years of experiments But it's also true that you'd be creating a past For the particle Based on when you choose to look If you choose not to look If you look after lunch or before lunch So if you think about it You are recreating existence Every time you Experience a shift in perspective A Pre-conception, an emotionalized thought Every time you make a decision Every perception in and of itself Brings with itself a whole dimension Of experience The particle theorists Were writing about this From the perspective of quantum mechanics Neville was writing about this From the perspective of his own mystical experience He and they Were saying essentially the same thing Without knowing one another Without ever being in the same room with one another Without reading one another And Neville created the greatest mystical Analog that we have To quantum physics And as you were saying Neville would point out that every time You are Engaging In an act of mental creation You are not only selecting Present and future circumstances But by the very Dint of what you are doing You are selecting past circumstances as well And you can not only revise your past But we are doing it all the time We are doing it all the time We don't sense it because we walk around thinking Well gee, I just walked from point A to point B I get it, I have a memory of being at point A It is perfectly symmetrical It is perfectly rational But Neville would say is it Is it because your so-called memory Of point A Is based on where you are at point B Right now There are infinite possibilities Reality is in a state of superposition In the sense of In the infinitude as it exists There are endless pasts Just as there are endless futures Just as there are endless presents So your memory of point A In a sense is just a construct And you are invited to revise it If you wish But the implication of this is so wild In the sense that right now Our experience Theoretically could be us In some future reality Revising Our past Absolutely, absolutely And I would even say this I would say to your listeners Mitch and Duncan are not even here You the listener You're here, you're here You're listening to Mitch and Duncan But we are just projections Of your own thought system It may just be that you were Intellectually prepared to arrive At this material, at this particular moment In your existence, and so in effect You've created Mitch and Duncan Who seem vivid, who seem real And we are just a Construct emanating from your own thoughts Bringing you To this information, but it's yours You're the creator Mitch actually, if you could see him right now Is an eagle and I'm a little snake So dig that Thank you for creating us Thank you for selecting us I often tell people In new thought settings People use the word manifest all the time That's not quite my term The term I use is select Because I think that's more vivid We are selecting, if everything is In existence, if reality Is an infinitude Which William Blake told us Which Erwin Schrodinger told us So many other great mystics and scientists Through history have told us If reality is an infinitude It's not so much that the individual Is manifesting so much as selecting And the tools for selection The tools for selection Are our own emotionalized thoughts And mental pictures, what are those But tools of measurement? Holy shit But it's, and again For me, I wouldn't even be talking About this if I hadn't been Figurously applying it over the last Month or so And seeing results that are Beyond astounding And one of the things I like about Neville Is that he gives examples Like real quick, and I'm going to give A real quick one, and I was wondering If you could give one as well So as I've been listening to this Basically one of his, I don't remember Which book it is, I'm listening to this audio Book compilation, I can't wait to read Your breakdown of it So what I'm reading right now is Talking about wishing Harm or good On someone else, and one of The things he says is If you give someone the gift Of wishing a thing upon them And they don't accept it Then the gift will be returned to you He has a reciprocity in his teaching People always say, gee the problem With all this new thought stuff Is that it's an ethical free for all To try to be wishing stuff Into somebody else's life Or what happens when a bad guy gets hold Of this, and I honor that concern Although I would also say the materialists Need to have that concern too We're making ethical decisions all the time This just broadens the sense of playing field But Neville has a teaching Of cosmic reciprocity so to speak In which if I wish Something for you Duncan And it's something that Duncan is Incapable of wishing for another In other words, if it's something generous But Duncan doesn't wish things that are generous Or if it's something negative And Duncan doesn't want to wish things that are negative For another, it comes back to me the sender For good or ill, so we got To deal with the whole of life These teachings are not just an ethical free for all And his invitation is You need to become a Really focused gardener Of the ecosystem of your thoughts Because if you're wishing ill Even in the most subtle way Up on a person who doesn't accept that Who sees themselves as Not someone who's an asshole Like you think they are That asshole projection goes bouncing Right back into you And then it can make you go around limping Which is why a lot of times when you meet people who gossip They're not doing very well Boom! You know, dude You just affirmed my belief in one universal mind Because I thought to myself Literally that instant I gotta make a point about gossip Anything is more deteriorative Of the human condition Than gossip. It's horrible Anything that we say in the negative About another individual And it doesn't mean not calling out injustice It doesn't mean abstaining from saying Hey, there's something wrong here that needs to be fixed But that kind of gossip that's nothing but trash talk That kind of gossip that's nothing but a smear For entertainment value Or what have you That deteriorates our lives immeasurably Because we are engaging In active reciprocity Those effects become In a sense, it's self-description It's self-description And I always tell people That the number one thing you can do To improve your life This instant is to desist from gossip And if you practice that for one hour You will stand more erect You will feel more noble You will feel more at ease Everybody's always out there in the world saying What can I do? What can I do? Hang on to this Desist from gossip and rumor for 60 minutes See what happens to you And if you do find yourself gossiping Look at the way you feel It's the grossest feeling I used to go to lunch with somebody And I would always have these mixed feelings about it Because she was a friend But I would always get lured Into this long Gossipy meal that would go on For two and a half hours And I'd feel physically sick at the end of it I'd feel sick. That was not imaginary This episode of the DTFH has been supported By Cryo Freeze Friends, I read David Goggins Sometime in early October Or late September And since then, I don't know what happened But I've been getting up at 4 or 5 a.m. And working out But I'm in a 45-year-old's body That hasn't consistently exercised In approximately four years You might expect from a recently Thought-out woolly mammoth That's been forced into doing tricks In an alien circus on a distant planet With more gravity than here on Earth That is some serious fucking Soreness But my agonized trembling muscles Gave me the perfect opportunity to try out Today's sponsor, Cryo Freeze If you're looking to get rid of nagging Muscle and joint pain immediately While providing long-lasting recovery Then you need to try the natural breakthrough Pain Relief Solution Cryo Freeze, CBD Developed by OMACS Health It's a combination of CBD And menthol And it works It's 100% natural And within 15 minutes of application You get relief that lasts up to 8 hours I tested this claim It was like a frozen angel breathed On my biceps and the pain evaporated Within 15 minutes, it really works The frozen angels over at OMACS Health Are offering my listeners 20% off A full bottle of Cryo Freeze Pain Relief Roll-On plus free shipping This discount also applies towards any product Site-wide.

I do, and Neville would always say That if you have friction in the world Leave the world alone Leave the other person alone and just look in the mirror Just keep coming back to the mirror Don't try to change the other The world is nothing but myself pushed out Look in the mirror And again, there's something so liberating About it because instead of changing Mike or trying to persuade Mike of my point of view I can Withdraw into the recesses of my own psyche And work out whatever needs Working out That's the teaching It's so crazy, and just the Strange relief that I've been going back and spending time With People who I've hurt In those moments Living out those moments as though I wasn't selfish Wasn't angry Looking at my mom before she passed In a way that I wasn't lost In the fear of her dying And it does produce Almost instantaneous I'm not saying external change But a sense of That's how you forgive yourself You don't forgive yourself by being like Okay, I forgive me now You go back and revise You go back and revise And Neville would also say to people That there are sometimes these gestation periods Sometimes there's a time interval And he had an expression In assumption, though false If persisted in Will concretize into fact In assumption, though false If persisted in will concretize into fact And he would say, look We see in the natural world A chick takes 30 days to hatch A baby, a human baby 9 months, a horse 11 months, a goat, 6 months So sometimes there will be a time interval And he would say, you know Just let that be, let that be If you wish to be in Paris And you wake up and you find you're still In your old circumstances That may feel disappointing and that is understandable But just stay with it Because this gestation period Sometimes just has to be abided Oh, wow, man Only just because another of the things I've been visualizing is taking my wife to Paris No way! How wonderful! Wow! We're getting it all done! Can you tell me an example Of working with this philosophy here? Oh, sure. I find that For me personally, sometimes The results seem fairly Instant and sometimes, as I was referencing There are these gestation periods I had an instance recently Where I sat for A shoot with a certain photographer A really, really great photographer Who a friend had hooked me up with And the photographer showed me One of the contact sheets From what he was working on And the pictures were Exactly something Exactly something, the very scene That I had imagined Myself being in when I was 20 years old I remember it as vividly as The fingers on my hand And I have a lot of instances Like that in life where Sometimes time will pass And I determine this unbelievable Symmetry. I want to share Something intimate with you and your listeners And this is heavy Because it's disclosing of something personal But at the same time, it's important to be blunt When I was a little kid I mentioned memories going back to My earliest years Of forming cognizant Long-term memories. So say When I was very, very young, even 4 years old 5 years old I might be playing a game with the kids in my neighborhood Like boys play war games And things like that. War is fun, right? So we all like to play that game And while my friends and I Were engaged in this war game Silently Without telling them, without disclosing them I was playing along Doing all the stuff everybody else was doing But I was imagining myself actually As an actor in a movie In a war movie with the camera on me And I would even imagine that The sandbox and things like that That we were playing in was like a movie set And that was My earliest wish at that age For whatever reason That's what I did. That was my fantasy life And it took Years and years and years But I am at mid-life today So-called living out On camera, in front of Microphones, in front of audiences All the things that I was imagining When I was a little kid I was never playing the game I was playing an actor in the game Neville was an actor himself and he said We're all Thespians, we're all actors And I'm living That out in my life today After many, many twists and turns And I find myself living Exactly the life that occupied My earliest memories and fantasies And I get chills sometimes over it It's like, well it is like that Because you know we're sort of Where this goes to To me is I get The other day as I'm listening to this I had this thought, like oh my god It's not that They're going to invent a time machine It's that we are The time machine. Absolutely Absolutely Time travel Understood from this perspective as a mental act And we're engaging in it all the time In fact, when we have Those little fantasies, we like to play these Therapeutic games with ourselves What would I say to my younger self If I could travel back and give counsel To myself at age 12, age 13 Seen from this perspective We're doing that constantly So be careful, be careful Because we're doing that constantly If linear time is an illusion And I think we can say that at this point In the 21st century Linearity is a very necessary illusion For five sensory beings We know that time bends So to speak at light speed Bends in circumstances of extreme gravity Everyone accepts that The implications of that are a different story We accept the data We don't accept the implications If time is An illusion, if linearity is a Necessary illusion Then everything is going on at once And our sensory Organs are nothing other Than tools of measurement Just like the tools used in the quantum lab So to say I'm going to go back To my younger self, that's literally real It would have to be It follows that it would have to be Wow, it's so wild Because what we're looking at here Is the time machine Learning how to operate itself And so we're seeing a kind of If you were building a time machine If Then somewhere along the course Of the things forming And maybe the time machine would be like The improbability drive in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy So improbable that it would come into existence That it came into existence That's what it does, but in this case It would almost be working its way Even though we're saying time is one thing From our perspective, it's growing From the future back into the past Exactly, exactly And that means that we're at the point where It's just gaining enough sentience To begin to dial in To not just measure, but to dial in coordinates So to speak Exactly, beautifully put To your listeners Everybody out there who's listening right now I want you to please think of the time When you first learned to ride a bicycle Just hold a mental picture of when you first learned To ride a bicycle When you first felt that you were riding without the training wheels You felt the handlebars, boom Everybody has a mental picture of that And everybody is certain, yep That's precisely what happened, is it? You may have created that right now at this instant Right now at this instant As vivid and as real as the chairs were seated on Again, man, I love being around I don't want to I like being around people who do this kind of work Okay I do too Me too It's always Again, I don't mean to keep doing it I think it was day before yesterday I was just thinking about my dad Teaching me How to ride my bike Yeah, it's crazy, right? Yeah, it's funny, it's just really curious May I share a very quick story Just about how time gets All mixed up and everything? Very, very quick I'm really interested in The band, The Monkeys I have all these crazy, crazy synchronicities with The Monkeys Just the other day I was in Kansas City I ran into Mickey Dolan's from The Monkeys Who was totally chill and nice and lovely And About two years ago Just out of the fucking blue I start getting into the music of The Monkeys And everybody around me is like Fuck, what's wrong with you? Like, why are you so into The Monkeys? And I'm like going full throttle on The Monkeys I'm reading biographies, doing this, doing that And okay, this was in the summer Come October I get this call From an editor at The Washington Post And he said, we have been trying to find you And I'm like, why am I so hard to find? And he said, your email's not working, something's going wrong Anyway, he said, do you know Michael Nesmith from The Monkeys? And I said, well, I know of him, of course And he said, do you know Mike Nesmith Has been Over the course of his life a Christian scientist And I said, no, no, I didn't know that And he said, do you know him personally? And I said, no And he said, do you know he just wrote a memoir? No, would you like to review it? And I was like, well, you know, fuck yes Nesmith writes this memoir called Infinite Tuesday, which is really Brilliant and wonderful about Among other things, about time loops About the non-existence of linearity And all of this came to me In this kind of seemingly backwards way Where I had cultivated this crazy Interest in The Monkeys And then months later, the editor Comes to me and invites me to review Nesmith's memoir, Infinite Tuesday Which is a great book And I was already so prepped So prepared, so ready to go I was almost embarrassed to tell my editors Over the post, I wrote the review In 24 hours because It was like a whole universe Of Prep had already come to me Months prior, and I Put all this in the review and to their Credit, they kept it in the review You don't find like a lot of psychedelic Philosophy necessarily in the book review Session of the post, but there it was And, you know, so it was a case In which there was such symmetry And there was such A sense of Time just being in this state Of what he calls Infinite Tuesday Not a past, present, and future But one great superposition Whole, just one story I wanted to share Whoa, it's It's, you know Well, again There's a lot of places my mind wants to go But I do want to sort of ground it In some questions I did have for you Please. Okay, so One of, I'm Simultaneously listening to In Love with the World By Ming-gyu Rinpoche Which he's a, it's a great book He's a Tool-ku who Snuck out of his Monastery and went and lived the life of a Beggar for, I think, three or five years This is an extra treat or whatever It's really good, but Because my main At least for last year, my main focus has been Like Some Vajrayana Buddhism, some Chogyam Trumpa I've been trying to Bridge these two philosophies Buddhism and whatever you would call this Yeah. And I've run into I don't want to say a problem with Buddhism because that is so audacious And obviously that's my problem Not Buddhism's problem, but maybe you could Help me with this particular As I feel stuck Goddard's philosophy Which I love Is liberating and also self-directed Yes. Whereas It feels like in Buddhism And some other philosophies Like Meister Eckhart Christian Mysticism Yeah. We find a place Of Thy will be done. Yes. A disconnect from the self And kind of just let this be As it is and learn to accept it As it is. Don't worry About forming your desires Into time and space Because that's just going to cause more suffering Anyway. Don't get in the way Of the Pin of the divine That fights your life on the page of time Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't fuck it up, man. It's doing, it's perfect as it is But what I love about Goddard is He isn't saying that. He's like, no you are writing the book Yeah. Write what you want So can you make these two things work Or are they just, is my analysis Correct? Is that what's going on? I think your analysis is correct And I've been in that particular place Myself. There were times actually where I felt torn in two by my dedication to Neville and my dedication To a philosophy that might be Annunciated as, I will be done Because Neville's philosophy And this can push some people's buttons Is really my will be done Neville would say that your desires Are sacred. Your desires are prophecy Your desires should never Be neglected because they are The voice of God itself That voice being your own Human imagination Neville would say there is no God Other than your own wonderful Imagination. And his system does have An ethical reciprocity A cosmic reciprocity So it's not as if it just gives the individual Cart Blanche to do unto others Because whatever you're doing unto others By definition in his philosophy You're doing unto self But he would say that Your desires are the voice Of God speaking to you And that these things are not to be resisted He would also say that Desire satisfaction Is only one element of his philosophy The whole point of all this Mental causation is to eventually Become acquainted with yourself Because as you discover The creative capacities of your mind That's a necessary doorway Through which you begin to discover Your own true identity Your own sacred identity And that as you pass through this world of Caesar And you experience all kinds Of things and maybe get all kinds Of goodies or what have you Eventually, eventually Those things are just detritus Those things are only necessary stepping stones To realizing the nature Of your own true self Which is God or Christ Closed in human flesh as he would put it And that's to me is the scary part I gotta admit it, this is where it gets scary And in this type of Buddhism There's dream yoga You've heard of this, the concept of dream yoga? I haven't, tell me about this I'm gonna give you this book The idea of Sleep and dreaming and sleep And so This is a practice that Is similar to Some of the Teachings of God What's the western astral projection You wrote journeys out of the body You know what I'm talking about? I know it, I can't summon it I'll put in the link friends It's a great book if you want to learn how to lucid dream But within the techniques of lucid dreaming A lot of us have heard Set your timer every 10 minutes And then look around and ask yourself If you're in a dream And then when you're dreaming you've conditioned yourself And you're gonna look around in the dream Like oh fuck I'm dreaming And then within that space you can fly You can walk through walls, you can do true miracles In a dream state The difference in the Tibetan yoga of dreaming and sleep Is it says begin to recognize That you're in a dream right now And it's not an intellectual exercise It's no, this This is a dream And you begin to As part of this yoga and it's so The author of this book is so emphatic About this That he has to leave a note at the end of the chapter About that which is like don't jump off a building Don't go nuts It's that level of like you are in a dream Right now And then when you do that You'll notice focus happens You don't get A dreamy, you get really In the moment and things get very clear So this The reason that There's to me something that's a little terrifying About what Neville Goddard is talking about Is that that gestation period That you're talking about seems to be More of a self-imposed Gestation period Because we aren't ready yet For the big reveal The big lifting of the veil Boom, beautifully put And I would add An exercise of Neville's That relates to lucid dreaming I might call it cognizant dreaming Neville's method prescribes Entering in To a state of mental creativity Just in those few moments before you drift off To sleep at night This is what sleep researchers call the hypnagogic state And it's a very special supple state Of mind because when you're Hovering between wakefulness And sleep You're in a kind of dream-like hallucinatory state Reality seems to morph and bend You can hear noises But you're still cognizant You still have some control over your attention And as Neville put it, that is prime time For mental creativity And that if you can induce yourself Into that drowsy state In between sleep and wakefulness We all enter it naturally twice a day Just as we're falling asleep at night And just as we're coming to in the morning Neville would do it through a nap He would take it 3pm each afternoon When you're in that so-called hypnagogic state That is the state Of real mental fertility And sleep researchers As well as serious psychological researchers Have identified that as prime time For self-suggestion For the occurrence of ESP-related activities Neville just had this natural instinct That that was a time In which the mind was uniquely supple The great French mind theorist Emile Couet made this point as well And I think Emile Couet was a great influence On Neville in his written work So you can just Go into this naturally Meditative drowsy state You do twice a day anyway And you can direct your attention Within this dream-like world But you still have cognizant control It relates sort of to lucid dreaming And Neville felt that is The greatest platform That we possess Of being time of day that we possess For engaging in mental creativity He would say use that time To picture yourself in a certain Scene that you want to be in Don't see the scene as if it's up on a movie screen But see yourself in it Like maybe someone shaking your hand and congratulating you Or maybe if you want to be married Feeling a wedding ring on your finger Or saying I do with the altar Feel yourself in the scene Repeated as many times as it feels natural And then drift off to sleep The great tool, it's not the only tool But the greatest tool that we possess For mental creativity And he really Really means feel yourself In that place It's not an intellectual thing You have to be like Literally be there You have to jump into that place And to me what within his Philosophy And it does coincide with My rudimentary explorations of quantum physics Is the implication That there is a Way to evade death As sentient as possible That you could theoretically drop Your entire Dream life And open your eyes and be in whatever The alchemical laboratory Of the divine that we're currently Apparently inebriated on fumes From a beaker with a blue in our face Or whatever it is You could theoretically You could just wake up And this is the most controversial Area of Neville's teachings And it's one that I've sat with for a long time As a student, including as a critical student Because Look If one accepts this mystical Quantum model That all of reality is in a state of superposition Then you'd have to argue That birth, death, everything Every passage of life is in superposition And that death is just an experience Death is just a perception And that sounds very high and mighty Of me seated in front of a Microphone To say death is just a perception But this is where I stop And I say to my Friends within the new age culture My friends within the new thought culture Go visit a children's cancer ward Before you start expounding on this idea Of death being just a perception Be very, very careful with that Because I would also contend That we experience many laws and forces And we experience them with such Vividness and such Absolute tactile reality That I think we fail Sometimes to underestimate When we start to get very exuberant About some of these things The position of great disadvantage That we as five sensory beings Can find ourselves in If I were to step my toe on a table Right now, I would feel pain My body undergoes changes We all experience physical decline We all experience death Any sensitive person Has witnessed death In an atmosphere Of great support and love and sensitivity I don't believe And I say this as someone who loves Neville And I say this as a lifelong student of Neville I don't believe Neville gave Sufficient weight to the Disadvantage that we men and women Have to always Engaging in this world of Mental creation Mental causation We experience tremendous barriers And we experience laws and forces That can be overwhelming And Proper gravity Must be given to that fact Proper gravity must be given to that fact It's all well and good that I can talk about Death As just a perception But how dare I talk about that On a cancer ward Or someplace where a life has been snuffed out Even in an atmosphere Of support and sensitivity and love We live under many Or I shall say we experience Many laws and forces And if a person doesn't bow To that I think they are leaving out an enormous part Of life that has to be contended with I want to play Devils I hate that term I want to play somebody's advocate Somebody's advocate I don't know who it is When I've been around dying people And I'm lucky because I have been around People who have had good deaths Something really beautiful seems To be happening Now children's ward of a hospital We both have kids I can barely think about that It's Unbearable But when you're in that moment It does kind of seem like To you You're seeing a thing die To this thing It's just putting the body down And this is again By the way guys I don't think I'm going to live forever Anyone's going to live forever But To get into the quantum Physics thing that I read Which is you are going to know more about They were talking about quantum computers And they were saying that Actually the implication in some of this stuff Is you really don't die Your consciousness leaps over into some parallel universe The onion skin And you just keep going And whatever thing it pops over to This does seem to Live it well with the Tibetan Buddhists The bardo-thought-all The concept of in the bardo-state There is a potential to direct Your Liminal astral Whatever the hell that momentum is That's floating through there into your next birth Into Something that is Special to that state Versus human existence To me I think There isn't a chance here Even in the children's ward of the hospital What you're witnessing If we're going to go full Snorting full lines of pure goddards In that children's hospital You're looking at The part of the multiverse You're hanging out in right now You're seeing that place But you theoretically Could upshift that To being not a hospital anymore To being some kind of futuristic Healing place And then you could upshift that one more time To a convergence of souls And upshift that one more time Until finally you're back in that Pure, unitive consciousness state Where the entirety of all of this is like Snow in a snow globe Yes, absolutely And I think that's well put I would add a couple of things to that People could be asking right now Well gee, as Neville's saying That there's no one else here In consciousness He did teach That there are other people here But we crisscross through one another's Dreams of life In this way that summons Or enlists us And vice versa in infinite directions Whenever the individual's Dream of life so requires So he would say that Mitch passes through Duncan's life In this crisscrossing way In this intimate Infinite Superposition universe that we live in Mitch has his own existence Mitch has his own dream of life Mitch has his own feelings But Mitch will crisscross into Duncan's existence Into the experience of Duncan's listeners At given moments in life We're all God We're all clothed in human flesh We all possess this creative capacity But There's a multitudinous expression To this intelligence In a certain sense, yes When I'm in this children's ward This is where I am This individual is just crisscrossing through my life At this given moment I have ultimate power He has ultimate power And then this teaching gets into The most delicate territory When questions of death and suffering are involved Because sometimes Neville would make Reference and other people loosely In his tradition like Joseph Murphy Who said he shared Neville's teacher Abdullah Talked about this in an interview With a French journalist Towards the end of his life of all things Neville would make reference on occasion Murphy would make reference on occasion To everybody leaving life at just the chosen time Just the right time and I push back against that I push back against that because I haven't verified it And when I speak of self verification And one hears this sometimes in a hypocritical way On the spiritual path, you know, people tell you Verify it for yourself And then in essence what they're really saying is If you come to the same conclusion I have Then come back, you know But until you do I'll argue with you And say you don't get it If we're going to talk in terms of self verification We have to be absolute with that My experience has been There are people who Undergo death and suffering and illness And that is not self selected And that throws us back on the heels Of some very heavy questions about the laws and forces That we live under Or that we experience Not to be trifled with, you know One could say for example That the force of gravity is ever operative It's a universal law But you're going to experience gravity differently Here on earth and you will on the moon or on Jupiter And in space you'll experience its vacuum Even though It's still there and it's still operative Gravity is affected by mass In a certain sense gravity is really mass Being attracted to itself It could be that with this law of mental causation We are affected Circumstantially It could be there different circumstances That interrupt Temper color condition Our experience of mental causation Because I have not been able To verify This ultimate self selected nature Of life to the point where The child him or herself who's Diseased or who doesn't have clean drinking Water is exiting life Under chosen Circumstances or under circumstances You know, cosmically symmetrical I don't believe that Because I haven't experienced that And I ask people To Respect this Principle of self verification To the extent that we not talk about experiences We haven't had I haven't been through war I haven't been through 9-11 I haven't been through these human catastrophes I want to hear from people who have And I bow to them I love your critique of it And honestly, as I'm sitting here thinking Why did I have to get into the implications Of this being eternal life and ascension For me, way more pragmatic To talk about what's happening now Which hopefully we are in a place Where we need to worry about ascending So This brings me to Well, something I wanted to say earlier Which is like You were saying you're in your 50s You look great You're vibrant You're healthy You clearly are taking really good care of yourself You have some kind of exercise regimen You know, it's crazy man I mean, I thank you for saying all that I don't take as good a care of myself As you might think I drink I smoke I do recreational drugs I definitely do that I don't sleep And so I feel very blessed And I feel very fortunate And I feel very grateful, you know To you for saying that But it's not as if I am some sort of fitness vulture I mean, I do take care of myself In the sense that I do exercise I do bicycle and all that jazz But I, it's the craziest thing Duncan, I have experienced This sense of youthful exuberance in my 50s I feel better I look better I enjoy life more than I did in my 20s It's crazy Say of it what you will You're definitely not a vulture, you're an eagle You're a fitness eagle And I, right So that's an interesting point But for me, what I've been As part of this experiment I have been getting up at 4am every morning And going to exercise And I've been doing it consistently Within reason, when there's like You know, when I'm exhausted You can really fuck yourself up by not getting enough sleep But for me This has been Equivalent to levitation In other words, the gravitational Hold of my Subjective Limitations Is keeping me trapped inside a specific type of body And so The practice, this Goddard stuff Aside from like the weird coincidences Has resulted in like A consistent Workout for the last month More than I have ever been consistent In my entire life And so to me, that is the ascension And that is the as above so below So again, we cannot, in the same way that Like we can't talk About what it's like to be On Saturn, for example But we can use our understanding Of physics here And our, you know Now our telescopic ability Black holes colliding Well, hopefully we're never going to experience that If we do, we're gone Right, right, right But we can still use Our understanding of physics here Where we are in the galaxy In the universe To understand what that would look like Even what it might feel like Even what it might sound like and smell like So similarly to me It's like, fuck, if I can literally Recode My behavior patterns By starting in my mind Connecting to a version of me That's healthier than I am right now Becoming that person I was doing this at the gym and the When I first started it, looking at myself And having that First thing where I'm like, fuck man, dammit You really let yourself go And then replacing that with Seeing through myself In that form Into my completely healthy form And now I'm watching my body Start changing into that And it is astounding Because nothing else has gotten Has really worked like that before So if that can happen With the physical body In the sense your thoughts can Literally change your body vessel Then the implication is just Crazy We're talking true levitation We're talking walking through walls I'm doing it again, I'm sorry Mitch We're talking all the shit you hear About gurus doing translocation And all that stuff You know I would say this Never neglect The means, the channels of arrival For whatever it is that you're interested in Some people could say, well gee Duncan Of course you look great because you've been working out That's simple right, we get it Well it's not so simple because There are always going to be different means And different channels of arrival I have wished for things including very intimate things That I have received But sometimes the means might come Through different ways, look we live in this world Of experiences as I've repeatedly said We experience many laws and forces If you wish for a house It ain't going to be like jack and the bean stock Where you throw the beans out the window And the vine or the house grows But it could be that your friend Mike says to you Oh shit I've just been working a Contracting job on this killer house You have to come take a look at it It wouldn't be natural To sit in a room and say, no thanks Mike I don't need to look at it because the house Is just going to appear Honor the channels of arrival Honor the channels of arrival It might come in a multitude of ways Some of them very ordinary But the ordinary can lead to extraordinary There's all these myths through religious tradition In every faith That gods or angels or deities Will come disguised as strangers And the person who invites in the stranger And is hospitable to him Will be granted great rewards How often do we neglect gods and angels Who are disguised as strangers Because that's too ordinary That's too ordinary It can't arrive that way It can't arrive in a pill It can't arrive through some ordinary procedure Well of course it can Fuck that's heavy man I never, oh my god I feel so dumb The other thing Goddard's doing is The invitation to Goddard out says there wasn't a Jesus This is a psychological process There is no historic Christ We're talking about outside of you Yes Neville makes the point He argues that there's no Historiography whatsoever in scripture There's not a word in scripture that's historical It's all a psychological blueprint And I have to say this also Is where I serve as a critical student of Neville's Because there are some Areas of scripture old and New Testament That really lend themselves well To a symbolical reading But the book of Chronicles for example Is just a recitation of generations It's really very dry reading And again In the name of self verification I have read scripture I have spent a long, long time I had an Orthodox Bar Mitzvah I have read Old Testament I have read New Testament And I can assure you There are passages that do not Lend themselves to the same kind Of symbolical Analysis That others do And sometimes May the purists forgive me Sometimes I feel that Neville would cherry pick from scripture I get that sits Okay great It's okay because I can like correct For that but honor the channels Of arrival Does this diverge a little bit from Neville's philosophy Because he would say things like Once you've done this thing where you become That which you wish To be The person who lives in that house Or the person who has that form He doesn't say worry about it He says that's it You're done, you did it He does say that, you're absolutely right He says you're done, you did it As soon as you're in the feeling state The reality is accomplished And that's the end of the variable Because it will unfold in its own perfectly natural Wonderful way And I think you can find in Neville's work If he doesn't say this explicitly He certainly says it implicitly We live in the world of Caesar And we have to honor that I have a friend who is the head Of a midsize industrial firm in the Midwest And this is where this Neville stuff is wonderful Because you can become friends with everyone Conservative dude with a crew cut Who drinks beer, smokes cigars Really intimate friends And he says to me, listen Nobody I work with knows I'm into this Neville stuff And I have a board of directors To whom I have to answer And they want a business plan I know the business plan because I understand Mental creativity But these dudes need from me Pieces of paper, so what should I do And I said honor them, man You live in a world of Caesar I live in a world of Caesar Give those guys what they need And behind what's going on Honor Caesar, but you know the engine of creation Okay, let me stop you there, this is actually I'm so glad you're bringing this up Because I've heard, and maybe I misunderstood I think I read Crowley saying If magic works for you If you have a successful If it works, then you have to Say out loud Did I misunderstand? And also the denial of Christ Is equivalent to this Which is like if you're using This incredible philosophy And it's working for you That you say that it's the paper Isn't it a disservice? Isn't it a... Well, he says it to me And I quote him in my books, albeit anonymously So that other people can Rock to this and learn from it But I think Neville would probably say Based on the parables of Scripture Don't cast your pearls before swine Render unto Caesar what is Caesar If there's somebody who's going to throw rocks at you Because they don't dig it Don't talk about it in front of the rock thrower Just leave the rock thrower to himself Do your thing and then tell your friend Mitch But you don't have to tell your rock thrower That's cool And also it reminds me in the Bhagavad Gita It says don't disturb the minds Of people who aren't ready for this Let him be P. D. Uspensky, the great mathematician And Mystic said life is like a train yard In which there's all these trains Going around and sometimes they're going crazy And they're going to bump into people They're going to bump into you Your job is not to fix broken machines But your job is to get out of their way Wow Get out of the way of the broken machine While you're working on your machine Yeah This is my final question It's going to seem like I'm being obnoxious And trying to find some crazy similar question To me Another big takeaway from this is that There is the potential For a global utopia World harmony That Shambhala or the mythical Cities are already existing Coordinates In this multiverse of the Goddard is talking about In a person's life even better Than ascending And not dying You could theoretically somehow Drive your Awareness It's not manifesting It's selecting You could select a planet Where there is harmony Where we have found a way to heal the planet Where there is a way to Drive your multiverse ship there Do you think that's possible? I would have to agree that it's possible Based on the implications of this law Neville said the lion Lying down with the lamb Is literal fact And it will come to be fact in time But we as individuals Are far away from that We have to learn who we really are And as we learn who we really are And as we come to a true sense Of our cosmic identity That world becomes fact That world becomes fact It may take the perception of many lifetimes But that world eventually Becomes fact because that's the nature Of where we emanate from Mitch Thank you so much It is always just a And also, by the way, thank you That thing that's happened to me with this Regimented workout thing It's directly because of you You came through Noah Lamper You echoed through time Wonderful And now you have a Peter Frampton t-shirt To wear with your new physique We love Peter Frampton Thank you Pleasure, man Magician of the Beautiful Now out on all the usual places Is there a place you want to direct people to?

Welcome. When you die, you step out of a simulator in a video arcade in a mall in the future and realize you're playing a game called don't be an asshole. It was the early 90s or maybe the late 80s. I can't really remember. I was driving through Fletcher, North Carolina with two of my dear friends and we were high as a fucking kite on really good acid. Darryl was at the wheel, shouldn't have been driving, but he was good at driving on acid. It was something he was proud of and he looked in the back seat where Jerry was writhing around laughing and said to him, Jerry, we're almost out of quarters. Jerry said, what do you mean? And he said, the simulator, don't you remember we're in a simulator at the mall that makes it seem like you're riding in a car. I thought this was hilarious and went along with it. Yeah, man, we're about out of money, so we need some more quarters. At that point, Jerry sat upright and said, I'll put some more quarters in and jumped out of the car. Luckily, we were slowing down for a stoplight. Looking back, I'm not sure if Jerry really believed we were in a simulator or if he was trying to teach us a kind of transcendent lesson, a message to all those who subscribe to any ideology that gives you the sense that the world you're living in is an illusion. In some ways, I think Jerry jumping out of the car high on acid was a critique of those particular modes of thinking. Yeah, sure, they're great as a temporary thought experiment, but the reality of the situation is we're not in a simulator. People can really get hurt here. Not just people, trees and animals and all the sweet furry darlings that live on our planet that we share with them. This conversation with the day's guest Peter Kalmas reminded me of this in a really intensely beautiful way. So stick around, we'll be back after this. You know, I know that many of you are sleeping on old clumps of hair or bits of rusty metal that you've woven together using the dried tendons you found in the dumpster outside of the slaughterhouse near where you live, but you deserve a better bed than that.

He works at JPL slash NASA and he's written an awesome book which you can download from his website, peterkalmas.net. It's called being the change, live well and spark a climate revolution. If you're somebody like me and you feel hesitant to even listen to stuff regarding the environment because it makes you feel depressed, forge ahead friends because this conversation had the exact opposite effect on me. I feel inspired and enthusiastic about looking into ways that I could be less of a drain on our beautiful planet here and I'm sure you will too after listening to Peter's very passionate defense of our beautiful planet. Now everybody welcome to the DTFH Peter Kalmas. Peter, welcome to the DTFH. How nice to see you in person. Oh crap. Hold on. I got to tell my kids not to play piano in the background. Oh, no problem. Go ahead and by the way, ambient child background noise, completely acceptable for this podcast. Just letting you know. Can you hear the like WC happening in the background there? I can't hear it and it's okay. The ambient noise is okay and then because if you worry too much about trying to control the chaos of your children during a podcast, I've learned, I've just started developing the scope. Like, oh, that's just what it's like and I make sure the people know there's a toddler. What do you want? There's savage and wild children and wild creatures. Well, these kids are 12 and 14 and they're the 12 year olds. Pretty serious about his piano. I really loved it. It was your kids that inspired you to make this big leap in your life that I think a lot of us want to make but for whatever reason, we just don't make it. I want to talk about that for whatever reason. Yeah. Should we start over? Are we like going now? We're going. Okay. Because I didn't say it was an honor to be here. I feel honored that someone like you would even be interested in being on my show. So thank you. The respect is mutual. You've done a lot of great work for the world and it's a real honor to have you on the show. So thanks for being here, Peter. Yeah. Well, it's a pleasure. You're out there in California right now, right? To me, this is just to get to the meat of the thing, man. I just left LA. I left LA driving through ash, falling from the sky. I left LA with the sun turning red like blood. I left LA with air that you couldn't breathe after a pretty fucked up earthquake. And all of a sudden, all of my laziness and weird derision towards people who seemed very passionate about the environment seemed like, and I don't mean derision. I just mean a kind of like, I don't, I know, but I don't want to hear about it. I just want to deal with it. It's too much to think about. All of a sudden, I was looking at ash in the sky and thinking, holy shit, this is why they're like that, because they know this happens and they know that this is the future. If people don't figure out a way to pull themselves out of their torpor, paralysis, or whatever, whatever the fuck it is. But to me, what I love about your voice in this particular world is that you really do seem to have some form of compassion for us, or at the very least an understanding that if the message isn't articulated in a way that isn't fear-based, panic-based, anger-based, then it ends up, people just don't listen. Is that how you feel? Am I grogging you correctly? Well, you know, I just, I'm terrified of what's happening right now, and I don't feel like I have a choice. Like, my voice, it's just coming from these emotions that I feel. I mean, I do see the scientific projections, and it can be hard to keep track of how fast things are changing. You know, the news comes so fast. We've lost two-thirds of wild species populations, and the, you know, the green and the nice sheets melting faster than we thought it was, and sea level projections are always getting revised upwards. And then to be living through this in the present moment. So we, you know, a couple weekends ago here in Los Angeles, we had this crazy heatwave where in a lot of parts of Southern California, it actually, you know, got up to 120 degrees. Yeah. Some places it was a little bit hotter than that for a couple of days. And so I've got like little baby avocado trees, and their leaves like turned crispy, and I can't, I kind of go a little bit insane when it gets that hot. And then, of course, it was completely predictable. This set off a string of mega fires all up and down the West Coast. And since then, we've had, you know, a couple of weeks of just terrible air quality. So I live in a place called Altadena, which is northeast Los Angeles. It's kind of in the foothills. And it has been like ground zero for smoke from the bobcat fire, which is burning a couple of miles away from here. And I don't know why it turns out that my body is kind of sensitive to the smoke. So I get headaches, I get, you know, eye burning, I get, this is a really creepy one for me is I get like tingling in my fingers and hands. And sometimes if it's really bad, like in my lips a little bit, like this kind of warm, tingly feeling. Yeah. And, and so I've been like kind of hunkered down, we have one HEPA filter, and we put it in the bedroom. And I've been, I went from like living my life in this house, because of the coronavirus, to like living my life in this one bedroom, because, you know, because of the smoke. And now the air is not safe when you go indoors and there is not safe when you go outdoors. And so yeah, this is, you know, I don't know how to say this, you know, in a nice way, but this is all going to get worse if we don't wake up as a species. And if we don't stop burning fossil fuels, it couldn't, it really couldn't, in some ways, it couldn't be more simple. But of course, you know, fossil fuels are running almost every aspect of our lives right now. So, so doing that kind of disentangling ourselves from that, and from these giant corporations that basically, you know, make easy money by sucking the stuff out of the ground and then selling it and frankly don't give a shit about our futures. There must be some, I'm sure they don't think they're evil. You know, from our point of view, like they, you know, the planets at stake, the future of the next few tens of thousands of human generations is at stake. So it looks evil to us, but I'm sure they have like weird psychological rationalizations where they think somehow they're, I talked to these executives from Shell once, I had lunch with them. They actually picked up the tab, which was nice of them. And they gave me these, they gave me these, I know, so generous, right? They gave me these glossy pamphlets, you know, with all their greenwash, like how they're planning. But you know what these executives told me, they told me that Shell will go as fast as its customers allow them to go. I was just like, God smacked. I'm like, they, they don't, they have no stake in trying to sort of halt this, this massive, like we all see it and feel it now, right? This massive climate and ecological breakdown that we're experiencing it, that'll just keep, you know, digging out the coal and sucking out the oil and fracking for the fossil gas until, you know, what, until we don't have anything left, right? Until it's, this is just like, you know, this, the Mad Max world with like vastly reduced biodiversity and, you know, a multi-thousand mile band of land around the equator where like, you know, one and a half billion people live that we can't live anymore as humans. So, so yeah, it's like, it's just like the scientific, the science fiction dystopia that I see coming. How am I, as a human and a father of two beautiful boys and someone who cares deeply about the giant sequoias and the Joshua trees and the coral reefs, how am I supposed to talk about this? That's my question, right? I've been labeled an alarmist and the climate deniers try to shut me up. And, and all I'm trying to do is sound, I think, very justifiably sound the alarm on what's happening so we can preserve what's left of this livable planet for our poor kids and their kids and their kids. And it's like a cosmic thing, right? It's, it's so many generations here that will be affected by decisions that humanity makes in the next few years. It's, um, this is the only place we know that has life and we're fucking it up right now. Well, what, but I want to talk to you about something. This is something that's emerging now, like essentially the data that's coming in, it seems to be pointing to some kind of exponential catastrophe. Like you're saying that melting ice sheets and people are starting to get in their head. A really brutal idea, which is it's already too fucking late. Hunker down. It doesn't matter what you do. This thing is over. Even if you do become like you are, um, you're, you're like, I was reading, you calculated like you don't use much fossil fuel. You're, um, someone who has managed mostly to reduce your carbon consumption in this incredible way. I find it to be very inspiring, including not flying, uh, which is easier these days, thanks to the pandemic. But a kind of like dark shadow seems to have fallen over the entire science because people who are really telling the truth are now kind of saying like, I don't even, I don't know. There's nothing, like if everyone stopped moving right now, if everyone like just stayed in their house and stopped, we're still kind of fucked, right? Uh, okay. So there's a lot there to unpack. Um, so first of all, okay, we're, we're, I would say we're already pretty fucked. And I think the fires on the west coast, uh, and these heat waves, which the heat waves now globally are like more than three times, uh, as frequent extreme heat waves as they were in like the 1960s. And that's going to get worse. I mean, it's just as global heating, it's, it's basic physics. Uh, you, we emit this CO2 from burning fossil fuels. It's just like little three, three atom molecule with an angle in it. And, and because of that geometry, it's able to interact with infrared radiation. These like photons that come from the earth, which would otherwise escape into space. They hit one of these CO2 molecules from fossil fuel, things starts vibrating, and then eventually it reemits an infrared photon in any random direction. So some of it comes back down to earth. So that's how it acts as blanket. Um, and, and that basic global heating, of course, one of the main effects is just worsening heat waves. Right. Uh, that's, that's one of the most basic effects. And also, frankly, one of the reasons I'm a climate activist, because again, my body just doesn't do well with that. I go crazy when it gets too hot. Um, there's actually psychological research behind that too, you know, the murder rate increases during heat waves, for example. Yeah. But, but that said, that said, um, you know, we're climate breakdown is here. We have to accept that. We're seeing it. We're living through it. More and more people are starting to have their lives and livelihoods affected by it. Right. But I would say no matter how bad it gets, we should all keep fighting as hard as we can, because it could always get worse. It's not like a binary switch that's either on or off. Okay. Uh, you know, one and a half, we're, you peep, a lot of people say, don't talk about the degrees because it's their, their eyes will glaze over, but I think it's kind of a little bit helpful, right? So we're at about 1.1 degrees Celsius of global heating right now. If you take the average of all the thermometers on the planet, we're a little over a degree Celsius, which is like two degrees Fahrenheit over what we ought to be if we hadn't been polluting the planet with these greenouts gas emissions for the last 200 years. Um, it's going to be way worse if we get to 1.5. And it's going to be worse than that. If we get to two, it's going to be worse than that. If we get to 2.5. And you know, I don't think there's, I don't think there's a point when we slip and we lose the entire earth and it becomes like Venus. Like there was some discussion about that at earlier points. I don't personally think that that's very likely, but there are these other kind of like smaller tipping points that can happen, which will be really bad. Like we could lose the Amazon rainforest. In fact, I personally don't think that it's, I doubt that it's savable at this point. We're losing the coral reefs in real time right now because they're so sensitive to ocean heat waves. So that's a, I don't think we, I think there might be little pockets of coral reefs here and there for, you know, until kind of late in the century. But if, and, and which means if we, you know, drastically reign in our emissions, as I think we should, they might have a chance after a few hundred years when things start to cool down a little bit to start moving back into areas that they formerly inhabited. I'm not sure. There's the, the Atlantic overturning circulation, which is part of like this global network of ocean currents, right? And that's starting to change now, which can have, you know, pretty serious implications for weather, for example, in Europe. Of course, there's the Greenland ice sheet that we already mentioned. There's, you know, permafrost and the Arctic, which could get released. So there's, there's all of these, you know, there's numerous tipping points in the earth systems, this vast complicated thing. And we, the thing is, we don't know where those are and exactly when they'll occur and exactly how they'll unfold and how they'll interconnect between each other and how they'll necessarily, you know, how they'll affect human systems that we depend on as a species for life. But they're out there in this murky climate future. And every day that we emit more fossil fuels makes those tipping points a little bit more likely, but we don't know exactly when they'll happen. And we can probably still stop some of them. And there's probably some that we haven't even really figured out yet, which we'll, you know, we don't, we prefer not to find out about. So it's this, it's this complicated, messy, gigantic earth system. And it's still beautiful. I mean, let's face it, like we're, we're fucking it up. We go around saying we're the smartest species, but we're the only ones, only species right now that's screwing everything up for all the other species on this planet. So I'm not sure we qualify as being the smartest, but let's face it, there's still incredible stuff on this planet. And it's, it's still a, this life support system, like literally we owe everything we have. Like you take a breath right now, that air comes from the fact that we have a living planet, right? You drink water, same thing. You're protected from cosmic rays and ultraviolet radiation by our atmosphere, same thing. You know, the magnetic, there's magnetic field. So we have this, this incredible, you take a bite of food, right? You, I mean, literally we are the earth. We're a part of this like, this crazy, massive living thing that's constantly recycling itself, you know, we die and then we get eaten by the worms when we turn into trees and then someone needs to fruit and you take a breath and that air from that breath has been in the lungs of every other human on this planet above like the age of 20 or something. So there's this mixing time scale. Yeah. It's like the air takes maybe around 20 years to mix around the planet, something like that. Wait, can you say that again? Say that again. So that can really soak in when you take a breath. Yeah. So a little baby, a little baby's breathing air in and out. Yeah. And that baby's, those baby's breaths haven't had a chance to like spread to China and to Alaska and to all the other places on the planet. But, but after about 20 years, those breaths have spread all around. So, you know, when you, when you exhale carbon dioxide, you know, it's you, you eat food, you take a bite of an apple, your body basically combusts that right through cellular respiration and it goes out as CO2 and then someone else breathes that in. And so we're all, we're all literally breathing each other, right? Because that carbon, that carbon that you're breathing out used to be part of your body essentially, right? In some sense. So, you know, the same thing goes for all the other species, true, like the, the trees and the animals that are on this planet. We're all literally just kind of these in a very literal way. We're, we're atoms that are in this big kind of recycling thing, right? That's gone back four billion years, right? And then life came, I don't know, three billion years ago, I can't remember all the numbers. But it's this, I think of it as this big just sort of beautiful system of, of just life and death and like things kind of like a flower opening, right? And in time lapse, but it's like on the whole planet. How much do you think that the tumult in the world right now? The, the, the, how much do you think politics, the economic stuff that's happening in the world, all the stuff that we're seeing that just looks like, to some degree, chaos or revolutions or whatever you want to call it, how much is that linked to the environment? But it's sort of people think that it's happening because of this president or that president or this social movement or that social, is there some deeper pulse behind that? Do you think? Yeah. So one of the things I believe is that right now, if anything, social scientists are more important than climate scientists because climate scientists have like kind of did our jobs. We, we, we understand why this is happening. We understand why the impacts are being driven by the global heat. And we have a pretty good sense of what's coming in the future. There's still some details to fill in, but there's, there's, we know enough right now to, I think, strongly suggest that humanity better get its collective assing here and do something about this or suffer pretty extreme consequences. And yet humanity's doing nothing, right? So that's social science. Like why, how, how are these things affecting humanity right now? How are they effect affecting our geopolitics? And why, why are humans so in the state of torpor, as you say? And I personally believe that there is a pretty significant imprint in our geopolitics right now from climate and ecological breakdown. For example, you know, what was like a year or two ago, there were climate migrants coming up from Central America, right? Because they were having heat waves and drought down there and they couldn't grow food and it was getting too hot for them to live. And so they were coming up and knocking on their southern border and look at like, you know, for a couple of years, all, all of that the United States would talk about basically was immigration. And I think it led to a, it was a nudge towards greater authoritarianism and a more conservative mindset in this sense that like, we don't have enough, and they're going to take it away from us, right? This sense of resource scarcity, which I think subconsciously comes partly from this. So I think that the, you know, a lot of people right now are in denial about this. And I think that denial comes from fear. And I think for a lot of people, they're not sort of self-aware enough to kind of understand, you know, why they're afraid and how climate and ecological breakdown are playing into that fear. But I think there's this sense right now that there isn't going to be enough and that, that a lot of people are going to be coming up from the global south because it's going to get too hot down there. I mean, how many immigrants, how many climate migrants was that? It was like order of like a million, right? Yeah. And so we're talking about like a pressure on our geopolitics a thousand times bigger than that. And it was also very disruptive in Europe, right? When people were trying to cross the Mediterranean. And that, I think that was somewhat due to civil unrest, which might have been linked to some level to climate breakdown. So this stuff is all extremely complicated. There's always, you know, multiple causes here. But the thing that it's like, it's like this, this, this, this complicated noisy music. But underneath it, there's this kind of this rumbling base that gets louder every day. And that's global heating, right? Every day, it gets a little bit harder. Every day, it gets a little bit harder to grow, grow food in the global south and waters running out a little bit more. And you're more likely to get climate migrants. And I think that's, and the geopolitics is this complicated noisy mixture of higher frequencies on top of that. But it's all being affected by this thing, which is getting louder and louder and louder. And every year it gets louder. And it's not going to stop getting louder until we stop emitting fossil fuels. It just isn't. I can say that with 100% certainty. So I don't know how it's going to play out. I don't know if like India and Pakistan are going to have some nuclear water war or something like that. But, you know, human beings are complicated. We're nonlinear. We get frightened. We get collectively frightened. We look for scapegoats. So yeah, I feel like this is a, this is a real crossroads for us right now as a species man. Do you feel like you might be in a movie co-created by HP Lovecraft and Kurt Vonnegut?

I want to emphasize that's the sound in your voice. I feel it. I know what you're feeling. I just left Southern California. I'm up here in beautiful North Carolina. It's green. It's raining. It's beautiful and I can see how if you had been living here in North Carolina hadn't been to LA for a while, you might think you might see the news and be like, well, it's whatever it's their fire season or you might you might not understand. And I kind of feel crazy here because I feel I'm legitimately rattled. I'm somewhere in between being completely disconnected from the earth and like being like a nudist or something, you know, I don't know where exactly, but I don't feel I don't feel I don't feel the way I feel right now. I've never felt like this. I've never and I and I'm around all these people in this beautiful place that and I and I feel like I have this weird look in my eye or I feel like they're you know, just a little rattled and I and I you want to say like you don't understand. It was 115 degrees. It was raining ash. You couldn't breathe. People were being burnt to death. It happened so fast. We might have, you know, we got out of there, but I don't know, you know, and I'm sorry because you're there, but like like I have to kind of like push that part of myself down the part, the alarmist part, because at some point you need an alarm. You need that. Yeah, I want you I want you to wake everyone up. That's what I want you to do. But it's hard. Yeah, it's hard when it's a beautiful day outside and you know, everything seems fine. Like that's that's what we are as an animal. We're a mammal that's geared towards our immediate environment and you know, we're a mammal that that's very tribal. And it's hard for us to empathize, right? It's hard for us to really feel the pain of others. And that's what we have to start doing now. I think I feel like humanity can go in one or two directions right now. And I have to say that the whole coronavirus thing made me feel a little bit less optimistic about which direction I might go, right? I'm like, I'm like, Oh, here's a chance for us to all realize we're in this together. Yeah. And take collective action together. And like, you know, wear a fucking mask for a couple of weeks and tamp this down. And even that simple thing couldn't happen, right? So that was a little bit discouraging because, you know, dealing with climate breakdown is going to take, I would say, a greater level of solidarity and a greater level of sort of collective call to action, right? And so we, I think what their earth is telling us right now in this, in my opinion, this kind of sort of trippy cosmic way is that we've been like, as a species, we've been toddlers, not to have anything against toddlers. But we, maybe we're like rotten teenagers or something. And we've been like, these terrible, this, this terrible roommate on this planet, at least this culture, you know, it's not the human animal necessarily, that's bad, I want to make that clear. But the human animal has like an operating system, right in our brains, which is called culture. And there have been cultures on this planet, mostly indigenous peoples that have lived in, in pretty great balance with the natural world around them, animus peoples, peoples that, that don't think that the human is better than a bear, or better than a stream, or better than a hillside, you know, they see, they see all of those things to some, to some extent, I'm not sure what language they would use, but they don't see personhood as being just something that humans have a monopoly on. They, they've, you know, a lot of them thought that, that these other animals, for example, were actually literally their, their relatives, right, which they are in a literal sense, I would say in, in, you know, from an evolutionary point of view, they really are a relative, they're our brothers and sisters, right, cousins, these other animals. But this culture now that we have this, this cap, this extractive capitalist thing, which has been going around and hitting other humans over the head and committing genocide and enslaving and, you know, hitting all these other animals over the head, just to like extract monetary gain from it, and it's destroying the planet and sees corporations as persons, right, not, not hillsides and, and streams and other animals. This particular culture, this operating system is just, it's running amok. And, you know, I think we're at a crossroads where we have to grow up as a species and kind of mature as a species and realize that, you know, there's no separation between you and me. That's the, that's the kind of, I think there's this sense of separation and zero sum gamesmanship and competition, which I, you know, I don't know if I'll lose a lot of people by saying this, but I think it all ultimately comes from fear of death and, and a denial about the fact that we're mortal beings and that we're going to die. And that denial leads to all other kinds of denial. And it leads us to want, it leads to this kind of greed where we want more and more. And we feel like that if we had more money and like a bigger house and, you know, in a nicer neighborhood, somehow we can have more security and we'll be safer. And I think that's a, that's a very dangerous mentality and it leads to kind of the rise of these corporations and the security state, right? So it's kind of going in the opposite direction. And it's convincing us that we're, we're separate from each other. We're separate from people that don't look like us. We're separate from the so-called natural world, which we're in right now, literally, right? We're, we're sitting inside these buildings, having this conversation through the internet and all of that is the natural world, right? So we have to, we have to wake up and realize that there is no separation, right? That we're breathing each other's air and incorporating each other's atoms into our bodies as atoms and, and kind of doing this sort of cosmic dance together here, trying to figure out why we're here, what it means that we're going to die. There's something like really beautiful about that. And I think, you know, if we can somehow look at this stuff that's happening now and look at our own mortality in a really courageous way and, and say like, we have to, we have to stop this, this, you know, putting profit above everything else and this quest for everyone wants to be like a billionaire, right? And we're literally poisoning the earth and we're poisoning our mindsets and we're not enjoying, we're not even enjoying life with this mindset, right? That's right. I think a lot of people are extremely miserable, whether they're rich or poor right now, because of this mindset. I went, I went into Pizka National Forest up here in NC. My goal, your goal might be to get me to wake people up. My goal is to get you to move to Ashton. I'm, I'm already think we're, we're, we're, so my wife and I have been having this conversation. So, okay, so it's, it's complicated for me because I've, I basically, my whole life right now is aligned toward trying to drag humanity, kicking and screaming, and to take in climate action and to sort of realizing that we're all in this together and that we have to share things more equitably with each other. Like that's, that's kind of what the earth is telling me right now is that we can't have these poor nations and rich nations and we can't have poor people in, in a rich nation that can't even afford to put food on their table, on their table and they're getting kicked out of their homes and they don't have access, their kids don't have access to education, they don't have access to, to justice under our legal system. So I think that climate, to solve climate breakdown, we, it's become very clear to me that we also have to deal with all of those other things, which is what I mean by kind of growing up as a species. And I think we can build something, you know, much better if we do that potentially, or we can slide further into sort of authoritarianism in the security state. That's what terrifies me is I'm not sure which way it's going to go, but right now part of my platform is, you know, being a scientist at a national space lab, I should say I'm speaking on my own behalf by the way. So of course you're not speaking on behalf of JPL. I don't, I don't want the blue meanies to, to call me often. So yeah, that's part of, you know, my agency, like my ability to help wake people up is also tied to, you know, my reputation as an expert on climate change and climate science. It's kind of, you know, almost feels a little weird to be talking about the more spiritual aspects of this, right? Because scientists aren't supposed to talk about that. No, you're not. But, but I do because I'm a human too, right? And I'm like, just because, just because I'm a scientist doesn't mean I have to shut up about other stuff that's important to me, right? I can speak out as a father, I can speak out as a parent and as a human too, and as a citizen. So I feel perfectly like I should have a right to weigh in on politics and policy as well, because it's important. Yeah, it's important. I think, I think that's our responsibility as citizens. And I mean, here's the thing, man, a lot of times scientists, I think, end up not having as much of a public voice, not because they don't want to speak out, but because the very nature of the business seems to be that if you like get identified as this or that, you can lose funding, lose your job, lose a lot of the potency that you have is wherever you got. I've noticed that in some of my scientific friends is that they may have, on the human level, they may have had some wild experience or had some spiritual experience, but they are not going to say too much about that publicly, because they have to, the way the business works is some form of funding of research. And, you know, they don't want to get labeled as quacks long and short of it, because once that, I guess that's doom for a scientist. But, you know, I want to finish a point real quick. When I walked, because it's related to what you were saying earlier, I went into Pisgah National Forest, my son at six or seven a.m. I hadn't been in a forest like that in a long time, a long time. I'd been in like Big Bear style forests or West Coast, but not that, just pure, just that, the air being like just as fresh as fresh could be, but more than that, the vastness of it, and more than that, the sound of rivers and more, and just that moment, it was like, it really was re-tuning me. It happened, didn't take very long. It was just, oh, right, this is, this is what matters. This is the thing. This is it, which is why I think, even though I agree with you, this is nature, sitting in our separate places, you locked down in LA, me in this office in North Carolina with my artificial light, this is nature. But how easy is it in this situation to forget what that mind is, how that mind, it's a mind, how easy to forget the perfection of that. It's almost like we built these artificial spaces precisely for that purpose somehow. It's what it kind of feels like. Yeah, to separate us from that, because maybe there's something there that was a little bit too scary, I don't know, or something, or heartbreak, something. So I, one of the most formative experiences I ever had was in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in northern central New Mexico. And I, you know, for several summers, I worked at a place there called Fillmont, which is actually a Boy Scout Ranch, but it's these beautiful ponderosa pine forests in the mountains, which have also been burning over the years too, like a lot of forested places. But there's one, there's one, you know, this was a really formative experience. So what I was doing there was I was building trail. So we would, we would go out there with like the picmatics and the shovels and the sledgehammers to hit the rocks. And, you know, it was like, you know, 10 kids and a couple of four men. The first year I was one of the kids, and then I went back a few times for summer job to be, to be a trail crew foreman. You're just like way out there. There's not even a trail because you're building the trail. You're like out there in the forest for the whole summer. And it's just this like primeval experience. And the first, yeah, I saw, I love, I also love western forests. I have this as kind of a young person, this made such a big impact on me. And one night I was, I don't know why I feel like telling the story, but I kind of, the first time when I was one of the participants building the trail, I had to take a piss. And it must have been like 1am or something. I got out of my tent and there was like full moon and it was like silver coming through the pine trees. And something just compelled me to walk over to the end of the trail that we've been building earlier that day. And I just lay down on that and like this perfect cool air, right? You say like breathing in that perfect, clean air with the sound of the insects looking straight up into the stars, you know, like this, the Sagray De Cristo, perfect Milky Way stars and just feeling connected to everything, right? And so that's like a well that I can draw on, you know, when, when it's just something that I always have inside me, right? It's kind of one of those, it's a little corny, they talk about those places you can go. Yeah. But and I've had other experiences like that too. It's, it's, you know, what you could call maybe a numinous experience. Yes. Where you feel connected and you can get that same experience through meditation, you can get that by eating mushrooms too. Sure. And maybe that's a big part of the answer is just we need a lot of people to start experiencing this connection, not, not intellectually, but like through their bodies and this, this very profound sense that after the experience, you still have that place where you can go to and, you know, and those experiences too, to, to go back to an earlier point that I was making, for me, at least they really, they, they chip away at my own fear of death, right? So all of this, this stuff is connected. I don't, it's hard to put into words, I think, but I really think that the fear of death is, is one of these big things that separates us and, you know, and this really bizarre twist of fate is kind of what makes us kill each other too, right? And have wars and stuff like that. Yeah. There's no physical, there's, there's no physical reason, you know, speaking as someone who's a physicist and someone who's already said that I think the social scientists and the psychologists are the really important people right now, but there's no physical reason why we can't build a better world here and we can't start sharing these resources. We could all live well on this planet if we shared with each other and there weren't like a few billionaires. You know, now like two billionaires in the United States have as much wealth as the lower half of all the people in this nation. It's crazy. It's crazy. So we share, we can share this with each other. And so yeah, I guess I'm, I'm an eco socialist, I would say. I don't, what that means is that I think we can do better at sharing with each other. And I think that that's really important. A big thank you to DHM detox for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. DHM detox, it's the vitamin for people who like to enjoy alcohol.

It reminds me of the stuff that I used to take when I would do a drunk history, which I thought was some kind of like MK ultra CIA shit that Derek had access to. This stuff is wonderful if you're going to be bounding into some kind of wild Halloween celebration or maybe you're just in a Mikowski phase. DHM detox is for the no days wasted. I think that when eco socialism, eco anythingism, I think the eco part is the part that we're centering in on here that is an experienced thing. For me, it's like holy shit, I'm so dumb that instead of listening to people like you who have been talking about this forever, in really believing it, I've been like, well, you know, and it took my state catching on fire. It took ash and then suddenly it's like, oh, fuck, fuck, this is real. But that was a direct experience with nature and out of balance kind of nature, a nature that was dying kind of nature, but still direct encounter with the ecosystem outside. And I think maybe and then to me what's happening is that yes, this is nature, but these billionaires, it's not just like they're hoarding all the research resources, they've become billionaires by creating devices that have become substitutes for nature. So people are staring at their phones for GPS coordinates to get instead of looking at real maps. People just let the machine tell them where to turn. They don't know where they're at. People let the machine tell them, well, socially things are fucked up, and they don't even think about the earth. You know, this is a bunch of, this is one of the theories that's out there right now, which I love. I know it's not true, but the idea is the sun's about to supernova. It's about to do a mini nova. This is a conspiracy theory, and the mini nova is going to wipe us all out. And people are saying the reason nobody's noticing the sun is fucked up right now is because everybody's staring at their phones. And I think literally that's ridiculous, but as a metaphor, as an explanation for what's happening, I think it's brilliant, which is that the sun, the idea was the sun told you what direction. It was a great way to figure out what direction you're going in. It was a great way to figure out what time of day it was. It was a great way to figure out what time of year it was. But, and so we were very in tune with just where the sun was in the sky, but now our sun, it's in our phones. We're looking at this little digitized sun that's like giving innocent a weird form of radiation that I think is making people lose that connection that you have, that you feel. That's a great point. You know, I think one of the encouraging parts of the pandemic lockdown was there was a huge resurgence in gardening. Yes. If you tried to go to the Seed Savers Exchange website, they had a message saying they couldn't handle all the requests, and so they weren't doing mail order seeds anymore. I think they might have run out of stock, and that was pretty common everywhere. So the gardening centers, the seed exchanges, they couldn't handle the demand, which to me was a wonderful thing. So I'm an avid gardener and orchardist, which is someone who basically plants fruit trees. And, you know, it's not to solve climate breakdown, but it helps me stay sane, first of all. But I think it also really connects a person to the earth and helps you not take the earth for granted, which I think is this other epidemic right now, which has come up in this culture of iPhones and disconnection, which is that we take this earth for granted. We take food for granted. You know, there's no sense of the sacred anymore when we're walking through a forest or over the dirt. And, you know, to compost, it's like practice for death to me a little bit. And it's beautiful. It's beautiful to turn that over with the pitchfork and see the worms in there and all the lizards that scurry away. And to be able to use that in your garden to create new life, right? And then to be able to, you know, the food tastes a lot better when it comes straight out of your garden. And you share it with neighbors. So it connects you to the community because you have like too many lemons at one time or way too many figs at one time, or too many zucchini, you know, or whatever it is that you're growing. So you trade that to someone else who's got too many, you know, persimmons or too many something that you don't have too much kale or something and you didn't plant kale or whatever. And so you trade and you become friends and you trade tips about like, you know, which varieties don't get powdery mildew as much and, you know, which which varieties of tomatoes are susceptible to spider mites and all that went to plant things. So it's this amazing community resilience building thing and this connection to the earth. So yeah, I think I think that's like that's a great way to connect. It's a great way to feel that to have some gratitude for farmers too and and the, you know, the undocumented immigrants who are out there in the fields with the orange glowing sky and breathing the smoke and picking our food for us, right? Yeah. And to go back to an earlier point you made too. Yes, I have reduced my own use of fossil fuels just because burning fossil fuels now feels disgusting to me. Like I kind of makes me go into like have a cold sweat. If I got on a plane right now, I'm pretty sure I'd throw up. Like I've had nightmares about being on planes. I haven't flown since 2012. And it's not because I'm trying to virtue signal. It's because it literally feels too disgusting to me. The last time I was on a plane I was thinking of my little baby kids and and how I was going to go give some like, you know, some I was an astrophysicist at the time I was going to give some 15 minute PowerPoint that my collaboration had already seen a couple of times and I'm like, why am I doing this? Yeah, I'm like stealing from my kids futures for this little like tiny boost to my own career. So and we're not, you know, to be very clear, we're not going to solve this problem by by some of us voluntarily choosing to fly less or voluntarily becoming vegan or riding our bicycles more. Those are all great things to do. But that's not how we're going to solve this. Like we're going to the way I think we're going to solve this the way out that I see. And it's getting to be a narrower and narrower path is to become fire breathing climate activists. And to build to build this grassroots movement, which has been getting it's been exploding over the last couple of years, partly because people are waking up from these climate catastrophes, but partly because climate justice was put front and center. And I have to say it first as a scientist as a physical scientist, I was skeptical about that. I'm like, why are we making this about, you know, I believe that, you know, that frontline communities are getting screwed more. And I believe believe they deserve a fair shake. But the thing that's going to kill us all is the carbon dioxide. Like that's what I used to think I'm like, focus on the emissions. And now I've completely changed in the last couple of years. Because you can't what we had before that was basically to be frank. And I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this. But for decades, the climate movement, the environmental movement was basically old white people. You know, I used to be part of this group called Citizens Climate Lobby. You'd look out and it would be all these these upper middle class people who had time on their hand mostly because they'd retired, as they could become environmental activists. But it wasn't something that felt like your youth weren't going to join that movement. You're, you know, your black people weren't going to join that movement. Your indigenous people weren't going to join that movement. You're all people, diverse people that look like this nation, and that maybe are again, you know, don't have the luxury to spend extra time on this, right? Because they're being hammered at a daily basis, you know, with their, you know, with the police literally kneeling on their necks, right? So, which we're seeing now. So, but over the last couple of years, because of this transition to climate justice and this realization that we're all fighting the same fight, we're fighting against corporate extractivist capitalism, which is killing, which has been killing these people for hundreds of years. And the people kind of that have been privileged enough not to be experiencing that firsthand have been kind of looking the other way. As long as the money keeps flowing in, as long as they have land to build their houses on, which used to be someone else's land, right? And the whole thing now, because of climate and ecological breakdown, is starting to implode in this big way, right? So now, now no one can really, it's harder and harder, even for privileged people to avoid this, right? You know, we may only interject one thing real quick. You know, the saying of the weather underground, you know, they're saying regarding protesting Vietnam, bring the war back home is what they said. And so they started, and I'm not advocating this at all. But I think it kind of applies to what you're, I think where you're going here. The, their idea was we will blow up buildings, and we'll make sure no one's in it. We'll call and say we're going to do it. So the buildings, they started blowing up buildings, because they thought people in the West needed to see what it was like to be bombed, because we didn't know what it was like to be bombed, because we've been bombing other countries so long. It seemed like this thing, like a, we weren't connected to it. Bring the war back home is what they said, because if people saw how fucked up the war was, they wouldn't support war. Similarly, it feels like something about like people need to, like what you have had is an awakening, I think. You can't fly. And you're not virtue signaling. You can't fly in the same way that I'm sure there's throughout history, there's been shifts in ethics where things used to seem okay. And they're not, you know, we could think of a zillion examples of this, where if we were living the way somebody in early America was living, or if we are living like Christopher Columbus, I can't, I can't fly in the same way that, you know, you can't own slaves right now. Yeah, I'm not going to hack off someone's arm. Well, it's morally, it feels morally repugnant to me. Right. You've just connected to the truth. And people that, you know, who, who don't see this as a life or death emergency the way I do, and who haven't connected the burning of fossil fuel directly to these mega fires that we're having in the, in the West United States, for example, they probably think I'm nuts for saying that, you know, and, and there's a lot of prestige, especially in the academic community that goes with flying in these planes, where you get some invitation to give this invited talk or this keynote speech somewhere, and you want to get on the plane and go do it and, you know, and, and you get to, they put you up in a hotel, you get like a nice vacation in this city, and you've worked your hard your whole life to, to earn this, right. So it's hard to give that up. And, and so even if they, and it's, there's so many different kinds of denial here too, right. So you, they, they know intellectually what's happening on this planet. They understand the science, but they can compartmentalize in their brains. They don't want to, they don't want to give up that flying privilege, the frequent flying privilege. So they find ways to rationalize and, and, and, you know, and again, like I, I, I don't want anyone to be excluded from this grassroots movement because they're not ready to fly less. We need everyone in this, even if you're still a platinum frequent flyer, and you just haven't made it. It took me three years, by the way, to go from like, you know, feeling like this doesn't really feel right being on this plane to finally being on that last flight and like basically, you know, having this image of like the plane running on ground up babies, basically, and be like, I can't, I can't be on this plane anymore. Yeah, that's, I don't, I, I, I, it's like the first time I've said that publicly, but that's kind of the way, that's the way it felt to me. And I'm, so that's why I can't fly. It's, it's, it's that simple. You know, I'm not trying to, I'm not even necessarily trying to save the planet by getting other people to fly, to not fly, but I just, to me, I had this vision on ketamine and that made it into the show I made for Netflix called the Midnight Gospel, where there's a city that runs on meat and it would meet flowing. I love this show, Duncan. I'm well aware of the show. The meat flowing through tubes, because the idea is like, holy fuck, you know, what if, if we, that's exactly what, like, essentially once you make the connection, these particles that just have this unfortunate composition that as an effect on photons, they kill, they're killing people. They're literally killing people. That story and the fires of that kid, who they found him, he was dead with a dog on his lap, you know, and it's like, once you make that connection, once you realize like, oh yeah, you're, and again, I'm a, I'm a comic. I fly over, I was, I, before the pandemic, I was flying, but still a little part of me. I flew a lot too. I flew a lot too. Yeah. Business class, you're proud of it and you feel it's a stupid corporate fucking, you're hypnotized by that. When you get up and prance in there for your sapphire club bullshit and whatever, it's such deep, stupid manipulation, but like the point being like, my God, the thing you just said, it's like a rotten connection, but suddenly when you get, when that clicks into place, which is like, look, take your flight, just understand, you're, you know, you're probably going to end up incinerating some kid and a dog and a lot more than that. And, and that sounds radical, but really, I just left a place where Ash is falling from the sky, man. And, and you are there. I don't mean to keep going back to that. I'm not trying to rub it in. Ash was falling at my house too. No, I, I, it's, yeah. And, um, I mean, God, God, there's so much we could talk about. I feel like we could talk for hours. I know, but look, let's you hold on. How much we got? We just, listen, I know this is a pretty much the most idiotic question to ask you. I just want to say I really am enjoying your book, by the way, and I really love the compassion in it. And that to me is what, what is very one of the things that's inspiring about you is that you're producing a space within which folks who are still kind of like, man, fuck that, I'm going to fucking fly to still have a part in this grassroots movement. Cause I think right now it does need to be very inclusive. It does. We can't just include people who have like gotten the switch to click in their minds, that kind of weird eco enlightenment. Cause not everybody's getting it. I haven't had it completely. We need a billion climate activists Duncan. I firmly believe that. And the other thing I had a, so I used to on Twitter, I would, I would always, you know, I'd say this really scary thing. And then I'd write another tweet underneath it saying like, what you can do, you know, like talk to people, join a climate action group, you know, be courageously creative. You know, it's what, what I realized a couple of days ago for me, this was a pretty profound realization is that I can't tell you how to be a climate activist. There's something everyone has to figure out for themselves. But that's to me, that's a beautiful thing. Because I can tell you with, again, I guarantee that each one of you, your unique form of climate activism is important. And it's needed. And if I told you, if I made like cookie cutter, you know, copies of myself, it wouldn't be as effective. We need, we need like, we need a billion climate activists that look like this biosphere, you know, like all these different forms and people that, you know, someone who's got this talent or that talent, or they do the climate activism that they figure out and that resonates with them. And then it resonates with other people because it's coming so authentically from them, right? So I would say that what I encourage everyone to do is to just like, first of all, there are some, there are some basic principles, I think that that can be helpful, right? And one of them is, it's very hard. But we all have to let this, what's happening now, the boys that are being burnt with their dogs, this horrible stuff, which is happening now, we have to actually let that in emotionally, we have to not hold that at arm's length. And wow, my wife's going to kill me for bringing her into this. But you're the beginning of this fire close to our house, we got an evacuation warning. And it was like late at night, it was smoky, the fire was a couple of miles away, we were confused, we didn't know what you were supposed to do. If you had to evacuate, our phones start buzzing. And that way phones do when you're getting some warning and all, all the phones in the house start buzzing at the same time. And we had this blowout fight that night. But kind of like because of the stress of that. And because of this 120 degree weekend, when we sort of like, we tried to escape the heat by hiking in the mountains just above Santa Barbara. Because we thought, we looked at the forecast and I should have known better, but I was so busy with my work that I didn't look into it deeply. When we got to the hike, it was so hot there and so humid that my body shut down, right? And my wife was crying, she felt like it was like, you know, and, and it was this, it was this little five mile hike to a campsite where we're going to sleep there one night and then hike back. But there's a lot, there's all this elevation. And I think it was like, it ended up being like 110 degrees or something there and super humid. And I literally had to, I just had to like sit by a stream and like pour water over my head until like 5pm. And then, and then, you know, we were hiking in the dark and kind of slipping down with kids, slipping down this like really steep like path in the dark. And it was still super, it was, it was horrible. But so that to put that in context, that had just happened. And I kind of like, I was kind of like, you know, I'm always, I've been freaking out about climate breakdown for 15 years, right? So I think I've been really hard to be married to. And she just wants to have a normal life. And she's kind of an anxious person. And so she doesn't want to think about, and she's a mother, she's got kids, she wants them to be safe. She wants to imagine that they'll have a future where they can have retirement accounts and, you know, kind of normal jobs and, you know, where piano lessons are relevant and stuff like that. And so, you know, sometimes I'd be like, you know, there's this, there's this new report about, you know, the future of wildfires in our country or something or whatever, like, I just like say something to her, and she'd feel like I was poking at her, right? And she would just kind of like, she would just sort of change the subject maybe or go do something else, right? And then I would feel like she was kind of ignoring me or she didn't want to talk about this thing that was so important to me, right? And so that tension of this kind of all this tension around climate and our relationship kind of exploded in that night. When I think, you know, I maybe used to talk to her directly, but I think it kind of came into her that this stuff was real and it was serious and that, you know, maybe all of my crazy climate activism over the years hadn't really been that crazy after all. But, you know, and then we felt like once it felt like the air kind of cleared to use an unfortunate metaphor after that fight, I felt closer to her than I think I had in a long time because of that. But, you know, again, I don't want to, what it sort of felt like to me was she finally kind of let this in in a deeper way. And, you know, I don't, it's so hard for me to urge people to do this because I totally get how I've talked to people who, you know, told me that, you know, to function in their jobs. This was years ago, like they couldn't let this in, right? Because they get too, they get too anxious or they'd fall into despair. So it's very hard to bring this in. But I think it's important emotional work because it's, I don't see how we can really start to solve this if we kind of at some level pretend it's not happening and pretend that we could go back to a normal life after, say, after the pandemic ends. So the silver lining is you got, you can't do this alone because it's too hard. So you got to, you got to, you do have to join a group. So that's another principle. You have to have friends and people around you who get that this is as serious as you think it is. Otherwise, you're going to feel gaslit. And that's a, it's a terrible feeling to feel like Cassandra to kind of like to know what's coming. And not only to see people not acting, but to have them telling you to your face that it's not as serious as you think it is. So, you know, it's hard. Like I, you know, I do know that we're going to need each other to get through this and that we're going to have to support each other emotionally and kind of share that space with each other. I don't, I don't even know how to do it. It's just, it's so hard. Can you recommend groups or like, where can people, is there like a place people are connecting now in this movement? Is there like a nexus? It feels, still feels a little bit disorganized to me. And maybe it has to be that way. I don't know. And that's kind of what I mean when I say like, I can't tell anyone how to do this. Right. But, but there are groups, you know, in the U.S. Sunrise Movement is a, is a, has done amazing work. They're frankly a little bit ageist. So they, and I respect that in some ways because, you know, we, you can't have a movement, really, that's not led by those people who are being oppressed, right? The system of oppression that is being fought against, that fight has to be led by the people that are the most oppressed, right? And in climate, that's, that's young people and that's people on the front lines, right? So, so I think part of their power was that they were a group of young people who, who realized that this was a life or death emergency, especially for them, because their whole lives were stretching in front of them. So decades and decades of being on this planet, as it gets hotter and hotter, and these catastrophes get worse, right? So they, they felt that in a way that, you know, a 75 or 80 year old politician probably just can't feel, because, you know, they've lived their whole lives under this assumption that taking the climate for granted and these fossil fuel norms that it's normal to fly a lot, that it's normal to burn this fossil fuel and that it's okay, right? So it's very hard for someone who's grown up with that and who's lived their whole lives with those norms to understand that this is, this is really life or death emergencies. So I get that. But there are one, there are one good group, Extinction Rebellion is another good group. I agree with them that we need to start taking direct action. This is such a big emergency. And the powers that be the establishment status quo, which is, you know, for various reasons, you follow the money, right? It's basically profit and power are invested in maintaining this fossil fuel system, which is degrading our planet, breathtakingly quickly, right? So, so Extinction Rebellion says, we have to fight against that. And it's, it's time to rebel and it's time to take risks and it's time to get arrested. Because, and this again, this goes back to why I choose not to fly anymore, or why it's not even a choice why I can't fly anymore. Because once you see it's a life or death emergency, again, these, these kind of pretty strong actions and these pretty strong words, they feel, they feel pretty justified. And if you think that we can solve this by just, you know, making cars a little bit more efficient, and by putting up a few more solar panels, then it doesn't feel justified. But, you know, I think we have to, we have to recognize that we're entering a major sort of bottleneck for our species. And the outcome isn't guaranteed. And, you know, we might have to use less energy to help speed this transition to a carbon free energy system and transportation system and food system, and to a new economy that doesn't depend on endless exponential growth for us to afford to function at all, right? We need an economy that, that is designed to make us happy, instead of just making a few people super rich, right? And we need an economy that understands that it sits within this biosphere, and that the biosphere is bigger than it. You know, our human economy, it's, it's like, that's how our species kind of exchanges energy with the, with the, the environment around us. You can think of bacteria and a petri dish, and they're exchanging energy with their environment and with each other. And so like those bacteria have a certain, you could call that their economy, right? Sure. And in the same way, our economy is the way we exchange energy and resources with each other and with this environment or the petri dish that we live in, which is the biosphere. And we have to realize that the biosphere is bigger. And we're just one species in that, like having this energy exchange. So yeah, we need a, we need a growth agnostic economy that works for all of us. And that sits within this, this, this, this, this pale blue dot that we're living on, right? Which is, which turns out to be just so much more fragile than we thought it was, right? And we've been taking it for granted for too long. And we, we have to stop doing that. And it's just, it's a heavy lift, I know. And that's why I kind of, you know, I do think that I don't see how we can have a commercial aviation system in that kind of a transition. Once we go into emergency mode and say, we got a transition really fast to, to save what's left and to avoid massive suffering on a scale that we can, we can't even really imagine that we can't wrap our minds around it. You know, the very least we can do is stop flying around, right? And that's a way to sit. That's a symbolic, we can also say we can end fossil fuel subsidies, right? It's a no brainer. We haven't done that yet. We can say we have to have a moratorium on fracking. There's these big symbolic things that we need to do, right? We have to get away from saying, like, we all need to become vegan. And by the way, one, one thing I want to say to go back to your episode, that was profound. And there's, there's something I've been, you know, I spoke with Pixar a couple of times to some of the creatives there and some of the other employees. And we need climate storytelling. We need art that's able to, it's like a shortcut to that sort of emotional awareness that I was talking about, right? It helps, helps bring people out of this intellectual mode where they're staring at these, these plots that, you know, some scientists is talking about, which is also important. But that intellectual understanding isn't enough to wake people up and make them say like, yeah, this is an emergency. I'm going to go out and get arrested in order to raise awareness for this, right? You need something that helps people make that connection that we were talking about earlier. And I think art is one way to do that. And it's, it's profound. I think we've been telling, you know, Hollywood has been telling these stories of the apocalypse, which are like, it's like a sublimation of the real apocalypse. Like they'll, they'll tell some story about a planet that gets way too cold, right? Yeah, which is this, this is coming out of anxiety over climate and ecological breakdown, but it's creating a fictional world, which is somehow comforting. And I think it helps us kind of stay in denial because we can process it psychologically, but in this fictionalized way. So we need, we need art that's willing to look at directly in the face, which I think is something somehow that midnight, you know, the weird combination of that art, you know, that bizarre art with, with your voice going on top of it. Thanks. Somehow it's, you know, somehow there was this, this, you know, what is the, what is this saying? The whole was greater than the sum of the parts there. Something, yeah, something emerged from that. It did from the community that made the show. It was just so many people who were, whose minds joined in the thing emerged. I mean, it's collaboration. It's the real economy is collaborative. The real economy is what is, but you know what I think you're giving us is really beautiful. It's very empowering and heavy duty, man, which is a question that I don't, I've never even thought of the question, which is, how can I be a climate, an activist for the, for the earth? How, what would that look like? If I set my intention to help not just like kids not get burnt to death, but all the other things, if I set my intention there, what would I do? Like, what's the first thing that I would do? That is great. That's great. Cause that, you know, if I learned working with the animators, that was the best way to work with them was ask them questions was to, to, to, and to give them very broad questions about what this could be. And then they would, their brains, which are brains would make those things. So I, I think just asking that question, get empowering people enough to imagine that you could be an actual activist. I mean, that's kind of brilliant. And it's, to me, it's, it's so spiritual too. It's a, to me, it's a sacred calling. We can't, what the, the enemy to, the enemy to activism is ego. It makes it hard for us to work together as, as humans, right? So activism is this messy thing where you're not always going to agree with everyone. And it's easy to want to kind of cancel people if they say the wrong thing. And there's not a lot of slack is given. And there's a lot of big egos. There's a lot of egos that want to just kind of make a career out of it or to receive accolades because of it. The sacred activism is to find a way to, to be a proxy for this planet and for the life on this planet and let that, let that speak through you. And then if you just become a mouthpiece for that, you, you don't, you're not scared anymore. The fear goes away, you know, the fear of losing your job. Even the further you go, like more and more, the fear of death starts to go away. And, and you, you know, we all have this like short time on this planet. It's a, it's, it's kind of a beautiful thing. And we have to decide how we want to spend it. And, you know, we're breathing this air and we're eating this food and drinking this water and having these friendships, which are all provided by this earth. Yes. And right now the earth is, you know, people say, I don't like it when people say the planet will be fine. I mean, we're talking about a hit, a huge hit to life on this planet, which will take 10 million years to recover because we're in a six mass extinction, right? Through the twin drivers of habitat loss. So that's one good reason to be vegan right there is, you know, take some, you can feed more people with less land, but habitat loss and global heating are putting us squarely now. I think there's a really strong consensus in a mass extinction event, right? And it takes 10 million years. You can look at the fossil record at previous mass extinction events on this planet. It takes around 10 million years for biodiversity to recover. So, and this is the only place we know that has life. So to me, this is a, it's a sacred calling and it's, it's hard. There's this really hard, to me, one of the most challenging dynamics is to, I'm trying to build up a platform so we can get this message out that we're talking about now, right? And to do that, you know, you need, like, to go on shows and you need to kind of people to know who you are so that you have access to these doors open and you get these platforms that you can actually speak on and get that message out to try to help wake people up. And that can make your ego get bigger. Yes. And so, so, you know, meditation for me, I have like a pretty rocky, vipassana practice. I need to go on a 10 day course as soon as possible. I'm actually trying to try to get into one, but it's been tough because of the lockdown. Yeah. And because, and then, you know, my main meditation center up by Fresno in Central California, it's in this little town called North Fork, which it's, which is in the forest there, like right just, just below Yosemite. So it's kind of a few thousand feet below Yosemite that's on the way between Fresno and Yosemite. And they claim that they're the central point of California, which is interesting. But they were right next to the Creek Fire. Like we would look, my wife and I would look on this, this map of the Creek Fire and there'd be these little like red, like spots, you know, like, like the fire was like this mushroom that was trying to like reach out and, and take over the meditation center. And it didn't end up burning. But this has been making it harder to meditate. But yeah, to me, like, it's hard to, I don't know how to, I guess I already said it, but you got to put the earth and these other beings kind of above yourself. And it's this, it's this, it's this hard thing, again, of dissolving that, that sort of illusion of being separate. And it's, I find it very hard to put it into words to be honest. I think you're doing a tremendous job of putting it into words. It's very inspiring. You know, all this, what ends up accidentally happening is that people who feel very strongly, especially people who feel afraid, they become aggressive. And the aggression ends up creating defense mechanisms, the defense mechanisms create denial and it creates a sad feedback loop that started with a very simple, we got to do more than this. So I think what you're saying reminds me of what Jack Cornfield, I heard him say once, this Buddhist teacher, we don't want you to be a Buddhist, we want you to be a Buddha. And what you're saying is you, you are, to me, the ego thing for a lot of people is not they, they are inflated egos, it's their ego has been so deflated by being not connected to the earth, that they don't think they deserve to be a voice for the earth. They don't think they're good enough to help. They're just a pile of shit. And they've already, you know, made so many mistakes. There's nothing left. And what you're saying, it's empowering. It's like, it's, it's, and I think that is the, if you want to know that the heartbreaking thing to me when I go out in the forest or when I think about Jesus or when I think about is that generally the relationship is not the power. It's saying, you got to help. I need your help. That's heartbreaking. It's such a sad thing. I got to hear you say that because I think you're right. And it's so sad to, you know, so many, so many activists right now are feeling deflated. And I think some of them are getting depressed. And it's, it's, it is heartbreaking. And, and yeah, we have to lift each other up and we, and yeah, you're all good enough to be a climate activist. You, it's, it's hard to find this way. But man, we got to help each other figure this out and help lift each other up and not tear each other down and help us figure out, help each other figure out how to do this and find our way through this. Because, you know, I don't think any of us really know how to do it. But I think that somehow together, we're able to figure this out, you know, and when one of us feels burnt out, the others can come and lift that person up. It's, you know, it's like geese flying in that formation, right? When the one in the front gets tired and they go in the back, and then the other ones help it out. And that's, that's sort of how we have to think of this, I think is, you know, not tearing each other down, but lifting each other up and celebrating the little victories and celebrating the differences. And even I would say celebrating to some extent the disagreements. Because, you know, again, I'll go back to how how much I changed a couple years ago, when I felt, I kind of felt threatened about, you know, this focus switching from that, that the keeling curve of CO2 going up every year, right? And switching toward climate justice. And originally, I was sort of suspicious of that. And now, like, you know, I'm so grateful that other activists realized that not only was that the right thing to do, but that was the powerful thing to do. That was the way to actually get that emissions curve to go down. So, yeah, we, I don't know how, you know, there's this, I don't know if other people have talked about this on your show before, but there's this beautiful idea, which, which I heard Tick Nahan say, which is that, I think others have been saying it too, I think many others, that the next Buddha is the Sangha, that we're right, we're waking each other up. That's it. Yeah. So let's keep doing that. And you know, I think these kinds of discussions help. Yeah. Thank you for saying that, because that's weird. I kept meaning to say, you know, and I don't know if this is true or not. But apparently, when the Buddha came out of his meditation, having gained realization, the first thing he did was bow to the tree. He was meditating. And yeah, oh gosh, we have a whole show talking about trees. We should listen, listen, this has been a really one of the greatest chats I've had. And maybe in my life, thank you, you are brilliant. You're brilliant. And your form of activism is powerful. And, and yeah, this really spun me around in a, in a good way. Thank you. But please let people know how they can find you, how they could chip in, how they can connect, because people are going to want to connect to you after this. Yeah, so I tweet pretty vulgarly sometimes on climate human. So you can, you can follow me at climate human if you want to get the unvarnished climate truth. And then I have a, I have a website, Peter commas.net, where I actually talked to my publisher of my book and they, they, they agree that I could put the entire book up there for free. So if you, if you're looking for a pandemic read, you can go to Peter commas.net and dive in there. So thank you so much for having me on Duncan. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That was Peter Kalmas, everybody. All the links you need to find Peter are going to be at dougatrustle.com. A big thank you to our sponsors, SUMA, BetterHelp and DHM detox for supporting this episode of the DTFH. And a big thanks to you for listening. I hope you all will heed Peter's suggestion and think about ways that you can be climate activists in this bizarre time period in human history.

133^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 552: Steven Kotler Transcript and Discussion^2023-02-17^Today they told me they saw this object or sky thing, a thing we don't know, an uncone thing. They said, you gonna do a down of the vehicle, silver craft, they said it's the size of a car. I said, show me a picture of it. Well, when I was a kid, it would be the size of, well, a 10th of a card. I'll tell you a story, a kid's size of a pebble, just this big, kid's size. Only had a slink shod, and they said to the kid, you won't be able to get him down. The kid was Daniel, and he took out Belith. And that's what it's about in America. I ordered a shoot down. Now it's down, problem solved. Thank you. Greetings pals, it's me, Detrusel. And as you can tell, especially if you follow me on Instagram, I've become unhealthily obsessed with deep faking the president's voice and other people's voices. But right now, doing deep fakes of our president is just scratching whatever demonic itch I have inside of me. It presses all my buttons. I mean, aside from the fact that you can just use 30 seconds of audio to create a near perfect deep fake, the implications are astounding. What's coming is so weird, you won't believe it. Like when you get a call from your mom, your dad, or your brother, your sister, saying that they're in trouble, you're gonna have to have a personal password that only they know so that whatever AI has stolen their identity and is trying to get money from you won't be able to trick you. And soon it won't just be calls, it's gonna be deep fake FaceTime videos of our loved ones. Oh my God, that's just one tiny little part of the strangeness that is waiting for us just around. The corner. I love all my podcasts. I love my podcast the way a crab loves its glistening, frothy eggs. I think crabs have eggs. Regardless, every once in a while, one podcast or another will change my life. This podcast that you're about to listen to, you can hear it. You can hear Steven Kotler using his brilliance to exercise the demon of age that had insidiously crept into me. You might know today's guest, Steven Kotler, from his many books. He is a New York Times bestselling author. He's written The Future is Faster Than You Think, Stealing Fire, The Rise of Superman, Stealing Fire is one of my personal favorites. He's a member of the Flow Research Collective and an expert on Flow States. He's got an awesome book coming out. It's called Nar Country, Growing Old, Staying Rad. Kotler put his money where his mouth is and taught himself in an insanely fast amount of time how to do ultra-dangerous skiing. Now, that's just one tiny part of what's cool about this book, which is a journal sort of explaining his path to doing tricks that no one should be able to do, much less someone who's, I can't remember what he is, like 55. The book is all about how age is a psychological state. Now, that might seem like a cliche to you, but if you're like me, somebody in his 40s, or even if you're not, if you're someone in your 20s, if you're someone who's found yourself saying, I'm getting old, watch out. After this conversation with Steven, I learned how deadly that psychological state can be. Kotler has figured out that people are sort of cursing themselves with a perception of themselves as being aged out of one activity or the other. This is 100% bullshit. The idea that your brain can't change or grow once you reach a certain age. Complete absolute garbage, and it's deadly garbage, because the more you believe it, the more you wither, the more you atrophy, the more you rot from the inside. This was truly one of my favorite podcasts of all time, so strap in. Before we get going with this podcast, won't you subscribe to my Patreon? It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH.

If you like the conversation you're about to hear with Steven Kotler, do us both a favor. Won't you pre-order his book, Nar Country? Listen, it doesn't matter if you're not walking around in an old body. If you feel like that creepy phantom of self-perceived aging has snuck its way into your body and is now slowing you down, then Nar Country is going to banish it. So I hope you'll pre-order it.

Welcome on you, that you are with us. Sh Zhao food is yours, welcome to you. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you for coming back on the show. Wonderful to see you. Donkey is great to be with you. Okay. A little bit of kismet here. The other day, I think I'm watching snowboarding videos with my kid. He's transfixed. I'm transfixed. And I think he was like, will you go snowboarding? I'm like, no, I'm probably too old for that kid. Then I watched in our country. I watched the videos on your website and there's Kotler. How do you 53? Uh, 55 now. 55. You've aged two years since I a few days ago. You, there you are doing like, I think what must be the most dangerous form of skiing on earth, rail slides, insane tricks, things that like I, in my mind, getting old, you know, as you get older, you just kind of fall into this weird, sad, hypnotic idea about what lays ahead for you and freestyle skiing is not on that list, man. Diapers are on the list. Diapers. So tell me about it, man. Tell me about it. How did you do it? So what is happening here? So the field that we now call peak performance aging was like 11 different fields that I've been either actively working in because they're directly on related to the research I do on peak human performance. Or they're sort of tangentially related. Or my wife and I run a hospice care dog sanctuary we have for 20 years. So like we know these amazing longevity protocols for dogs. And there were questions like, will they work for humans? And that sort of thing. But what ends up happening is we have to start at the beginning, which is what you sort of just gave voice to, which is the traditional idea about aging, right? It was what most people, what I like to call the long, slow, rot theory, right? It's our physical skills, our mental skills, they fall off, right? Our mental skills, our physical skills, our mental skills, they decline over time and there's nothing we can do to stop the slide, right? That's the long, slow, rot theory. And the theory actually dates back to Freud. Something Freud said. He's like 49 and a half years old. He's terrified at turning 50. And he says, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but he basically says, you know, people over 50 are so stuck in their ways and their brains are so locked up that don't even bother with psychotherapy. Anybody over 50 is no longer educable. So the idea you can't teach an old dog new tricks, the long, all this gets codified by Freud because he's terrified at turning 50. The funny part is Freud goes on to write like six of his most famous books in his fifties and his sixties. So like, it doesn't even apply to Freud, but that doesn't matter because the damage has been done. And between like Freud in 1904 and like roughly 1995, all we did was prove Freud right. They figured out every single thing in the body that falls off a cliff and that's the story most of us know. And it turns out starting about 1995, holes start popping up in this story. And first it's one and then it's another and then it's another. And suddenly we arrive where we are today, which is with this, the new idea, which is all the skills we used to think decline over time. They do decline over time, but we now know they're all user to lose it skills. So if you never stop using them, you can hang on to them, even advance them far later than anybody thought possible. So that's the theory. That's what it looks like in the lab. There's tons of research for a bunch of reasons that we can talk about it later on. I look at this stuff, I take some other ideas out of stuff. I'm directly working on flow science and body cognition, a couple of things like that and say, you know what? If this stuff is all true, I should be able to or anybody should be able to onboard incredibly difficult, challenging physical skills, even very late in life. And so I decided to test this because of course I have to test it. I'm going to try to teach myself how to park ski at age 53. And as you pointed out park skiing, it's rails, it's jumps, it's boxes, what did your wife say? Wait, 12 different. She was thrilled. She thought it was a great experiment. She was like, go ahead, we have a life insurance policy on you. It's fine. But so one, we can go and come back to this. One, I think I've made a couple of discoveries on how to do it safely is the first thing. I was like, wait a minute, there's a way to progress safely in this. Two, you know, park skiing was this great thing because for like 12 different biological reasons, people think it's impossible. It's not over 35. It's difficult to learn. Yes. Over 40 is very difficult. Over 50, you're fucking nuts, right? You're insane. And so we made a list. I made a list of 20 tricks that was essentially zero to intermediate. And I had no parks. I couldn't do any tricks. I've been skiing my whole life. I'm a good skier, but I like I never went into a terrain park. I didn't know how to do anything. Zero skills. And I'm also worth pointing out. I'm not a naturally gifted athlete. I've been around professional athletes. I come from a family of some gifted athletes. I've seen what it looks like up close. I'm not that I, it takes me a very long time to learn athletic skills. So I make this list of 20 tricks that covers zero to intermediate. And I figure at the time if it takes five years, so it takes five years. I got there in less than a season. And my ski partner who's 20 years younger than me, former pro athlete, sponsored athlete, not pro, but sponsored athlete who got really injured, left pro park skiing, had a family's three kids, got a job, did all that stuff, came back, used the same protocol. And he got faster farther than he's ever gone before. And we went, wow, this is incredibly cool. But this is like the world's sexiest pilot study, right? Right. And that's the story mostly documented in the new book in our country. But at the end of the book, you find out that the season afterwards, we went back, we took the same protocol. We took 17 older adults ages 29 to 68. That's the video you saw. And then in four days on the mountain taught them how to park ski and park snowboard. And most of them were intermediates when they started intermediate skiers or snowboarders. And we still got them into the terrain park and doing stuff as some of them. I told you, we're in the late sixties. Then we stripped out the action sports because apparently they're not for everyone. I don't understand that, but apparently. And we used it as a class, a pre-performance aging class. We ran about 350 people through it. And what we were trying to do in that class is essentially, so what you were talking about earlier, that voice in your head, this is, I'm too old for this shit, you know, I need diapers. That has the formula that's basically known as the mindset of old and it's deadly. So we know that if you have a positive mindset towards aging, meaning I think the second half of my life is filled with like really cool, interesting possibilities, my best days might be ahead of me. That mindset will translate into an extra seven and a half years of healthy longevity and there's dozens of studies that show this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can actually, if you're morbidly obese and have a shitty mindset, you will live longer by changing your mindset. It's rough, the equivalent of quitting smoking. Like it's really significant in terms of helping. And this is not one or two studies. This is dozens and dozens of studies over 50 years. One of the most well-established facts in peak performance aging. In fact, this is incredible. Sorry, go ahead. Can I tell you a crazy mindset story? Yes, please. It'll blow your mind and you can look it up when we're done. So this is my favorite. I think we ran the weirdest and most radical experiment in peak performance aging. Anybody's ever run? Yes. Run her up. Run her up goes to Ellen Langer. She, she's like the godmother of positive psychology. And like I call her the eagles of psychology, meaning like if there's a psychological experiment and you don't know who did it, it's probably Ellen Langer. Like when we were growing up, you heard a song on the radio and you didn't know who did it. It was probably the eagles. Same thing with psychology, right? Okay, okay, I get it. That's what I mean. The eagles. You took your while. Duh. I am dumb. Okay. Dumb. No, no, no, no. No, it was, I was blaming me for the storytelling. It was, it was my punchline delivery that sucked. It wasn't fault. That falls never on the audience. That had changed my diaper, Stephen. Hold on a minute. Go ahead. So Ellen does this thing. It's 1981. Her early work in psychology is on language priming, right? How, how language can influence people to behave in certain ways, even subconsciously and she starts to wonder about, so ageism is the most widely held stereotype in the world. It's everywhere. It's totally socially acceptable. Literally like I walk outside with any other stereotype, tried it out in public and I'm fucking canceled. Like ended me, right? But ageism is totally fine. You know, I got another sense of smell. Here's another sense of smell gone from COVID fucked up from COVID. You go to someone you're like, yeah, I got this disease. It blinded me. They're going to be like, oh my God. Oh no, I'm so sorry. You go to someone like, yeah, my smell. It's like an attitude piano. Now my piss smells like oatmeal. They laugh. It's the funniest shit ever. So I'll add to it. You can lose it. That is, but yes, I don't mean to derail you for sure. Making fun of old people. It's totally fine, right? Like it's totally, totally kosher. Totally kosher everywhere, but it turns out, and we know this now, like a woman named Becca Levy, she's at Yale. She's done most of the work on aging and stereotype. It's deadly. Like we are literally killing old people by how we talk about them. It's, it's amazing the impact of stereo of stereotypes on health and longevity, but anyways, it's early days. It's like 1981 and Ellen Langer dreams of this fucking insane experiment. She takes a group of 80 year old men. She's at Harvard. She drives them two hours north of Boston. They've taken over a monastery and they've made them. It's 1991. They've made the monastery look exactly like 1961. So the posters in the wall are from 61. All the magazines are from 61. All the books are for 61 and brings people in and she takes the group of the 16 of them, eight of them just sort of reminisce about 1961. What was it like? Oh, I remember Kennedy was blah, blah, blah on the Cuban. The other group, the study group pretends it's 1961. They play act as if it's 20 years younger. They talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis is an ongoing current event. They watch movies from 90s, et cetera, et cetera, and they measure everything cognitively and everything physically could possibly measure. Use list all the way along. Five days later, just five days, the subjects who pretended, they both saw benefits, but the subject who pretended it was to be 20 years younger. Their vision improved on a snelling eye chart. They're hearing improved. Their disease symptoms fell away. Their gates improved. Their arthritis went away so much. This is the crazy one. They got taller and their fingers got longer. Five days. Yeah. In fact, there's video, a touch football game breaks out. They're waiting for the bus to go back to Harvard and this group of 80 year old men start playing football, touch football on the lawn. Like it's crazy. They don't, the experiment is so well, nobody believes it. So they redo it three different times for three different TV shows in Europe, two different, three different networks in Europe, redo the experiment for TV shows. They still don't believe it's possible. So they redo it again in 2019 with all full modern data gathering. And my point is, and this is Ellen's point, aging is as much a mental event as a physical process. Have you ever heard of data brokers? Neither had I until I read this ad and it's super creepy. They're the middleman collecting and selling all those digital footprints. You leave online. They can stitch together detailed profiles, which include your browsing history, online searches, Jesus Christ and location data. They then sell your profile off to a company who delivers you a targeted ad. No biggie, right? Well, you might be surprised to learn that these same data brokers are also selling your information to the Department of Homeland Security, the IRS. I for one, don't want anybody to know my web history. God forbid people should see that I just keep watching German foot fetish porn. It would ruin my career. So to mask my digital footprints, I protect myself with ExpressVPN. You better believe when I go to a hotel. I feel like that sweet ExpressVPN button, boom, protected. It's easy. When you're connected to ExpressVPN, your IP address is hidden. That makes it much more difficult for data brokers to identify who you are. It also encrypts a hundred percent of network traffic to keep your data safe from hackers on public Wi-Fi. That's why I have ExpressVPN app downloaded on all my devices, phone, computer and even my home Wi-Fi router. All I do is tap one button to turn it on and I protect it. It's that easy.

So a lot of the biggest interventions that we can do for peak performance aging are psychological, not physical, which is very counterintuitive. Like most people want to take care of themselves. They're getting older. They are immediately they're changing their diet and things like that. And exercise is usually important. Human growth hormone, testosterone, supplements, steroids, you know, seriously, like, and I'm not, and those are, so let me give you, this is what's funny about it. If I were to give you peak performance aging the sentence, this is the sentence. If you want to rock to your drop, you want to regularly engage in challenging creative social activities that demand dynamic, deliberate play. And I'll talk about what the word dynamic means in a second and take place in novel outdoor environments. But point I want to make on that is you didn't hear supplements. You didn't hear diet. You didn't hear all the long list of stuff. You just tried it out. None of it is on the list. Why dynamic? So let me walk you. So let me start with dynamic and walk you through that. Okay. Dynamic is, is, is. So I said there are a bunch of uses of losing skills on the physical side. You need to train and we know exactly how long you're supposed to train each of these as we age, strength, stamina, flexibility, balance and agility on a regular basis. Dynamic is one word that means all five of those things. So skiing, tennis, these are dynamic activities. What does that mean? It means they need strength, stamina, agility, balance and flexibility. That's what they mean. Dynamic, deliberate play is the opposite. Deliberate practice is like repetition of incremental advancement. Deliberate play is repetition with improvisation and it's just way more fun. There's less chain. There's less self-consciousness and uses far better learning and lifelong learning is what we're after here. Novel outdoor environment. So why do you want this a novel outdoor environment? So if you want to preserve brain function, you want to birth new neurons. You want new neurons, new neurogenesis and you want to form new neural networks. So we know specifically that this is why so you have something called cognitive reserve. It's what protects you against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's dementia. People with high cognitive reserve, you can even have Alzheimer's, they are tops of your brain upon death. It's filled with tangles and plaques. If you've got a big cognitive reserve, you won't show any symptoms. And this is one of the findings that goes back to the 90s and we can talk about why but really and if you want to build a cognitive reserve, this is why you need lifelong learning. So you want lifelong learning because it produces cognitive reserve. What is that? What am I talking about? Lifelong learning is I want expertise and wisdom. Those are the two things that matter. Expertise is sort of all the stuff we learn consciously. Wisdom is often the stuff we learn unconsciously, but that's those aren't good definitions. Here's what you need to know. The part of the brain that is most vulnerable to cognitive decline, Alzheimer's dementia to prefrontal cortex parts right behind your forehead, right? It's the newest part of the brain from an evolutionary perspective. So it's the most vulnerable. The stuff that's deep in the brain stem and whatever. Not age doesn't touch it at all. It's the new stuff that's really vulnerable. So when we have expertise and wisdom, what those things are are really diffuse networks of neurons in the prefrontal cortex and they're very redundant. Expertise, one of the properties of the brain is redundancy. Like you never just learn one way to do something. You learn six or seven and so there you have these backup networks running through the entire prefrontal cortex that protects the brain. So to maximize lifelong learning, to maximize these new networks, to maximize neurogenesis, you have to ask a simple question, which is, okay, if I need new neurons to protect my brain, where are they born in the brain? Like, where do I get them? Where do they come from? Right? So it turns out the adult brain will produce like 700 new neurons every day, even until like, basically you die, but they come out of a place in the brain and notice they have a campus. The campus does two things. It does long-term memory and it does location. It's filled with like place cells and grid cells. Why? We have followed this hunter-gatherers. So the brain is designed to remember exactly where you were when you had emotionally charged experiences in other outdoor environments. Why? Where's the ripe fruit tree? Okay, I got to remember that next spring when I'm looking for food. Where did I get attacked by that tiger? Okay. I don't ever want to go back there. Where was that watering hole? Yeah. Those, that's survival, right? So the brain is designed to specifically remember that. So I always say that peak performance is getting our biology to work for us rather than against us. Right. Performance aging is the same thing. It's getting your biology to work for you rather against you. Supplied to the challenges and opportunities of aging. So all these new neurons are showing up in the part of the brain that is designed for map making and path finding. So if you have, if you're getting your, these experiences, you're doing your learning and novel outdoor environments, that's what the brain was designed to remember. So you're using the system exactly like it was built for. And so what you end up with is more neurogenesis, more new neurons and more robust neural networks. You know, you've, you've discovered here, Steven, you know, you've discovered you've discovered that outdoor sex will heal the brain. Cause it fits in. It's a physical activity. It's physical dynamic. It's dynamic. It's definitely very playful. Improvisational. Bring peanut butter. Peanut butter? You've been hanging out with dogs too long. Nothing, right? That was the first thing that popped into my mind. Listen, whatever floats your boat and this is what you're saying is incredible. Like, like you're sitting here, it's like we have this like an aspect of our brain that is being underutilized compared to what we used to, what we needed it for, right? We're, we have our GPS. We've got our technology. We don't need to know where anything is anymore. And most of us are stuck in a pattern where we're definitely not going to novel outdoor environments. We're going from point A to point B, point A to point B. And so you're saying it's sort of like we have these. I mean, there's, there's, there's new apps now. I just saw this. There's an app now that will, so let's say you got to go to the store, you know, make you a map based on greenery. So you can, I got to go to the store. It will give you a novel environment that maximizes your exposure to trees. So there, there does seem to be some benefit to technology after all. Oh my God. That's so crazy. But just to clarify, it's, it's, it's like, you're saying that if you want to grow new neurons, the place they're coming from is this theoretically underutilized part of the human brain that it's like, it's, it's the redundant. It's not underutilized. I mean, it's, it's, I mean, they have a campus is not, it's underutilized is an interesting word there. But it's the, I mean, it's just designed to figure out, you know, it's designed to remember emotionally charged incidents and novel outdoor environments. That's how to get it to be the most active. And that's how it also knows, oh, shit, this is really important. I need to save this. I need redundancy. I need backup because you're having a novel experience outdoor, right? Cause that's what it was designed to do. Unbelievable using that, but that's always been sort of one of my sort of approaches is evolution designed all these systems for a purpose. And if you can, you know, evolution of psychology, evolution in our biology is about seeing if you could align that closely. Cause it's, you're just using the system the way it's designed to be used. You get better results. I'm telling you, this is a lightning rod. Like you have done, like to me, what, what you've done here is not just great for people my age or older people. But you know, if you're in your twenties and you've got that old mindset and I think some, I think right now, so we can talk about where that comes from. No, you're totally right. It sets up for some people and it's insidious. It comes from a good place, but it's, it can set up as early as like 25, 26. And you're literally killing yourself. Like you think this mindset is keeping you safe and it's actually killing you, which is crazy. And so let me tell you where it comes from cause you'll, you'll totally get it. As you know, we have all these reward neurochemicals and we get addicted to them, right? People with the cell phones are addicted to dopamine, right? That's a dope. Absolutely. So when we're younger, teen kids and into teenage years and early twenties, we're dominated. So we're dominated by the seeking system and the place system. We're going out in the world. We're trying to figure out who we are. How do we want to live? Yeah. What do we want? What don't like all that stuff. We, some of the social neurochemistry comes in, but the seeking system is predominantly norepinephrine and dopamine, right? Those are the drugs we're addicted to. As soon as we start getting stuff, we found stuff that we want. I've got the right partner. I've got the right job. I've got the apartment. I like, I've got the car. Yeah. Trade our addiction to norepinephrine and dopamine, which are about seeking. Give me something new to serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins. Protect what I have. Now we do this switch naturally when we have kids, right? Cause you don't, you don't want to shut, you want to shut down the seeking system cause you've got to stay with your partner to raise the kids, right? Yes. So it's a healthy biological trade. It turns out for peak performance aging, you need all these systems. So you have to reignite the seeking system and the place system. Reignite the seeking system. Ah, I love it. Oh my God. That's my new mantra in life. Thank you. Hari Krishna. No more reignite the seeking system ring. Oh my God. That's giving me goosebumps. It's, you know, yeah, I'm a, I've got a two year old, a four year old and a baby on the way. So you are describing to me my life, but from a neurological perspective, which I didn't even realize everything you just described. It's what I'm doing. This is a funny story. This is a funny ski story and this is, so we call it getting geysered. Which is when somebody gets there like, I'm too old for this shit. Juice on you. So halfway through my ski season in the NAR season, um, I decide that I've got the wrong skis that I like there. I wait, I don't weigh enough. I can't bend my ski. So I'm talking to other people about their skis and in these parking lessons, um, we're in the, this is the most extreme example. We were at Kirkwood and I'm with my ski partner and this truck pulls up next to me and a guy and a girl get out, a man and a woman get out. She's, she's maybe like 27. He's maybe 30 and he's skiing a pair of skis. The moment death wish that I'm really interested. I was like, Oh, tell me about those skis. Are they good? Did they do this to this? And, and, and I was like, well, what are they like with like nosebutters in three sixties and things like that? And he's like, well, what is that? I was like, Oh, park, park tricks, you know, stuff you do in the train park. His girlfriend jumps out of the cab turns with the most anger I've ever seen. And she's like, we are too old for that shit. They can't tell how old I am cause I've got a ski helmet on. I've got goggles on. I took my helmet off and I'm like, lady, you are literally 35 years younger than me. I don't know what's wrong with you, but you are 35 years younger than me. That's what I'm saying, man. That's what you're doing is like, this is like, you know, upstream. Well, the, yeah, there's another, sorry to interrupt you. There's one other point here that I want to mention cause it's important. I think cause people don't get it. So what the cool thing about peak performance aging is on both sides of the spectrum on the late in life side, there's all kinds of data that says interventions will like make a difference even into your late eighties. They probably make a difference into your nineties, but we just don't have data showing that. But like you can be a sedentary couch potato and be 85 years old. And if you start any of these invent interventions, they're going to make a difference. But what the flip side is, what the data shows is for certain categories of things, peak performance aging starts young really clearly starts young. I guess there's a bunch of stuff you want to pay attention to even in your twenties, your thirties, your forties, your fifties. There's a lot of stuff in those decades that sort of matter here or could really, you know, move the needle for you on the back end. You're so it's, it's, I think like a big part. What did you call the name of it? Getting geysered. I think a big part of getting geysered is it's like a coping mechanism to deal with fear. So one way to avoid whatever it is you're afraid of is to do what those people did to you and say, I'm too old. So you make that assessment of whatever the situation is and, and now you can without feeling like a coward, you can ride off. You can ride it all off. Like I'm too old. So there is a benefit if you try, if you have cognitive dissonance associated with not wanting to go outside the boundaries of whatever your habits are. And that's why what you're doing is like so devastating in the best way possible to people who are utilizing that trick and they don't even realize that's what they're doing. You know, it's like, no, you're afraid. You don't want to get hurt. That makes sense, but don't blame it on the fact that you're old. Blame it on that you're afraid because that's what it is. It's fear, right? I mean, this is it. It's like, we want to avoid fear. I, we want to death. I mean, we want to avoid injury. We want to avoid like paralysis and the assessment any of us make regarding our own personal bodies, unless you're a Kotler is this shit is not doing nose butters. This shit is not jogging out of what it's doing. But, and so I love what things that you're doing, what you're doing here because it's like, it's, um, it's like you're banishing. A mimetic cultural demon or something that we don't even realize we've been trying. Yeah, I, I, I'm trying and, um, and you have to understand for like those of us who have been in and around this, this field for a while, like I'll give you a random example. I ski when I go to, when I go to Palisades, Tahoe, Squaw Valley, I'll ski with a posse of like pros, ex pros and whatever. And invariably we're chasing Tom day around the mountain. He's usually in the pack. He's usually in charge. Tom day is in his late sixties. Yeah. He was like one of the first extreme skiers when Warren Miller started making movies about skiing and then he became like Warren Miller's camera ran forever. He's amazingly talented, but like there are like young Olympic athletes in the posse and the guy who's leading the charge who you can't catch is 65. And so in the action sports community, Tom's not that much of an anomaly. We see a lot of that fairly frequently. You see it in surfing. You see it in skiing snowboard and like it's rock climbing. It's, it's there. It's visible and for a while you just don't notice it, but like when I started to look at it, I was like, well, wait a minute and here. So here's something interesting about that. If you look at the longest lived communities in America, there's four. It's Loma Linda, California, Summit Eagle and Pitkin County, Colorado. So some of the Eagle and Pitkin are where Vale Beaver Creek, Aspen, Copper Mountain, all the big outdoor mechas are there and Loma Linda, California, it's a, there's a seventh day Advent community there. They've got certain dietary practices that work really well, but they, they go on these marathon hikes together all the time. And so you have these pockets of, and by the way, like Summit County, Colorado, on average, people live 10 years longer than any place else in America. So it's a big, like it, it's a big boost.

I want to just, just put in italics here. Just make sure that I understand this correctly. Because you know, what, you know, as an older person, I'm an older person. There's something really like weird when someone in their 20s or someone who just turned 30 says, I'm old, I'm old. And you're like, shut the, no, no, it's like number one, you know, you're implicitly saying I'm a fucking fossil, right? Like if you think you're old, how old do you think I am? Number one, but, but, but I don't know what the number two is there. I don't know why he started a number list. But what you're saying is that habitual assessment of one's self is actually, has been scientifically proven to reduce. So let me actually take it far. Let me take it farther than that for you Duncan. So not only is the idea that the old dog can't learn new tricks false. It turns out that old dogs are actually better at whole new types of learning and thinking than young dogs. When we enter our fifties for three different reasons. One, there's a bunch of genes that only turn on through experience. We call that epigenetics, but like it basically right. Um, the second part is wait, what I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What genes? I'm really interested in this. I'm, I'm very curious about, let's go to the next two cause it's easier and I'm not an expert in genetics. I'm better on, I'm better on the brain and we'll have a more fun conversation. Okay. Great. Cool. The bigger news, the bigger news is that in our fifties. So the two halves of our brain do different things. Sort of they work together, but sort of they work in opposition. In our fifties, they start working together like never before. And it progresses from our fifties, sixties, seventies into our eighties is what it's at its peak. And finally, this is why I lit on the word underutilized that you used earlier, the brain starts, you know, bowed in our late forties, but in our fifties, it, it'll say, okay, you've got this underutilized region over here. You never learned to play a musical instrument. So this is a gap. Um, we're going to colonize it and use it for redundancy and we're going to back some stuff up. We're going to use it for new learning. Yeah. The brain starts to colonize these underutilized regions. The two hemispheres start talking to their bunch of genes turn on and as a result, as we enter our fifties, we gain access to three new thinking styles that we, that are mostly offline before. Uh, and, um, we, we, we basically gain the ability. It's relativistic thinking, which sort of like says, Hey, look, there are black and white thinking as a folly youth. It's all gray and it's all shades of gray. Okay. Right and wrong is, is, is wishy-washy. And then we can multi-perspectival thinking our ego quiets down. So we can now see things from other people's point of view and all around. And finally we get levels of systems thinking, big picture thinking that we don't have access to before as a result in our fifties, whole new levels of intelligence open up, whole new levels of creativity open up, including divergent thinking, which spikes that's outside the box, like the far flung connections between ideas, hardest aspect of creativity to train, really difficult to train, but it starts blossoming in our fifties. Equally important. We gain access to whole new levels of empathy in our fifties and wisdom. And all this stuff, um, doesn't, isn't available before all this stuff means that like not only are we, you know, all the skills we used to think fall off a cliff and we now know their user to lose it skills, we're gaining genuine cognitive superpowers. Now you have to, this is another one of those people performance aging starts young things because there's certain things you have to do in your twenties, thirties, forties, and actually early fifties to make sure you get full access to these cognitive superpowers. But if you get it right, um, the, you, we are just so much better at so much stuff post 50 and pre 50. So if you can keep the body up and train down the risk aversion, what becomes possible is really exciting train down the risk aversion. Now that to me, see, this is the, the paradox, isn't it? It's like this is where the, uh, the, the, the creeping mental disease if I'm too old, this is where it really fucks you up, huh? Because it's like the idea is my bones will break easier. I'm going to break my hip. I, you know, I won't heal us. I won't heal as quickly if I do injure myself. So this would, if you believe those things, you are naturally going to become increasingly adverse to risk. And you're saying that this will actually slow down or potentially eliminate your access to these new. Yeah. So, um, if you really want access to these skills, uh, in your fifties, you have to creativity is sort of one unlocks them. So if you're being creative, forcing the brand to be creative, um, that actually is what starts to really turn these things on. So that's important. That's one of the modifiers or gateways that you need for this. You also have to fight off physical fragility, right? Like if your body's falling apart, who cares if you've got new mental skills, right? It's not going to do you any good. So you have to, that's when you have to start training up all five categories of functional fitness and get really serious about that. And finally, risk aversion increases over time. As you pointed out, and you have to train it down. And the reason is this under that risk aversion is fear as we talked about. And here is predominantly cortisol and norepinephrine, right? Cortisol hormone and norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is literally adrenaline in the brain, right? It's the brain's version of adrenaline and a little bit is great. It's sort of primes learning makes you attentive and alert too much makes you super anxious and it blocks learning. It blocks creativity. So this is obvious. Like when you're stressed out, your brain doesn't want to, you know, when you're, when you're scared, your brain doesn't say, okay, let's find a really creative solution. No, no, give me the same old, give me the thing that works. You know what I mean? So it becomes very logical, very linear, very conservative. And if you can't access the creativity, right? Cause you're too risk averse. You're not going to gain access to any of these super hours and if you're too risk averse, right? The other one in your fifties that matters is you have to self forgiveness and forgiveness of others. You have to forgive those who have done you wrong. You're to forgive yourself in your fifties. Otherwise you can't get access to the empathy and wisdom that comes your way. Whoa. Okay. I want to give you a comedy example of what you just said. So when you start doing stand up naturally, you are terrified. You know, you're not sure you've studied the, the evolutionary biology, the explanation for why we don't like to eat shit in front of strangers. Not later. Well, we don't like to do it literally, but we don't like to bomb on stage in front of strangers. It apparently affects a part of your brain that is different than other psychological pain centers. I am clearly not a scientist, but, but, uh, so what can happen to a comic because of that fear is that you get stuck in the same damn material. You go on stage, you do the same material over and over and over again. You get stuck in this rut, this terrible loop. The minute you're, you, you can kill actually, you can do great on stage, but you'll drive home with the same feeling that you bombed because you know, you've been saying the exact same words in the exact same order for years potentially, but the moment you get your, the nervousness starts going away. When you're up there, your brain, and this is the dream of all comics is what we love. Sometimes your brain will spit out a joke. It will complete a joke. It will find a punchline. It will pull out of the air like an angle that you never thought of. It won't, when you're writing, it will not happen the way it will happen on stage. You just described why and what that is. It's because if you're too freaked out, when you go on stage, you're going to get rigid, systematic. Yeah. And, and stuck. Well, it is so, I mean, the brain limits choice and we all know this because the extreme example is fight or flight or freeze, right? Where the brain goes, Oh shit, crisis situation. You have three options, right? It takes all the others off the table. What people don't realize is it's true with any level of anxiety, any level of time stress, when we're time stressed. It's why I like to get up and write at like four o'clock in the morning because nobody calls me from four to seven a.m. It's non time. It belongs to no one. So if I got to take two hours to get a sentence, right? Who the fuck cares, right? Like it doesn't, it doesn't matter. And the opposite time stress. I'm, there's no way I'm going to get that. I'm going to have access to the same level of creativity. It will work in the middle of the day. Steven, this is, I mean, you know, you've been on the bar guys before and you have changed my life. You're doing it now. Anytime we talk, my life improves. I to this day, to this day. When I am freaking out from weed refer to a podcast. We did where you just described this. I hear your voice. Do you know that? Like when I'm about to like go down the hell, that the hell tunnel that you want to, I hear your voice like Obi-Wan Kenobi. I'm like, you know, yeah, maybe talking you down, maybe these problems. Like you're like, okay, you're, it's your amygdala. It's cortisol. It's presenting problems to you that maybe you need to deal with. But if you just wait a little bit, some of that stress chemical will reduce, but if you obsess on what it's presenting, it's going to amplify. It's going to create a feedback loop. And so yeah, I always, whenever it's like, oh, fuck, I forgot to send the email. I didn't respond to that person or oh my God. I'm like, okay, brain, we'll deal with that. But right now I'm just going to relax and then sure enough, 20 minutes, 30 minutes suddenly, every, you get that nice warm high that we all love, which is why we like cannabis. I don't know if you still indulge in that wonderful, wonderful. Yeah. I'm not a quitter. So yeah, this is, so yeah, it's what you're, what you're, what you're doing here is, is really perfect for people like me. I mean, and you know, with the pandemic, Steven, it's like, if anything triggered our amygdalas, if anything created fight, flight, freeze. I mean, you could literally go through Twitter and analyze tweets. That's a fight tweet. That's a flight tweet. That's a frozen tweet. You know what I mean? That's really funny. You can just see what's happening there. And, and, and it's, you know, it's cause we all just went through this bullshit. And I think we've left it, but we're still scared where we've, our, our risk aversion is so high right now and the implications for society, if creative people, if philosophers, if scientists have managed to get into a trauma state from the pandemic, it's bad news, man. We're, we're not going to get the innovation. We're not going to get the, you know, you're, you're, you're right about that. And, um, yeah, I mean, the other thing is that, so there are nine known causes of aging, we get older for nine reasons, but the thing they all have in common is inflammation. That's what that's the root cause of all of them. And inflammation is always tied to stress. It's always tied to stress. Right. This is one of the reasons and Langer says aging as much a physical as a mental event is a physical process. Aging is tied to stress. And now we're hyper, like first of all, in modern society, we're, we're hyper vigilant in general. The pandemic has made it worse. And it's interesting. The, um, there's the, the long-term effects, um, are, are considerable because these are the very things that age us the most. Right. Right. Right. This is, you know, it's like the old cliche in like, like cheesy old movies. You look at the vampire and your hair turns white. It's like, you know, that's the metaphor. It's like the vampire in this case is like you're, you're staring at this like life-sucking idea of your future that is not real. And, and, and so you age, you get, you get, that's when you get the stress wrinkles. That's when you get the tremors. That's when you get all this stuff. Why wouldn't you? You're freaking out. One of the reasons I thought the, we talk about like a NAR style. NAR, by the way, if anybody doesn't know is. I didn't know when I felt like it was named act. Oh, what is it? It's action sports slang. It's short for gnarly. And it's a very defined as any situation that's high in perceived risk and high in actual risk, which as it turns out is a great description for later years, high in perceived risk, high in actual risk. So NAR country, right, is a finale. And it turns out also that NAR country is also sort of a good descriptor of like the gritty mindset you need to thrive in your later years too. Yeah. So that's where, that's where the title came from. But we talk about we at the flow research collective when we're training people in this stuff, we talk about sort of a NAR style adventure. I'm not saying you should go out and learn to park ski. One of the things I will tell you is, and I'm me, right? I'm, if I know I did all the work, I read all this. I still, there was like residual, the mindset of all this is sneaky. Like it gets in there and like deep levels that you don't even notice. One of the things that I found is, you know, like halfway through my skis and it didn't matter what I thought about the second half of my life, because once I started learning how to do a nose butter 360, you know what I mean? Like whatever I thought was possible, the second half of my life was out of the freaking window because it got exploded by what I'm doing in the real world. That was the weirdest thing about going after this kind of quest is like, I thought it was going to take five years. It was going to be possible at all. Almost everybody else thought it was impossible. Even my friends who were pro athletes would hear about it and be like, well, how many bones have broken so far? Like they just didn't believe you could do it safely without killing yourself or anything else. And yeah, you know, we just found a way to do it safely. Yeah. Thank you.

Hello fresh is the best. I love them. Thank you. Hello fresh. You are the psychological equivalent of that doctor who cured ulcers, but to get the ulcers, he had to give himself ulcers to make himself the lab rat to cure the ulcers. Yeah, totally. You know what I mean? I mean, you know, Duncan with all the peak performance stuff I've done over the years. I'm usually the first lab rat. I just don't ever talk about it because I don't believe it works for me. I don't trust that it's going to work for you. Most other people are like, oh, it worked for me. It's going to work for you. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, there's a lot of psychology that says that's not true. There's a lot of stuff that says that's not going to be the case. So I just never talk about my experiments on the front end because I don't like, I know enough science to know that they don't mean it. I'm just proving it to myself and then I have to go figure out if it's going to work for other people and do all that stuff. Those experiments have kind of been prevalent my whole life. I just like never this is the first time I was like, okay, let's just tell everybody about the experiment as a way to talk about the science rather than just talking about the science in a million other ways and telling. I wish you could have seen the grin on my face watching you on the ski slopes, watching the analysis from that. What's his name? The Nick Nick. Isn't he funny as shit? Funny as shit and a very impressed with you. Like what the fuck? Like definitely like what? This is not. It was he was great. So I stumbled upon. So when I stumbled at a parks gate, one of the things is they speak their own language. I didn't even know the names of the tricks. Right. So like how to figure out the names of the tricks. I had to find commentators online who were accommodating and they would name you like, oh, that's what the fuck that is. Okay. Right. So I stumbled upon this kid during like the COVID lockdown right when everything's closed and all I'm doing is I'm watching him and this other slush is another free skiing channel. That's how I learned the names of the tricks. But as I was watching him, I was like struck by two things. I was like one, he's funny and two, he tells the truth like a lot like he's not like he's honest. I was like, I'm going to send him footage of me three months in the experiment. He's an idiot. We now know each other a little bit, but I literally sent it to him. I called him. I was like, this is who I am. This is what I do. This is footage of me three months into my experiment. Grade me, judge me, make as much fun of me as you want. Just use the footage, explain to me what the fuck park skiing is so they know and just just frame it up and whatever you want to say is totally just be honest. And that's what showed up. He was honest. He was honest. And okay, look, we've got only a little bit of time left and we have a hard out. I've been reading about there's a new movement in the world right now. The movement is go outside. It doesn't seem like that original movement, but relative to the world that we're in right now. It's a it's a kind of unplug, get out there, pull yourself away from the dopamine addiction of your phone. Do you consider yourself part of that movement? I think you are. Do you see yourself in what you mean? Well, so the thing you have to understand is I was never I like I like technology and I've as a writer, you know, I've covered technology. I mean, I work for wired. Like, you know, I covered I covered this stuff, but as far as personal technology goes, I've never I've never been suckered in by it. So I have very little of it in my life and I've never not gone outside. I'm outside. I mean, you know, ever since I got a dog, I'm at least outside a couple hours a day just walking my dog. Right. Um, but I've like, I live, I don't live in cities. I live in the country. Like I like this is so for me, I never had to be told to put down my phone. I don't like I'm the guy in the airport who's not looking at his phone is looking at all you motherfuckers looking at your phone. What is wrong with you people? Don't you have books like it's so strange to me and I and I will say you should have her on the podcast because she's lovely. My dear friend, Catherine Price, who wrote a great book called how to divorce your phone and is probably the world's leading expert on that right now. Yes. Yes. She's awesome. Please happily, happily. Um, you'll love her. Let me make a note of that. Thank you. I appreciate it, Stephen. I mean, God knows how many how to divorce your phone. How many? No, it's a great little book. She wrote and it's really so for older adults, older adults, anybody who's sort of the mindset of older, anybody over 50, there's like seven or eight or nine or 10 or 11 or 12 reasons you really want to put down your phone. There's a lot of yeah, there's a bunch of stuff. So there's a bunch of stuff that cell phones make a lot worse that are already issues for people over 50 and so literally like these are the stuff that you need to be training up and your cell phone is training them in the other direction. Yeah, um, totally. So there's a bunch of like you really want to be putting down that phone and so in the course that in we in the course that we spun out of this, the peak performance agent course, um, it's one up based on Catherine's work, some other stuff is one of the things that we ask people to do for the duration of the course, but divorce your phone. I'm taking your course. How do I take your course and also when is this when is your book coming out man? It's not out yet. It comes out in 14 days. Yeah, it's 14th. It's on the February 28th is when the book when the book drops, um, if you go to our country.com and you want to pre-order, there's this ton of really amazing people from his training bonuses that are free, um, that you get for pre-ordering because pre-order. Oh, really? Yeah. If you want the pre-order, everybody pre-order this book. It's up. It's up to you guys. I mean, you can get it anywhere, but if you go to our country.com and pre-order it, we're going to give you a lot of free peak performance tools and trainings to help. Um, when do I get to, when do I get to do nose butters? How do I take your course? Is this like a scheduled course or is it? So do you want to, I mean, the, we haven't done the course it doesn't, isn't, isn't skiing snowboarding. The skiing snowboarding, we don't know when the next time we're going to do one of those is, but, um, I could, the book walks you through exactly what we did to sort of the approach. So it makes it like there's, there are very safe, safe ways to do it, but, um, we haven't, uh, we're, at some point we'll start doing ski like on the hill stuff again. Um, we just haven't put it together. Uh, there seems to be a lot of interest in it though, which I didn't like in the beginning, I look, I use skiing in a sense as a metaphor and I wanted, one of the advantages of the book is the book is functions as a, it's almost, it's almost a diary, right? It starts pre-season training and goes all the way through the season and covers every day. And the reason is it's really hard. Nobody's ever written a book on applied peak performance. There's this detailed cause it's really hard to make it not terribly boring for the reader. Like there's a lot of writing challenges in doing that, right? And, and, and it took, it actually took a very long time to get it right. But what it gives you is a look at like, oh, this is what it looks like. This is how it's applied on a daily basis over a very long time. And you start to realize you're like, oh, wow, this is a lot more accessible. There's, yeah, he's doing some crazy stuff that maybe I wouldn't do, but like, I can do these things. I can do my versions of these things. This is available to me. Cool. I love it. And in the course, what is the core? Like, is it a, is it the courses? The course is called, um, enter the NAR. It'll be, uh, we will, it'll be available through the flow research collective, um, like our, you know, like our flow trainings and other things. Um, and we, it goes, I think it'll go on sale, uh, probably April 1st. I think we're going to wait and give the book a month and then put the course on sale April 1st, but I can, you know, we can let you know. Can't wait. Steven, you're doing the Lord's work. Thank you for this. You have no idea all the synchronicities involved in this conversation. Thank you for your work and, uh, everybody, please pre-order NAR country. Well, you remind me of my mantra. Usually I say Hari Krishna when I'm getting offline, but what is my mantra? What was it? It was, uh, what do we see? It was C. That's cause I'm not. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody's like, uh, God, what did you say? I remember it was so beautiful. Activate the mother fuck. This is why I need to take it. You know what? You know what? If somebody would have only recorded this conversation, I don't record my podcast. I don't go back. It's just, it's just, it's just like we do it in the ether. I know I hijacked the greatest life coaches on earth for an hour and don't release the podcast. This is a great scam. Activate their power points to distract them so they don't realize it's not recorded. This is it. This is it. Steven, thank you so much. I know how you are. I know how you are. You, you are a, this is one of my favorite conversations in a long time. Thank you for your time. And, uh, Duncan, my pleasure. It's great seeing you again. What's the website? Well, sir. What's your website? Mr. Kotler. No, uh, my Steven Kotler. Dot com. No, our country. Dot com. Flow research collective. Dot com. Duncan trestle. Dot com. Yes. Um, you, we've taken it over to actually all that Steven Kotler stuff. You don't know this. This was going on. Why are you podcasting and stealing my. I know you, you're hijacking your website.

I'm just happy that you are listening to the podcast and letting us spend some time together in the strange, beautiful waters of the World Wide Web. So without further ado, everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, the lead singer of the Flaming Lips, Wayne Coyne. Wayne Coyne, welcome to the show. Oh wow, here we are. I mean, we have to say that we're at like a really expensive hotel that you snuck your ... Did you sneak them in or are you allowed to have the dogs? They let the dogs in. We go. Hotels are cool these days because you get to have your dogs and they don't care and yeah. We're in an expensive hotel in Nashville, Tennessee and we're looking out at the other side. We can't see the sunset but we're seeing the residue because we're way up high 14th floor in the shiny buildings downtown. It's beautiful. And I think it's important to say how I ended up in this hotel. Well, I wasn't going to bring it up. It's embarrassing but I think we need to say it. I'm a professional. Yes. You were so ... I was unprofessional. I was on high on ... No, I was not. Wayne Coyne. Wayne Coyne. No. You can't do that. We've got to ... You were so high on that. It was not because of that though. It was ... Right. It was an acceptable accident. You were traveling all day and ... I left my charger at Will Oldham's house. So it's this crazy convergence which is that ... These are the kinds of things ... I'm sure this is for you. The life that you must have, I think, must be a series of odd synchronicities and oddness but for me to be in a tiny house outside of Nashville and to be sitting in the tiny house with Wayne Coyne, that's enough to send many a man tumbling off the precipice of sanity. You could go nuts. Now you say tiny house as if the world knows what that is. A tiny house, it's not just actually a tiny house, it's a thing. Yeah. Right. It's a movement. It's this idea that we don't need to live in some kind of ... We don't need all this space. We're in this bucket, two beds, two dogs. I know. I agree. But I thought it was quite small. Oh, it was ... It was a tiny house. If you had ... Which you don't have, which we'll talk about in a minute, but if you had your girlfriend there with you, that seems like it's too small for a dude and his girlfriend to be in there at the same time. No, you couldn't live with a family. That's a single man sort of domain. Am I right? You're writing a manifesto in that thing. You go there to write a manifesto. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And even that would be uncomfortable. Even writing a manifesto in there, there's not much of a desk. You'd have to figure out ... You'd have to sit in bed with a lap desk, I guess. It was tiny. Yeah. But maybe it's great and it's affordable and it's simple and for ... I mean, I thought it was interesting. It just seemed ... Even for me and you, after all, I was like, hey, man, this is kind of like being in a jail of some kind, and I'm stuck with you in my jail cell, which isn't that bad. How do you think I felt, man? It was ... So not only ... But we had our dogs. And you had your dogs. They were wonderful. I might say Wayne Coyne, Wayne, takes this heroic leap into pure unknowingness, drives to it, gums to a tiny house. No, no, it's not pure unknowing. I mean, I know you kind of. Yes. Yeah. And you're traveling across country. Yes. I mean, you're not a complete stranger or anything. We've been trying to do this for a long time, and then when I do finally get there, you've left the cord at Will's house. Is that ... That's exactly what happened. But we started this conversation for you, pressed the button, and then you slightly turned into this other radio personality guy. Am I doing that? Did my personality change? No, not at all. Really? Not at all. I need to know things like that. Which I'm like, come on. Step it up a little more. You want me to be more, but ... No. But we were like, I was asked, have you ever been to therapy, and you said, wait a minute. Hold on. Let me press the button. Yeah. Yeah. Before you even answered. I went to therapy a little bit, but I don't go regularly. I think you should. It's a great thing to do, but I don't do it. Yeah. Do you go to therapy? No, but I get to talk about myself all the time to strangers who are not that invested in ... You know what I mean? I think if you didn't have that, and you weren't asked about things in your life, and you didn't get to talk about them, and they were heavy things, you would want to have someone. I think doing interviews, as you probably ... Maybe you were about to say this. In a sense, it has a therapeutic. Absolutely. Articulating is different than thinking, and writing, and even talking. Articulating this speed by which we're answering each other. Yes. We're not really thinking about what we're going to say, but perhaps we should. But we don't. No. It's coming out quicker than we're even thinking it, and that has some kind of ... There is something in that therapeutic, that's therapeutic to your being, that you're this flow of whatever. Yes. I'm in therapy with you right now. Oh, great. In a sense. You're in it with me. Well, I think I'm more in it with you. You are a healing force. Thank you. You are. You seem to have this ... Anyone who's been to your shows knows that this thing happens in there, which we talked about last night. We did. We want to get back into that. Okay. But it's not just your shows. As I was hanging out with you, and I realized, not only are you not ... You don't seem even slightly annoyed that I'm unable to record this podcast. You spend at least an hour with me, and we've gotten this great conversation, but the feeling ... It was a great conversation. I mean, you're an interesting, cool guy. I mean, I've been around you other times, and we haven't talked that much, but we've talked enough and done things that we weren't thinking, oh, this is for a podcast. Very much just hanging out with you, and you traveled across country, and you talked with ... Well, you've got to ... I mean, I was ready to hear your stories anyway. Yeah, but they've heard my stories. We want to hear about you, and when I'm ... What the feeling I get from you is that when people get around you, you start reconfiguring them in a kind of sweet, positive way, but also a kind of wild way, and it's beautiful, but it's beautiful, and it's healing, but it's not what you would necessarily call therapy. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Do you get this feeling that ... Do you feel ... I mean, it sounds so schlocky when I say it, but when you're putting all this energy out in the world, is that the intention behind it? Well, I mean, when I was with you last night, I was utterly fascinated with the things you'd say and then what it would lead to, and I would be asking you questions like, oh my God, this is really your life. We talked about your girlfriend that you had, and then your separation and all that. Yes. To talk to someone, which you're like this, that just is being honest right there. They don't have an answer that they want to give. They haven't thought about it a billion times. They haven't asked about it a billion times, and you're just saying it. I mean, I think it's fascinating. It's fun. Yeah. It's a joy. I mean, it's a thrill. I mean, you know, I think that's why you have such a great show. Oh, thanks, Wayne. I think there's something that's pulling the truth and an urgency out of people, and so yeah. Oh, God, that's amazing. I mean, I felt the same way around you. I just felt like when you left, I didn't want you to leave, and then I thought, oh, of course, you don't want them to leave. It's Wayne Coyne. He's a rock star. It's a flaming lips. Everyone wants him to stay. So yeah, and we talked about so many cool things last night, but I sure would love to circle back to a few of them, and it kind of goes back to what I was saying before, which is that a lot of my friends and my experience when I go to a flaming lip show, it can be a transformative experience. And I was, I think last night, I was kind of trying to fish out of you some intention or some right, some like, like, like a mission statement, right? Yeah, yeah. It felt like you were telling me, no, that's not necessarily well, I mean, you know, all these this thing that we do now as the flaming up as a show, you know, it's a it's a it's a long, long, you know, evolution of little ideas put together, things that, you know, you would have tried that failed things that you didn't know you were doing at work accidentally and all those little things being that we get to kind of have, you know, it's not control, but it's like, we're the ones creating the show, whatever, and using all those to their most effective thing, you know, and having a slight confidence that I think this would work. And the audience is ready to listen to us and pay attention to us and be with us here. If we do these things, they're gonna, it's gonna be fun and we're all gonna be in it together and then we can have these, you know, these emotional things with the songs and singing together and all that. But that's not a mission, you know what I mean? Right. I think it's more, you know, there's a certain thing that we like to do and then it just works out that there's a certain thing that the audience likes and those can be kind of together. But it's not, it wouldn't be a mission, you know, in that way. We wouldn't have ever thought, this is what we want to say to the world, I think. When we're doing it, it feels like we're so lucky we get to sing our songs to people, you know, and I say it still all the time, it's like, you know, people who really know music and people, you know, a lot of people have musical minds that aren't musicians, you know, they're, they're musical anyway, even though they're not pursuing music. What, what did that look like? And they can tell, they can tell, I can't really sing, you know, they're like, you're you know, you're, and I'm like, I know, I'm not really a singer, but I'm, but I'm allowed to sing, you know, these flaming lip songs and I, and I'm just like the luckiest person ever in that way, because, you know, the audience is like, we know you can't sing, but there's something that allows you to be a singer and I could be a singer for no other, anything ever, but I can sing flaming lip songs. And that's where I sort of feel like this is, it's a special like, man, I got a special duty here, you know, yeah, yeah, it's wonderful. It's wonderful that people allow me, let me sing to them, you know, well, we love it. And I love it too. I mean, you know, it's such a great thing. But, you know, a lot, you know, a lot of people are singers and they think, oh, I can really sing, but I never think that that's nuts, man, never in a million years would I thought that when you think about yourself, you're like, well, I'm not a singer. I am not a singer. Like I'm not a singer. I'm not a singer in the way somebody who doesn't have a spine is not a jogger. I can't. Well, I think in time, if you would, if you, you know, if you tried and tried, you might find a way to say, oh, if I sing in this way, it works for me, which is what I do. You know, I'm not, I don't have, I can't do very much, but I can do this one area and doing my thing. It's, you know, it's passable. It's I mean, it works for people that like our music for sure. Right. But yeah, it's beautiful. You're a singer. I mean, if you're not a singer, God, all of it, we're doomed. Well, I mean, I think there's there's probably a, you know, a description or or an identity that comes with someone that you think, well, he's standing up there on a stage singing. He must be like kind of a show off or this confidence, you know, and I could see where most singers in the world, you know, are probably exactly that, not in a bad way, but they feel like, oh, you want to hear me sing because I'm a good singer. Well, I'm not like that. You know, I came into it, not really starting as a singer, but then singing and like, well, punk rock stuff, you know, right? Well, you know, John Leiden doesn't sing that well. And, you know, Anthony Kitas from Chili Peppers doesn't sing that. Well, I can do it or Henry Rollins, you know, those types of singers. And then I wanted to start to do music that was more emotional. And then it's like, but you can't really sing. I'm like, I know, but I want to, you know, and that's where I'm at still. I mean, I still think of those guys in some ways as my heroes, even the guy from Durand Durand. What's his, what's his name? You know, like these guys who can't really sing, but they decided I'm going to do it anyway. Yeah, it doesn't matter. I'm just going to do it. Yeah. I'm going to jump out there and make a thing regardless of whatever the problem is. But, you know, but music is sacred ground in some way, you know, and, you know, to go out there and say, well, you're listening and I'm I'm the guy, you know, you're going to listen to me tonight. That's why I think it's different at a Flaming Nip Show, because it really isn't, you know, we we never go out there and be like, you're the audience. No, you know, we're us. It's like, we're all in this together. It's participatory for sure. And that's that that is the absolute truth from the heart of our minds that we try to say, you know, it's not about it's not about us because we're we're horrible introverts. We talked about that last night. Yes. Like, ooh, you know, we're not we're not saying, oh, pay attention to us. We know that that's the that's the deal. You know, you're there and you're going to watch us do our thing, but it's not. We need your attention to make us feel good about ourselves. It's just a different trip. But I don't know if it comes across that way. I mean, I could see where years ago you could say, go to see Beyonce and then next night see the flaming lips. You'd be like nothing very similar. Right. Yeah, sure. Now you you might go see Beyonce one night and see the flaming lips next night and say, well, there's some similarities. You know, it's a it's a big show. We we we make it seem like at the end of the every song, you know, you're going to clap and this is going to be a big a big deal. You're the audience where the where the stars and, you know, but underneath all that, that's there's nothing those two are not anything alike. You know, Beyonce knows I got the butt, I got the hair, I've got the voice. Yeah, right, right. It's going to work. Yeah, right. And then she's got lasers and stuff, too. Yeah, and you just go blammo. Yeah, you're like, I'm done. Yeah, you win. Absolutely. I want to be in the audience and I want you. I've never been to Beyonce. I've never been to one of her shows. It's amazing. You just said, yeah. But but the flaming lips are, you know, we're even though those those same things may happen. We're never coming across like where the lips and you're just no, no, it doesn't feel like that. No, he feels like a ritual. It feels like we get to do this thing together. Yeah, there's it to me. There's a it feels religious in the good sense of the word. I agree. We always say it's like it's like a religious cartoon. You know, it's like it doesn't it's not there's nothing overly heavy, even though it's heavy, but it's all in music and it's all in a show. It's right. You know, we're not really we're not trying to change you. You're here. You're at our show. You're the perfect, wonderful person anyway. There's nothing for us to change about you. You're here. You know, but I agree with you and we're getting that same thing when we're playing, you know, when it's working, we all feel like, oh, man, we've created this thing together. Yeah, because without the audience's energy and that love, it really is love. You know, when people are paying attention to each other and urging each other to do do this thing, do this marvelous thing. I mean, that's, you know, and to go up there and to to know, oh, we're purposely going to do this thing. So we feel this thing and it works. It's it's wonderful. It's love. It is. It is absolutely channeling love. It's like, I mean, most performers, in a sense, do. I mean, sure, you've got to see people. It's not it's not something we do that nobody else does, but it is that. What do you think love is? Love, so that's a that's that's it's not tough to define because we all know what it is. It's tough to put it into words, you know, but it is. It's like you just, you know, you like someone, you want someone, you want this thing, and then it slips over into a deeper category. Yeah. Unknowingly, it's become part of you. You know, I always say, like, if you love someone, you're doing that for you. You know, liking them is for them, you know, but if you love them, it's for you because it gets to be in a special part of your mind. Yeah. And you know, you want to come, you want to put it in your mind. So it's like, oh, it's so special, even though it's probably, you know, a selfish thing or whatever. But you know, we all know people like that. It's like, you know, I love them, but I don't like them. Right. Yes. You know, yeah, sometimes your relatives or whoever, you know, you love them, but you don't like them. But there's other people that, you know, you like them, but you don't really love them, you know. Yeah, sure. Absolutely. But can you love everyone? No, I don't. I don't. Why? Why could you? I mean, why? You know, I mean, I think you could. Well, I think you could only it would only really be love if you had experiences with them. And that's why I think it when I say it goes into this other category, I don't think it's you doing it. I think there's there's a certain, you know, you know, amount that you start smelling and seeing and experiencing and thinking about and considering. And then that plump, you know, it's a but what do you what do you call the the amount once the amount is so much? I know what you mean. It's like a scale. It goes, yeah. And then it plumps and you don't know it. But suddenly they're part of what you think about. They're part of these millions of things that you're able to think about. And if something happened to them, it would hurt you. Their pain is your pain then. But if you if you don't really know someone, you know, them being here, not being here, them being in pain or not being in pain. We have, you know, empathy and, you know, we understand their thing. But you know, it's not really affecting you. You're you're drinking your coffee, reading your, you know, your your internet. So whatever it is you're doing without being that affected. Yeah, sure. But when something has plopped into the love category, you know, it's it is you. You know, their pain is your pain. Their love is their joy is your joy. Can it go back once it plumps into love? Of course. Yeah. So you can fall out of love. Yeah, luckily, yeah. Otherwise, it would be, you know, I mean, when my when my mother died, I mean, it wasn't like a sudden thing. But it's, you know, it it climaxes into like a very sad, devastating thing. But she, you know, didn't want us to be sad. She's like, look, I don't be sad for a while. Don't be sad the rest of your life. You had a wonderful life. Don't worry about it. And in time, you know, the sadness turns to just a profound, great memory or whatever. And you can talk about it without it killing you, which is good, you know. Otherwise, you know, your animals die. It's devastating. It's devastating. You don't want to live. But you do heartbreak. Yeah, it's horrible. You're saying if you you're saying if love didn't dissipate, that we would be in a constant state of heartbreak. Yeah, because there's too many too many things die and too many things reject you and too many things. You weren't right about what you thought was happening or whatever. You know, it'd just be too difficult. And yeah, let's talk about heartbreak. Let's do. That was an evil laugh. No, it wasn't. It was. I noticed that last night. No. Oh, man, I've never allowed that laugh to come out in any other time. Now I'm in the woods, which is where you were. You know, people don't realize I took a Uber. The Uber driver was worried about me. He was he asked if you if you are you so you want me to drop you off. And I was like, no, I'm not sure. But but I don't have a choice. You know, and he was he was very kind and caring. I'm really concerned because who wouldn't be? He drove. Well, once he saw you, too, that raised it even more. Yeah, before then, he was just worried about how far we were. And he saw you. Oh, Jesus, did you show you want me to leave you and this guy with a beard wanders out of a tiny house? It gives me this suspicious look. Yeah. So heartbreak. Because we kind of we were kind of like skirting around this last night and heartbreak is for a lot of people, the worst thing that can happen outside of, you know, physical injury, maybe worse than physical injury to some people, for sure. I'd depend on the injury. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And but but heartbreak is is considered by a lot of my teachers one of the most sacred things that can happen to you. Because when a heartbreak happens, this is actually contact with reality that the feeling of heartbreak, the feeling of your identity being sort of overcome by this great sense. Well, I mean, I suppose that that can be true. I mean, I think. I mean, when people are sensitive, most people that, you know, do music or do art or something, you know, they have a sensitivity that's, you know, something affects them. And if they don't have some agitation or some some vehicle by which they get to play with it, then it and it's not anybody's in stock for a good or bad. It's just, you know, the situation I was with you, we were looking out the window and we posted the sunset is amazing. You know, we we're standing here with some strangers. Some people probably look at it and not think it's amazing or boring. I mean, it is like whatever just buildings do, you know, and we look at it and it's like, oh, my God. Yeah. And we think, what a what a great thing that we noticed this this beauty. Yeah, we're standing here and it's so beautiful. Yeah. But to another normal person that's not sensitive in the same way we are. It's like, whatever, it's dinner time. Let's go. You know what I mean? It's not a moment of of, wow, the glorious thing. Right. So it's our fault. You know, whatever your your sensitivity is, it's your dilemma to deal with it. Yeah. And when you if you're sensitive and you have that deep, deep love that's guiding you and all that and it goes away. I mean, you're you're in deep trouble. You know, if the. Yeah, you're in trouble, but you're in deep trouble. If the love is based on another person. No, even even animals and things. I mean, you know, I know. But no, I'm saying you're the the love that kind of love, which is that I love my poodle. What people can't see, but the poodle is right here. And we're both able to pet you. What's your poodle's name? Gatsby. Gatsby. And he sat in your lap and he loves you and he wants to be near you. But but the the the idea is and I really want to know your opinion about this is love localized. If love is localized, in other words, I have to have this poodle, a person, a sunset, a thing, an event to trigger the the beautiful tilting of the scales into the universe of love. Then I think we're in a desperately rough place. But what do you what's the word localized? What do you mean? So I mean, the idea is many times people will say, I am in love with you. Right. And what they really mean is you are giving me love, kind of like what you were saying before, this this somewhat selfish. I'm essentially I know, I know, I don't know about that. Love for me. No, I don't. I mean, that's a, you know, that's an individual category. You know, like I could see with some people, if they get attention, you know, they think, oh, this is this must mean that they're, you know, that they're in love with me or something. And then that maybe trigger something in them. And that's, you know, it's nobody's fault. But that can, you know, those things get misread all the time, you know. I think it's best to be in love with someone that you already know. And it's been a it's been like getting into some really cold water or hot water, whatever it is that you wanted to call it. But you've gotten used to the first foot being in and then you dip a leg in it. You get used to that, you know, and you're getting used to it and you're you're getting more trust built up and more comfort built up and more, you know, just more used to the way that you are and they are. Yes. And then perhaps before you know it, you're all the way in. And this is good to be in here, you know. But if you're if you're falling in love with people that you don't really know and you're just going in and I don't know them, here we go. It's it's going to be rough. That's it. I mean, maybe maybe there are times when that it doesn't turn out rough. But I mean, that's but this is all that don't this. It's down to your personality. I mean, your personality may be that's that just as the way you are. And you can't, you know, there's deep things that happen within us that we don't want to control. We have no control over it, you know, and so let it, you know, and that's right. But if I let me ask, if I eradicated all life on earth and and and in the in the in the universe, somehow I had a button and I pressed it. Right. And all sentient life in the earth I've caused to blink out of existence. Right. Would there still be love? Well, you mean like inside of you or or just in the universe? Once the universe is all obliterated, does love is love an essence? Yes, we can't see or smell. That's right. No, love is love is a belief. A love is a belief. That's why when people say, do I believe in UFOs? And I'm like, well, I don't really believe in anything that can exist without me believing in it. Like UFOs, if they exist, they don't need me to believe in them. Right. They're flying around there doing fine. You know, Santa Claus, if he exists, I don't need to believe in him. He's delivering toys. But if I don't believe in love, which is just a little thing inside my mind, if I don't believe it, then it's not there, you know. So I save belief for things that wouldn't exist like trust. Like, you know, these types of these things are only they're they're just done with your mind. There can't be done without you being connected to your mind. There's that that doesn't make any sense. It's like your mind's the record player. Love is the record. The two have to come together. If one's not there, you're not going to have. Well, you know, you I have trees in my yard and I do sometimes go up and say, I love this tree. Yeah. But I know the tree doesn't love me. It's a tree, you know, and I and I think that's even better. You know, I love the Beatles, but the Beatles. But that's to me, that's what love is. It's like that I love you. I would I'm glad that you don't have to have emotions and you don't have to have ups and downs. You don't have to be happy or sad. You can just be you and I love you and I don't want by loving you. I don't want to burden you, you know. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm not I. The love is for your life to be better and happier and better because we cross paths or something like that. Yes. Yeah, sure. But but I want to talk about this idea that he doesn't love you because the way I have I have been taught and I I love to believe it. Right. Believe, I guess, right. Alex here. But I love to believe that everything is love. Everything's made of love and the human condition is for me. I think that devalues what love is then, you know, to me, love is it's a motherfucker and it's and it's hard work and it's trying and trying and trying again and seeing seeing the reason why, as opposed to the reason why not. It's not. Oh, it's it's just here. I guess I just don't see it or it's here and I don't care. I don't that tree loves me, but I got shit to do today. And that dog loves me, but I got to do today. It's not. I mean, I feel like it's a it's it's a powerful thing that you're you're doing all the time. You're trying to make this love and be with this love and see what comes of this love that you that you want to be part of your cultivating love. Yeah. And and you're you're reaping the rewards of it. And you get the, you know, the the bad parts of it as well. But I mean, if you're lucky, the love that you create is nourishing you, which is what that's the greatest human achievement ever is this thing that I need. I can make it myself, you know, and you don't blame anybody and you don't you don't wait for nobody. It's something you can do. You can love the tree. The tree doesn't have to love you. I got you. That's beautiful. Well, you're like it's more like you're a fountain of love. Inside of you is a fountain that can start fountaining out. Well, because giving love is like it, you know, it's something that you love to do. You know, if you love to do it, it's not like you're like being selfless. Oh, I'm sacrificed myself. I'm loving because it I want to. That's my favorite thing in the world. And when it when it nourishes the entity or the creature or the person, whatever it is that you're loving, it even works better. It's healing. And you get you're getting off on it. They're getting off on it. Life is is great. Love's the most healing thing. I were wondering why outside of bandages and penis going. Well, all those things are probably they're probably invented because of love. Oh, I love and caring. Yes. Yes. Right. Right. It's the progenitive force. It's where all human life comes from. I mean, obviously, we're not some of us are humping not for love. But it's the progenitive force. And well, I mean, obviously, it's I mean, there is something. It is something that but I would I don't think it exists out there without our minds and our bodies having some attachment to each other. I think it's something in there. Right. Well, there's a right. You're I know what you're saying. It's this there's clearly there must be some two things coming together for this love thing to happen. And I want to talk about the devaluing. Yes. Of love by the concept being the entire you. This is the idea. The entire universe is made of love. You are made of love. And when you are falling in love, you're not falling in love. You're remembering your true identity. Right. That's the concept. Right. Well, I mean, I don't I've never thought of it like that. I guess, in a sense, you know, I don't I mean, to me that when I say devaluing, it's like, oh, I just love everybody. And it's like, well, we really don't we don't know everybody. We don't, you know, it can only be I guess that's what I'm saying. When it plops from being, oh, I'm I like this and I'm interested in this. And now I'm obsessed with it. Yes, all these things. They're short of love, but you know, when you tell someone that you love them, there's always that way of saying, I love you, man. Yeah. And we do. Yes, I mean, we could say it to each other. Yeah, I love you, man. I love you. But I don't know you that well. And if if you, you know, died tonight, I would it would be wow, it's just with him. It'd be it'd be a bummer. But it wouldn't be the same as if someone in my family or someone I've known for a long, long time, deeply. And that's just the way it is. You know, I would I would know. I wish they could see me crying right now. I wish I was filming this so they could see the hot tears running down my cheeks. I know. But but that's something that we don't get to control is what I would say. You know, that that that overwhelming feeling that's attached to us. OK, so that isn't true. Well, like when we say, you know, I love everybody, we know it's not it's not true. You know, it doesn't work that way because, you know, people are going to die in the streets tonight of Nashville, where we're at. And we're not going to care about on one level. You can't love everyone's personality. You wouldn't. But this brings us to the other thing we were talking about last night, which is this idea of the there being some kind of membrane or a transcendental connective mechanism that allows for synchronicity to happen. Right. And so this thing is our true identity. Underneath all the personality and all the all the stuff, there is like a matrix of consciousness. And see, this is I mean, I understand people like to believe that. Yes, but you don't believe that. Well, no, I mean, because I mean, the same, it's like me and you. I didn't know you. I didn't feel like when we finally met each other or whatever in real life that I've known you my whole existence, Duncan. I really started to know you when Shelby and I Shelby talked about us connecting. I texted you. That was one level. We, you know, we'd have jokes back and forth. Yes. Another level would send pictures back and forth. Yes. It's another level. By the time we meet each other, I kind of know you, but I didn't feel like I knew you in a cosmic way all along. I didn't even think about you until Shelby and said, connect with him. And now that you've made that you've tried and I've tried, we've probably texted each other a thousand times without really thinking about it. Yes. I was like, hey, Duncan, I send you a picture and you send me the best. Yeah. So that's not just there. You made it happen. And I made it. Sure. You made it happen every time we try, every time we text, every time we think about each other and say, I'm going to let them know. I was thinking about them. We're building up a thing that could be like love. It's we care about each other. Yes. That's not just there. I'm not just running into someone saying, brother, I don't know you, but I love you. I'm saying I'm beginning to know you. I'm beginning to love you. You know, after last night, I'm beginning to not love you. No, I'm not. No, no, this is the this is the risks we take with deeper with deep love. But that's my feeling of it. It's like that you're trying and I'm trying and we're not drawn to it in the dark. We we saw the movie The Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Yes. That movie, you know, where they're they're obsessed with this image and they're they want to go to the mountain where the UFOs are going or whatever. That's to me, that's not that's not happening like with the human race. We don't have a true answer that we're just always trying to get to. You know, we're always answering questions or always of new answers. And that answer leads to a new understanding of, you know, things that you thought you didn't understand, you know, to me, so I don't feel like there's a flow going that we all dip our foot into. And finally, we feel at home to me. I don't I don't feel that way. Wow. OK, I love it. But we then this is where we have a fundamental disagreement. And because I do feel I do get that sense. I get this feeling that there is a we are all part of this river of love. And that and certainly I am not going around to people being like, I love you, brother. Right. But I think that if I were to work on myself enough, if I spent some time like in a deep practice, then I could anything that crossed the in front of me, I think that I could love it. And I but what but what would be the way that you loved it by just something with your your mind or I mean, what would be the I mean, you know, love is fine, you know, but you have to do. There has to be some action connected to it. You know, it's like I love my dog, but I forgot to feed it and it died. That's not love. If you love your dog, you would you would be asking it every 10 minutes. Are you hungry? Because I can I'm feeding you. Yes, I want to feed you. Yeah. That's not love. Well, there's action that would go along with it, too. But well, but if someone is passing in front of you, there there can't be love without some knowing their personality. No, without you, it has to be you have to be in it. You can't just it's not love if it's like, well, I just saw you and I love you. It's like, well, OK, you know, but you don't know anything about me. And you don't, you know, OK. But I which is fine. It's better than saying, I mean, I would rather it just be like indifference, you know, I don't love you and I don't hate you. But we can meet in this middle ground of being, you know, positive about each other and wishing each other well. That's great. Yeah, you would you would rather have an indifference. So you would rather like an optimistic, well wishing indifference. Not like, I don't know you and fuck you. You know, that's not, you know, it's like if if, you know, if something happened to you, I saw you on the street, I would go, hey, are you all right? Can I help you? I don't know what I'm getting into. You know, you might be trying to trick me. I don't know. But my instinct would be, I don't know anybody seems like he needs help and I would say, hey, can I help you? Yeah, yeah, sure. That's that's better than saying, I don't know you fuck you, buddy. Good luck. And maybe they're both in difference. But one is I don't know you, but I'm willing to. Take a chance if you need help. Optimistic indifference. Yeah. Hey, I'll take it. That's pretty good. I mean, hey, that's cool. You know, I get it. I mean, again, I can only speak in and I can only speak as someone who believes in UFOs, because not that I believe in UFOs, but your dog. You don't know if you could tell your dog growled when when you said UFOs. Yeah, no, he doesn't like me talking about it. Because when when no one's around, I just sit and talk to my dogs about UFOs and they get really no, here he goes again. Well, again, it's like, you know, I. Sure, you know, I did if the if the universe is infinite, as far as we're concerned. Sure. And, you know, this world that we live in, it turned out this way. There probably could be other worlds. And if those entities, whatever they are, found a way to fly around and stuff that maybe they exist and maybe they would want to visit here. But to me, all that seems like, man, that is just so far fetched. I'm not going to spend very much of my mind, even considering it. I would rather spend all of my mind, as much as I can, in the real world that I know. I know these people have problems. I know these people need some help. I know these people need some help and not care if the UFOs are there. Good. They don't need our help. You're here. You're a realist. You're a pragmatic realist. Well, when it comes to those sorts of things. Yeah. I mean, being a man imaginative and creative and all that, that's just your work. That's fun. But it's, you know, but I but I'm older than you as well. You know what I mean? And maybe by my time, you're 56. You might say, yeah, I used to believe in UFOs, but now I don't. If they're there, fine. Well, the UFO thing, you know, is what I meant to say is UFO, I know people, these Ramdoss people, who encountered this being that when you got around him, it was it was the most transformative thing you've ever experienced. Because when you got around him, you did know him and he knew you and he would tell you things about yourself that you have never told anyone. And it wasn't like he was saying, like, I know about you to run some power game on you. Right. Yeah. It was that it was like an instantaneous connective sense of like, I've known this guy for a long time. And this person is looking at you. Not like I love you in the way a parent loves you. But they're they're saying, well, this this is an entity from beyond. They're goo, you know, probably Baba, you know, this being popped into time and like influence this connected to the UFOs. Oh, I'm just saying, I know I know people who've seen UFOs and I know people who've seen people who, theoretically, can throw out unconditional love to all those in front of them. And that being said, I have never been able to achieve that state. And I haven't necessarily been in the presence of someone who's putting that out there. So it's similar to UFOs. I've met people who've swear to God they saw a thing up in the fucking sky. And I believe them. I mean, and to them, perhaps it really is magic in a UFO. But I mean, I would say, well, you mean scientifically or you've proven it's UFO. I mean, that's a different thing. And so we're, you know, I'm all for look, if you want to believe in Santa Claus, I believe in him with you because there's there's there's great, you know, there's great things in in that that belief. And that makes me think this and it drives me to, you know, to do this or whatever. But, you know, it's like if you really if you really think they're real, then the investigator, let's find out. But that's, you know, that's not part of the fun, you know, that's not that much fun to really go and see. But it just doesn't seem that likely that a UFO would have lights on it. Well, as you would see them, why do they need lights? They've been traveling through the endless universe. Yeah. Lights on an airplane aren't there so they can see, you know, it's only there so other people can see them. No, it's that that whole the humanizing of of alien technology is hilarious. It's just I don't take it serious. I take it as kind of like it's fun to talk about it. Well, this was we I did this show with Rogan a long time ago on sci-fi. And we went to all these UFO people and we went to every weird thing. We went squatting. We went with big people, squatting for big foot. You ever gone squatting? No, see, I mean, I mean, big foot doesn't interest me as much in the big picture. I mean, I could imagine, you know, there's maybe there's some creature out there. I mean, I would feel more sorry for big foot, you know, than I do. Don't feel sorry for big foot, Wayne. That's the title of this episode I can see now, you know, don't feel sorry for big foot. He's big stinky dude, man. He'll bum he'll bum out your camping trip. He he big foot. So with these squats, so what's it called? Confirmation by. So you you run into people looking for big foot. And I'll tell you, here's what big foot does. If big foot likes you, he will put a feather in the path in the forest. So if you're walking down the forest and you see a feather, it means that big foot's been checking you out. And he's like, oh, he's cool. And he puts a feather there. And so big foot likes to make structures in the forest. So if you see sticks that have been that have fallen, then that's been constructed by big foot. Big foot can turn himself into a frog. So if you hear, see, that that throws up a red flag for me. See, anything that can transform itself into another entity, another, you know, shape or whatever. I'm like, well, I mean, I think it's a wonderful story. I think it's a great imaginative metaphor for some sense. That's right. But if you're saying it's a metaphor, I say, well, it is a great metaphor. They don't think it's for them, it's real. But what they're doing is a really fascinating thing, which is that we have a thing that does not exist. Yes. And what we've done is we've taken the natural world and we've picked variables that occur in the natural world. But again, I say it devalues the bizarre, wonderful, insane things that really do exist that you don't even bother to go look for. Right. How many times, you know, going through the Internet, do you see that some weird, one-eyed, clear fish that we've never seen before? It's real. Yes. We don't have to make up a story. It's real. I'm still looking for big foot. Fish is cool. Looking for big foot. That's hilarious. Yeah, you've got to think 50 times weirder than big foot. And you're still looking for this thing that doesn't exist. Like, but it's like, are you really interested in how wonderful and unknown the world is? Or are you just, I'm going to find big foot, fucking kick his ass. You know what I mean? It's like, to me, it's easy to say, yeah, I'm searching for the beautiful and you would find it. You would find it in the ants crawling on the sidewalk down there. You'd find it in everything. But why do we have to go search for big foot in the middle of nowhere when the trees that you're walking through are better than big foot? The squirrels that are running around are your feet are better than big already. And you just want to find big foot. So I that's my feeling. It'd be amazing if we found big foot and realized big foot was looking for another kind of big foot. It's an endless quest. But it'd be horrible. But I got to. So again, I would say, you know, it devalues all the great mysterious things that are here right now that we don't bother to search for because there's not a story and it doesn't elicit this. Dude, I'm, you know, I'm on a higher plane because I believe there's big foot and UFOs. And, you know, it's like, no, it's like if they if they're there, they're fine without me. I don't need to go search for them. And this is actually I got to say, man, this is like if of all the people that I would think UFOs would have attempted to contact. Right. I could see you being one of them. And I like I wanted to ask you these years of touring and these years of being in this incredibly rare form of existence, which is to be a rock star in this amazing band. Surely you have seen some supernatural happenings out there on the road. Is there never been a moment where you're like, what the fuck? Luckily, we've been going for a long, long time. Yes, you know, and the very first time that we took my my dad's old giant Plymouth with the with the trailer on the back, the very first time we went to LA, we were on the border right as Arizona turns into California. And there was this bizarrely strange, blobby thing hovering way up in the dark sky. And for some reason, we were getting gas for doing something. And we marveled at this thing by ourselves on the side of the road. Like, what is that? Yeah, convinced. Well, you know, maybe this is a UFO or whatever. Yeah, because we don't know what it is. It's a UFO to us. Yeah. And we thought about it, thought about it. You know, back then there wasn't an Internet, but you'd look at pictures and you'd see if anybody had said anything about it. Time went by and well, nothing was said about it. 2002, we were going to rehearsals with Beck. We're walking through a little part of where I forget is Southern LA through where the studio was. We're going and we stop on a bridge and this same thing. Is in the sky and we all stop and Beck stopped with us. I remember us thinking, we're going to die. A UFO is going to explode over our heads. We're going to die with Beck right on this bridge. Cool. He was included. I think he started to run away like, fuck it, I'm not dying with flaming lips. But anyway, this thing and Michael and I were the only ones. We had seen the thing, you know, 25 years earlier. We remembered that's that thing that we saw. And it was coming. We didn't really know what it was. It didn't end up exploding and killing us. But we went to rehearsal and we wondered, what was it? So the next day on the front of the page of USA Today is a picture of this thing. And it's a missile that's being tested way out 300 miles off the coast. But it's so big of a tale and so tall that we're in the dark. And its reflection is still in the light that the sun is getting. You know, we're in the dark, but it's so far. Yeah, yeah. And it looks like it's just sitting there, but kind of moving and just a missile. Twenty five years later, what we thought was UFO because of the sustained curiosity, we found out it was just a missile being tested. No aliens, no, but still. What a fascinating, insane, cool thing. Yeah, that this this and it's still fascinating. And I'm relieved that it wasn't UFO. Now I have some explanation. Oh, I know what that is. That's cool. Why are you relieved? Because it's it's a mystery that I thought, well, what is that? Why did we see it? No one knows that that is. Well, people see it all the time. They just don't remark about it because it's normal to them. If you live out there, you see them. Oh, they're testing a missile out there. No big deal. Night after night, touring night after night, right, running into so every part of the entire spectrum of humanity. No, not really. No. You mean like people you mean like a truck stops or people are shows and all this traveling, right? You've never once crossed paths with a being or a group of people. You're thought, whoa, these people are kind of enlightened or this seems like some kind of advanced person. You've never like it just feels like with a no, no. I mean, I mean, I mean, we run into people all the time, but we think or man, they're they're cool, they're smart and they're man. They're they're but not like they're from outer space. You've never had any kind of contact with anything or you're like, I don't know, man, I feel like night after night, I'm going on stage. I'm Wayne Coyne. I'm going on stage. I'm getting in a ball. I'm rolling out into the audience. I mean, I from what I've read, you know, you don't take psychedelics. And you've never you know, I've taken a few things. I mean, but it doesn't it doesn't agree with me. I get too worried and too paranoid and too. Yeah, sure. Too. I lose too much of my responsibility. Somewhere in the course of the touring in there, I think I would start getting a little wobbly up in the. No, no, you wouldn't. No, you did. You'd be fun. You'd like it. It's it's not that it's not like that. I mean, it's not like that to us. We get to play our music and never found yourself like like you. Have you ever struggled? You've never struggled with some kind of like Messiah complex or some sense of if this is happening to me. No, no, no, no, I mean, not, you know, not since I've been like more than eight years old or something. You know what I mean? I was like, no. I mean, I'm not being out there in the world. I mean, we're we want to play our music. I mean, we want to visit places we want to, you know, we want people to come to our shows. They're not just drawn to us. I mean, we we put out records. We advertise. We make up, you know, we we say, hey, we're here. Yeah, you like us. Got you. It's not the other way around. Gotcha. You know, we're not just there and everybody shows up magically. That's incredible, man. I love it. You this is amazing. You are such a focus. But I think that's great. I think that's the way it should be. You know, I mean. Well, I think that's why you get to be what you are, is because you've maintained this state of equanimity. But you have maintained balance. Well, well, that's thank you for saying that. I still think it's I think that's better that we're all in it together. I'm not trying to say, you know, what I do is more important than you. It's just like, man, you need to be entertained just like I do. We'll entertain you tonight. Yeah, one night it can be somebody else. Yeah, it can be Beyonce or Fugazi or whoever you like. You know, let's do it, you know, go see their movie, go see their band. I'm just here tonight and it's great. I don't I don't need to be a messiah or anything. You know, I can be the messiah tonight and tomorrow night. Beyonce's but can be the messiah. That sounds like a great world. That's exactly the world I want to be. I know, I think we're already in that world. You know, we are in that world. There's a new title for the for the podcast. Beyonce's but isn't the messiah is the new messiah. Beyonce's but is the new messiah for tonight. For tonight. OK, wait, let's cut because we have two great titles. One of them is don't feel sorry for Bigfoot. The other is Beyonce's but is the messiah. We're going to have to do a vote on this. Yeah, yeah, Beyonce's but is the new messiah for tonight. See, I think that makes it a little bit. It's important, but, you know, we'll wake up and there'll be another one tomorrow. You know, I mean, my my if I have an overall theory of life is that, you know, everything that we do is is like a meal, you know. You, you know, you can't read about a meal. You people like to do that, but only because it's leading to the meal. You know, you can't read. You can't look at pictures of a meal and be, oh, I've done it. You know, you can't. There's it has to be the real thing. Right. But there's a lot of things in life that we don't know that we don't know. Oh, it's got to be the real thing. You know, so you have to it's like seeing Beyonce's but is like a meal. It's going to be good tonight, but you're going to wake up tomorrow. You're going to be hungry tomorrow. You can't just eat once and now I'm done. You have to eat again. And if you eat the same thing over and over, you might get curious about other things you might eat. Why not? It's wonderful, you know, or accidentally find something else. But for now, the meal you're having right now. Is the greatest meal you're ever going to have to me when sometimes when I get to go to sleep and you know you're tired, but you're aware enough that you're falling asleep. Yes. It's the greatest sleep ever. Yes. And you know, you're going to do it tomorrow night and the next night. And if you're lucky for the next hundred years or whatever. But if you don't, if that meal is just I'm eating it just to fucking get done with my shit and get on with it. If I'm sleeping just to wake up and get back to my shit. And if I'm spending time with you, but it's just to get back to my shit, it's like you're on the you're already you're already being buried, brother. This meal, this time with you, this is my I'm this is my greatest meal. Yeah. And that I think is the truth, you know, you can only eat one meal at a time. You can only sleep in one bed at a time. You know, Wayne, but unlike you, I mean, you maybe have sex with several women at one time. I don't know, not me. I've never had that's another podcast. That is Wayne tonight. You're the Messiah for me, man. And you for me and you for me. No, and you for me right now, I agree. Beautiful. That is, that's the truth. And that's that's that's that's all we need. Thank you so much. Men, you I see why people like your podcast. Oh, brother. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for listening, everybody.

135^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 429: Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2021-03-27^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Welcome, this is the Dunkin' Trestle Family Hour podcast. Big thank you to Heart Thongs, the metaphysical energy thong for supporting this episode of the DTFH. If you're having difficulty numbing down your heart, try a heart thong. They come in all shapes and sizes and are all made of dehydrated demon hides. Guaranteed to keep you from feeling those pangs of compassion that really can ruin a person's day. Neither the DTFH or Dunkin' Trestle is responsible for any of the wild animal attacks that have been happening across the country. My dear loves, my heart, it's all mushy today. It's all open unexpectedly. Usually it like is sealed shut like an old crypt, a cursed sarcophagus down in the bottom of some decrepit shit pyramid in a dark alien landscape and some horrible dream that old sailor is having as his ship begins to sink into a stinking dead briny sea filled with skeleton sailors mocking him as he breathes his last breaths. But today, I don't know, it just opened up unexpectedly. Somebody sent me a nice Instagram message about their dog they just lost and then I started thinking about Fox and my Chihuahua who I lost a few months ago and then just a classic grief meteor smashing into the unprotected imaginary heart planet that I spend a lot of time trying to cover up in various metaphysical energetic forms. Most of them metaphysical leather thongs. Did I just say that I wrap a metaphysical leather thong around my heart planet to keep myself from getting shaken up by grief meteors? Yes. Which is why you should consider using a metaphysical heart thong from Jerry's Heart Thongs. Go to Jerry'sHeartThongs.com, use offer code Duncan791 and you in a dream will have a metaphysical heart thong delivered to you by a mermaid in an ocean of come. Today's guest is one of my best friends and I'm so lucky to have him as a friend because the truth is this thing, whatever you want to call it, spirituality, trying to be a better person, self transformation, almost every single way of describing the process of maybe not being such a festering boil on the carapace of reality sounds cheesy. But however you want to put it, part of the thing is you get confused. You're supposed to get confused. That's part of it. It is confusing. I mean, this is confusing. This thing that we're in right now, it's confusing. Think of all the forms you're going to have to fill out over the next. However many years you're going to be alive. Literally, a book, like a giant book of stupid forms, you're going to have to fill out and sign various stupid forms, forms to get into an overprotected dog park, forms to get out of traffic tickets, weird forms when someone you love dies. One of the most humiliating things the demiurge tosses our way is that after you lose someone you love, you're going to be filling out fucking forms. You thought this was going to be some mystical time of beautiful morning. No, you're going to fill out 600 different forms. You're going to have to write, you're not going to have the right check for the undertaker form after form. The point is, it's confusing here. It's confusing. Human penises are shrinking because of pollution. There's just so much already happening just in the material level of this universe that it's going to confuse you, then add to that this weird idea of meditation or the possibility that you're not your body. Come on, it's bonkers beyond bonkers. You're not supposed to go at it alone. This is why there's classes and all these different things, calculus, you want to learn to knit, you want to learn to solder, you're going to do better with someone around. The identical thing is true when it comes to whatever you want to call this thing. For me, it's like I just want to avoid as many embarrassing explosions of selfish anger as I can over the last half of my life. For me, that's why I need a spiritual community. One member of that community is today's guest, Ragu Marcus, though membership is open to everyone and you all are members, even if you don't know it. The point is, it's like you need a palette cleanser. You need some kind of grounding mechanism. For the type of personality that I have, this grounding mechanism, it's not going to happen in the presence of somebody, a positivity fascist. It's not going to happen in the presence of somebody who thinks that any omission of verbal dismay is a bad sign. I'm talking about the spiritual hall monitors that if the moment you say something like, fuck this shitty bullshit fucking traffic, they'll be like, but the traffic teaches us that shit. That's not going to work for me, though I feel like I've inflicted that on people I love in weak moments. The point is, it's nice to have people like Ragu who have this incredible authenticity that includes within it aspects that maybe you wouldn't say, that's definitely, that's some Dalai Lama stuff there. But also within the authenticity and the reality that you will hear in this conversation, something else comes out, something beautiful and sweet and full of love. And the Ram Dass community has as a nexus, this being that showed up called Nirm Kroli Baba. This was Ram Dass' guru and Ragu's guru and having met many people who actually met this person, it's interesting because you can kind of see this being spirit in all of them. And I feel like anytime I get a chance to have the kind of conversation you're about to hear with Ragu, it's like I get a little brush with that person. And I need those kinds of brushes. I get emails from y'all, I got an email from somebody, forgive me if I'm calling you out, I didn't ask permission, but I got this lovely email, I'll change the drugs. I got this lovely email from someone who was smoking Garvarius Melvana Bex, this wild drug that is gathered from the pollen of cricket infested tulips. And in that state of being super high that happens to last the exact same amount of time as DMT, he encountered Nirm Kroli Baba. And just so y'all know where I'm at, when I read a thing like that, I don't think, wow, that's really lovely, I think that's so wonderful. I think, what the fuck, why don't I ever get that experience? That's just where I'm at. So I need it, I love it anytime I get. Just the slightest fragrance of this wonderful being that had one of his incarnations in India. And I think now is existing within the connection between people like Raghu and Ramdas. And somehow in that connection, in that conversation, it's like, it just appears. So enjoy this chat, if you like Raghu Marcus, you should check out his wonderful podcast, Mind Rolling. And you can also check out the Love, Serve, Remember Foundation's website, love-serve-remember.org, because Raghu is tirelessly planning all kinds of wonderful things via that network and via the Ramdas Foundation, the Love, Serve, Remember Foundation. So we're going to jump right into this conversation with dear Raghu. But first, this. 828-579-9529. That's my Mint Mobile number.

But that number I just gave you, you can call me on my Mint Mobile phone and you should know that having activated my phone with Mint Mobile, it worked perfectly. And it happened really fast.

I got an email at lavenderhour at gmail.com from a listener who was recently attacked by a wild raccoon. At the time, she was not a Patreon subscriber. And I got to tell you, she sent some pictures and this little fella ripped her up. There were deep gashes and terrible claw marks and she had to get rabies shots. I'm not saying there's any connection between her not being a subscriber to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and these wild animal attacks. Because that would be almost like I was threatening my dear listeners or saying, you know, if you don't subscribe to the Patreon, there's probably an 80 to 90% chance of, especially this summer, the summer of blood, as they're calling it, a view getting attacked by a cute wild animal. Nothing larger than a raccoon, I would guess. I'm not sure. I'm not sure because there's no connection. That's all I'm saying is there's zero connection between these wild animal attacks that have been happening with great abundance and people who have yet to subscribe to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. It is interesting though that the subscribers haven't haven't been getting attacked. So that's curious to me and I wonder what that means. Regardless, I hope you'll check it out at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Subscribe. You can join us every Monday for our weekly meditation journey in a boredom.

Okay, friends, without further ado, let's dive into this wonderful conversation with Ragu Marcus. He helps run the Love Server Member Foundation. It's Ram Dass' foundation. He has a wonderful podcast called Mind Rolling, which even before you listen to this, just press pause and subscribe. He interviews people who live in caves. He has access to people who probably can teleport. And you should listen to these wonderful conversations he has with them on mind rolling. Also, all the links you need to find Ragu related content are going to be at dunkitrustle.com. And now welcome Ragu Marcus. Ragu Marcus It's the dunkitrustle film. Everyone were back like we never left. Back with my departed soulmate who left me here in California, Duncan Trussell. Hello, everybody. Hi, Ragu. Good to see you. Sorry. Same here, man. Everyone left everybody this year, didn't we? That's what I realized in LA was I'm not seeing anyone. Everyone's zooming. What's the idea? Who cares? I could be on Mars. Wouldn't make much of a difference. Yeah, right. That's true. Although hopefully we're heading in the right direction, but Polly Annish kind of maybe thinking. Aaron has given up in the sense of she's noticing that I've been saying every few months, I think this is the end of it. And she's like, come on, Duncan. You just keep saying that. Eventually you're going to be right. Eventually we will be right. All of us. But it won't be. There is no back to normal. So because normal is gone. Well, that's to me that you mentioned that yesterday on the phone. But that's a funny thing to even talk about is like that idea are the normal before the pandemic wasn't normal. You know what I mean? When was it normal? Like at what point was worth things back to normal? You know, like you go back, some people say 2012, actually they were right. Because if you look at the world after 2012 and before 2012 to completely different worlds, because prior to 2012, that's the, you know, the internet is in more of an embryonic phase. You trace that back to pre cell phone, you know, when answering machines were high tech. When was it normal? I'm saying is like, at what point was this normal? How do we go back to normal? Yeah, that is absolutely 100% true. You know, but I'm thinking though is for everybody out there, Duncan now has two small children. And I've got a couple of other friends, mutual to Duncan and I, that are part of the community that have either getting another one or already have a couple. And every time I'm with, I was just with our friend John Fann at the other day. He's, you know, he's having a new baby coming along as well. And I said, I think I must have said something about the, yeah, there's no going back to the normal. What's the new normal? But really it led me to start thinking about the way in which you guys particularly need to nurture these children in a way that they're going to have a planet that is livable. Let's start there. And, and they're the hope. Right. You are raising the hope for humanity. Wow. Right. That's cool. Yeah. Is it not true? A lot of pressure to put, you know what's so funny is I remember asking Ramdas about some, you know, schmaltzy question about, how do I be a dad? And his response was, I'm having, you know, my son, I said something about my son. He's like, first of all, remember it's, that's the role that those are all roles, you know, son role, dad role. He was so good at breaking it down. And so, and that little bit of magic that you just cast there and that spell, we've created a role, haven't we, for my son, which is savior of the known world. And also we've created a pretty intense role for me, which is to some kind of like, I've got to like, tend to the messiah over here. And, you know what I mean? Like, I've got to raise a messiah now, Ragu. Well, no, two of them know. Now, you know, you keep just referring to one, but there's two. Yes. I know. You know what? Yes. Dune is still in, you know, the, yes. Yes. He's still beaming down and it's beautiful. But both of the, you know, I think maybe part of, part of the shift is figuring out ways to let our children be themselves outside of our expectation. It was hard enough. Fuck, my dad wanted me to play football. Now I'm going to want my kids to save the environment. You know what I mean? Like, and football, I wasn't going to do. And certainly God knows the lot. If you really do want your children to be this thing or that thing, don't act like it. You know what I mean? They'll both end up being like lumberjacks. Yeah. No. Okay. What I'm talking about, I'm talking about what I hear of spraying away the, what? You know what's so funny about this spray that I just sprayed is this was in the bathroom of our old house and you would spray after you poop. And now every time I sprayed, it just reminds me of poop because the two have paired in my mind. Yeah, right. That's great. No, what I'm talking about is the, what his holiness has said repeatedly, the Dalai Lama over the years, over many, many years. And that is humanity will be saved by our mothers. Okay. He said, I am, as you see me, I am as I am as a result of my mother's loving compassion. And the more that that can be expressed as we go forward, then that is what's going to be, he didn't say saving grace, but that is what is going to be the deepest affection, affectation rather on our, on everything, the polarization, the planet, the discrepancy of rich and poor, all of it is by virtue of this development of compassion. So that's really what I'm talking about. And that is really what is happening in your little sphere. And in the spheres of some of the other people that we're quite friendly with. So I think that, I mean, that is, look at him. It's obvious, right? He is an obvious example of the, of what got passed on to him by his mother, the compassionate, loving kindness. So, yeah, I think that's what we're talking about more than trying to groom somebody to be the greatest environmentalist that ever lived. And no, it's just compassion, love, awareness. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, yeah, I, I, so far, I have been attempting to, I just go back to like Chogyam Trumpa talking about the gift you, the best gift you can give your kids is to be fully in the moment with him. So when I'm with Forrest, I try to stay off the phone and I try to just be, it's, and it doesn't work a lot of the time, you know, it's hard to be in the moment with a toddler, you know, because like, you got to keep them from killing themselves or you're running in front of a car. But it's also not hard because they invite you into that realm where the new, the realm of novelty, everything's new and it's beautiful. And, and from their perspective, the world is not fucked up. From their perspective, the, the, the world is perfect and, and wild and new. And so, yeah, I, you know, for me, it's some kind of elemental practice as much as I can of being in the moment. And then also of like, trying to practice something Trudy Goodman told me when I was telling her, Aaron and I have been fighting and feeling really guilty about that, fighting in front of him, which happens, and especially during the pandemic, you know, it's just, but, but not trying to like make excuses for getting in fights in front of the kids. But Aaron and I discussed it. Should we hide fighting from him? Should we have our disagreements like when they've gone to bed? And, but what Trudy said was, it's not the fighting. They need to see you make up. It's learning that conflict happens. Sometimes argument, sometimes, you know, uncomfortable. Sometimes not good arguments happen. But if they can see that resolution happens, then they're going to learn it's not the end of the world to get into conflict with somebody. And it's not, and it's just part of being alive and living with people. Because I think that's one of the things that some people had to deal with the fact that their parents were miserable with each other, but we're never fighting. They didn't know what was wrong or what was going on and it was being hidden. You know what I mean? Whereas like seeing conflict and then it's hopeful resolution. I think that's something we can teach our kids. But, you know, again, for me, as far as any of the utopian bullshit aside, it's one of the brilliant things Trump or Rinpoche said that I also hold close to my heart is whether you whatever your ism may be, you know, socialism, communism, whatever your particular utopian path forward to global harmony. If you really want to impact the planet, then find a way to be harmonious in your own house. And that to me was a summation of it all. The E equals MC squared of what I think a lot of the environmentalists who are rightfully upset and rightfully freaking out are looking for it, which is it's not enough to ask for the collective to do something. We need a pragmatic methodology that on the subjective level, the individual can utilize in the moment and day to day, which is OK, you fucked up. You got in a fight. You got something you and your wife or your brother and your sister or whatever having disagreements. OK, that's the world. That's the world. You're just experiencing the world because that's what's happening on the macro. OK, well, that's great because that means you're like a little beaker. You're all the troubles of the world in this tiny little pixel. Now, what can you do to harmonize this? And, you know, not to keep I'm going to stop this right now. But what I've noticed is there is it seems to be that trying to be right just doesn't seem to be a very good strategy when it comes to finding harmony. I know, I know. Righteousness is the is the is the last thing that goes. I mean, one of the last things that goes. My dear darlings, we live in the age of Kali Yuga, the age of disintegration and entropy, which means everything is getting way more uncomfortable than it was when our parents were sleeping soundly in their non pandemic world of comfort and safety. We don't have that anymore. But one thing I can always count on for comfort is my purple pillow. That's because purple is comfort reinvented. Only purple has the grid, a stretchy gel material that's amazingly supportive for your back and legs while cushioning your shoulders, neck and hips. I don't know how it does it. It's just fantastic. Of course, I only have a purple pillow. I don't have a purple mattress. I wish I did. The pillow, though, is a go to clutcher. I hug it. I sleep on it. It's fantastic. And that's because of how it's designed. The grid doesn't trap air. Air actually circulates and flows through it. So you'll never overheat. The grid bounces back as you move and shift unlike memory foam, which remembers everything. That's why memory foam has craters and divots and is inevitably bitter. This purple pillow I have, friends, it truly is like something out of the Starship Enterprise. I know you've got mattress fatigue. You've heard everyone yapping, especially about pillow technologies. And I know you probably have a type of classical conditioning from other unsavory, fascist pillow vendors out there. But I'm telling you, this pillow is amazing. I really love it. You should try it. You can try your purple mattress risk-free right now with free shipping and returns. Financing is available, too. Purple really is comfort for an uncomfortable world. Right now, you'll get 10% off any order of $200 or more. Go to purple.com slash Duncan 10 and use promo code Duncan 10.

I think I told you when we started chatting the other day that I had done a podcast with people who are deeply involved with environmental activism. They have a thing called full ecology. It's worth listening to, actually. But their thing was, and this goes along with everything in terms of the tradition that we come out of through Ram Dass' lens, you've got to work inside yourself to think that you can add anything to any issue. They went on about this, and it really made sense about the way in which we are dealing with ourselves and the way in which we are relating with ourselves has so much to do with how we relate to the most simple of things, like what's going on in our very, very closed environment, and how are we just looking at everything that we do from moment to moment, the way we might ignore something, we ignore that inside ourselves. We are ignoring and not paying attention, and then we're ignoring and not paying attention outside ourselves. I loved it because it really was so holistic. I think, and again, I have had some environmentalists on my podcast who are legitimately terrified, and so I understand people who work at NASA and understand the structure of carbon and the tragedy of that shape in relation to the planet and the kind of fear you can only get from deeply looking into a thing, and also the passion behind trying to get people to change in the real legitimate anger and frustration when you realize nobody's changing. I'm telling them exactly what is the culmination of not just my own lifetime of research, but the culmination of the lifetimes of so many different scientists. Wasn't this why we wanted science? Isn't this why we wanted science so we could say, look, we have to change, and if we don't, you don't understand, but nobody's changing, and so why? What's the problem here? I think one of the problems is that in the messaging of, oh yeah, you don't even understand, and like right now, if we just stopped everything and one of us stopped emitting carbon, we're still fucked. See, that's part of the message. It's like, oh, now you don't understand. Like, we're fucked. Like, we're fucked. So in that messaging, suddenly you feel completely disempowered, and humans are all about power. There's no point. So then at that point, we sink into nihilism or denial, and so nothing happens. So the idea is we've got to find a way on the subjective level for people to feel that their positive participation in the world is more than just pissing into the ocean. And otherwise, forget it. There's nothing's going to happen. So I think that a lot of people are working on those fronts in a lot of different ways, which is we need to get people to actually really understand how powerful they are as an individual, and not in some bullshit way, but you just don't know. The problem is you really can't understand how deeply you're impacting things around you, which is something I've been very interested in lately. Studying quantum physics and the craziness that's happening on the quantum level of the universe, but from an ecological perspective, it's a really interesting thing. Anyway, the point is I think what Ram Dass was so good at is he... Sorry for this tangent, but we are the quantum level of society. You're a quirk. I'm an electron. Aaron's a neutrino or whatever, but the point is we're all part of this beautiful supersymmetry called society, and we're witnessing the symmetry in the things that appear on the world stage, the big, the calving of the ice sheets, the wars, the appearance of demagogues or tyrants. That's the supersymmetry, the manifestation of the collective and the negative, but the implication of that is that the opposite is also possible, and that's where you get a Ram Dass. That's where you get a Dalai Lama. That's where you get a Neem Krolibaba, which is that if there's these tyrant possibilities and war possibilities, then the opposite must also be true. That's part of the symmetry. And if it's not true, then we're doomed anyway. We're doomed because it's endless war forever until the environment collapses, where there's a thing, it's opposite must exist. So my point is we have to find a way to engage people in an optimistic worldview that isn't delusional. And I think that what you and I have been discussing over now, it's going on to a couple, three years. This whole thing about the complete grasping and belief in the me that we live with on a day-to-day basis. I do think it's a really great way to start a conversation along the lines of what you have just mentioned. How do we help to create a space of optimism, subjective optimism, where we believe that there is a way to positively affect all of these different very difficult situations from the environment to the racial injustice to the inequities, economic inequities and all of it. And I came across, and I think I told you this the other day, excuse me, I came across a talk by Krishnamurti who happens to live around the corner for me right now. I mean, his vibration, his Krishnamurti center here in Ojai. And this talk was with a, I don't know what denomination he was, he was a priest. They never said, there was nothing on the YouTube thing that suggested who he is or who he was, whatever. And we'll put up a link though with it in the show notes here so people can watch it themselves. But I did, there were some fabulous things that basically the whole thing started out with, is it possible to completely empty the mind of the me? That was the premise, right? Is it possible? We can sort of pick this apart a little bit and add our own thing to it. Is there a process to rid the quote unquote me? And you know him, I mean people, if you don't, if you have not ever heard Krishnamurti or read any of his things, he was really a spiritual maverick in a way. He just, he put down all of it. And there's a, oh God, I guess I got to tell this story. Krishnamurti used to travel in the foothills of the Himalayas where Nim Karoli Baba was. And where we spent a lot of time with him in a place called Kenchi. And so they knew each other. And one day he came to the ashram and our mentor, K. C. Tuari, who we're just finishing a wonderful documentary film on, called Brilliant Disguise, because he was really a powerful yogi, dressed as a school teacher, a headmaster of a school. So he happened to be there this one day that Krishnamurti came. And Maharaji said to Tuari, okay, I'm going to take him over to the river. You get on, you know, just get a little bit away, you know, but you'll be there. So he sat on a rock and Krishnamurti and Maharaji sat down. Krishnamurti started regaling Nim Karoli Baba, Maharaji, saying, you're like a wandering mendicant, sadhu. What are you doing with all these ashrams? Look at all this attachment that you've created, like that. Not exactly those words, but pretty much. And you know what Maharaji said? You're right. You're absolutely right. But it's the way I get my grub. That's how I get my grub, he said. And then you looked at Krishnamurti and he said, gee, don't you go around the world giving him talks and lectures? That's the way you get your grub, right? Yeah. So they had this phenomenal conversation, right? So Krishnamurti, who did not believe in gurus or anything like that, this was, you know, he was the bottom line. He made Zen seem like a wild bhakti fest actually. Yeah. So what he said here is that there is no process to eliminate the me. Then he started to describe the me is everything that is going through that brain, is the me. And he said, so he gets into it a little bit further. And he says, if I say by me, and I'm going to throw that me out, it's still that me throwing the me out. So this is where he goes, you know, with, can the conscious mind examine the unconscious me and expose it? I pose that to you. Can the conscious mind examine the unconscious? So awareness brings in the hall of the Buddhist concepts of mindfulness and awareness. Can it expose that? Can it? And you get a first crack at it. Well, the discussion of me is really interesting and it has popped up with some friends. Also, we're talking about the whole me thing. Oh, yeah? Yeah, because, well, I was having a conversation with one of my friends. They were asking something along the lines of, I feel like I'm too afraid to jump into the abyss. And it reminded me of a question I asked Ram Dass in one of the retreats. I just put it in a different way, which is like, you seem like someone who jumped off the diving board. And I feel like I've camped out on the edge. And he got this big smile and he said, there's no diving board. Remember that? There's no jumping. It's all a, you know, you're creating the structure. You're creating that in your head. And the abyss when we were laughing about it, because I was, you know, that saying like, when you look at the abyss, the abyss stares back. And I was thinking probably the abyss is looking at you thinking, fuck, look at that scary abyss. You know what I mean? That's a terrifying abyss. And like, so in the conversation of me, really, it's a kind of like sweet thing in the sense that you're excited to imagine that you're encumbered by this thing. Because if you are encumbered by the thing, well, it must be real, right? And then if it's real, then I must have some solidity. And then if I have some solidity, I've got a me. You know, that's the whole separate me. Right. So no matter which way you go at it, which is the, I've got to get rid of my me or I'm going to be me. You know, both of these things, if the central premise is, well, what the fuck is the me? Yeah. Okay, I'm going to give you his explanation, his definition of the me. Okay. The me is the entire conceptual ideation of oneself. It's the content of my, the entire content of my consciousness, thinking mind, emotions, feelings, all of it. In this sense is it's the entire content. And as long as the content of my consciousness remains, there will be separation between you and me. And that is the key. I mean, when I heard this, I was like, okay, that's the key of what you and I have been talking about in terms of what there's nothing that can happen in any way. And I mean just simple things like being happy. Being able to be in a relationship, not just with a wife or husband, but in relationship to people, nothing can happen until this is transformed. And now it just, you know, and it doesn't happen. And I like what he said, that the idea that there's a process like that's how we've been talking, you know, when we've been putting together the ideas for the, from the movie of me to the movie of us, we've been talking as if there's a starting process and an ending. You know, there's an end, there's a beginning and an end. And what he's saying, which is really fascinating, it is not about process at all. It is about perspective. That's how he ends up with this thing. Yeah. Blue Choo's tablets help men achieve harder, stronger erections to combat all forms of erectile dysfunction.

I do think it's fun. I think that's one of the cool and infuriating things about Christian Emerty. He really does make himself out to be some kind of authority, and he seems so charismatic, but it's like, okay, that's just because you said that's what the meat was. Well, wait, no, no, no. I mean, we have our own experience. Is not your experience that the content, the story you tell yourself is content, the way in which you look at other people and project them to be one thing or another based on memories or whatever. That's all true. It's kind of like Christian Emerty drawing a circle like in the sky. That's the sky. It's like, you know what I mean? I do feel like it's a funny, you know, this is from my own exploration of the me stuff. Playing around with Chogym Trumper Rinpoche, who there's another like wonderful encounter between Christian Emerty and Trumper Rinpoche where Christian Emerty is doing his like thing. And, you know, again, I'm not trying to take sides in something because both of these are like what I'm looking at. I'm like, so what is this where spirituality was in those days? Was this what it was like? Cage matches between spiritual superstars confronting each other over like this stuff? You know, even with even with like young Ramdas and Trumper Rinpoche, these two young spiritual stars, and it's like, what's going on here? Like these confrontations between, you know, I'm going to go to Neem Karoli Baba and say you shouldn't be doing this thing. It's like, because of so many stories of this with Christian Emerty, I have a, though I do have a lot of respect for him, his intelligence, his intellect. I always get an empty feeling from him on a good way. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. What do you like? Some kind of spiritual arm wrestler going around from ashram to ashram, trying to get like in some embarrassing ego competition with spiritual teachers. It's an embarrassment. And because of that, for someone who is so wrapped up in challenging me's with his me, it's hard for me to take anything he says. Okay, you got to get that. Yeah, but now that's exactly what this is about content of consciousness. Who cares where he's coming from? He, in my little belief system of advanced beings, et cetera, et cetera. There's not, to me, that's not, you know, not at the level of one like a Neem Karoli Baba that was no longer living in subjective anything. I mean, because you can even see in this talk where the priest says kind of catches him, okay, so you're saying you should be doing this. You know, oh no, there's no doing anything. You know, he backs off and all of that. But you got to watch the Trump or Rinpoche one because Chokim Trump, I just sits there and like it's very quiet and just lets Christian Emerty do be Christian Emerty. And like it really seems to start rattling him because like he's like, his question to Trump or Rinpoche was something about why I had meditation to people's problems. What's this meditation thing? And so he's like, he like, it's just being very quiet and he's sitting there. He's not really answering the question, but he's in the moment with him and then it just rattles Christian Emerty because there's nothing to, he's looking for a fight. Yeah, but the, so anyway, so regardless, we're, you know, I'm creating a fake Christian Emerty and now I'm fighting with him. So I'm doing the same thing. Yeah, right. You're just, yeah, you're right, isn't it? Yeah, it's like part of it. But, but, but let's, but I'm sorry. One of the things Trump or Rinpoche said that I love is confusion is on the continuum of enlightenment and so, or a condition of enlightenment. So in other words, the problem with the me circumference, however you want to draw it is that what is the me happening inside of? And so, you know, this, this is where I think the mirror starts running into some real trouble in the sense that the, the, the, regardless of whether you, your me is your Twitter bio or, you know, the, your recollection of how your memories or how you tend to act in any given moment, you're always thwarted by the sort of non continuity of the damn thing. It doesn't, it's always changing. You're kind of making it up in the moment. That's the problem. And you're making it up. You're having to like, you're, you're adhering to some meanest thing. You know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? So it's like, Absolutely. But at the same, well, he calls the me is the mischief of the world because it's in living in separation. It's, it only is in, it's in fear of losing stuff. It's in hope of gaining its preferences, its choices, it's looking at people by virtue of how is that going to help me or not help me at the most subtle levels. You know, so it is mischief. And what, what does he think? Like it's a mistake? No, but we're going to get there. Okay. But I just wanted to kind of parse this a little bit. But just to say about Krishnamurti's, yes, he's a real brain. He's, you know, and he brings up stuff that's good to, good to go apart. I mean, it really is. He challenges everything. It's cool. Yeah. But, you know, and the rest of it, who cares? You know, his thing about, you don't need to do practice, meditate, you know, coming onto Trump or Rinpoche, but I mean, Trump, Trump or Rinpoche, you know, is a highly, highly advanced being was, is whatever. Whatever. And I would be taking that kind of advice in terms of the ways in which he discussed, you know, what meditation really is, is moving into the gap, for instance, between thoughts. And that is the way in which one can transform this deep grasping onto the story we tell ourselves, the me. But one of the things so that he advice is probably not the right word for him because there's no advice. There's nothing. But being honest. Otherwise, one tends to deceive oneself. So we did this whole thing with Ram Dass. My friend David Silver and I, who I started the mind rolling podcast with. Yes. And because I always felt like one of the biggest things I got from Ram Dass when I first met him and then all the way through the years was his ability for self honesty, not to bullshit himself. Yeah. That that was like, I got to say that's right at the top few, if I'm to say what I got from Ram Dass over all those years. That was right at the very top few. Yeah. The ability to do that because there's so much fear around being on, which is why I wanted to do this, this whole journey with with you around the movie of me to the movie of us. And I've said this more than once to you. I was getting so sick of, you know, I had enough honesty, I thought, to see the sickness, the sickness, meaning the mischief that and I like that word mischief better than sickness in terms of the of the transparency of the motivations, which are so self interested and self cherishing and all of those great Buddhist terms. It just got to the point where got to do something. And in the doing of it between you and I over these last couple of years, probably more in the doing of it, we have come to be able to maybe offer something that allows us to be clear about how the effect of living in this kind of separate reality. Yeah. It's affecting us so deeply and it's affecting everything around us. And so yeah, self honesty is a is a primary way in which we can really look at ourselves and not run away. Well, yeah. Yeah. I think that that looking at yourself self knowing that's the. Yeah. That's the start start of it. I mean, again, like not to keep beating up on Krishna Murthy, but come on. Yeah. He's like the grumpy. He can take it. He's a. I'll run over to his center and after this, he just seemed every single thing. I'm sorry. All the Krishna Murthy fans out there. I don't. I remember it's just to me. It's just like, I got to go with my instincts here. And I think the reason whenever you see whenever I like leave some encounter with Krishna Murthy, just thinking like, oh, no, thanks. It's versus Ramdas is because Krishna Murthy is of course, he's going to use the word mischief. He's like a get out of my yard kid person. You know what I mean? Mischief. Whereas Ramdas, he invites you to look at yourself like it's a flower. Look at all that karma. Look at that and love it. It's not looking at yourself like, oh, this mischief here. Oh, this mistake of the universe. Oh, this aberration and the great cosmic everythingness that I am. Whereas Krishna Murthy is like, ah, the mischief of the world. Uh, get out of town, Krishna Murthy. No, thanks. I like the because, because let's, if we really are going to be honest, let's talk about, if we really are, let's talk about that. Come on. Let's talk about that moment when you've lost control and you've become your worst you. Maybe it's in the moment. Maybe it's the repercussion afterwards when you find yourself sitting by yourself, feeling all of it. And I'm not saying the guilt or the shame, but also the righteousness and the power and all of it mixing together and the mournfulness and the sadness, but in that moment where you weren't Ramdas or Krishna Murthy or whoever you imagine you might be in some incarnation, but we're actually you, you, you, you encounter truth. And when you're looking at it afterwards, you're not seeing it like, oh, that's who I want to be. But if you for a second don't judge it. You're like, this is my karma. This is who I am right now for real. And it's, it isn't right. It's not good or it doesn't, it is mischievous or it doesn't fit into the idea of a harmonious world, but it's real. And that's where I'm at here, not whatever the fuck I thought I was, but no, this is you. This is me for real, this density, the anger, the, the, you know, the potential to cause untold pain to those around me, the potential to lose everything and all of it. Those moments, I think it's worth noting that that thing is very, very powerful and that thing is very, is not all bad. In fact, I don't know if it's bad at all. It's just is, it just is. It just is. There's no bad or good. It just is. That's it. So when Krishna Murthy is applying mischief or terms like that to the damn thing, I think it, to me, it represents more of a bad mood than some like assessment of the thing. And I don't think it's going to help anything. Yeah, but I think it, but to me, it's just tone. I mean, you who've been doing podcasts forever than me, when I learned this, when I was doing radio way back in the day, it's all about tone. And, you know, I can say, for instance, you know, when something goes awry and I see it and I can, I can say, gee, there's mischievous me happening again. I can say it in a way that it is a guilt, shame, judgmental and so on. Or I can say it in a way, and this is how the difference between Krishna Murthy, probably what you're trying to say in Ram Dass is have a sense of humor about it. Yeah. Oh, there's that mischievous little guy again. He's just trying to hold on, et cetera, et cetera. So I really think it's in the tone. Now, where this comes round to is interesting because where he came around to it in this dialogue that you have with this priest was around perspective, that that was the entire game changer. And it made me think, okay, so what are we talking about? We're talking about, you know, we've been using Ram Dass as our centerpiece here, somebody who was very much human and very much able to let go of the me in the moment. And you, when I first brought you to Ram Dass's house, I mean, you just were swimming in that. Yes. Where there was no necessity to be or not be anything and there was no judgment. There was nothing but just a spacious quality of a total acceptance. Yes. And he was able to do that. But the perspective, so like I just mentioned this tonal thing around the word mischief. Tonally, it can be just a completely bullshit, judgmental asshole thing. Or tonally, it can be a humorous, spacious thing. Yeah. So what's the perspective? So the perspective and Ram Dass brought this out the last maybe 10 years he was in Maui. Right? I think you were there for most of the last 10 years and loving awareness. Yeah. And that was the perspective he was saying you easily can take a few breaths into the center of your being, into the center of your chest and move that consciousness out of the me story, into the unity story. And from there, you can laugh about all of it and not take yourself so seriously, self serious. Yeah. You don't aren't judging yourself or anybody else. You're not moving towards the preference to be comfy or pushing away the tough stuff in life. Your perspective is the key. And this is what he ended up saying this as well, Krishnamurti. I'm defending Krishnamurti now against you because you have defiled this extraordinary philosophical saint. That's what he did to everybody else. You're allowed. He gave us all permission to do that. To me, the idea of unconditional positive regard, Carl Rogers, Rejarian therapy, because he couldn't, I think when Carl Rogers came up with the term unconditional positive regard, he knew he couldn't say love and be respected by academics, so he had to come up with another word. I don't know him. Carl Rogers, I'm okay. You're okay. Rejarian? Oh yeah, I've heard that, but I don't know the name. One of the great stories that they told about Carl Rogers when I was in school was that it stuck with me. And it's what Ram Dass was so, that spaciousness that you're talking about, and it's what apparently Neem Karoli Baba did, and I guess you could say Ram Dass is a reflection of that spaciousness. But some kid was about to get basically put into like a juvenile detention facility because he was misbehaving so much, but I think it was a very young kid. So it didn't make, it was like too young to be this like out of control and everyone had tried everything. And so Carl Rogers had them bring the kid to him, and this kid walks into his office, the way Rogers describes this kid, looking at him as like, this is a kid who's been to, God knows how many therapists already pissed off that he's got to go to another one, doesn't give a shit about any of this. And sitting on Carl Rogers desk is like crayons and paper, and the kid says to him, I'm not something on the lines, I'm not going to fucking talk. And Carl Rogers said, Oh, you don't have to talk. And the kid just starts drawing for the whole hour. Carl Rogers just sits there trying to hold a space of unconditional positive regard for this poor kid who everybody was trying to change. Everybody was saying mischief, mischief, mischief, you better be better, you better be this or that. And suddenly he's in the presence of someone who's like, just do your thing as you are right now. The kid comes back, same thing comes back, starts talking a little bit. And then as the story goes, the kid, all the teachers are like, what have you been doing? What he's a completely different person. And all that had happened was this genius was letting a child be themselves without with nothing. And it reminds me of this story. Ramdas tells about Neem Krolibaba where he, maybe it's transmitted in a look or something, but within the look is, when do you want to, when do you want to do this? You want to keep reincarnating forever? That's okay. You can play the game for as long as you want. Or as you don't have to play it anymore, if you don't want to. I'm the thing that I'm the non-playing of the game, but however you want to do it. And within that spaciousness, that seems to be where the transformation happens. And from the quantum perspective, not to try to put into some pop science bullshit, it's really interesting the way the quantum level photons act as a particle and a wave simultaneously. And, but if you observe it, it pops into one or the other. But somehow the effect of observation forces it into either showing up as a particle, showing up as a wave. My physicist friends out there, I'm sorry if I fucked it up, but I spent some time watching various versions of this thing, which I believe is called the double slit experiment where you shoot light through and there's a way to show it as a wave or a particle. But a superposition is the name for when something is these two seemingly completely different things simultaneously. And so in thinking about meditation, non-judgmental awareness, unconditional positive regard, I feel like it's that moment of allowing yourself to simultaneously be a me, the particle of identity, and the great ocean of everythingness. These two things somehow existing simultaneously, meaning that we're not in the act of some demo crew trying to knock a building down anymore. It's just part of what we are. It's the particle. It's not mischievous. Is a particle of light mischievous? No, but it's not everything we are. We're also wait, wait, now come on. It's the mischievous part is I mean, not to harp on this, but the mischievous part is just the self interested part. Okay. It's the part of us that wants to protect our territory. It wants to take advantage in every way so that we can advance ourselves in whatever way that makes us feel more comfy, more powerful, all of that. So that's just that part. But you're absolutely right. This isn't about okay, we don't have that old me anymore. We're going to live in the undivided now and where we recognize where the particles and the waves are one and we're not seeing them separate. That's not a reality. We are human. We have got to operate. It's part of our humaneness on a day to day basis. Boy, there's a great story. I don't know if I can tell this though and it fits, but basically it's the idea of you are a me. You've got the me. You became the separate me when you were given a name and then move forward and you've got all of the grasping, all of the terror of the causes and conditions that have made you whatever that me is. And then you start to wake up and you start to think, okay, wait, there is another possibility. You do that through psychedelics. You do it through hearing a talk of Ram Dass or anybody, you Alan Watts. You do it through meeting somebody. You do it just, you and I, what we've been doing, the way in which we're sharing this creates the possibility and the new perspective. And once you have that, all that happens in my mind is there's a, a, a lessening of that grasping that makes you so, the feeling of separation is so powerful by the, by this grasping that you have no way of having a harmonious interaction with the environment, with your, with the people that you're in relation to, with your work, with any of it. And I think that that's what really needs to be understood. I mean, Krista Morty needs to be understood. He wouldn't like that. That's what comes about once we step on to a path of knowing that there is something beyond this Mimi land. Yes. And, and, and, and like, there's a, so many different methods related around sort of loosening the grasping or loosening the, it's really more like a, I think grasping as a, it's more like a muscle spasm. It's like when you have a really bad leg cramp, except you're the universe having the leg cramp. And it's a little, it's painful. But again, for me, the, it is painful. You got, that's an important cramping is painful. I mean, I mean, suffering gets to the point where you can't, you can't stand it. Well, but then, but then also this is, this is, this is where we get into the really interesting addictive quality of, of it, like, or the subtle nuances of the thing, which is again, like suddenly your relationship. So at first your relationship with yourself is, is naturally undifferentiated in the sense that you just think you're your mom, you're part of the ocean of isness. And then you begin to differentiate from your parents and suddenly you're a you and now you're going to, you want things your way. This is the toddler situation. And then this continues to like crystallize until you become an adult, which is just like a sort of neurological thumb print of various habituations that you've assembled as a, whatever you think you are. But the, the, the, what, what's been quite useful to me is not, well, first of all, what hasn't worked for me is the destructive approach, which a lot of people are into these days. God knows you get the emails I do too, where people are like, I obliterated my ego on 3000 micrograms of LSD. My, and the language is always war language obliterated, smashed, demolished. And, and, you know, but, and so the language itself demonstrates, number one, the recognition of, Oh God, this thing called my me is causing so much pain that I want to go to fucking war with it. But then also it seems to be a little bit of ignorance in the sense like, wait, so you're going to try to relieve yourself of the pain of the me by blowing it up, by exploding it by, you know, dropping bombs on it. How's that going to work? So yeah, by the way, Ram does, he used to say, like he'd advise people, if you have dark thoughts, he first started out going, love them to death. And then a couple of years later, he, you know, he's, it's too violent. That kind of, that leads you into something that is even further polarizing. Yeah. Well, again, we're a war culture. We've been 93% of American histories. We've been at war. So we're like Klingons, essentially in Star Trek. Like we know the way we understand the world is war and conquering and colonization. And so we take that approach against our own ourselves when we start having some recognition of our suffering. And, and, but yeah, anyway, the point is like the, that idea of confusion being a condition of enlightenment, I've always loved it. And I didn't understand it at first. I think I understand it a little more now, but I guess the way to, David Nick turn told me this funny joke, a funny spiritual joke, and there's a lot of shitty spiritual jokes, I'll probably butcher it. But basically, I think a student is on one side of a river, his teachers on the other side of the river, and he yells to his teacher, I want to get to the other shore. And his teacher yells back, you are on the other shore. And it's, do you know what I mean? So it's like, where it gets addictive for the addiction to really work or the spiritual high thing to work, you have to create another shore. And now you've got the spiritual path. And now you're on a journey from this profane to the sacred. And within that journey, there's all these chances to get completely blasted. You know, because Oh my God, now you're having this cherished moment because truly you've you're melting like a sugar cube into the ocean. But then all of a sudden, you're not anymore. And you're back down to your shitty self again. And then you're melting again and back. And now all you're doing is getting high. That's all you're doing is doing this weird form of spiritual bypass. It's called, I don't know if it's, I mean, like in one bypass in that it's, it's, it's just feeding the same ego that was being fed before there was a spiritual path in one's life. I'm referring to this thing that was discussed in this book, which I'll tell you right now. Yeah, it's called it's by hold on one second. It's called me over my audible here. Wonderful, wonderful Buddhist scripture called. Oh God, let me find it. It's one of the key Buddhist. It's about Bodhichitta aspiration. Oh yeah, it's called Way of the Bodhisattva by Shantideva. Very wonderful. I mean, that's incredible. Wonderful. And he's talking about this Bodhichitta idea. And, uh, but he's mentioning all these different things you can do as someone who's waking up or however you want to put it or cultivating Bodhichitta, moving through the realms. And one of the things you can do is actually cultivate this compassion, loving awareness, mindfulness to a certain degree where you begin to experience all the awesome things that go along with it, which are, I think are best be described as little miracles all the time or little synchronicities or the relief that comes from, you know, recognizing you're just in a bad dream and you're probably going to wake up soon. It's really quite nice. But there's a possibility here within even that of intentionally going back to sleep, putting yourself back to sleep because of the thrilling exhilaration of waking back up. You essentially turn yourself into this fucking yo-yo. It's true. I'm telling you, people do it all the time. And I, and I think part of the problem, so to speak, is that it might just be that this way that things are, all of the Eunice and all the meanness and all the confusion is just the way things are. It doesn't get better. It doesn't get worse. This is it. And people, that's intolerable. It's intolerable because the great dream is there's this thing around the corner that once I do the chakra exercises and the purifications and the mantras and the thing and get the initiation and then get the thing and then get all that and then somewhere around the corner is great hope. But what if it is hopeless in the sense, no, you're there. Deal with that. Holy fuck. It can't be. You mean just this? No. Then I've just got to be me. Then I can't exert aggression against myself. So now what am I going to do? Wait, wait, let's, I like to think of this in practical terms as to that once the shift starts to happen, I've had a shift over many decades that I can, and I have noticed and that is really what I only think I am concerned about for myself and you and others that are around me is moving in the perspective shifts without, I don't even know why. Yes, I do practices. Yes, I've been with incredible beings. Yes, starting with Ninkoro-Libama and ending there really and hanging out with Ram Dass as much as I did. But something happens and it's due to something that I was going to tell this story a little earlier, it's called grace. Yeah. And something happens. So, but the practical application of it is certainly I am not reactive the way that I was earlier in my life. Period. I am not and it has helped me with the anger issues that I've carried in this life. It has helped me with just being more open and I talk about that openness, that spaciousness, that self honesty, the way in which Ram Dass talks about loving that quote unquote Christa Morti mischief. It's just a happening. Yeah. It is inevitable. It's an inevitable happening. Yeah. It is our human, the human reality is certainly this ego me, me thing and getting entrapped and you're saying, well, people fall asleep so they can wake up again because it's so much fun. They do. And maybe that's, I would say that people do a lot of psychedelics just for the experience that may be true. And retreats. Yeah. And retreats and whatever meditation core. But again, it's all in, I say it's tone when we talk about a word like mischief that we've been talking about. It's all in, it's an honest intention allows for transformation that I love, that I love the honest intention that I love. And that took me a long time to get to that one. And I love it. And I think that that's if, if you were trying to find and saying, hold on to something, but to me, it seems more like a mnemonic device than anything, which is, you know, in all the like, you're describing, you're reading some beautiful Buddhist description of death as being like being in a blizzard and are like, they're like so dizzying and so lost. So, you know, I do like having a little, an intention like that that I can refer to when I've lost all reason or all like, wait, what was I even doing any of this for? What was I doing this for? I don't even know what any of this shit is. Just that little intention of like, okay, I'm going to try to be a little kinder today. Or it's like in Annie Lamont's new book, I believe she put just trying to be a little God, I think her prayer was God, let me be a little, a little less of an asshole today. You know what I mean? But just some simple, simple, simple, simple thing like that. So that I have a thing. But then part of, to me, part of being less of an asshole, having really become adept in earlier years at beating myself up and hating myself and all the various methods I use to sort of hurt myself, it didn't achieve the goal of some kind of stable happiness. So, and if it did, I think we'd be living in a paradise world. In other words, like we, if we're going to go back to like, we need some subjective methodology for improving our internal ecosystem, which maybe then we'll reflect into the world. I think the first step has got to be peace. We're like, in other words, we're calling an end to this war against the mischief person. The mischief man and I, maybe we're not going to get along for a while. And maybe the things the mischief man wants to do, like snort ketamine for the next 50 years straight. And what I need to do is a, what I need to do is a, is a father and a husband and a provider don't mix. And I'm going to be the one calling the shots in that regard. The father part, not the mischief man. Also, I understand why. And I know why that he wants to do that. I know why he likes it. And I, and I understand why the addiction is there. And I, and I get it, but all I'm saying is the war mentality, even using the language of war to refer to ourselves, uh, is not useful. So to me, there's a big relief in what you're saying. The relief being, this is a process. Like you're not really quite in this, you might not be in control at all, but in that scares the shit out of the mischief man, because the mischief man wants to be in complete control of everything. But when you start recognizing, oh, wonderful. Like when I look back and think, wait, how do I even meet Raghu? Well, how did I get to end up at Ram Dass's house? Or why do I get to have pictures of Neem Karoli Baba all over my house now? Why do I get to have that? Or why did my child and the womb get to be in the presence of Ram Dass or any of these things? Like when I look back and think, what was the right thing I did? Like what, what was the thing to deserve that? And when you, you know what I mean? And then when you realize, oh, I don't know that there was, or if there was, there wasn't, I, okay, here, this brings up the story that, that's my third time saying, gee, I don't know if I should tell this story. Well, it's not, I love your stories. No, no, you don't, you hate all those miracles story. Ah, that was earlier. That was earlier. Now you'll, okay, I'll give you a whole picture. I don't love them, but I like them. This isn't about that. This isn't about that. Well, this is a, this is a story that's been told many times, but it's so apropos to what you just said, what we've been talking about, because everything we're talking about is in duality, right? Trying to fix, no, don't fix, Cristian Borti said, there's no fixing, there's no process, there's no nothing, there's just perspective that takes place. This is a conversation that Ramdas had with Neem Karoli Baba in Allahabad one day, many years ago, where Ramdas said, Maharaji, is it not true that karma and grace are the same? How could they be different? Action and grace. That's intense. And you know the story, but Maharajis, no? I don't remember. It's sorry to cut it off. That's good. I love people who have no memories anymore. I can tell the story and they'd act like they'd never heard it before. It's like so refreshing. Anyhow, he said, Ramdas, I am not talking, this is not something I'm going to, I can talk about, even say it exactly like, this is not something that I'm going to talk about in public. And there wasn't anybody there except us, you know. So later in the day, in that day, Dada Mukherjee, the great, by his grace, get that book. You want to know anything about Neem Karoli Baba? That's the book. I just threw that in there because it's true. He came to Ramdas and said, Ramdas, Maharajee said to tell you that Ramdas and I understand each other quite well. So Ramdas thought, okay, it must be that they are and you couldn't talk about it and so on and so forth. Fast forward to not that long ago, maybe about eight years ago, I was in India with Siddhima who was with Maharajee forever and is a saint in her own right. It was our Indian mother, just an extraordinary being. I asked her, I said, I told her that whole story and I said, what's the truth, Ma? And she said, it is true that they are one, but human minds cannot fathom that. You need to act as if they are not one until the other thing happens, which is ineffable and we can't talk about. We have no idea about where you lose complete subject to object and you are now just part of the universal divine presence, whatever the hell we want to call it. So in your case, how the hell did I end up in India? I'm saying the same thing as you. How did I end up in the pool with Ramdas? I was in terrible shape. You say, I was in terrible shape. How the hell did I end up in looking in Ramdas' eyes and going, wow, I trust this guy. Period. And that pushed me to India. I had to meet whoever the hell it was that he trusted. I had to meet and I went and did that. How did that all happen? There is something going on that is not able to be understood by our minds. Well, yeah, it's something outside of time. We just, at one point, we don't try and figure it out. Actually, Maharajee said, stop trying to figure anything else. Don't try and figure it out. And we stop and at the moment we stop and surrender into the moment and the Buddhists have so much great terminology about being in the awareness moment, being trumpets between the gaps, in the gap between the thoughts, rather, we suddenly trust that. And once we trust that, then that perspective that we've been talking about where we are not judging, we are coming from a place that Ramdas called loving awareness. We are not judging ourselves. We are not judging other people. We are not trying to change things. We are not trying to have preferences. We are not trying to push it away. That seems, we accept the fact that we are human. We have suffering. We have to, that little me, mischief, he's a sweet guy, actually. We're going to let him do his thing and just, you know, just like a little bit of loving will allow it to be less pernicious and we can be a little kinder. Love it. See, this thing, and I think it's really important to underline what you just said and stick it in your heart because it's like the moment that you allow yourself this possibility of there being something more going on. It's really such a wonderful relief. And you know, because I, some of these moments happen in our family where all of a sudden, I don't know, like the other day, we're listening to Inya and Forest is like really listening to- Oh, don't make Forest listen to Inya. Come on. You monster demon, mischief man. No, give me a break. It was beautiful. My mom used to like it. I know, I just- She lives in a castle full of cats. You're going to judge her. She's the cool as cool as it gets. But like, we're sitting there listening to it, four seating dinner, Aaron's breastfeeding dune, everyone's just in the moment and it's all love. But it's like something has come into the room. I don't know what it is. It's the only place you want to be. You never want to be out of that place. We're all feeling it. No one's going to say it in the moment. No one's going to be like, Oh, the transcendent has descended upon our house because it's outside of words. It's dirty even that. Yeah, exactly. Or like when after Ram Dass married, Aaron and I, and Krishna Das is playing music and everyone is chanting, happened, something came into the room. I don't know what that is. Same thing. But when it came into the room then, I remember thinking, well, that's just because I'm at Ram Dass' house, or I don't know. They know what that is, but I'm not going to mention it because I don't want to mess it up. Little mischief. Yeah. Well, I say it out loud. But then, now I know a little bit more about what that was that came into the room. And I know it's not limited at Ram Dass' house. I know it's not limited to me being around my family or not being around my family, but also I know I can't make it happen. It doesn't seem to obey my desire for it, which is another thing I love that Ram Dass said, which is if you desire realization, that's just another desire. But there's intention and you've been fulfilling the intention for so many years now. That intention is sharing. You absolutely want to share whatever has come to you that feels good or feels like enlightening or anything, all of the stuff. You have that wonderful crystal mind that loves to learn and assimilate stuff. And you have been sharing it on this, well, this is my darling, but on Duncan Trussell family hour for years and years. You're the only reason I'm sitting here doing this right now with you. No other reason. So you are doing it. And it's that intention that it's back to his holiness, the Dalai Lama's most simple, simple kindness is my only religion. That's all we got. That's all we got. That's all we got. And then, so there's nothing to do but share that. And the little mischief guy, we, Krishna Morty, we got to love him too. It's a talent of Aaron, but he's not. We're going to love him. We're going to learn to love him. That's the purpose. That is the point of this podcast. Learn to love that. I think if we can do that, learn to love this thing and not bullshit love either, but love it unconditional, positive regard the way Carl Rogers love that kid or the way that Neem Karoli, or Mr. Rogers or Mr. Rogers. The real deal. But you know, if we all started doing that, my, I do, I do think that like we're getting the cart in front of the horse. If we think that the way to stopping environmental collapse is through going to war with ourselves. It's just not going to work because we're part of the earth too. And a house divided upon itself cannot stand. So we have to figure out a way to stop the war inside. And then maybe from that, all the other stuff maybe absolutely one billion percent. And we're going to end this podcast on that note. Stop the war inside ourselves. You know, I did a podcast with a fantastic monk from the Thich Nhat Hanh tradition, Chung Lu. And he went on about that very thing. What happened to him is he was with in Plum Village with Thich Nhat Hanh for 17 years or something as a monk. He said, I was the best monk you could ever be doing everything exactly right. And he said, not nothing happened to me. Nothing. So I dropped my robes. He said, that's when it happened of its own. I was just too much of doing, doing, doing, doing. And he talked about while I was there as a monk for 17 years, all I had was a war going on inside myself. Just what we were just talking about. And then once that left, then suddenly that realization came and that war started to evaporate. And that's what it's all about for all of us as far as I'm concerned. You're the best. I'm so lucky we're friends. I love you. You're the best. Never mind. We have a mutual admiration society. Thank you so much, Duncan. Anytime. This hang, I mean, you know, I don't even consider this a podcast. I mean, we do this by the way. I can't, folks out there, I can't tell you how many times we just get on the phone and we're just talking or whatever and it gets into an extended conversation and I go, well, this is the same thing as a pocket. We ought to record the damn thing whenever we get on. I did the same thing with it when I'm having a great conversation. I'm like, let's monetize this. Yeah, right. But we're now, we're not going to, we're not going to get into ourselves and go, you cheap piece of shit. It's how we get our grub. It's how we get our grub. Yes, we lovely little mischief guy. That's what we'll call this little mischief. Little mischief man. Yeah. All right, Roger. Thank you for letting me be on the show again. We'll throw some stuff up everybody, you know, with show notes and links and yeah, be here now network. It's, we is happening. Okay, we'll see you later. Thank you.

Greetings dear friends, there are landscapers directly outside of my office and barking dogs and helicopters and some kind of basic chaos vortex has formed outside of my studio so at least part of this intro is going to have to be recorded in a digital voice because I want to get the intro done today but as often happens when I set a goal, the universe is pushing back by creating a literal hurricane of instant noises. It's not just the landscapers, the dogs, my neighbour Jack hammering concrete, the toddler, or the very loud birds preventing the usual intro it's that when there is a break in the sound I get paranoid that at any moment the sound will start back up so this intro is unsatisfying as it may seem to those of you who love my deep, booming, central voice is very satisfying to me in that it represents a kind of victory over the forces of chaos. This is the sort of thing that all of my favourite teachers have taught me regarding getting things done. That if you wait for the perfect moment then you'll end up waiting forever. Or even worse if you get caught up imagining that you need extra gear or some kind of technology you don't have access to then your need for a better camera or computer or synthesiser becomes yet another excuse to not make something. So instead you try to use the limiting factors or the chaos factors as part of whatever it is you are creating instead of attempting some kind of escape or waiting for things to quiet down. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but to me I've begun to imagine that it's a good sign when at the very moment I try to make something there appears some kind of pushback or problem to, content with. That being said if I lived in a mansion you better believe I would have an elevator that went half a mile down into a bunker where my studio would be located in a sealed vault and where I would slide into a flotation tank that had some kind of getamine mist that it pumped into the air allowing me to telepathically recall my thoughts while travelling through alternate dimensions. Unfortunately we are not there yet, would need to get the Patron up to 100k a month for that. Regardless we have a wonderful podcast for you today, we are gonna jump right into it but first this. Welcome back friends we got some silence praise god but really you know I kinda like the text to speech thing maybe I'll just start doing that from now on. There's something really liberating about knowing this like digital English person is gonna take over your voice it's fantastic this is the future that I long for you know or so many things were just born into it you know you're born in I didn't want to talk this way I didn't want to look this way to be honest with you I mean some like some of my friends who are you know into the a certain idea of reincarnation would actually say well the truth is you did you did sign up for that exactly that thing that you're in right now you sign up for and PS I'm not trying to bash myself I mean I love this form that I've taken I just like it I didn't have to grow a beard to make it seem like I had a chin you know that kind of thing I don't know why when I went out in the department of reincarnation when they're like do you want a nice strong beautiful powerful symmetrical chin or do you kind of want to like a stork thing and I'm I was like I'll do the stork and just grow beard that's the thing where I can't wait for that video or whatever you get when you before you go into the next incarnation of that I want to I would like to have a conversation with the self that shows that by the way similarly you know I don't quite understand this voice you know it wouldn't have been the first voice I picked I would want like some kind of beautiful booming deep voice you know again I'm not saying I don't like myself I like myself but this is these are the kinds of things we have to deal with you're just born you're you're born a certain way that's just how it is you're going to be a certain you're going to have a certain height you know you're I've got scoliosis so you're going to have a kind you're going to have like weird shit I got one ball I don't know if I sign up for that I say give me hey how about no chin and one ball let's do that I wasn't born with one ball by the way I had to get one of my testicles removed but anyway this is what I look forward to if the transhumanists are right we're going to get to a point where nanobots can disassemble our bodies and reassemble them instantaneously so we get to experience every possible form come on as much as we have a culture of like you got to love yourself how many people are going to not instantaneously change some aspect of their identity immediately how many people who up until that day have been like showing Instagram memes that say love yourself or the wonderful videos you see of the children doing the sweet affirmations in front of the mirror saying oh god I love I love you I do that sometimes and I'm hyper depressed that's one of my tricks and it honestly I'm not sure it works that well but I just would love to know how many people when it does finally when we get into that place where you just like you know press a button on your iPhone you can turn into a tiger a lamb a tree you know a neanderthal or a whale or you can you know shift your voice instantly or can pain painlessly all of a sudden have boobs you know how many people are gonna like not change themselves give me a break everyone's gonna you won't know anyone from you only you only know your friends are anymore everyone will look so different probably people turn into little gnomes and people turn into snakes and cats you won't have any idea what anything is when that happens and I look forward to that moment but hopefully there's some precursor moments where you could just be like you know what I want to grow my ball back I want that weird little bald spot on the top of my head to fill in again I want my eyes to be a vivid blue I want to have a powerful chin and let's get the Brad Pitt abs from Fight Club and let's experiment with that weird tattoo idea I had when I was in high school fuck it let's do that and then probably definitely make my dick bigger and then I don't know let's add a couple feet to the old body size size it up a little bit get some biceps I'd like to be able to play Flight of the Bumblebee on my mug that'd be pretty awesome and yeah then after that let's see what it feels like to be a cabbage this is what I would do but who knows we don't know we're not there yet in the meantime we've got the computer to do that stuff for us and our imaginations and until then yeah love yourself because what else are you gonna do you know push up sit up start running jogging give me a break what are you gonna do start eating healthy you just start eating healthy is that what you're gonna do you're gonna stop stop eating these fucking perfect bars that are everywhere I don't know if you guys have had these not sponsored by the way but they're delicious but I'm starting to think these are just candy bars because these there's no way these things are okay to eat I don't know

a brilliant human this is a podcast that definitely I'm still spinning from it got a lot of data that I'm not going to spoil for you right now regarding what it's like to be a black person in the United States and I think it's really important right now to as much as possible get as much of that data as you can if you don't happen to be a black person in the United States it's crazy to me that all this time I've had my face shoved into a variety of conspiracy theories when one of the more sinister conspiracies that I've ever heard of that is verifiable as verifiable can be is happening every day to black people who are in this country and wow fuck it's crazy and it changes you in a good way I think but it definitely isn't a comfortable thing necessarily I don't mean to spoil the podcast for you honestly when I reached out to brandy to have this conversation I thought we were going to talk about birth she's a postpartum doula a newborn care specialist and a lactation consultant and a pediatric sleep specialist and I wanted to talk about babies but the conversation it didn't really uh it didn't really hang out there that much and I'm glad that we didn't hang out there that much it got really intense really heavy and really really for me very important so I hope you enjoy it if you enjoy this conversation why not sign up for one of brandy Jordan's anti-racist parenting workshops there will be a link for that at dunkatrustle.com now please everybody shine your divine internal rainbow astral light through the mycillio spiritual network that connects all beings that it comes raining down on today's guest welcome to the DTFH brandy jordan it's brandy welcome to the dunkatrustle family our podcast I am so excited to chat with you when Erin told me that she was friends with you and that there was this possibility I was thrilled because uh I have yet to chat with anyone on the podcast who is a midwife a doula what's the right I don't even know the right word for it is a doula or is there a doula I don't help them actually deliver the baby like I'm not catching any babies um so it's a non-medical role okay I got you now I was doing a little bit of research into this and uh the history of specifically african-american midwives and um they're there may I was wondering if maybe we could just you could just talk a little bit about that or if if if if that is not something that you feel like talking about or if that's not a good place to start well I would well how many hours do you have is more of the question all right okay it was the right question yes so I mean in America obviously we have a 400 year history of enslaved people who were black americans from africa and they were the ones who deliver the babies both for their masters owners and for themselves and so those are the women that they sought out in the community to deliver babies and many of those women delivered hundreds and hundreds of babies without incident um when there became you know modern medicine as we think about it today which were mostly white males who became you know ops you know african-american ecologists they began to kind of demonize these women and say they were unclean and they didn't know what they were talking about and they didn't know science and um that kind of was the demise of midwifery as we knew it back then but they were the ones who are responsible for a lot of us being here right now both ancestors white and black right and a lot of them you know their names may never be known for especially for a lot of black americans who may not have had birth certificates but thousands and thousands of these thousands of babies they were basically the ones who brought their knowledge to this country and helped the people that enslaved them deliver their babies safely at the time that's gotta be some cognitive dissonance there delivering the child of the person who is human trafficking you yeah how what i mean they're that's so wild that is so wild did now i is the reason like when we first started chatting and i called you a midwife versus a doula that's partially connected to this history right i mean women always assisted other women in birth and whatever civilization you look at that was just the thing that happened um and so for a lot of people their family members were the ones that would do that you had an aunt or a grandma or somebody that was just a person you knew and the villager in the community that was a person that came and helped everyone with their babies my own mother who's from mississippi her name is maggie and the midwife who birthed her named her maggie uh so that was the kind of relationship that these wives have in their communities yeah and is there some there's you know okay so i'll tell you what i used to think about it which was completely informed by what you're talking about which is a paradigm that has been put out there by uh white people that is now i mean studying it that is connected to slavery another thing just no no idea but i will tell you what i used to think and it and then going and studying it you realize my god you're so conditioned because what i the things i thought you can go on wikipedia literally and it shows you what was put out there which is just what you're saying superstitious dangerous uh basically like witchcraft like basically yeah yeah like some form of like dangerous witchcraft that was you know had its roots uh in african religions maybe and that uh also i think there was that the problem was one of power which is that doctors there were people who would rather go to a midwife to have their baby delivered because it's super expensive to go to a doctor and have your baby delivered by a doctor and also i think is it fair to say back then it seemed kind of weird and unnatural to all of a sudden have to bring yourself to a hospital or bring yourself to a dude who is also males just weren't as involved in the birth process and that's even partners weren't as involved um so that obviously was something different and so they had to have a way to convince women that it was better and safer to come into a hospital and they did that by demonizing these women i didn't know about midwifery until i was probably at 19 or 20 which was like a blessing um i was listening to um npr at the time and they had this story of this old-time career called midwifery that you know women were doing but it was very much painted as something that was created about like white women hippies like there was no mention of being rooted in you know african-american culture or in the history of america so that's something that i learned along the way but it's really what opened my knowledge and curiosity into supporting women in birth you know i cold called a i'm from houston so i cold called a uh birth center there it's like i just heard this story on npr i want to know what this is all about and for whatever weird reason they allowed a 19 year old to come and be with them and work with them and kind of change the trajectory of my life and so 20 years later i'm still working with my babies so was that that story had you have you seen a birth before that had you been in the presence of a birth before i had you know my i have three sisters and we're all like 10 years apart and so my oldest sister had my nephew when i was 16 and i was in the birthing room with her um and so i did see a birth when i was 16 and then the second birth that i saw at the birth center i was 19 or 20 at the time a couple had a 10 pound baby in water and i was like oh like my god like bodies can do this like what what is this like that to me is witchcraft like how was she able to do this yes um and it's like you say like no one was screaming and there wasn't blood everywhere and i was like okay so this is a hundred percent not what i've been conditioned to believe that birth is that it can be something very different um and i had the pleasure of learning that at 20 years of age before having my own children and going down that road okay do you think you could chat a little bit about that specifically in the sense that my idea of what birth is and my experience of birth is more what's in the zeitgeist because i we went to a hospital we had the injections i saw my wife was going to have an epidural and they messed it up they something went wrong and that i watched my wife her pulse just start going down i watched she didn't see it she didn't see the look on the doctor's face see she didn't see the look on the nurse's face i saw the moment of it going from being oh this is just a you know what we do to oh shit something's really off here erin was just saying she couldn't feel under her neck but suddenly my entire life in that moment went from you know my idea of what was gonna happen which is oh you know i don't know they give her a needle it doesn't hurt there and then i have a son this is how it's gonna go to i think i might watch the my soulmate die right now in front of me with my son in her belly now also i have a prior to that of course we've all heard the whole thing like it's a bloody screaming mess and it feels like what you're saying is actually what that is is what birth turned into versus what and i wonder if you could chat about that a little bit with us well i think i mean i always tell people you know people have this idea that doulos and mitwebs are like you have to have a natural birth and you got to be at home and you need to be like a bear in the woods and like i love science my minors in science um and so it's not that like not everyone is a good candidate to have a baby outside the hospital there are many people who need to be in a hospital and i'm so grateful we have hospitals for that right at home birth one home birth and two hospital births and they were all are amazing births it's just not about the hospital it's the way in which we care for families um and pregnant people that is the issue and so thinking about you know the wifery model of care is more of what is important for us to be thinking about so your big wife knows you they know your they know the couple they know the children you know your visits are about an hour to two hours long you know i think about my time with my ob gyn and we probably didn't spend more than seven eight minutes together right during our visits and so you know so much of birth is about trust the ability to let go the ability to you know get yourself like in the zone so to speak yes and you're not in a space where you feel that type of connection with people you feel that kind of safety what comes up for a lot of people it's fear and we know fear doesn't make you feel relaxed or make you feel like you want to release anything you're going to hold tight and you're going to get stiff and that's the exact opposite of what we want in birth when you're trying to let go and like like this person that you've been protecting for nine months come from your body to the outside world right and so i think it's more of the idea that we don't have that kind of community connection with our healthcare providers they don't really know you and you know i'm thinking about the black woman where we're more like four times more likely to die in childbirth than white women there's also that i'm walking into that yes wow in some places 10 times racism and bias is the only reason how can you go deeper into that what is the you know we know that people have what one people don't listen they don't trust black women when they say they're in pain or they have concerns they're usually brushed off um and so in los angeles for example they're four times more likely to die and it's regardless of income socioeconomic socioeconomic status health status it's simply bias and so it might be that you know some things they might take more seriously with you know a non-black patient they're not taking us seriously or they're brushing off or they see them as annoying or complaining and not taking those same precautions that they would take with you know other patients in places like new york um dc it's 10 times more likely to die in childbirth what um yes and so it's a crisis and so you think about if you're going into birth already concerned like how many clients would have to say it's like i'm afraid of dying not everyone is saying that about their birth that their fear is dying you know and if you don't have that relationship with your doctors most doctors in the united states don't necessarily look like the clients in which they are serving they don't know the issue they have preconceived notions about their families you know i know with my my first child every time i went the woman would be like oh so how are you gonna do this on your own they all assumed i was a single mom i don't have to you know tell you to guess why that was um you know simply just the way in which they you know the way in which they interacted with me didn't lead to a lot of trust happening between us i have to apologize i have not heard what you've been saying because my mind is grappling with that statistic that i had never heard before yes that is that's that is the most i mean of all the things everything we're hearing right now regarding african-american experience are like something out of invasion of the body snatchers level of like fuck but that one i did what a poster that someone wrote um for one of the recent uh marches and it said um doctors do to black women what police do to black men oh man and i wouldn't resonate with me but it did and i tell people this story i've spoken about it a lot my third baby is now three um i went to hospital to deliver him my third baby and and for a little precursor my second baby was born in 50 minutes so this will give you some wow uh precursor 50 50 five zero congrats luckily it was a planned home birth but this when i was having at the hospital and i arrived at the hospital you know third baby you know what's happening um the doctor you know i say i'm in labor you know my water start trickling he's like hmm i think you may have peed yourself when you thought it was your water leaking like okay i'm gonna let that one go and i said well i'm in labor you know it's my third baby um and he said to me word for word it doesn't matter that you think you're in labor what matters is when i think you're in labor holy shit and so at this point like you know this is my third baby we're an hour into this and i'm like you know i know where i'm at and i know what's happening um and so he wouldn't admit me so that meant we had to stay in a little triage room have you been in the triage room but it's like the size of like a damn nurse closet right and you have like a door or anything like that and so i was having to go through this little closet to like the public bathroom and the lobby back and forth while i'm laboring my child uh so like every moan every cry like anyone who's in the waiting room would basically having this experience with me and so at one point we got in there doesn't have a real bed it has like kind of like a cot situation but it became too uncomfortable so i got on my hands and knees on the cold floor and i remember thinking like how am i expected to do what i know i need to do and these circumstances where i'm not even worthy of getting a hospital bed on a slow night on a tuesday um now the the important piece of this story is that this is the hospital that i worked at for five years at the same time this was happening and in the same department but i didn't have on my fancy white coat and so i was just another black mom coming to this hospital and so word got around obviously that i was an employee and then the brigades came in and then the whole situation changed but i'm thinking about someone like me like i've been in maternal child health for 20 years you know i have a master's degree i have all the things you could think about as far as like the education or whatever and i still was not given what i know they give to clients every single night that i've been there working there for five years and so i think about if i had to endure that think about someone who doesn't have the background who doesn't have people i had a doula i had my husband i had those people to advocate for me but many women don't have that i don't even know how they can advocate for themselves and that's how they die here's i was gonna go home here's a woo-woo interpretation and feel free to slap it down i will do you feel like maybe people like it almost sounds like you were given that experience by the universe so that you could tell people about it because i just the odds of having worked at that hospital having seen what happens when people of color come in versus white people for them to not know you were connected it was it's like you were given a story in the most awful way you could possibly be given a story because you're not someone who's like well i've read this you know i've read this in sociology papers or i've heard it when all those things people want to refute because it's easier i don't want to live in the world that you're describing right right right i mean like i tell everyone you know even hearing that story just know that i'm one of the lucky ones i've been able to come home three times alive with three alive babies so i'm a i'm one of the lucky ones you know so when i tell this story you know i can tell us from a place of gratitude because i am alive my babies are alive and that's not the case for a lot of women who look like me so i am grateful because i do have the platform to be able to say hey this does happen and i'm someone that you guys consider respectable like i've done all the things you're supposed to do in america to be quote unquote respectable and this still happened to me so yes i think it is a gift that it happened um but more importantly a gift that i'm alive and my baby's alive and i didn't go home as they instructed me to do um during this labor and so you know i think about all the people who don't have this and this is one of thousands of examples that i can give on my own personal you know history with just navigating through society so i know what it looks like you know i have the moms who call and say what do i do like you know i i feel like i'm dying like how do i advocate for myself who do i talk to who do i call like is it like a lot of men are now afraid to go to the hospital so we have the other thing happening that you have people who want to have a baby at home by themselves because they're so afraid of what can happen in other settings not always say this is not a referendum on hospital versus home birth because i think they're both valuable because even that birth experience turned out to be something really beautiful the doctor who then came and relieved this person was amazing and he turned it around and it was this amazing experience yes i think you can have a beautiful birth in either place but it's knowing how to advocate for yourself and having people who really believe in family centered women centered you know birth person centered care in the future and i just want to put it out there that i hope this is the future where this period in american history global history of catastrophe becomes the what people look back on as like when we really did face facts and somehow and god knows i have no idea how somehow on the other side of this we do have equality we do have we've come to terms with it there's been i don't know what the word for you even that is it some kind of global healing or evolution or healing and equity is what we need much

we've had you know 450 years of difference and so a lot of them talk about like we just want the same no we need equity so if you've had a 450 year head start we have to figure out how we create equity in that race unfortunately and there's no easy answers to that that's going to make everyone happy do you say unfortunately why do you say you say unfortunately because you recognize the just sheer impossibility in that I mean it's you know is that why you say it's not impossible I am a very positive thinking person so it's not impossible you know my grandmother who just turned 99 in April thinking about what she experienced in her hundred years living almost a hundred years living in the United States to go from what she you know like separate you know found since my parents experience drinking from separate water fountains they're from the south as well and to now see that some of that same rhetoric is happening in the United States like I don't know that feels like progress to them if anything it probably feels more like a setback because they were alive and around during this little rights movement so for them it feels like we're a setback not in progress so you know I want to remain hopeful for my children and I'm doing what I can to create that equity and to give them the idea that yes they can still do what they want and become what they want and that's what I was taught regardless of what's happening around but I can't say that I'm entirely hopeful that it's so possible for myself just because I know so many of the liberal well-meaning people that I know are unwilling to really unpack their own racism and bias and that's the issue and if I can't get them to see it how in the heck are we gonna get the other people to see it yeah I mean that is the issue isn't it because it is it does just come down I mean it's easier for me to do that because I was raised by I was raised in the south and my this is the problem I'll tell you the problem the problem is we love our parents but one of my parents was not a liberal in the closet racist one of my parents was a born in the south racist racist do you know that's what I was born I was and I'm not trying to do like that therefore I'm okay any of the excuse I'm just saying that's the water that was poured into my plant that is me you know and so at least if I'm like looking into myself and seeing bias and seeing like my experience as a kid and remembering what my some of the things my father would say to me and then having to like pull those things away from his soul which was beautiful every human soul is beautiful but having to pull away from that soul damn you I tell people that like I'm from the south I can tell you pretty much every racist thing that's happened to me has happened in Los Angeles not in the south and so you have this idea that like things are so much worse than the south and you know and that's not the case I think that it's easier for people to say oh yeah that's a problem that's in the south so that's a problem in Texas you know but that then keeps you from actually unpacking their own thing like here people talking about Trump all the time and this person in that person like hey let's put all people aside say none of them exist how are you personally responsible for upholding and benefiting the system and that's where you have to start we have to stop looking outside of what's happening and a lot of people don't want to address that no it's simple makes you feel guilty and you have to name some things you don't want to name and until everyone is willing to do that it's not going to change and also people of color have a lot of their own unpacking to do like we also get brought up on the same system and so I had to like from myself over the past 41 years of my life kind of unpack all the internalized anti-blackness and racism that I absorbed to be able to walk through the system that's right that's wild that's a that's interesting because I don't think people can you talk a little bit about that angle which is that you know we're raised to make honestly black people are raised to make white people feel comfortable everything that I was taught and I wasn't said in those terms but I understood that my physical emotional financial well-being was very much rooted in making a certain population comfortable in many ways making my boss feel comfortable making myself feel seem non-confrontational making sure you know I didn't know the only texture of my texture of my hair until I was 30 because my hair was chemically straightening until I was 30 and I realized that I like I actually even know the own texture of my hair because this hair was considered non-professional disheveled the actual hair that comes out of my head you know you think about you know every child of color will tell you their parents always told them you need to be twice as good and work twice as hard to get the same that's what we all were raised on and that's not something I'm passing on to my kids because I don't feel like my kids need to do more or be smarter they just are you know they just have to do be them to do what they want to do but when you give that to children and my parents did it because they wanted to protect me they wanted me to be able to have something but it also was a burden as well you know so I had to unpack like it's not I don't need to prove myself to anyone because by saying that I'm almost signing up to the idea that I'm inferior in some way people this is one of the things that I didn't I just didn't know I didn't know I feel embarrassed the whole thing it's not just guilt it's embarrassment you feel I don't I don't I don't think that we have quite you know quite the word for it for the experience of what a lot of us are feeling right now guilt is part of it but it's I think shame is probably a big part of it they're ashamed there's I think it's a new on both sides I think it's a yes I think it's a nice gumbo of all kinds of stuff like that that really is makes you if you really do you know I've worked with these spiritual people for years and I've been taught mindfulness how to work with my thoughts how to sit with my thoughts and I'm feel lucky for that because I can create a little bit of space around the sensation of holy shit man it was right it wasn't like this was hidden in a vault somewhere it wasn't like you had to go dig underneath the Vatican or some shit to get an ancient scroll and look at it you could have talked to any black person for 10 minutes and ask them what's it like being a kid in America if you're black be easy thing easy how many of them would honestly answer that I don't know years ago not many and I wouldn't I wouldn't have felt comfortable asking the question that's the other thing I felt comfortable answering yeah I think people are having a much needed you know 450 years late conversation and there's no way to get to the next side until we all have these conversations just like family you got to hash it out you got to say your piece maybe got to be now with each other for a little bit to come back to some kind of okay this is what we're going to do to fix this right we're in that phase right now like we're having some hard conversations you know and they have to be had because when you don't have them like you don't see me you don't see my experience and oh everyone's learning that because I mean it wasn't so I went to college that I knew much about black history something that we are taught I remember in high school I was caught that Rosa Parks gave up her seat because she was just tired her feet were her feet hurt like that's how I learned that that's how she gave up her you know she wouldn't give her seat on the bus but she was just so tired oh my god that is so tired and I remember like all the pictures had her with gray hair whatever she was like I think 43 or something when this happened she wasn't like 85 like I was taught in high school sounds like if you have those kind of narratives and everyone's getting that same education of this water down idea of what it was like you know 50 years 100 years 200 years ago it you know it makes sense that we're kind of like oh well it wasn't that bad they were really friends they loved each other right they loved being slaves it wasn't that bad right well that right this is I mean so you know gone with the wind classic American cinema so the other like way before the pandemic my wife my wife and I sat down to watch gone with the wind not because of like any racial thing but just you know this is one of those movies they say is one classic classics you watch that is the most racist fucked up movie right from the start but can I tell you how much I loved this movie when I was like you're high that does that tell you the level of brainwashing I don't really want to call it but the level of complicity that we all have to play in the system wow I probably watched that movie probably 15 20 times that's like what a four hour long movie like yeah I watched so many times it's it did I was not horrified that that version of the south is a version of the south where if you're a slave you're kind of like oh well you know it's better than where I came from you know this and that that you know they take care of you we're family we yeah you're part of our family you're not a you haven't been human trafficked you're not a hostage you're not an unpaid hostage you're you're you know you're you're you're you're lucky basically you're lucky that we we got you and yeah that's what most people learn most kids learn so you know it already starts from you know elementary school that you're already being taught either superiority or inferiority depending on you know what color your skin is when you enter to a traditional schooling in America so no one escapes this so whether you're liberal you're conservative everyone's getting that same education and so you know I I always tell people I'm not a jackass whisperer like I have no intention of turning people who are races not races like they can continue to be races with not my I'm not working with those people but I do work with people who want to see things change who are looking for equity to see how they play a part in this call them on that call them in and out and figure out how you could how you can make the change start with you that's the people that I work with I'm not looking to change hearts and minds of people who don't want them change but I definitely think there's a lot more people who don't know how competent they are and need someone to kind of shine the mirror and it happens in every aspect of life whether it's childbirth parenting you know I think what is looking for a preschool for my kids and LA was like trying to you know apply to Harvard because it was just so few options they walked into some of these places like oh my god my kid's gonna be the black kid and my kids are biracial so they have privilege in that like they don't have my same skin right they're exotic you know they can be fetishized and seem like they're exotic right you know and there's an issue in that as well you know so there's so many different layers to all the things that come into parenthood like play into this as well well I mean this this is thank you for that by the way and here this is what I want wanted to ask you after this and again after we have achieved equity and I do think it's possible I think partially because of the technology we we have right now it's at least it's it can happen before I don't know but now we have technology so it's hard to suppress data like what you're putting out right now I didn't know it a lot of people hearing it just didn't know it but this is my question so we have achieved equity I don't know what that's gonna look like but we're looking back at this time period what do you think is going to be the analysis of a society where black people are being publicly executed in the streets where if they go to give birth they're four to six to ten times more likely to die what is the word for that is what I want to know what is what are people gonna say this was a genocide it's genocide yeah but it's it's it's it's like genocide evolved it's like someone looked at what the Nazis did and said whoa they were way too out front in the way they're they're getting rid of Jews you can't just do it like that you've got to do a slow boil genocide or something but that is what it is that that but genocide I mean America has perfected that I mean with the natives uh so this isn't the first time right um but yes I mean I would call it genocide I mean I think about you know 1985 like do you know anywhere else in the world like or in the United States were they able to drop bombs on family homes in the United States of America that's what happened in 1985 in Philadelphia killing women and children inside a home in Philadelphia right like on our own soil where how else would that be allowed without outrage and people you know in the streets in the voting box changing everything but no one cared because it was black people when you say I didn't care they didn't care enough to do more than care because I think a lot of people do care sure you know I say that really honestly and genuinely I know a lot of people who care but not enough to actually move beyond that feeling because feelings pass well I mean there was a lot of people in Germany who cared too now I want to know when you so with it with genocide the what you're saying is there's intentionality it's you know and so this I would love to chat with you about that if the intentionality implies a power intelligent decisions that are intentionally being made to kill black people to reduce the population of black people in America so I mean who's doing who's making the decisions we can look at the criminal justice system um you know I want to say that the prison population I want to say is about about 50 something black men when they make up I don't know 15 20 percent of the population when white males are committing the same amount of crimes but that's not an narrative that you get on the news no you know you think about during the drug crisis you know a black man having two you know rocks of crack in their hand would go to jail for 20 to 30 years yep and cocaine which is something that was not something that usually people in urban areas were selling you could have a kilo and do you know 15 months there's an intentionality to that because we know what communities are doing what the fact that they actually brought drugs into the black communities um that was by the CIA and that's very much documented that I was down on purpose yep um so you know you think about families you know they changed the way that welfare work that you could not get welfare if you were married so think about what that did to communities of color if you couldn't be married to get the substances that you needed that meant that you didn't get married and so you had generations generations of families not getting married and that broke down the family you know community that was needed to strive in so many of these you know underserved areas this about schools the question I'm asking you and I I don't know if anyone even has the answer though is who is orchestrating this like it's so sinister many people corporations government I think whoever benefits financially is who is orchestrating this because just put it this way let's just say the top one percent said you know what I don't want to have racism anymore I don't want to have discrimination their money is what fuels everything and so if they said I'm not going to shop for any of these corporations that have someone who's supporting x those corporations would no longer cease to be in existence if they said this person is saying this you know and I don't want to pay for this they're going to lose all their sponsors because they're going to pay attention where the money flows right so we know that there is money and people being poor there's money and people being divided you know especially for the criminal justice system it funds many of the corporations the labor basically our new evolved way of doing slavery right happens in the prison system right and so there is a financial benefit to creating a caste system right now they're calling with that but this is where the conspiracy theorist part of me this is the part because I do go on reddit conspiracy every night I shouldn't have horrible dreams I'm sorry it's the worst it's the best in the worst don't do it I love hollow earth theory part of me I'm not embarrassed to say believes there could be civilizations in the core of the I hope so but this stuff that you're talking about this is to me the crown jewel of what's of the of conspiracy and by conspiracy I don't mean like therefore it's not real I mean holy shit if apocalypse means lifting of the veil then this is the most apocalyptic collective realization that I any society I've ever heard of is having right now which is no no no this isn't this isn't just we just haven't quite figured out a way to balance the scales you're looking at a slow motion genocide that is being perpetrated by the wealthy to eradicate people of color and it is so insidious and it is so ingrained in us that even though it's clearly happening we saw it happen we just saw it happen I mean maybe we explain it away if you've been taught your entire life that black people are dangerous and lazy then how could you see it that way you just another criminal getting what he deserves that's right like you know think about I grew up watching cops like as a family show me too how I mean I was taught as well like you can you can make black people afraid of their own people like if that's every image that you see you start to believe that and so you have this idea that if I dress a certain way I go to college like these are the things that makes me different and protects me and then you get the huge wake-up call once you become adult and be like well that was a little bullshit like I've done all that shit and I'm no you know I'm not safer than I was not doing any of those things I'm gonna stop harping on this particular point I know what you're saying I who all who who who who is a lot of people everyone is it a deep is it a demon is it that you know you know is it well I mean I demon in the sense of like um Carl uh Carl Jung had this theory that the ever you know everyone has a shadow the side you don't want to share and the collective shadow if the if enough people are repressing the truth in a society then that collective shadow will manifest as a tyrant that that's what happens if enough people are not looking into it not going through the what we're talking the the the thing that you will feel if you really look deep into this as a white person then what happens is it jumps out of us it takes on a form it takes on the form of an Adolf Hitler an Adolf Hitler appears and then you get that but in this case and as you're describing it it feels like a even though look I don't I don't want to call Trump Adolf Hitler not because I like Trump but because I think it's assigning too much um organization to that person he just seems like a speed freak lunatic Hitler was a speed freak too and a lunatic but there was this this diabolical ideology and philosophies that I don't believe that Trump necessarily has thought through that deeply but here's the part that and again and this I'm not trying I'm sorry but here's the problem if we get a narcissist sociopath speed freak it doesn't matter what he thinks we just need to get around him and like start putting little ideas in his head somebody's like you know remember I'm sure you do remember when the the the racists were marching with their white torches just like the Nazis did one of them ran over a charlotte yeah yeah and very fine people in charlotte yes now someone so I don't know that he someone may have just told him here's what you say but these you know are when he accidentally puts in his tweet uh thanks to the SS for clearing out these people it's intentional like yes right I'm sure someone like Stephen Miller who is the orchestrator of much of what he does is does it on purpose because they want to incite their base the populist movement like we've seen it before so there you go they know who their base is and what they want whether he believes it or not he knows it gets them fired up and that's what gets gets votes and that's what got him elected so we continue to fire them up and that is that has died in the wool unapologetic white supremacists puppeteering our our political system that is not and I think the problem is that when when we say the word white supremacy most of we're thinking about people wearing a white hat and burning crosses and yes I can be one facet of white supremacy but it's also giving me a home loan that has four percent more apr than a white person it's also you know making me wait in the bank line for 45 minutes you can check to make sure my check is a real check yep like that all is the same thing it's also like my kid being like the token black kid at a school you know and that's the one you want to always take a picture of and put him on your front of your thing even though he's the only black child you know it's all of that and so I think until we start seeing white supremacy with a broader lens you're going to continue to be focused on Trump and he is such a minor part of the issue he is a culmination of what we already had he just is allowing you guys a mirror to see it well I mean that's I guess like that's where they they really screwed up because they put somebody out there that just couldn't be subtle about it and now because of that it's that's the weird gift not just that that he's giving us and I'm sorry I don't mean to call this a gift because that the execution of George Floyd will go down in history is one of the most horrific things that as a society we had like we had to watch that that's there forever that's never going to get forever but where what happened there was it's like the thing god this is forgive me anything I say is just not going to be sufficient and you say it anyway that's how we move forward thank you oh god I'm so dumb the movie predator right this thing he's in camouflage you don't see it killing everybody you don't see the thing it's like he's using this weird camouflage and then suddenly finally you see the fucking monster there it is plain as day and once you see the monster you can fight it you know it's there you can't deny it anymore right that was the human sacrifice that was George Floyd is that you saw a human sacrifice you saw what white people couldn't see it exactly and you're right so and you know for you know unfortunately fortunately we have social media and video so that you guys because before you would have been able to say oh well that's not what happened like no one know he didn't do that like he must have resisted no he must have had a gun no he must have been resisting yep and now you're unable to do that because of the video that's right oh we looked telling since forever since 1619 and now you guys see it with your own eyes and so there's no way for you to tell your eyes that you didn't see what you saw that's right nope even with that I've seen people say that's not what happened that it was a hoax that oh that's a good one because he had he had see he had COVID-19 that's why he died and it was because was on his neck and so anyone will make an excuse but I think it's forcing you all just like you know watching people be beat on the sound of bridge back in the 60s forced by people to say okay this is not okay right but how many I mean how like do we do this every 80 years until we get it like I'm hoping that's not the case no no I mean it's no I no I don't know it's no I think you can't be complacent anymore because that's the dream the dream is to be on the bench the dream is to be watching this thing go down as though you're watching a show cops you want to feel like you're watching cops and now you can't be complacent anymore now you have to look and by by you no longer say you didn't know if you're complacent right now then you're as far as I'm actually making a decision and a choice that's right that's right you didn't know it's like this is the eight minutes and 46 seconds heard around the world no one can say they didn't know now there you go and what's that thing the weather underground said something like ignoring violence is violence it's if you it's a violent it's you don't know at this point is willful ignorant ignorance like everyone knows but this is what like people knew before this and this is what's probably frustrating to a lot of people of color is that the idea that people need to watch basically black snuff films live on their facebook feed in order to believe and trust that we've been telling the truth that there are some people who don't quite treat us the same as they're treating you that in itself is inhumane it's dehumanizing it's so many things but uh the thing that kind of I think besides George for that kind of brought us to a head was Amy Cooper I don't want to leave her out of this conversation right because that is a video you need to see to say that everyone knows no one can say they don't know everyone knows because in that moment you saw that she was skillfully and understood a hundred percent what she could do with her whiteness to harm this black man who was telling what her what to do in her park right and everyone saw that right right so this whole thing I didn't know I didn't know no you knew it doesn't affect you in a way that made you care right yeah yeah I mean that's the new it's that's the new uh it's a sad genre isn't it now it is it's in and no one's no one is everyone has to unpack right now you know I can tell people like I'm married to a white male who clearly has a black wife and biracial children so he's like in the struggle he know he's doing his work yeah and I still have to check him like no this isn't this is not a thing no stop you need to be quiet in the list and you need to so there's no one who is absolute absolute from doing this work everyone has to do it I don't care how deep you think you are in anti-racism work how down you are if you were the only white kid that grew up in the hood like whatever your story is none of that matters you still have to unpack can you tell me about the being quiet part the thing is when you are taught that you are smart you're the conquerors you create civilizations it creates a lot of sense of ownership in spaces and so you go into spaces and the way that you own them that's what you've been taught and so sometimes you have to also unlearn not to take up so much space maybe you don't have to be the person who's sitting in the front maybe you don't have to be the person who's leaving the conversation or leading the revolution like sometimes maybe you have to like join other people and let them do it and not be in front yeah and but that's something that has to be unlearned when you your whole life has been like yes you are the people who lead us of course that's what you're gonna do and so you have to actually unlearn that sometimes taking up space is another way that you that you have learned white supremacy taking up too much space yeah that's the part that i have the a very difficult time with this shutting up i loved it yeah it's just about knowing when right right and i everything doesn't belong to you like i think about like you know everyday things like there was that whole i don't even saw the sidewalk challenge that a lot of people of color did nope most people expect for me to get off the sidewalk and we're both coming both places like i've done this and i tested it out where did that where did people learn that where did you expect that people of color supposed to move out of the way for you on the sidewalk like where did you learn that holy shit it's so internalized that people don't see it and i've had people literally like bulldoze me because their expectation was that i was gonna move because that's supposed to happen and i somehow internalized it because i was always moving wow i didn't even know that was a that i didn't know that i never even heard that so like now i tell you like simple things like that pay attention to how you are in spaces you know do that like every time you see someone let's like move off the sidewalk and see what happens like would you normally have done that for many people probably not if they really were honest with themselves they actually paid attention is that you have this idea that they're in your space and they're supposed to work around you that's right you know these days i get off the damn sidewalk i don't care who it is because of covid right like i'm just trying to get that hell away from all human beings i mean a lot of that might have changed because of covid but you know i see this all the time like on buses or in trams like you know and it's not just america like people you know will say you know we spend we spend part-time in france part-time in la and um people say like you know is it less racist there i'm like it depends on how you ask like i'm not wearing a hijab so it's probably yeah for me it's better right but if you're wearing a hijab it's probably not for that person you spend part-time in france yeah my husband's french oh come on you got to invite us over when are you going we might we might not be able to go back huh like they're saying yeah the life first are supposedly um increasing it for america's uh failure to deal with covid they are possibly closing the borders just to american travel wow that is so crazy i know there's a difference it's not less racist but the difference when i'm traveling overseas because i've lived in asia i've lived in europe you know obviously i'm from the states is that there are plenty of people who don't like black people whatever i don't care you don't have to like me but they aren't afraid of me and that's the difference of being killed versus people just like whatever being rude i don't care if you're rude right i just want to be killed and that's the difference like i have no sense that women france if anyone's going to kill me because of my race because they don't like me they might take long to seat me at a restaurant or something but it's not a life or death situation as is the united states and that's the difference well i'm glad that you're putting out this data and i'm i'm absorbing it i don't know what to do with a lot of it but the only thing you do with it is to examine yourself and work on that if everyone did that and the problem's fixed see this is can i i just i think what i do love is like we are saying look we are all just going to be honest with each other right now yes and i love that i love that invitation i love it and i would like to make a couple of observations that i've noticed in these recent difficult conversations i have been having with people of color and it flies in the face of everything i've been taught by my teachers because you know ramdas one of my teachers he said there is a revolution of love happening right now and you know and michael beckwith my wife and i were just listening to this beautiful sermon michael beckwith was giving on you know impossible look break down the word it means i'm possible it's possible they said the wall couldn't come down there's so many times in history where they've said it's impossible but one of the things that i've noticed in chatting with black people about this very uncomfortable beyond uncomfortable thing what are you going to say an uncomfortable genocide i'm sorry is the genocide inconveniencing you is that y'all have a kind of optimism that i don't share it is not oh wow how could you not like i like i tell people like somehow my ancestors made it through the middle passage they made it through 450 years of slavery they made it through reconstruction they made the civil rights for me to be sitting here today how could i not be optimistic right like i don't you know it's impossible like it's not in my dna not to be optimistic like what you had to believe to be enslaved and make a family of your own and have traditions and to pass those down and to get married and have babies under those conditions you had to be a craft like your craft was optimism to be able to do that wow like i have i don't have a right not to be optimistic that's how i feel about it are we allowed to be optimistic right now our white people everyone should be optimistic i need people to be optimistic because if you if you are if it's all doom and gloom then why would you do the work right but here like what's different now is that we're having these conversations and like i tell people now because i've unpacked my own internalized racism anti-blackness that i'm no longer willing to sacrifice my dignity and my children's lives for your comfort and so that means you're gonna get it from me straight because i can't afford to keep you comfortable anymore right and that's the difference and i think a lot of people have that collective sense of this is the time like i will not allow for my children to be having this conversation 25 years from now and so whatever it is for you it's not what we've experienced and you're gonna get over it and be fine with it but we gotta just give it to you straight like we're not keeping anyone comfortable anymore right well there is an insidious thing there too isn't it because it can seem like the work is done see this is one of the things when i was coming up i really there were periods in my life where i would think the work is we got america it comes so far oh yeah what we were fucked up back then back then can you believe how fucked up those genocidal psychotic conquering white people were but now ah we've done it i probably thought yeah and then you're like let's watch cops get me a beer let's sit down and watch cops which is essentially the the running it's a game show where black people get chased down by people with guns and i'm sure you know this normalize well they and they i listened to an npr story on it so once the people have been arrested and their adrenaline's pumping the crew of cops would go to them and get them to sign their releases and they would not tell them they were with cops so they thought they were just signing stuff that cops wanted them to sign yeah i mean but it's again you become desensitized and so my fear is that people will become desensitized as seeing black bodies dying on their screens if we continue to let it happen right it's already normalized like oh okay another one today you know it's normalized like why aren't we all in a state of shock trauma and anger after watching someone be killed over an eight minute period on our on our phones right because we're desensitized all of us it's like oh okay another one he's okay that guy's like he's gonna get in diet he's gonna get off and then on the next one like i've lost count of the people and that's where we're at and so i think you know there's a part of people there's so many issues and so many layers that people are overwhelmed about where it began that's that that's how i feel and also there's this kind of lazy fatigue a blurry fatigue that sets in there's this just sense where you just feel like well what in this again this is where my pessimism comes in and chatting with you is helping me but there's still a part something on very dark days i think well maybe this is hell is this just how are we just in a place where human sacrifice you know it's like what they're not putting them on Mayan pyramids and driving daggers into their hearts but what are they doing they're making it so if they go to the hospital and the doctor's like you you don't know your body like i do i'm gonna leave you in this little room here and you know maybe go home let's roll the dice you know what you might die but let's roll the dice it's so insidious this is to me where this is the part that's like god if it's if it were pyramids if they were wearing clan outfits if they were self-announced if they all had Adolf Hitler mustaches you know at least then we could be like fuck this is nazis now we're looking at this slow and over time and everyone's comfortable and you have tv's and you have netflix yes you know it's it's hard for a lot of people like i was just saying like the amount of drama people had about having to stay in their house and like watch netflix like that was a that was a sacrifice in a struggle right you know we're gonna like topple structural racism overnight not gonna happen right a lot a lot of sacrifice is gonna have to go along with that and when you lose things that you thought were your right and it was actually a privilege that was afforded to you as a white person it feels like you're being discriminated against give me some examples of that so you know you think about jobs for example and most industries unless even i was gonna say hip hop but even that like the decision makers aren't people of color most industry the people who hire in fire are non black people non people of color as well and so if there was equity and all of a sudden you know the 15 people in leadership you know are all equal then you're not necessarily going to be the person in charge you know necessarily going to have like leadership position you're not going to be the only people on the board and so if those things start getting taken away it will feel like for many people they're used to those things being theirs they'll feel like they're getting the choreo mistake i'm being discriminated against because i'm white damn right you're losing the benefits of privilege and that for some people is going to feel like discrimination oh god i'm a you should hear i mean so many comics white comics are like just forget it you can't get a job anymore unless you're black yeah i i mean i was married to a comic for a long time i'm sorry so i know the uh he's actually passed uh in 2018 um but you know even he would say like i know the a lot of things that i do and the gigs i get black comments aren't even at the table for this like they're not going on hbo like they're not going on this tour like unless it's like the black comedy tour like they're just not at this table right you know and that's just what it is in this world um you know so it's you know i even now i think about like i feel bad for him because he would have so much material right now if he were alive to be able to be during this time like i know would have given him lots of material would have made him really upset but very happy to be able to speak on what's happening right now that wasn't that long ago no it wasn't long ago at all i'm so sorry yeah 43 years old yeah what was his name can you share his name sean rouse oh wow oh i'm so sorry yeah what a world you're in i know i know 2020 2020 a lot has happened but even that like i think you know me and sean we met and we're both from houston's we met in houston and you know we came to la years and years ago he had a pilot and was working and i would think about like when i would go to shows with him just some of the like the blatant thing you're just like like are we serious like it's in every industry like no one is you know like there is no one who can say that their industry or what they do or their community is free of this like you see it in every turn so sean rouse he was a can i tell you a story about your husband i'm sure you have some probably really funny bad stories but go ahead and tell no i have a great story about him he's my ex-husband when he passed but we have a beautiful child together who's 13 now well let me tell you about your ex-husband he was brilliant as a comment yes he was and so i go on stage this is when i was going through my uh so embarrassing my edgy i would call it me trying to be edgy is i was which is like because it's so easy to trick yourself into thinking like if you're up there being edgy yeah and people aren't responding it's like you know okay just it's too it's too tough when it's like a fuck up you're just not writing you're not writing it's not a joke it's not a joke and there's so many so many of us out there who make that mistake and it's an embarrassment but i'll fully admit that i did i went through an anti-cop in phase two equally embarrassing that being said i'm i go on stage and i make some stupid joke about being molested as a child which i was not as far as i'm aware it was a dumb eat lazy joke and something something about trying to connect that to being a better artist or something awful stupid edgy joke i get off stage and shan gets on stage he followed me and he's like wow dunkin said that makes you a better artist it just really makes it so i can't sleep at night very well because i think he was abused he was he was sexually abused um and he was very open about it so i'm not sure anything that he didn't talk about all the time and he was in his act a lot um by like a new gooder in the neighborhood through the church he like helped all the parents and the less at all their children basically it was one of the it was it was led to a lifelong addiction for shan it was why your ex why he was my ex that was a tough husband but that was in comedy i've had a few smackdowns that like helped me and that was one of the great because i was he knew i respected him as a comic so and he knew i was watching his set and that was a like that was a good one for me it would really help me in my writing and i'm sorry i'm sorry for that you lost him and i'm sorry for all the people who lost him i know i know he was very quick with it and like but i still have laughed about the things that we laughed about and i tell everyone like a couple months before he died he called me and was like you know being shan and like but but not being shan apologized for how he was as a husband and told me that you know make sure our kid knows that i love him i kind of just like shan stop like whatever like stop with your melodrama you're fine like you know and for me it's like oh my god i'm so glad we got to have that closure before he passed because he passed me three months after that phone call you know and obviously he felt it somewhere but this was happening for him um yeah you know but it's like we get to have that and you know and i see many things that happen like you know you talk about like did that happen to me for a reason so many things happened for a reason like you know i was doing a project um and i happened to like go to this office and his his um manager which is what brought us to la is like next door to the person i'm working with and i was like how in the world like i'm a doula like but i'm in the office like where this all happened you know yeah however many years ago with me and child like this is like this is for a reason it's too much it's too much i and this is i think this is a good place i didn't know we'd get here but a way to wrap it up because i mean i have been around you know i've lost my mom and my dad i've been around dying people and i've been around my son being born and one of the things that was so wild to me was realizing that the energy in the room of a dying person is the same as the energy in the room of a person being born and i wonder if you could if you have felt that or if you know what i'm talking about that i know your feeling i wasn't i wasn't with him when he passed uh what i can say is is that i firstly i personally feel this need to like rebirth and i bear the situation like when when you're with someone who has a baby you have this just the preciousness of life yes you get reminded of and the same thing happens when someone dies and so that feeling that energy is something i feel in both ways because losing him made me think okay he's 43 years old we have this beautiful child like you never know let me like like we have to slow down we have to like have these moments i've had these memories that have you know these traditions in the same way when i had my son my first you know i had my first at 28 my last at 38 when i had him like i was trans i became a new person like if i'm going to spend one minute away from this person this child like it has to be the most amazing thing it has to be you know worth it yeah to be able to do this and so i think what what you're talking about is just the energy that both of those experience brings to people is the same thing this idea the preciousness of life yeah yeah oh wow what a wonderful wonderful thing to get to know you uh and for our first conversation which i hope will not be our last to be through this podcast i'm glad to know that you knew son that warms my heart uh i i had a lot a lot of he was a really deeply respected in the comedy community yeah he is so funny and such a sharp writer and my son would love to hear that so oh yeah well that's all he's gonna have to do is google his dad because that's you know like he watches this stuff to my chagrin i know i don't know if it's what can i do with his dad you know yeah yeah he was he was he was brilliant a story that i hope that he will get to hear as he gets older about the craft and the type of artist that he was a lot of people because i had told people there's a lot of people who said they're a comic honey that doesn't really right like that doesn't have so much weight because a lot of people can say that they don't actually do comedy like um they might say funny things but that's not the same thing as being a stand-up no no no right i know what you mean son was a network a lot more than any person who's not a comic needs to be in no son was a cash on son would have this is how i these days how i know if someone's a comic is i i think you know if there were some kind of actual apocalypse and if we were living in rubble how long would it be before they figured out a way to build a stage and start telling jokes again and that was son son you know he was he had a lot of challenges they had a lot of reasons to stay home and not go not wait to do 10 minutes of material and he i he lived for it yeah it was for it yeah he sure did well he's lucky that you were that y'all had a connection he's lucky to have known you at all and i'm i'm i think it's really wild to have lucky to have known him i would never be doing what i'm doing or have moved to la but have i had them at sean wow you know i could have easily been in houston working a nine to five and doing what you're supposed to do and collecting benefits and you know and he allowed me to be confident and not that's not what i wanted to do and being around someone like him and it was so free and just knew like he was going to do that there was no plan b it was just comedy that's right allowed me to have that sense of freedom as well so we were equally lucky how cool well i feel like sean popped into the podcast for a second that was truly unexpected well
