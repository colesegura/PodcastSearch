And on behalf of Darren Frigely Enterprises, I'd like to remind you that time is an illusion. You're enlightened, and we're both flying over to bed right now because we're monks having a typical afternoon. Also, I'm back with the demiurge. I have to remind you that you are not an enlightened monk flying over to bed right now, but that your experience of life as dreamlike as it may seem is actually very, very real. In fact, it's all there is. And now, a song. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. First off, forgive me if it seems like I'm wagon, but I've never been in a satanic wagon pulled by dragons. And as you can see from the tattoo on my face, I recently became a demon slayer. He sits on a smoldering throne and he makes me eat his ass when he's feeling alone. He also replicated me with a clone and he has me monitored by these drones. So let's get going. My master wants a milkshake of unicorn jizz ejaculated in an earthquake. Also, he would like a holy grail, supersize it and lay off in the ice so there's more Christ blood inside it. His son would really like some heated baby bones with cheese and for me, I'll take a hamburger please. And if you've got some extra souls, I guess I'll take three. One for my clone, one for my drone, and one for me. Okay kid, let me get this for you. You got a one, twenty-five to thirty-six to seventy-eight. Did you bring in your useful dishes? So just let me know there's a raffle for a fish. Extra cheese and comfort please. A long waiting order, please. Seven dollars extra, bring your mouth to your knees. Please pull over, I don't know about that. And that's for a dotting apple six. Yes, the same machine's broken. Now we get fixed. That was drive through, which is now out on fish laser records.

Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, join me to be blue. Welcome to you. It's been Duncan. It's been Duncan. It's been Duncan. Welcome. And you probably didn't hear Bex, our program coordinators introduction. So let me just mirror it slightly. We're here tonight doing our first free webinar, which will be once a month series that is sponsored by DharmaMoon, in which we have guests and the thread thread is mindfulness and dot, dot, dot. So we're a meditation company, DharmaMoon, DharmaMoon.com. We have a lot of students here and a lot of friends gathered. And Duncan is one of our best friends and most true friends for DharmaMoon. And he's participated in a bunch of programs that we've done together. And so we're really very happy and kind of tickled, I think is a good word for it to have Duncan joining us for our first webinar in this series, Mindfulness and. So we call this one mindfulness and the cosmic joke in our kind of attempt to draw together the notion of some kind of playfulness and humor with the idea of Buddhist practice, which is our unique, that's our unique Jag. Some of you might know me with Duncan from his wonderful series on Netflix, The Midnight Gospel, in which I believe I and his mother were the only two people who appeared as ourselves in cartoon form. I was David, the meditation teacher, not a big stretch, but animated version. And I gave his character Clancy who was in that at that moment in the form of an octopus meditation instruction. Yes. Right. So that was a kind of interesting moment in our, in our collaboration. Wouldn't you say. Oh yeah, that was super cool. It was nice turning you into our cartoons. But we don't know the rights to it, right? No, hell no. Are you kidding? We could never do it again on our own, right? Well, not in that form. Yeah. You know, only if Netflix wants to. Yeah. Well, right, right to your local Netflix dealer and see if they'll do it, do a retake on Midnight Gospel. Meanwhile, we move on and we're doing all kinds of other things together. So tonight is just going to be a jam, the way we jam. Some of you have heard us on the podcast. We have folks here, Duncan, just. Our mutual friends of yours in mind. There are people from your podcast who took our mindfulness meditation teacher training program. We've got another one coming up. March, starting March 11th, which I'm going to shamelessly promote at some point during the evening. And we're hoping to invite some new folks to come and take part in that. But meanwhile, we don't have a huge agenda. Duncan. No, I mean, no, we were just going to do a kind of podcast. About, you know, maybe some parallels between mindfulness and comedy, even though anytime you start talking about comedy in a way that isn't doing comedy, you immediately seem like an asshole. So I had some reservations about doing this. Only in the sense of like any, you know, like, why do I, why should I talk about comedy or anyone talk about it? You know, that it's just an easier to talk about comedy than to do comedy. Well, don't you think that's true of music also? And man, any spiritual practice. Well, and sex, let's include a bunch of other things that it's true of. It's very hard for me to talk about sex, actually. Food. Yeah. Well, yeah, but I mean, you can talk about food. It's easy. You know, when you talk about food, you just seem like someone who likes, yeah, but you know what? There is something weird when someone talks about food versus eating food. You know, like when someone brings the oysters, like when someone brings the oysters and tells you the name, like what each type of oyster is. I don't care. When you have to pretend like you're going to remember something like this is a Michigan shores blue. And this is a Rinaldi. You're just, you know, it's you rather just eat the oyster. That's a good point. And do you remember that restaurant in Maui, that famous restaurant? Which they tell you which fishermen caught each piece of fish. Oh my God. Yeah. What was the name of that restaurant, Monica? Yeah, Mama's Fish House. Yeah, exactly. And it tells you the name of the fisherman that caught the fish as if like, oh, yeah, I'll have that guy's catch. Oh, I love the animals. He yanks out of the ocean. Life is open. You just got a special way of cutting them open. Yeah. And now this is interesting segue. This is all the way of people building up credentials. Isn't it in a way? Identifying things and making them more familiar to you. Yeah, I think, yeah, sure. I mean, you know, generally it's like a kind of manipulation from the restaurant. If you're talking about like the naming who caught the fish, right? Like it makes him seem, you know, somehow. I don't know. Like, I don't know. It makes you feel a little better somehow because the fish wasn't caught by some anonymous, faceless person or something. You get this weird sense of like, okay, this was the right kind of fish. But just Duncan, the sense of credentials, you know, one of the things that Trump said to us, what he had a lot of credentials as a Buddhist master, he was the 11th trunk patulku in a series of teachers. He came from Tibet, which is heavy cred for anybody studying about meditation. And he said to us, if you had met me in a restaurant, would you still want to study with me? And he wrote a early article called Buddha Dharma without credentials. So is there, is there comedy without credentials? What if you never heard of that person? Does knowing what their credentials are help you think they're funnier? You get four minutes about like, you know, having worked at the comedy store for the longest time and having seen like legendary world famous comedians go on stage to work on material. And you get four minutes about maybe eight, four, four to eight minutes before people stop laughing if you're not being funny. And so that's it only works for a second. But generally, like, I've, you know, that's what's really beautiful about the comedy store is you get to see the process and you realize that though you're looking at someone who's been in their entire lives, you know, like being a comedian, when they're in the initial phases of developing a joke, it still won't work sometimes. So the credentials become irrelevant. Similarly, like in sports or whatever, like who cares if you've got credentials, it's how you're playing that particular day that matters. You don't think like when they always say somebody has like four Grammy awards and then you go, they're really good. But you know, did you see the Netflix, not Netflix, but the series on the Beatles recently? Did you watch that? I hated it. It's almost there's two groups of people, the people who loved it and the people who couldn't take it. So what about it? Not, not that we want to alienate, you know, the Beatles particularly, but what about it? I love the Beatles. Right. You're not like the Beatles. The Beatles are like a manifestation of Christ on Earth maybe, but that documentary, it was like somebody had just been snorting rails of Adderall and got on Final Cut and had a bunch of Beatles footage and like threw it together in this really annoying way. You know, no offense to people who loved it. I mean, I'm awful. I don't because I don't like something is mean meaning. It just means nothing. Wow. I'll never ask you what you like or don't like again then. Please do ask me what I like or don't like. I just think it's good to preface. You know, anytime anyone thinks they have great taste, what's more cloying than that? When you're with someone who's like, no, I've got really good taste. Like people do say that though. I know they're, I mean, they're definitive assholes. Like anyone who says they have good, anyone who wakes up in the morning is like, boy, do I have good taste. It's such a dull. That's the most annoying stance. Maybe you do. I don't know, but I mean, we're living in a, at this point we live in on a planet where there are so many potential ways of tuning in to reality. That for you to imagine that there's some, you know, like middle C for taste and you represent that. You know what I mean? I think there's a lot of hubris in that and you probably deserve to be made, you know, sneered at and I rolled out a little bit. So thanks for those of you have great taste out there. Yeah. Or even good taste. Whether it's saving more and spending less or getting organized or losing weight, learning how to do backflips. There's a lot of worthwhile goals to set for yourself this year. At the top of my list is learning a new language with Babbel, the language learning app that sold more than 10 million subscriptions. I'm trying to learn French using Babbel. And the reason I want to do that is so that I can instruct someone in the Parisian catacombs to take me to the place where the MDMA party is happening. Not only is learning a new language a fun and engaging new hobby, you can use it while you check off traveling more from your list. The whole Babbel process is addictively fun, fast and easy. Babbel teaches bite-sized language lessons for real world use. It's so easy. If you've ever taken any other language program, then you might have a bad taste in your mouth about learning another language, but clearly Babbel recruited people who are working at MK Ultra and told them to create a hyper-advanced, super-easy language learning program that was also as addictive as some kind of synthetic narcotic. Babbel's 15-minute lessons make it the perfect way to learn a new language on the go. Other language learning apps use AI for their lesson plans, but Babbel lessons were created by over 100 language experts. Their teaching method has been scientifically proven to be effective, and with Babbel you can choose from 14 different languages including Spanish, French, Italian and German. Plus, Babbel's speech recognition technology helps you to improve your pronunciation and accent. There's so many ways to learn with Babbel.

Thanks for those of you who have great taste out there. Yeah, or even good taste. But in my own way, Duncan, I'm slightly nudging us towards ego. It's an assessment of credentials of ego and how people identify themselves. Because the cosmic joke, as we talked about earlier, is, as I mentioned what my teacher said, is the cosmic joke is actually that you don't exist. Right. Okay, so that means all the ways you identify yourself, all the credentials, all the things that you've gathered together as a sense of identity are just that they're just a bundle. It's a bundle. Right. So how do we live with that? Do you feel that's true? Yeah. Yes, I do feel that's true. I think that's one of those things. Depending on where you're at in your life, that seems to be either the most horrifying thing you've ever heard or the greatest news of all time, just depending on where you're at. If you're really working hard at being a thing and you hear that, then I think that makes a lot of people put the book down right away. It's like, fuck that, I don't want to mess with that. I'm definitely something. And so then they don't want to hear it. But then if you're starting to recognize just how absolutely calcified you've gotten in your identity, then that becomes like really, there's something in that that's, even if you don't, reading it isn't enough, but just that possibility is pretty exciting. So you're somebody, and so am I, for that matter, who's functioned actively and also for career in the kind of entertainment or show business world, in which a sense of identity is super important. Wouldn't you say? I mean, what's it like being a Buddhist comic? Are you a Buddhist comic? I don't, so I wonder about both of those categories all the time. I'm always like, I don't know if I'm either of those things. Sometimes I am, but I don't, you know, there's a saying in comedy that I really love, you're only as good as your last set. And I really love that because it's a, every time you go on stage, you're starting over. And I think that's where there's a real parallel between Buddhism and comedy and, you know, something that I've learned from you, which was also one of those things. Initially, when you started explaining it to me, I found it to be really quite annoying was the idea of disowning, you know, letting go of whatever the peak experience you had on the cushion and starting again when you sit down, because those peak experiences can really act as anchors. They don't really do much for you. And I know you must hear this all the time. Infinite stories of people achieving some incredible state of heightened consciousness during a meditation session or something. And what I really love about the idea of disowning is like, okay, great, but that's not happening now. You liberate yourself from that, you know, so you're not always constantly sort of trying to be whatever the thing was the last time you were something. Wait, that's really worth repeating. You're not always trying to be, say it again. You're not always trying to be the thing you were the last time you were something. And could we could we all write that down, please? You're not always trying to be the thing you thought you were the last time you were trying to be something. The last time you were something, because you know that in that again, when you started exploring, you know, Buddhism, mindfulness, meditation, psychedelics, you do sort of have the amazing or terrifying encounter with this. Well, I'm not something that I'm dissolved. You come out of whatever the psychedelic state was and now you're a thing, but there was a gap. And that's really wild. So it's, you know, it's, it makes a lot of sense to constantly be trying to like replicate some version of yourself that you thought was happy. Yeah. That's good. Cool. That somehow is saying in a very plain English way, what all the Buddhist teachings are trying to say that you're trying to replicate something. Yeah. It's a version of karma, isn't it? Like it's a replicator. And you're trying to create a familiar sense of something either good or bad. It doesn't even matter if it's if you're familiar thing is a shithole, you know, or, or. Are you making fun of my basement? I don't even know where, where are you in the world right now? I can't disclose that right now. I just, I mean, even the state, you can't even say the state. How about the state of mind? I'm in a good state of mind. No, I'm in my base. I don't know why I'm trying to be mysterious. I'm in my garage. You work in the studio sometimes too, right? Yes, I work in the studio, but I wanted to get home to put my kids to bed. I like to, I like, I like to read them a story or read the older one a story before he goes to bed. And I didn't want to be at work all day and miss that. So I came home and went down to the basement to do this. Even though it is not aesthetically pleasing at all, it's really creepy down here. It smells bad too. And I lost my smell because of COVID and it still smells bad. You lost your sense of smell in an ongoing way or just for a period of time? I'm going. Yeah, my smell has been like oatmeal, pea, poop, coffee, all smell exactly the same. Wow. I mean, there's a million things, ways to rabble that and unravel that, but oatmeal and poop is where I would start. Somebody just said, don't get those mixed up. Yeah, no, that's the two of the four, those are the two that would be easiest to mix up. Well, thank God I can still see. Now, that's a good punch line. That's that Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder movies, you know, remember those? One of them is blind and the other one's deaf. I mean, what a great, what a great premise that was. But yes, but you know, I do think that there is something really funny about Buddhism. And I think that's something that if you spend a lot of time with the books and you spend a lot of time, you know, getting into this sort of dense. What is it? I heard Jack Hornfield say, for Buddhist God is lists. And so you, you know, you get into like this funny. Yeah. There is it. I remember once when I was complaining, I was telling you, telling you like this stuff just seems dry and you're like, it is dry. Yeah. But there is like, that's the sort of like reading the, you know, not to like, that's like reading the ingredients on a box or something like that. But you know, or that's right from that to like put together what a cookie tastes like, you know, which is one is very sweet. The other is like a side-chlorium dioxide, you know, cane sugar, you know, whatever that whatever it is in the in the ingredients. And so the sweetness has within it a really funny quality to it that isn't that isn't a cynical kind of funny, at least in my appraisal of the thing. That's a very sweet kind of funny, but yet still incredibly edgy in that we are talking about the, the sort of possibility that the thing you think you are just doesn't, doesn't really exist. I mean, that's about it. I don't know of anything edgier than that. Yeah. And we, you know, at Dharma Moon, we have this Tuesday night, a gathering that I've been wanting to have you come visit. And you're invited. But it's kind of a little bit of a deeper dive into the Buddhist teaching. So we started last night on the Heart Sutra, the Prajnaparamita Sutra, which starts as it's about 17 volumes called the Prajnaparamita Sutra. It narrows down, narrows down. And then there's one thing called the Heart Sutra. It's just two pages of text. And then there's shorter and shorter versions of it. And there's one version where it starts the usual way. That's have I heard blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. One word. Wow. Supposedly there were people who could hear it that way and understand the whole thing without going through the 17 volumes, without going through the two pages. So, and of course, you know, there are sutras in which the Buddha just is holding up a flower, even in the longer version of the Heart Sutra, but it's not even talking. It's just, his students are, you know, jabbering away in front of them. And then at the end, he says, that was pretty good. So, but ah, remember Ram Dass used to just go like, you know, ah, I am loving awareness. You know, there was something like that of just like allowing yourself to be stiller and simpler. Well, you know, what a relief. I mean, that's what a what a relief you, you know, for the dream to work, you got to be all stuck in a self, you know, and that's one of my favorite things that happens in a dream state where like you're be like you're having some rotten experience in a dream state. And if, and then maybe you remember, oh, this is a dream. And then the instant sense of relief that comes from that. And it's so immense and wonderful and you wake up with a smile on your face, even though the dream was sort of a nightmare versus like nightmares where you wake up screaming. And I, you know, I think that using language involving sleeping and waking is the Buddha seems there's lots of ways of communicating the experience that he was pointing towards as being awake. Buddha Buddha means is awakened person, basically. Yeah, and awakened being even. And, or the awakened aspect, it could be the awakened aspect, but it also could be a person has completely manifested that and is that's the space that they're in. Kind of settled into it. Yeah, they call it stable stability stabilized into it. Yeah, because we all have glimpses right when you say, oh yeah, oh yeah, but you don't believe them. You're not going to believe that. I mean, that's the problem, you know, it's like and that's it does kind of match like when you start waking up at a dream maybe because you do, you can go kind of sort of come out of a dream and then go right back into it again. So I think something like that is possible. But I think they're that that are that sense of a kind of never ending relief. That makes a lot of sense if you've been toiling away and a and a, you know, trying to like replicate what you were a few seconds ago over and over and over again what a fucking horrible job. No, you're not like it just you didn't even apply for the job, at least maybe or maybe you did a good depends on what like you what what system of metaphysics you want to like you want to want to subscribe to that's a whole different conversation but you know for the sake of this conversation, it's like, you just suddenly you find yourself in Europe, you're in a body, you know, and you're looking around and there's all this stuff around you, and you're wearing clothes that you picked out a long time ago. Maybe you got some tattoos. You know what I mean that made sense when you got them. And you're in you either like, that's a good one to maybe you got some tattoos that made sense when you got them. And now you're like what the fuck did I do. What am I what am I what is this like you know and those and so maybe you think when that happens you're confused or something. And so then because that moment of confusion is so scary, you go back into trying to be trying to replicate yourself. You think oh my god I disassociated or something I'm not know I I remember why I got that tattoo. I got that tattoo because Carlo is beautiful. And there's this big joke about the resetting it over and over again is that none of it's necessary. Right. That which is what they are is saying is you can, you don't have to do it. But that can easily, as you know you and I have talked about dribble over into a kind of nihilistic perspective right, then you don't have to do it and then you go well the self is just empty and void why should I be anything why should I have kids you know, treat people well, you know, so that's the tricky thing about simplicity is that if it's not right, right and properly, it'll just turn into nihilism. You know, if I'm going to, if I'm going to, I'm going to, you know, I think I'm lucky sometimes to be a comic and because I can just say things that I don't know, I don't know, I don't I'm not certified or anything and it's good it's great. But, you know, any encounters I've had with this experience of not, you know, letting go of my identity, it doesn't feel you know that you sometimes you get in you run into like I have nothing against atheists. I get why you wouldn't believe in God and I get it. But sometimes you run into like an angry atheist who just it's like someone it's like a you know it's a non consensual ghost story. You know what I mean where like someone's trying to tell you a ghost like they think it's going to scare you because they're like no you don't get it when you die you're gone forever. Death is the anesthesia that keeps you away from the pain of life Richard Dawkins, but they're mad. It's not like they're telling you that, you know, in a way like in a gentle way they're generally there's a kind of weird anger behind it. We're like, look, I didn't write the fucking Bible. Why are you mad at me? I didn't invent God. Why are you coming at me like this? It's not my fault that this thing that you thought the way you sort of embodied the infinite didn't work out for you. But my encounters with that thing that you're talking about it's always very sweet. And it's always there like my my sense when I've encountered it has not been I'm going to go around telling people you know you don't exist. You're not a you there's nothing there. It's usually more of after that you know just a little taste of that relief or that possibility that is never ending sort of. You know, I don't know. There's so many different ways to put it. It's like being rolled by the most obnoxious wave. Like if you like, you know, when you're surfing or I don't surf, sometimes I say like I surf, you know, when you're surfing David. When somebody else is surfing, right? You catch now when you catch that big wave. Yeah. Well, I have tried body surfing and I've been rolled and you get rolled by this wave and you're just rolling on the on the and you realize like, oh, you want to air. Too bad. You're not going to get air because you can't swim up to get the air because you're being rolled by a wave right now and you're in the oceans grass. Hopefully you will get up. You just don't know. But it's like some existential version of that, except in this case the wave is this never ending series of react reactions and then from those reactions you get lost in your thinking and then from getting lost in your thinking. You react in another dumb way and every once while you might come up for the surface and look around and be like, oh, fuck, I got another tattoo and rolling and rolling. So this is a very painful sort of experience. And so anytime you do get that sense of like, wait, I'm coming up for air. I don't know it. It usually feels quite joyful. You know, there isn't that anger part. It doesn't feel like you want to get nihilistic with it at all. Yeah. You know, or disregard other people or try to shame them for being themselves or thinking there. It seems to engender a more like loving kind of way of thinking about other people. Well, you know, emptiness and compassion that they're linked in the doctrine of Buddhism. That's the two elements of Mahayana Buddhism. Isn't that a strange thing to go together emptiness? You think, okay, well, it doesn't matter. There's nothing there. No need. Nothing to get hung about. But it goes somehow. It opens the gateway to compassion. That's really what you're saying. You're saying that actually. Well, yeah, I mean, I'm, this is, I wish I could pretend that we, you hadn't already told me that. I was spontaneously erupting with some kind of like brilliant dharmic stuff. I'm parroting you kind of, but I can say that I have had brushes with this. Encounters with this, whatever this is in that in those brushes with the thing. There's a very sweet sort of warmth to it that I don't really understand at all. And, you know, in retrospect, whenever I'm thinking about it, I try to disown that and try not to get too caught up in it. And in sitting meditation, I've gotten better and better when that sort of thing seems to be happening. It just, you know, not trying to get too hung up on it, you know, but whatever that thing is, maybe it's a delusion. I mean, I don't know, but I do know that anytime I'm being a really a jerk or anytime I find myself like being aggressive or weird, it's 100% the opposite experience. You know, it's coming from defending something that I feel like needs defending and whatever that other thing. But once you have sort of let go, let go, what's there to defend? You know, one thing that one of my teachers said is, don't defend yourself. But then he went on to say don't defend the Dharma either. Oh boy, yeah, that's obnoxious. That's the one for it to put into your smile and poke it, you know, because we could get caught up with like, you know, kind of zeal zeal. Oh yeah, that's the other thing. Yeah, you turn into that you don't want to be that person. Yeah. Now what are you now what's going on you becomes a kind of weird but I get it you know that I mean like God or don't you remember the first time you took acid. Like, oh Duncan. I don't have to think of that. Yes, I do now. But it's a longer time ago for me then for most people here. But I remember totally vividly now that you mentioned longer time how long four days. The first time was I was junior in college at Columbia so you know maybe 19 or 20, and I'm going to be 74 next month so how much is that 50 years ago. And I remember pretty vividly because one of the things that happened was my girlfriend at the time had a bad trip. And she went into a kind of spasm of fear and anxiety. And I was in no condition to kind of like, okay, let me just ground you here I'll hold on here. So it was kind of the trip got a boarded at the time. And you know, it was, I don't think that would have been the outcome for me, but through her, I thought, oh, I really need to come down here I need to I need to be on the ground here to help to help her to not have a terrible experience. So, you know that idea of losing your ground can be very easy navigation for some people and much harder for other people or easy for us sometimes and harder at other times so have you ever had a bad trip. I've never had a good trip. Now that's funny. They can ask it over a hundred times. I don't think I've any of them have been particularly great. Wow. No, I'm Joe. I have there, you know, I think anyone who's to use my acid friends out there you know what I mean like you can have states of ecstasy but like part of it's sort of an uncomfortable experience. I know for sure like one like, like at least 99% of the time when I've come down. I've thanked God. Oh, thank you God, thank you God, thank you God, thank you God, oh God. But, but also, you know, it's an incredibly enlightening psychedelic. And I've, I love it so much. And now, you know, having some kind of sloppy meditation practice, you know, it's exciting. It's an exciting experience to like every once in a while have glimpses of a place that I thought I could only get to with like 200 plus micrograms you know that I think that's kind of the double edge sort of psychedelics is on one hand it's like look here do you think you know you think you think your identity is something here try this and you know you will experience some form of dissolution I don't think there's a way to avoid it depending on dosage you know yeah and yet you still recrystallize you know and then of course that place that you're talking about that your girlfriend experience is the which I've been to is the place where you're desperately just digging your fingernails in this into like whatever you picture is the thing in front of the abyss that you're getting pulled into and you're just trying not to get sucked into that not understanding the moment that you let go you're going to have the greatest experience of your life but that doesn't make any sense at all when you're tripping you know that you did what you're this I don't want to die I mean that's you know I'm sorry if I'm rambling too much about acid I'm you know Buddhism and comedy but anyway to me there is that that thing that you're talking about the heart sutra you know that that that is this to me the the if there ever was a way to articulate that experience and I think what's very interesting about the experience or in other words like it's whatever the method that you have used to cease to exist you only it's only when you stop ceasing to exist that you begin to you know you the commentary comes from the moment you come back to yourself you know when you're Well and you know Duncan on on the midnight gospel you know that was such an interesting thing because you just invited me to come in and we started reading some lines and then we improvised a bit and we ended up in the meditation instruction I flat out borrowed from Tenzin Wangel Rinpoche I want to give that to him right now who is a great Dharma teacher and you know very fluent in English and Western culture and he's developed this thing called the three pills which is silence stillness and spaciousness yeah if you just take those three pills like if we don't you know I hope everybody can come and take our meditation training and so forth but if you don't take those three pills sometime in the next month maybe take them like for 15 or 20 minutes a day maybe you can get more articulated meditation instruction about how to work with the myriad manifestations of your mind that arise during that silence stillness and spaciousness but just leaving some space is so rare yeah it's so rare so rare yeah being still is rare yeah so you know these are kind of universal even if you go into you know theistic traditions that have a kind of contemplative aspect they're still going to talk about those three things it's not uniquely Buddhist actually yeah right do you think of Buddhism as a revolutionary practice you know at the time it was Buddhist time you know definitely he was throwing off some like for example he threw over the caste system in his group that was a big like those are the Republicans of that day they're going like yeah everybody's born with a fate a karma a destiny and he's saying no way you can change it so that's a revolutionary but revolutionary in relationship to the existing culture and I think it can become Orthodox you have seen Buddhism become Orthodox and it just takes on the same you know it's got to be this you got to do the four this the three that so there's traditionally people who come along periodically and just mess the whole thing up and shake it up you know and that's what I think all the a lot of inspiring teachers to different degrees you know but it should shake up your concept yourself if that's not happening a little bit and it's just strengthening a concept of self and I know I know the formulas and I know the chance and I know the sadhana practices and it becomes a kind of you know living rigor mortis of with with a sort of handsome ritual attached to it. I don't think that's what's intended. Yeah, you know what I mean mortis with a handsome ritual attached to it. Well, I mean, but revolutionary in the sense of that it is in the interest of all the people trying to sell us stuff that we're always moving. You know there's not you don't you don't see a lot of like if if we're existing in a world where all our data is being sort of that we is being recorded, and then that data is being fed into some algorithm that's then trying to create desire inside of us. And that and the desire manifests as some fervent action either to make more money to get the thing we desire to get the thing, and especially if like the, the idea of the three root clay that poisons the three poisons what are they desire, ignorance, aggression aggression yeah so that means that if if something is trying to instill desire in you through some algorithm algorithm. Algorithm, then it's it's literally trying to induce the suffering of desire inside of you. And so when I say revolutionary I mean anything that is subverting that the algorithms ability to implant desire and do you anything that's messing up the way the way desire works anything that's even introducing you to the weirdest concept maybe you can correct me on this that the within the desire is actually the feeling you're looking for that that this is this mess is the whole game up you know it really if the game is. Oh, once you go over there you're going to feel better. Once you have this thing you're going to feel better. And then there's some method you can call whatever you want. Duncan, you know, depending how cynical the the wielding of that algorithm is, there's a lot of aggression in it. So, and I'm thinking right now, really, we're part of a new, very new, very innovative algorithmic production which is probably your savvy on this kind of stuff has probably gotten out of the hands of the human beings who created in the first place already. It's not like the algorithm sorry Instagram but that's being created on Instagram is, you know, diabolic in times of trying to keep up with it like I've watched when I sort of go through it and how it's responding to me it's almost like a conversation going on. But it's like, it's like a casino, the odds are to the house. It's not your game it's not like you and I sitting down and playing blackjack it's the casino is like just needs to win 51 52% of the time. And it's, and anybody can win big you or I could go in and get enlightened but they go okay well we're just creating a, you know, a tableau of confusion and and also feeding off people's hungryness. Yeah, and emptiness in the wrong way. So, yeah, so that's a good thing to keep in mind is the the are we subconsciously participating in stuff. We have to we can't just go with the conscious stuff we have to look into the infrastructure the systemic stuff for so for a modern Buddhist I think it's much more appropriate than it might have been to look at the systemic part of the system. You know, it seems like the basic stuff that, you know, Budo is dealing with. It's just showing up in a more in a technological way, like, you know, like you do you throw paint on the invisible man. You know what I mean that's what technology does it's like it's not like the algorithm didn't already exist the algorithm existed wherever there was anything trying to seduce you. The analysis of your whatever the way you know how you since the beginning of whenever that this has been the, you know, any grifter like takes a look at you and thinks oh you seem lonely. Okay, I'll present to you the possibility I could make you less lonely or oh you seem hungry maybe I'll trick you into thinking I can get you more food or oh you seem greedy I'll make you think you can be rich or oh you seem worried about your health I'll make you more worried about your health and then pretend to be a doctor. These things have been going on forever it's just now an AI has figured out how to do it, and you know it's doing it with sadly more precision, but, and the, what to me like one thing that would completely destabilize that things ability would just be a simple. Dissolution of the self I mean the thing depends on you like having some like desires, something you're afraid of you know I get these pop up sometimes that's like symptoms of hepatitis, just show some guy holding his leg. And I'm like oh my god I held my leg the other day it hurt, do I have hepatitis, but I mean like that kind of stuff like it's either trying to scare you, make you hungry, you know what I mean but all those, these are these poisons that are elucidated in Buddhism. You know, they're they're being elucidated because of the possibility that there is a way for them to no longer cause suffering. And so, that's why I think it's a revolutionary practice, not revolutionary in the sense of like overthrowing the state as is earlier, but revolutionary in the sense that the gears of society as we understand them. So, I think that all of the economy depends on people subscribing to the idea that upon attaining this thing or that thing, they will experience peace. I mean it's it's the most satanic thing of all time. When you think about it. Thank you Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

Well, it's so nice to have all these folks present with us. So if I could. Hey, David, what's the difference between a chickpea and a garbanzo bean? Oh, geez. One is a Buddha and one is a Buddha doesn't cost $500 to have a garbanzo bean in your mouth. I didn't see it coming. I feel like somebody just threw a pizza in my face. Okay, well, with that in mind, it's probably a perfect segue for the mindless meditation teacher training program, which I just wanted to say a couple of words about. And since quite a few of the folks here are regulars, it's nice. First of all, it's great to see everybody and it's also kind of cool to see some of the new folks. But we've been having at Dharma Moon, a training course called mindless meditation teacher training program 100 hours. I'm going to be very brief about this. It starts March 11 with a weekend program that you can take as a standalone. So maybe back you can put that in the chat first so people can see it. And with a full five weekend program that is over about four months and quite a few of the Dunkites, we call them Dunkites Dunk and there is a lot of Dunk energy. What's that? These are my friends. Well, but but I'm just, I have to give them some acronym otherwise it's hard to identify. And it's we have one starting and then there's a early bird on it till February 10. If you want to jump in if you want to find out more about it will put the link in the chat. And we're hoping that you can at least come and check us out. We have an info session on February 2. If you want to come to that. It's a great gathering just like this. It's not as different from this as you might think. We do get precise about talking about meditation practice and and mainly teaching other people how to do it. Well, that's what I love about you. That's one of the many things I love about you, David is that you're so precise and you're it's like your inability to like completely diverge from what could easily turn into some kind of, you know, boring sanctimonious, too strict thing to like going into the outer realms I don't know how many times you have completely pulled the rug out from under me and the most subtle way where for you to it's you're an amazing teacher and I hope people will take your class. Thank you Duncan and that's you know, at the end of the day, it's a funny thing. All we're left with is a beating heart. All the logic falls away. All the rationale falls away. Even the sense of relativity falls away. And it's so sweet for me to hear you say that. Thank you for saying that. Yeah. And, you know, that's the atmosphere that we've been able to create in this pandemic we've been gathering people together just like this and saying okay it's hard to gather right now and keep our spirits up. So we created a Dharma moon and that's only purpose it has. You know, it's, we're trying to keep it connected and on the ground and operational and a lot of people are working very hard on it but we're not trying to make some kind of like, you know, super techno AI driven meditation app that that helps you sleep better. That's, that's the irony to me is we said Buddha means awake and then a lot of the Buddha's a lot of the apps are like how to get a good night's sleep which is good Buddha said you should get a good night's sleep to be fair. And you should eat well and you should take care of yourself. That'd be really weird if you said you should never sleep. Well, some religion let's face it the religion when the last that long. Well, you know what they are famous Tibetan teachers in the last century. I'm sure there are some yogis in the hills now there was a teacher named. Very famous, highly realized at the master who sat in a box. They have a meditation box and he did not lie down to go to sleep. He might have maybe dozed off a little bit. But, you know, and as you said earlier the dream states are viewed as another opportunity to practice in more advanced practice so that the lucid dream that you had is something that can be cultivated. And when you cultivated it you also develop the ability to see the loser equality of daily life. Do you think anybody ever opened the box, not knowing. No, no, the box he was in there. Oh, no, he's sitting there. It's just it's just it's just and people are coming in all the time and he's teaching and transmitting, you know, to people. Yeah, it's close box. No, that's called a coffin. That's a different thing. Yeah. No, it was just a kind of level of discipline that I've seen dunking with my own eyes with some of these people that is out of the range, you know, of, of what we think of as cultivation, it's like 100%. There's no kind of holding back there's no doubt there's no, I'll take not exploding in rage and traffic. And you know what, maybe you incarnations down the line I'll be the grumpy, non sleeping box. But the people who did sit up like that they say don't blow your cool in traffic. That's that's that that teaching if you know look at the Dalai Lama or something like that. That's mostly what he would say. How much traffic do they have to deal with if they're in a box all day. Well, you know what there's mind traffic and it's the same you've sat you've sat meditated how much traffic did you deal with while you were sitting and meditating. Oh my God, are you kidding. It's it's worse right. Traffic's not even the right word for it. Yeah, just you're right. No, exactly. No, you're totally right. Of course, and I'm obviously I don't mean a blasphemer the was his name I feel clearly that's an aspiration to get to I guess. And you'd have to, you know, experience teachings from somebody like that. His name was to go. You just G Y E N, and he had four sons who are wandering the earth now teaching one of his Mingyue Rinpoche who's a very famous teacher. Oh my God, I just made fun of Mingyue Rinpoche's dad. Great. You did. But but none of them would mind. I think you're okay because we're not in Catholic school right now. That's true, but still I love him so much I can't believe and I remember him talking about his dad and being like wow. Yeah, his dad, his dad was like a real adept, a real yogic adept and you know. But where do they get the box do they know it's just like it's like a you know just has a back and sides. It's all in the cushion in it so when you're sitting if you if you lean back a little bit you can just kind of relax a minute, as you're just sitting in full. It's just there's a less of a differential between sleep and awake. Okay, I got you. And they say that great masters can kind of meditate 24 seven. Even in a sleep physical sleep their mind is awake. We're not as you said we're we're just trying to get to the point where we go like, could I understand the foundation of my own grouchiness. Yes, maybe kind of give can I give my family and friends a break without without being too harsh on myself in the bark. That's where I'm at that's exactly it. That's what I'm at. That's where I'm at. We're at the same place. So the box is like a chair. Your cushion is the box. Your chair is the box. That's right. And you're in it for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. But the principle is the exact same. You're the mind is coming up with stuff and you're learning to not to fixate too much on the content, but return to the ground of awareness that's generating the content. That's our meditation, right? Well, yeah, I mean, yes. And what I find really interesting about it is what you just said, and all the various things that you might hear. If you study Buddhism. It's so interesting over the course of like practicing it though those sentences like, I don't know how to put it but they change like not like, you know that you're you're understand it's interesting the way something so simple as the cause of suffering is attachment, or there is suffering or something so simple is that over the course of like working with someone like you are having some kind of practice or working with any of the awesome teachers out there. Those, I don't know, it's interesting how the those ideas become sweeter and sweeter and sweeter, you know, they go from being this kind of boring, like what does that even mean or a furiously simple things to see me. I don't know how to put it, it gets sweet. So far, I don't know if it stays sweet there I'm sure there's something around the corner that sucks but it seems very sweet. You know, it depends what you experience and what you've been told and what you feel is possible, but from my perspective it gets sweeter and sweeter. Cool. And the reason is because you're just fighting it less and less and you're allowing people to be who they are, you're allowing yourself to be who you are. And it's, it's less ambitious and it's less greedy and it's less goal oriented. Yeah. And, and, you know, they, there's a lot of things to say about it. But that's, that's, that's enough said and I think the main thing is that our experience learning how to sit for 20 minutes a day is not that different from what we're talking about with somebody who's a great, a very accomplished meditator sitting in a box 24 hours the same process of tuning in and working with the mind. Right. And opening up the gateway beyond habitual pattern so that you can be kind to people even when you feel a little grouchy. Yes, that, I mean, that's, to me, that's it. That's, if there's it, that's it. That's all that matters. I'm a dad now. I've got, I can't, I can't be like a grouchy, like awkward, mean person anymore. I just can't. Well, and your mom was so sweet. Thanks. I mean, at least from that episode, she seemed like a very wise and kind of realized person. Well, you know, I think that that's, she had a practice and you know, I think that that's one of the things that happen when you have a practice is that when you, when you die, that when you're dying, you know, when you listen to that conversation, she was dying, actively dying, but that, that, that, you know, all that's left is the sweetness. You know, it seems like, and I think maybe some people when they're dying, they get scared or some people when they're dying, they get really pissed off. I mean, I've heard you die like you live, like you sort of relive your life and the days leading up to your death. And so, you know, I think for anybody who hasn't seen Midnight Gospel, watch the eighth episode, which is Duncan and his mother very close to when she passed away. And man, that's, that's transcends the genre that you, that you, it's so cool because you set us into a genre which is kind of rapidly moving and shifting and changing. And that one at the end, you just cadence with the kind of most tender part of the journey. Yeah, well, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. A lot of people read that understood that. Thank you. Thank you. So if I see some questions coming in about the about the teacher training and back, I'm wondering if you can put the link for where they can email if you have any questions about the teacher training. Or Dharma Moon in general, we have a website, but we also have an email address. Bec, are you still here? Could you just say the name of that address? Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I've already posted it twice in the chat. The email is assist at Dharma Moon.com. Yeah. ASSIST at Dharma Moon.com. And the thing about that is that I see people having questions about, you know, when is it and could I get a scholarship or a payment plan and all you need to do is write in there. We try to make it so that people can comment if they want to come. So, so please feel free to write in there if you have any questions. And Duncan, I thought maybe be fun to open up the mic a little bit and see if anybody has anything, you know, thoughts or questions they want to share. Is that cool? Yes. Okay. So, remember, oh, I see people are ready to go right away. So, Bec, you want to moderate? Sure, I'll be happy to. Let's invite, let's see here. Vivian, go ahead and unmute. I feel like I just raised my hand. Some other people had their hands up before me. So I'm going to have them take a shot before I go. Okay. Yeah. It is very sweet. Yeah, just a whole bunch of them popped up at once. Let's see here. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. Can I interrupt? I'm so sorry. I'm not sure. I don't think the Instagram people are going to hear these questions. I'll repeat the question. So if you could, yeah, that's, boy, savvy there. So Instagram people. They're asking questions now, y'all. Yeah. Instagram. So yeah, so I'll try to repeat the question, but that would mean, can you make it concise if that's possible, not going too long, and then we can share it. Okay, so. How about Eric and Nell? Okay, Eric and Nell. Hey guys. Thank you so much. It's an honor to be here. We're big fans. So quickly, I just have a question. Duncan earlier talking about like getting, you know, when you're serving, it gets down in the way as we call it the washing machine. It's like that pattern that cycle. Yeah. I was wondering, what do you guys do to like break that pattern? Right? Like what are some things? I mean, obviously sitting, but and that's working for me in my life, but Okay, let me pass that question along. Okay. Okay. If I can, if I can just make it concise like that. Okay. So the question is from Eric and Nell. And the question is, when you're getting washboarded in that way, you know, as a metaphor, what are some things you can do to change the pattern that's locking you in there? Is that right? Did I get that right? Yeah. Okay. What are some of the things you can do to, well, that's a good question, Duncan. What are some things you would do? Well, okay. When I'm surfing, depending on the wave, of course, I've surfed some pretty big monster waves headed out. Actually, no, I am. I'm flying out tonight to the Antarctica. There's a big swell out there. Ice surfing is what I'm into. I have a grappling hook. I keep it on my back. And so if I get rolled, I throw the hook up. I've got a trained team that like snatches the hook attaches it to a boat pulls me up. The as with the meditation stuff. I really don't think I have a good, I don't have a good answer to that. I, I, the, the, I've learned from David though that the sort of the futility of trying to stop it. And I've heard Jack cornfield say, the mind makes thoughts the way the tongue salivates. So, you know, it's like, how do you stop your tongue from making spit? How do you start? It's like, so, so, and I think there's something in the consideration of the entire process of thinking, including the emotional continuum too, which in Buddhism also gets noted as thinking. There's something really great about sort of disowning the idea that you own the thoughts or the feelings that this is even you and in allowing yourself the fantasy that this is just a kind of, you know, it's like, you can have a particularly vile thought and spend days thinking to yourself, my God, what's wrong with me? Like, why did I think that and completely forget? It's not like you were sitting around like God, please let me just think the most horrible, shitty, rotten, disgusting thought that anyone's ever thought in their lives. It's not like you ordered it or something and your subconscious like, Oh, I've got something really good. Here you go. It just pops up. And then, and then you get caught up in judging yourself for having that versus like other forms of flatulence. You know what I mean? You don't, you forget right away, you know, some vile burp or something, you know, you're not like, you're not, you have a particularly disgusting burp, you're not spending the next, you're not talking to your therapist like, Oh my God, it was so horrible. Duncan, if you given him a really simple answer, what would it be? Yeah, I would say, touch and go, the chogum chump idea, touch and go, you know, which is sort of like, this thing isn't about necessarily like suppressing or ignoring, but rather, yeah, there's the thought. And then, and then let it, that's it. It's gone now. And then there's another one and another one and another one and another one and somewhere in this sitting practice that I've had. There's at the very least recognition that these things can't be quite as important as they're making themselves out to be if there's so many of them. And you don't even know when they start or end. You know, there's a Mahayana slogan. The lo-jong slogans. Duncan, have you looked at that ever lo-jong? Yeah, I've just been getting into it lately. Oh good, auspicious. So there's one that says change your attitude and relax as it is. Just relax as it is. And it's not the kind of relaxing where you go to sleep exactly but you go with the energy of the situation more. And you stop fighting. And that's a good instruction for real life and for meditation practice. Just relax. That, in fact, that's actually a very advanced instruction. You can't really say that to a beginner because they'll go, what do you mean, you know, I mean, but relax a little bit. Like, it's not, it's not the, that syllable, ah, is the essence of letting go in that way. You make that sound. Ah. There's a lot of space. You know, more than we're comfortable with sometimes. So why don't we see anybody other questions? Thank you. Long days, pleasant nights. Yeah, thank you. Great meeting you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, how about Nick, Nick Burr? Duncan, do you know Nick? Oh, no, he doesn't. Not now. Hey, Nick. Hey, how's it going? I've been listening to your podcast. You introduced me to David without knowing it. For years, you've been a little Buddhist earworm. So I guess my question's a little, a little interesting. I'm in David's meditation teacher training course. And earlier you were talking about how Instagram and like the algorithm has become just like a. Nick, remember the people on, on, on Instagram cannot hear this. So if everybody can be concise, I know that's challenging. Just like it, just a concise thing. And then I'll pass it through to them. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So the, the algorithm is like desire and a lot of passion and aggression. So what if you do what are your thoughts of trying to make an AI that cultivates precision gentleness and letting go. Okay, so friends in Instagram. Interesting question from our friend Nick, who is taking the training program right now. We're having some great questions coming from him. What are Duncan's thoughts about creating an algorithm as long as we're in that space that is structured to cultivate the qualities of gentleness precision and letting go or something actually beneficial because the algorithms are sort of organized on a different premise. What about doing that? Any thoughts, Duncan? What a great question. Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, wherever there's a thing it's opposite could exist. And I think lots of people are stumbling on this possibility with that with like, Oh right, the algorithm doesn't it's just, it's doing what it's what the code is telling it to do. It's doing this sort of corporate manipulation and with varying degrees of sophistication. So maybe there's a way to make it to turn it into something that's actually yeah what like what you're saying, doing it doing the opposite. My, if like the sad answer I think would be the reason the algorithm has been trained to do these things is because it's making billions of dollars for corporate. And so, you know, I think it's going to be like, I, you know what, I think we can predict something like a more peaceful algorithm brought to you by Citibank. You know what I mean? Like, there's always going to be, it's something really interesting, isn't it? Like the way that the whatever the thing is will almost instantaneous the moment it enters into capitalism, it gets warped, or it gets, you know, branded or something like that. But I think, you know what, it is a possibility. I think what you're talking about, it must be a possibility. And I think in all the scary talk about AI what you're talking about gets completely left out. And that there is an equally positive, if there's like some horrible possibility from any technology, then it's generally that technology could be used for something incredibly beautiful and powerful and transformative. This is, you know, I know you've heard this idea that a lot of the technology that we're enjoying right now in the world started in the military. And then, you know, it was advanced by people trying to figure out better ways to kill people. And then it, you know, we're using that stuff. So yeah, I think I hope it happens. I can't wait. Maybe that's the matreya, maybe the next Buddha is just an algorithm or something, you know, or some kind of AI that imperfectly embodies the Dharma. Who knows, why not? Can robots get enlightened? Thank you. Thank you. Do you have any thoughts on that, David? Do you think robots can get enlightened? Yeah, it's sort of an interesting, I mean, Duncan and I have kitted around or not so much kidding around about like each one of us, they develop a 2.0 version of Duncan. And then people would rather go see the 2.0 AI in the club and Duncan's playing at the club next door with three old ladies drinking a beer. So I think the problem is pretty simple, which is disembodiment. That's what I see as something that is probably not going to lead to the result people want. Because the body in at least from a Buddhist perspective and I think other traditions is the seed of wisdom. Oddly, it's also gives us the most pain, the most problem. And it's also the most impermanent aspect, obviously impermanent aspect. But it seems like when you meet somebody who's got wisdom, it's embodied. It's in the way they walk and talk and communicate. And we're moving into a disembodied universe. That's what I think. I don't think it's necessarily, maybe there'll still be ways for people to connect with their bodies or leave their bodies completely. I don't know. But the body is one of the three sort of seeds of wisdom in terms of the way Buddhists have traditionally thought about those things. And that would that would lead to a serious disembodied kind of quality. But David, wouldn't you say that if you are someone who's completely trapped, if you're someone who's completely reactive, if you're someone completely functioning by this basic coding mechanism, known as the three poisons. What's the difference between you and a robot anyway? What's the difference? In fact, wouldn't you say anyone who is purely reactive is essentially mechanical? That when you find yourself hyper crystallized in your karmic karma to the point where you're not even aware that you aren't your thoughts, you're running on autopilot. You are sort of a robot. Well, wouldn't the coon, the modern coon would be, does a robot have Buddha nature? It used to be, does a dog have Buddha nature? Does a robot have Buddha nature? You see people vetting that in science fiction movies. Is there some point at which digital organism could be sentient? There's a lot of current science fiction that pivots off of that. So the short answers, I don't know. Yeah, that's definitely the right answer. Yeah. Yeah. But thank you for asking. And maybe we could take two more questions. Thank you so much. Great. Great. All right, so two more. All right, let's let's hear from the ladies. Vivian, are you ready to ask your question? Hello, everyone. Hello, Duncan. Hi, David. Hi. Okay, I wrote down my question. So it goes by real quick. But just want to say it took the teacher training course. It's really good. One of the takes we go over is the wisdom of no escape. And the three themes that we really talk about is gentleness, precision and letting go. And my question is about letting go. So when you experience a really good joke, you know, there's, you know, you start to laugh and that peak of that laughter, you've lost complete control. Like, that's a form of letting go. And like, I'm wondering, because you're a, you know, a comedian, what your thoughts on that. So can you ask that I want to repeat it for the, for the Instagram folks, can you ask it in one simple question? A magical ability of allowing people to let go. What are your thoughts on that? Okay, so what, what Vivian is asking is humor has a magical ability to help people to just let go. And what is any thoughts from Duncan about that? Well, great to me. I, you know, I think in really great comedy, and you do see this, there's a Buddhist idea of poison in the medicine. And so quite often you will see, you know, I mean, I can remember watching Richard Pryor do a joke about after he burned himself, I think from smoking crack, how painful it was to have the skin taken off of his body from being burnt. And the way he was so funny, that the way he took, like, if I, you know, if I see if someone just said, you know, yeah, a couple of years ago, I had to go in the hospital and I was badly burnt from a cocaine addiction and they scraped my flesh off and it was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. Nobody's laughing. That's the most horrible story. And yet, coming from him, somehow, everyone's just laughing. It's so funny. And somewhere in that laughter, I think what you're talking about is a sort of the experience of all that suffering me alchemized. Something is happening there that's more than a joke working or something you're you're you're witnessing the read I don't know what it is some kind of magical thing that's happening where you're in the moment, this thing that's the most awful thing ever in this person's vulnerability and artfulness and ability to express it. They're not just transforming their own suffering into something that is the very least it's making people laugh. At the most it's it's embracing the reality of human suffering as a whole, you know, and the possibility that even with that suffering, there's still the ability to so many rotten things about the human experience into something that makes people laugh. Maybe that's too complex answer, you know, with God, I'm so bad at talking about comedy, I don't know, but I do know I know that experience that you're talking about, and being in an audience and, and being caught up in like that moment is just so healing so weirdly healing so precious to say that but my God I've walked out of good comedy shows, feeling like, you know, great for days like so. Yeah, whatever that is is quite powerful. And where are you. When you when you're experiencing that where are you. Joe so he's asking where are you when you're experiencing that if those folks in Instagram couldn't hear it. Where are you, when you're when you're when you're lost and laughter where are you. Well, I mean, I think we're gonna have to do like the Ram Dass level thing aren't we like you know clearly you're hopefully you're wherever you were when you started laughing, hopefully didn't you didn't laugh yourself and you didn't evaporate yourself. No, I got to tell you that would be an incredible night if you told a joke that made the audience disappear from laughter, but Duncan Duncan wouldn't be funny if like the heart attack sutra you know when Buddha taught that some of the people died if you're in a comedy club and you guys often say I killed tonight but actually people died in the audience from laughing. That would be good or bad. The worst night of your life. If they died laughing. Well, for one it's like going to mess up your show if someone in the middle of a great joke keels over now you're where are you going to bring the audience back after they have to haul someone out. David would be I don't want anyone to die during during a show that would be raw raw. But I'd know some comedians have died on stage. Oh yeah. In the middle of a set. Absolutely because there's video of it online you can find it like a British comedian people just kept laughing they thought he was doing a bit. And I know it's yeah but I take the other I think it's a really great question and I think there's a lot of a lot of answers I like I would like to imagine I like the idea that maybe if in that moment where everyone's laughing and truly laughing and lost in the laughter maybe you you do sort of become temporarily part of the part of everything maybe there is a universal sort of shared experience of laughter I don't know. It's a great question though. Where are you when you sneeze. I think there's something about the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. It says where you are when you of course Douglas Adams came up with that. Duncan sorry to interrupt but we lost you on the Instagram feed I'm not sure exactly why but let me see if I see. I don't know you have to re invite me I think it was just it just kicked me because I've been on it too long. Oh yeah is that right. Edward any idea how we can get that back. I think you just have to re invite me. Okay. Or you might have to let go. I think that's going to be hard to do with everything that's going on here let's see if it's. I'm re inviting you. Let's see if that works. If that works we'll go with it. I'm back. You're back. Okay. Thanks Monica. So great that was this is the first time I've ever done Instagram live so excuse. Any. Obstacles that we've encountered that way. So I think at this point sorry I know there's folks who have questions and I see Puccini in the audience and that's like you know I want to ask about some of those operas but I think let's do one more. Okay let's do Puccini then and since Puccini are you there. I don't see your. Visit. Thank you Vivian. Thanks Vivian great meeting you. Puccini you're the last one to speak okay. Okay thank you so much. And if you could keep it concise so I can repeat it for the Instagram folks. Yes of course so. Thank you yeah. I think my question kind of. It's very related to what Vivian asked and my question is just how do you let go of the past when you've been living in the past for so long I feel like. Great. Yeah that's so good can I just go with that the way you just asked. Simple and elegant and to the point so what our friend is asking is how do you let go of the past when you've been living in the past for so long. Yeah that's powerful. Yeah don't you want to take a shot. Oh I'd love to. I'm going to give a rotten answer though you have to look up Marcus Aurelius he did this there's an essay he wrote. About this very thing and it's people who are worried about dying actually and he was making just an incredible point which is bad news you can hold on to the past like the idea that you can let go of the past implies you can hold on to the past. And that idea has within it this this tragic conceptualization of everything that happened before now is being a thing that you can hold on to. It's gone I mean at least as far as we're concerned in this place that we're in the bardo of becoming you kids gone there's no way to get it back it's just gone you can't hold on to it. And so that's the good news which is you actually haven't been holding on to the past at all what you've probably been doing is habitually like remembering something. But that's not the past that's just a some kind of neurological echo of the past which usually and also if you look at their memories that you're having at the past they're not that great. If you ever go that far with it where you're like let me just look into these memories that are haunting me so much I don't know if you ever do that David. But like memories are at least I mean I don't know I've like honestly I've been doing drugs since I was in the ninth grade so my memories are particularly like just you know when you old film muddy grainy stuttery big those burnt spots in them. They're not also I don't think they necessarily match exactly what happened in the past and. Well and Duncan there's one thing you said that can elaborate on a little. It actually isn't the past. The memories of the past happened in the present right and my suggestion to Puccini is the Puccini do you practice meditation. Not as frequently as I would like but I definitely would like to. Dr Nick turn is prescribing take two sit pills every day and and call in about a week because in the meditation you you're performing a simple cleansing ritual of recognizing that those thoughts about the past are actually in the present. You can see that and you're actually also putting energy and discipline into bringing your mind and your attention back into the present in the form of the experience of breath or whatever you're using. And as a gradual shift like a muscle you have a big muscle that's used to thinking certain thoughts that are dwelling in the past. But if you every once in a while when you notice that you labeled thinking now you're bringing your attention back to the present like right now right Puccini. You're not in the past right now right. Oh yeah exactly because I'm very concentrated on what you're saying exactly the point so he's not in the past because he's concentrated on what we're saying. And instead of us having to be there talking to you all day long, you can just use your own breath your own posture, your own body and come back, but it takes cultivation and that's that that's what I think. And that's what I think why we're advocating mindfulness meditation is it builds up a kind of strength of coming back into the present and you can do it. Puccini you can definitely do it. I'm just going to tell you flat out you can do it. And we will help you will help you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm a big fan of both of you so that means a lot. Thank you. By the way, I'm from Columbia so. Okay. I'm from over the world, yes. Okay so Puccini everybody is in Columbia right now, not Columbia University either. Yeah. So I think unfortunately I apologize that's all the time we have for Q&A. We should, you know, spend the last five minutes just closing up the container. And in a kind of. So I wanted to say a couple of things. I'm, I'm choked up a little bit Duncan. I love you and I'm so happy to have you here doing this with us and the kind of conversations we've had have been rare, like rarefied atmosphere of like having fun goofing around and really getting at the true meaning of stuff. Well I don't take them for granted David. So on behalf of everybody at Dharma Moon want to thank you for being part of the ecosystem and such an important part. And also you're honest, you know, I don't need a lot of honest people actually. And so I want to also thank the Dharma Moon team that you don't see them, but it takes a lot of work to put these things together. And we just got the Instagram feed working at the one minute to seven. That was a lot of people leaning in working together. And so I know we're reaching quite a few people in the Instagram world and in the zoom world. This recording of today's talk will be available to you. So if you just have registered for for tonight and you could probably go do it right now if you want. Go to Dharma Moon.com there's a banner on the top and you register we will send you email you a recording of this evening's exchange. And so we plan to do more of these kind of things where we can just talk maybe a little bit. Less formally about these things. And I want to remind you that if you're interested in getting involved with this community, which is burgeoning at the moment and growing with a lot of heart, even though it's all online, it's just stunning to me. I wasn't sure we could pull it off that it would still have enough heart to be worth the effort, but people are really connecting and connecting with the Dharma in a really genuine way. So just go to Dharma Moon.com and all the, all the, you know, information you need to say or write to assist at Dharma Moon. And because it assisted Dharma Moon or assisted Dharma Moon.com assisted Dharma Moon.com. That's your that's your ticket to ride we have some back and Renee are there and they'll write back to you and back. Go back. Sorry. Is that a dog or a cat or a child? Who is it? I've got a, again, David. I keep them down here. I'm so sorry. Igor. It's making it impossible to do podcasts from down here, honestly. Yeah. Well, and also for those of you, I think most of you do know Duncan, but you should check out as I, when I need a laugh, actually, I like to listen to Duncan's podcast and sometimes the podcast themselves are funny, but the intros are always like laugh out loud stuff for me. And also he's a cool musician. He's making the musical intros and I'm working on learning music right now. Yeah. So hopefully you can visit with Dharma Moon and with Duncan Trussell for, you know, the foreseeable future. And we'd love to hear from you and thank you so much for coming everybody. Great meeting you all. Thanks for having me on David. I really enjoyed this conversation. Thank you. Wonderful. Okay. That was David Nickturn everybody.

It is I, Dee Jucel, and this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. If I sound different to you, it's simply because this is the month of October. This is the month of mystery. It is this month where we do not celebrate something idiotic like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, but something real, true, something very, very human, which is darkness. It was October 1978. Joanna Maloney, a beautiful 35-year-old fashion model with the heart of a poet, was taking a walk in a small national park 30 miles away from her home in upstate Kentucky. She'd often gone on this walk to clear her head to get some exercise, but on this day, she was going for a different reason altogether. She had had a dream the night before, where two squirrels and an owl had told her that if she were to take this very walk at exactly 3 PM, the following day she would find treasure there in that national forest. And so smiling and not really taking the dream seriously, but thinking to herself, you never know, she decided to listen to the owls, to listen to the squirrels. And she got in her white Chevy pickup truck and headed up the road for a hike of mystery. Halfway there, she passed a beautiful hitchhiker. He had incredible abdominal muscles, long flowing blonde hair, a tattoo of the peace sign, a hippie symbol of love and unification on his back. She says that she thought he seemed special and she could see the glint of the sunlight in his blue eyes. So she pulled over, picked him up, continued to drive. He asked her if she wanted to listen to a bootleg of Paul Simon. She told him she would rather that he just eats her pussy while she drove up to the park. He agreed. And as they rode up the road, he began to deliver to her the most powerful session of cunnilingus that she had ever experienced in her life. Even the German shepherds in the backseat experienced orgasm. When she arrived at the forest, the hippie disappeared. She found a note on the car seat saying, this is the treasure I told you about in your dreams. This is a true story that was told to me by your mom. Now, we have a wonderful podcast for you today. With us here is Satanic witch, Zandora Lavey. I have been friends with Zandora for years. I had the honor and good fortune to perform my Satanic pop it act for her at her wedding where she married Stanton Lavey, the grandson of the founder of the church of Satan. We had a wonderful conversation clearing up many of the misconceptions about Lavey and Satanism, witchcraft, Satanism in general. And I'm sure by the end of this episode, you'll see why Zandora and I are friends. Are you interested in commercial free episodes of the DTFH? Then go no further than patreon.com forward slash DTFH.

Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Dunkertrosil video. Zandora, welcome to the DTFH, how you doing today? I'm doing pretty good, how about you, Duncan? I'm good, I'm pretty good, a little tired today, but excited to talk to you. I've really been looking forward to our conversation, because as I've been thinking about the questions I wanted to ask you, I realized I really don't know as much about Satanism as I think I do, as I was contemplating some of these questions, so my first question for you, the most basic ever, what is your definition of Satanism? Well, to me, well, not to me, but Satanism is a non-theistic religion. When we say hell Satan, Satan represents ourselves. It's more of a self-worship religion than, you know, worshiping a deity or a god. We do involve lesser and greater magic, when what that means is like, lesser magic is like more of a psychological manipulation of getting your way and making things happen, right? It's just like a psychological ritual. And then greater magic is ritual magic, which is we usually have a compassion ritual or a destruction ritual. Some choose not to do the greater magic, and it's more of a lesser magic lifestyle thing for them. It's really up to the Satanist. And Satanism is a religion, but it's not, it doesn't have set rules, right? You can still have the ability to be yourself and be open. It's indulgence instead of abstinence, but don't be an asshole, you know? Right. So I hope that helps explain kind of what Satanism is. That is an excellent articulation of it. But with that articulation, the first thing that pops into my mind is from a Satanic perspective, what is this self? What is the identity? If you're worshiping yourself, what are the specifics of that identity that you're worshiping? You know, like, I think with me, especially with Satanic witchery, so much of it does come from my femininity and using that prowess to my power and my advantage at times, right? So, I mean, it's just taking humanism and balling it up into a package where there is ritualism involved, you know? I think worshiping yourself, there is like a materialistic and selfish part that comes, you know, from that in Satanism, but who isn't selfish in an asshole at times? I think that in a world that we're in, it's necessary to be that way to survive, so. But like, when I think of myself, it's scrambled eggs over here. It's like, you know, I don't know what the fundamental self is even. It's a thing that seems to change. Or if I look at myself 10 years ago versus now, it's something of a different self. So, when you say worship of oneself, what does that specifically look like? How do you pull out from your own, I- I think that what that means as self worship is, you know, loving yourself and not feeling guilty when you fuck up and you're a human, you know, like, it's not like you have some sort of identity, like a Satanist is a cookie cutter person because you're a Satanist. I mean, your idea of self worship is up to you, but to me, like I said, it's worshiping my femininity and that is a huge part of Satanism for me is celebrating that and it allows me to do that. And a lot of religions, even in kind of witchcraft, they don't allow women to be at the forefront. They don't celebrate that. And that is a part of my self worship, you know, is loving myself. And I think that people see Satanism in like a really dark way when really it's just kind of a self help book, you know. Got it, okay, got it. Now, dad, yes, thank you. In general, like I think when people hear Satanism, just like you said, they don't think self help. They, here's what they think. They think, well, they hurt children. They sacrifice children. They are part of a dark network, but they're the ones putting the fentanyl in the candy. They're the ones who are, it sort of reminds me of when you hear about the way people thought of witches. If your cow is not producing milk, it's a witch. There's a witch nearby. Maybe your fucking wife, if things are going wrong in society, it's the Satanists. The Satanists have a plan. They're out there erupting. Yeah, you see no Satanists doing, you know, shooting people and killing people. You know, you do see people of certain different religions doing that, but it's usually never Satanism, I mean. We've got, you know, y'all have a few. We have a few. We have a few. We have some serial killers too. You got Ramirez. Yeah. You got Richard Ramirez. You have, who else do you have? Richard Ramirez. Oh, even Dahmer was into the Satanic Bible too, so. You know, who hasn't had a copy of the fucking Satanic Bible in their messy apartment? Give me a break. That's like 81 and 12. I just watched the Dahmer series and they actually have the Satanic Bible sitting in his apartment on the table. I was like, oh, okay. So that's kind of what's out there, right? Like that's kind of what people see as like this Dahmer thing, which I thought was a great show. But like, yeah, of course they're gonna put the Satanic Bible in a serial killer's house to kind of further the narrative that we kill people and sacrifice people and God eat people. We may sacrifice people metaphorically, but it's like in a ritual, you know, like a destruction ritual. If you're gonna curse someone, it is called a destruction ritual. So I mean, you know, there is an energy that's been, you know, propelled towards destruction, but it's not like we will go out and like kill people. You know, everybody has, every religion and every walk of life has their assholes and shitheads. Okay? There's just no way of getting around that because people are individuals and have individual thought. Yeah. But if we're gonna like, you know, there's a professor, David Nut in the UK, he made a harm scale of drugs. What are the most harmful drugs, the least harmful drugs? And he used a lot of cool methods to come up with that. The least harmful drug on the scale, mushrooms physiologically, what it does to you. The most harmful drug, I think it was alcohol, like up there in the sense that it's so available, it fucks your body up, it's everywhere. And then like heroin safer than alcohol. Yeah, believe it or not. Yeah. I mean, I kind of believe that. But if we were to do the same thing for world religions, I think Satanism would fall on the side of like, not hurting people. I mean, if we're really gonna map it out, like what organized religions have caused the most harm in the world, I don't think Satanism is, like, I don't know. Like, I imagine that like under Satanists are gonna be Quakers, probably something like that. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Like something like that. Yeah, but they probably burned witches. I don't think they did. I'm just kidding. They probably thought about it. They probably thought about it.

I was on a lot of acid in those days and I really wish I'd paid more attention. But had I learned French, I could have fulfilled my dream of going to Paris and doing a live recording of an interview with the Parisian Catacombs Caterpillar, a half human, half caterpillar, cryptid, hybrid that apparently lives down there and supposedly knows we're a hidden stash of cigars and fine chiante are deep within the catacombs.

So, okay, I think folks aren't aware of the fact that there are lineages in Satanism. There isn't like just, here's what Satanism is, right? Aren't there various forms of Satanism out there? I was wondering if you could talk about those. Totally, you know, first I'll start with Levet and Satanism. That was created in the 1966 by Anton Levet, the church in San Francisco. And the church of Satan was opened in Onwall Purgesnot, April 30th, 1969. So, I mean, it is a fairly new Western religion, right? So, I think too, that's where some of the confusion comes in because it is such a new religion. There's also the Satanic Temple, who is also an organized Satanic religion, but they take a more political stance, right? Right. They don't only come from ritualism, but they also stand up for abortion rights. They go after states, you know, like through the legal process. I think that they have open abortion lawsuits in Texas, Indiana, and Idaho right now. Yes. And they do all kinds of sorts of things to connect the Satanic community. And I think that's really cool. And they have a headquarters in Salem, Massachusetts, but getting back to the Levet and Satanism, that's kind of the Satanism that I was talking about to you earlier. That's the type of Satanism that I follow. But I do support the Satanic Temple and what they do. I do a lot of events with them. Recently, SatanCon was a spectacular event in Scottsdale, Arizona. So, they told, they said that they couldn't have an event there or I can't remember exactly, put a statue, it was something to do with some religious stuff. But they said, you can't do that here. So, they decided to hold the first largest Satanic convention ever in Scottsdale, Arizona. And the amount of protesters that were there was amazing to see. There were Protestants and Catholics getting in a fist fight brawl over a corner. The Catholics won. But you didn't see any Satanists getting into a brawl. That's what I'm trying to say. It was a pretty peaceful event, but the Christians were there running amuck, I'll tell ya. Well, this, so another sort of preconceived notion people have about Satanism is that it celebrates evil. That there is a celebration of evil. Is that accurate? Would you say Satanism celebrates evil? I think that people confuse one accepting their sexuality as evil. And so many times, sexuality and evil go hand in hand. Now, you see rituals of like Anton Levé in the 60s and there are people with goat heads and pig faces and things like that. Well, that's called a psychodrama. That type of ritual is there to invoke a mood, right? So yeah, Satanism does take a dark connotation, like as far as style. There's a lot of goths that are Satanists, but there's a lot of people like in tech and in law and all these things that you wouldn't expect that are actually Satanists too. So I don't think that necessarily you should go off of judging a book by its cover when it comes to Satanism, but so often, yes, the personification of that in imagery is dark. Well, let's talk about that because something that has always confused me is the idea that goats are evil. I've been around goats. They have to be some of the least scary creatures out there. They're adorable and I mean, maybe they'll butt you. You know, they're strong. You can't move one, like at least I can. If it doesn't want to be moved, it won't really move, but how did the goat get wrapped up as a symbol of darkness? Eliephus Levy is the person who drew the Baphomet originally. And the Baphomet, if you really kind of look at him, is kind of a dual spirit being. He's a them, he's a they, or they are they. Like the goat has a goat head and female tits, you know? So I think that, you know, a lot of the goat really came. It's not as a sacrificial thing or as a representation of evil. It's just, I think, to the horns, the breast, it's a beast and having him stand up on his legs kind of grounds him and gives him power. So I think when he drew that, he was taking all of these things in and just kind of making his own interpretation of what Satan was, or, you know, visual representation. And I think that just really stuck. Yeah, well, you know, the Baphomet drawings that creep me out are the ones where they don't work hard enough to show these are female boobs, where it looks like moobs, or what they call pot tits, or it's like, you know, like the Baphomet. Pancake boobs, pancakes on a nail. Yeah, it's like, no, those are supposed to be like sexy boobs. Yeah, those are supposed to be tits. Not dad boobs. Like come on, work on, let's work on our Baphomet tits out there, Baphomet artists, come on. I think that the Satanic temple took the root of having a male chest, you know, just because they wouldn't be able to publicly put it anywhere. And did you know that his chest was modeled after Iggy Pop? No fucking way. That is not fair. I wanted to, I submitted. They're like, it's snow, the boobs, you can't do it. It's too much, too many moves, we can't do moves. No moves. Another symbol, Satanic symbol, that people are terrified of. I'm walking down the beach some time ago and I'm picking up sand dollars. You know, the little, you know, you know what I'm talking about, the little day of sand dollars. The ones with Jesus inside? Well, they actually have a pentagram on the back. It's like a natural pentagram that forms on the back. I thought it was the funniest thing ever because I'm looking at him like, oh fuck man, these are some evil sea creatures, I guess. It's a naturally occurring form, the pentagram. It's everywhere and yet another symbol that when people see it, they're like, oh, you better watch out, there's a pentagram. What does it mean? Well, so there is two pentagrams really used in magic. One is the inverted pentagram, which the two points are inverted. So they're pointing upwards and that's usually used in black magic, right? And then the other one has the one point pointing up and that's for like wiccan magic, you know? And then like all of the points, it's five points, right? All, you know, air, water, you know, they're, the points also like you can use them in a way that is like, God, I'm sorry, my brain is fidgeting out right now. It's okay. I'm sorry. Let's come back to the pentagram one. We'll come back. That one's a harder one to explain also because it means different things to so many walks of witchcraft that like that is a very like salty territory for me to get into. Okay, I get it. So let's get that one. The last thing I want to do is offend witches. That's what I don't, I don't want to get into that. I don't want, you know, we don't want that. We don't want it. So as I was like explaining it, I was like, ooh, what it means to me? Could it mean ways something else to someone else? I've heard it. It's a representation of appendages, the head, the arms, the legs. Yeah, because they did it with a guy on it and I mean, like that, like I said though, like in different scenarios, like in a ritual, there's like people sitting on each point of the pentagram, you know, there's also, it also represents, you know, East, Northwest, South, you know, you have different ways that you can use the pentagram. So that's why I think like it represents different things to different people and in different situations. I want to thank Zip Recruiter for supporting this mystery month episode of the DTFH.

OK, so going through the main symbols, people associate with Satanism, just to sort of deconstruct them, anecdotally, any time I've been around a Satanic ritual, which I think we could say that the wedding, your wedding that I performed at, was an incredible one. And another one that I was at, the Temple of Satan put one on. And also, when I spent time with you in Stanton, I experienced what I think you're talking about, the aesthetic, the darkness. I experienced a kind of heavy, juicy, powerful vibe. Like it's deep, like something heavy. And these days I've come to associate anything I'm afraid of, that's good. Go towards, you need to explore that. There's something there. But it wasn't comfortable. Not to say that you, when you made fried chicken, gave me absent. That was the most hospitable, sweet, living in LA. You don't need a lot of people from the South. So it was really, really nice. Thank you. But I mean, there's a tangible something there that that. I mean, the goats, I'm sorry. I'm not going to be afraid of goats. Pinnograms? No, I'm not going to be afraid of pentagrams. But the vibe. Yeah, the vibe, too. What's that? OK, well, I think how people believe in the Holy Spirit, and you see these people, yeah, you see these people run up the pews and up the aisles, and they have this feeling inside of them. That's like the type of energy that everyone has within them. And some people know how to conjure that energy better than others. And I think when you were in a situation with two people like Stanton and I, we were very much deeply into Satanism. And the vibe was because that we did vibe on that level. And when you kind of open up your energy, and it is a chaos energy, which definitely followed that relationship, there is definitely a darkness that's going to be opened up and a vibe. So you're saying that might not be so much Satanism as much as two people being really open and then expressing. But I think that is an essence Satanism, because we both harness that energy, right? So I think that during our relationship, there was a lot of ritualism. And that energy and that vibe, especially coming into our home, is always going to be there, you know? Gotcha. So now it's a non-theistic religion, as you said up front. And yet, like in tantric Buddhism, there is a visualization of various deities. But an acknowledgment within that visualization that this is you, like you're seeing yourself. These are ways of seeing yourself. You're not like there's no, I think maybe some potential of a connection between the two is something shows up, which is like, no one's going to save you. You need to realize that, like, you know what I mean? Like you've got to get a hold of that quick, because if you're sitting around waiting for someone to come and save you. That's never going to happen. You're right, but also. Rarely does that happen. Rarely. And even when it does happen, it's like, it's still like, do you always want to be being saved? Do you always want some super man to come down? Do you always want, like, I mean, this to me is like one of the big problems right now is everyone's waiting for someone to save us, you know? And so, and then no one's doing anything. It's like, we've got to get moving here. You've got to do it yourself. Yeah, you've got to. There is nothing supernatural that's going to come down and save you, not even in Satanism, Christianity, or whatever. You have to make those steps yourself. You know, you can, you know, I will say, though, like, I do believe in manifestation, you know, that there is a thing there. And I am a strong believer of that and manifest things all the time, but it doesn't come just naturally. It just doesn't come from me wanting it and thinking about it. There are steps and actions that you have to take to make that manifest and manifestation move forward. So that's magic. I mean, you're just, that's what you're, that's magic. There's really no difference between manifestation and magic. Yeah, yes, essentially. I mean, I say it as manifestation because it's a lot easier for people that don't really, you know, understand magic or Satanism will understand that, you know? But yeah, it is a manifestation magic. That's kind of a part of lesser magic, as I was saying earlier. It's like, like, I guess, like, where maybe some differences appear between Satanism and a thread that runs through the philosophy of my Satanist friends is that it's OK to want stuff. Like, you're allowed to want things, desire not bad, desire good. If you want something, you don't have to start, like, beating yourself up for wanting a thing or feeling greedy or feeling like your malfunction. Especially in a time where self-care and self-love is promoted, you know, like, that should be pretty well understood, you know, that caring for yourself is number one. If you don't love yourself and you can't, you don't care for yourself, your fucking life is probably going to be shit. But I guess so, we'll go back to that. So, you know, the manifestation and, you know, I think some Satanists, because you, it is a super, it's a persecuted religion. Like, the Satanic temple in Salem was set on fire. I believe that was the one that got set on fire. Yeah, and he wore a shirt that said, God. There you go. And I saw news stories on it. And because I'm friends with you and because I'm friends with, like, Mitch Horowitz and a few other Satanists and because I'm, like, I love you guys. And when I saw the news, thank you, when I saw the news stories, and they're, like, doing, like, tongue-in-cheek almost. They're, like, if any other temple, church, synagogue, anything else had been set on fire, it would be national news. Oh, national news. Oh, yeah, seeing it in everywhere. Hate crime. Everywhere. It would be a hate crime. Hate crime. But in this case, it was just kind of like, ah, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? It caused substantial damage to the front of that house, and there were people inside. People could have died. People could have burnt to death. It was an attempted witch burning. It was an attempt. It was just, like, in Salem. It's just, like, what the fuck? Let's go retro here. I mean, we don't have to build the fucking. I'm sorry, it's not funny, but that was funny. Yeah, well, you got to lighten it up a little bit. I mean, yes. But it's like, you know, to me, that's one of the curiosities of it as a religion, is that it gets constantly shit on, attacked. You should see the messages I receive from Christians online. I mean, telling me I'm going to burn in hell, and like, they hope my whole family burns in hell, and it's like, you can pretty much leave my family out of this, thank you. And it's like, I don't go to Christian, you know, webpages and cause, you know, a ruckus. And I don't understand why they have to, like, always come and target Satanists or, you know, anyone, like, in the occult, because we pretty much mind our own fucking business. Right, right. Well, I mean, yeah, and the where is turn the other cheek here? Where is forgiveness? I mean, I think. Exactly. You know, I'll just read this, one of my favorite Mark Twain quotes here. He's the best. He's the best. I'm pretty sure he was one of y'all. De facto Satanist. De facto Satanist, and I want to talk about that. And I'm sorry for familiar this, for the folks listening. Mark Twain said, but who prays for Satan? Who in 18 centuries has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most, our one fellow and brother, who needed a friend, yet had not a single one, the one sinner among us all, who had the highest and clearest right to every Christian's daily and nightly prayers for the plain and unassailable reason that this was the first and greatest need, he being among sinners, the supremist. Have you ever heard that before? I have not heard that before. I mean, there's so many Mark Twain. I'm gonna have to really re-read that. That was very deep, Mark Twain. Our brother. Our brother. Our brother. Yeah, yeah. You know, there's so many Mark. What's that? He's like sounding all Hellfire Club right there. I know, but to me, it's like, look, if the idea is prayer, forgiveness, love, compassion, why are you persecuting people who are, at least in my experience, some of the sweetest people I've ever met? Now, answer this for me. When you have, you've taught me a lot in some of our conversations, one of the things you're like, say what you're thinking, say how you're feeling, let it out, what's going on, don't hide stuff, what's going on. So here's my suspicion. I was raised a Christian. I am a veer towards neurosis paranoia. Having spent a lot of time with you, a lot of time with Stanton, a lot of conversations with Mitch Horowitz. And really, from a cynical perspective, looked in like, okay, what's really going on? Where is it? This is one of my suspicions that has popped up. I'm like, are they tricking me? But is it like, you know, Scientology, you get deep into Scientology and suddenly they're like, look at- Do you think we're like recruiting you? Not recruit, no, I don't feel like you, you don't need, I mean, I'm a de facto, as you said, I'm a de facto Satanist. You're de facto. I don't think you really need to recruit, but no, I just mean more like, you remember those awesome chick comics? Yeah. Oh, my favorite. I have one made of me. Oh, that's cool. But you know, it's always in the beginning, you meet the Satanist, they're so cool. They're awesome, you know, but by the end of the chick comic, your car's going off a cliff, you're with your Satanic friends. They're like- Ah, we gotcha. There's like a bag of pills falling out the window as you're going off the cliff. Yes, I love this. You're grabbing for the pills? Fuck, that's good ecstasy, man. So yeah, what about that? Is it a trick? Is that part of your game is like, hey, we're gonna be the sweetest, coolest, most compassionate, generous, we're gonna make you fried chicken dinners, we're gonna help you forgive yourself, we're gonna help purge you of any kind of like trauma from weird associations with Christianity when you're just a little kid, you didn't have the fucking rational mind to determine that there is no loving God with someone to hell. That's insane. We're gonna help you get your rational mind back that was beaten out of you by superstitious terrified people. And then once all that happens, somewhere down the road, we're gonna plunge off fucking dagger right in your heart and lick the blood off and offer it to our brother, Satan. You know, there actually is no catch. And I'll kind of explain that because even in the very beginning of Satanism, Leves and Satanism here in San Francisco, Anton and Diane, they would hold like, you know, workshops and even the original members of the Satanic church were like prostitutes, gays, transsexuals, or transvestite transsexuals, you know, people from all walks of life that were accepted in the normal society, they were accepted, you know, and they were like given a platform to where they could actually exercise, you know, being them actual selves and being comfortable with themselves. So I think like, you know, even, you know, I think that most Satanists are pretty open people. And I think that a lot of us have stemmed from traumatic situations and that makes it easier for us to recognize that and our friends and kind of help them out and see things for the way that they actually are and to know that we're all human when it comes down to it. We all do shitty things, shitty things happen to us, but it's just the way that you process it and move on that makes it kind of worthwhile to be around and kicking. So I think that, yeah, I think that most Satanists are open and helpful and that's really not what people see a lot. I saw it and the other thing that I noticed and I've always been curious about this, maybe this is just you versus it being some like tradition and Satanism, but when we would hang out at the comedy store, which was so fun. It was the funnest. You would always go to the person who was left out, you know, cause that happens at the comedy store, there'd always just be someone out on the outskirts and you would be so sweet to them and you would like, you know, like say the kindest things to them, not flattery, but like you saw into them and watching a person experience that and realizing she's doing, I think she's doing that as a practice. Like I think there's something in there that might be part of the tradition, but I don't know, maybe that's like, I was true. I think for me, where that comes from is I've always had like an intuition about people and I've always noticed the underdog because I think in so many times people have mistaken that in me that I would be the underdog or, you know, people would leave me out of scenarios and situations and school and it always made me feel bad and especially like being the weirdo in school. Like, you know, I was the goth person, I was a Satanist and, you know, people didn't like me. They didn't like that in the South. And I think that I took that with me and it's not, I don't think that really comes from Satanism. It just comes from being a good person. I don't like to see people left out. Cool. That bothers me. You hear that, Christians? We got a real monster on our hands over here. Get your email fingers ready. Yeah. So, okay. Now, do you remember when you taught me how to do curses? Oh my God, yes.

Oh my god, yes. I won't get into that details, but do you remember how like because in those days I was really like depressed and really dark and like I like I need like your friend, like my experience with you, I consider it like a very spiritual evolution for me. Oh my gosh, thank you. But I'll never forget how you got real serious with me and you're like, don't curse. You were like, don't do that. Like you were explaining the metaphysics of it, you're explaining here's why not. And I remember both of you were like, if you really want to like get revenge, live a good like, you know, like, become successful. That's the ultimate way. That's my revenge every day. Yeah, yeah. So I remember, yeah, I know what you're saying and and you know, the curses, have I done them in my life? Yes, I wouldn't really be able to say that I'm a practicing satanist without have experienced that. Do I do that now? No, like it would take something really personal for me to go there. It's just not worth it to me. It's not worth having the you know, instant karma, as they say, and whenever I do anything bad, I get like hit with like, whatever they want to call it, instant karma. She's a bitch, like immediately. So I think that I, I try to stay away from doing dark things, even though I may thank them, even though, you know, you do because you are open manifest thoughts of darkness and maybe bad things happen to people. That's why I always have to be careful about what I say out loud too is because words carry weight, right, especially to me. So I yeah, I tend to not go that route. I think I'm better than that. I'm a better rich than that. Yeah. Now, there is what's the difference between like a satanic witch and like a wicked? Let's just get I'm going to get like very surface about this because I don't want the witches coming to get me. I think like, you know, with white witchcraft, it's more of God and goddesses and deities and white magic, which is, you know, of the nature and celebrating the witch, you know, they are witches. I think, you know, in a way, they use their prowess the same way as a satanic witch does, you know, some of them are glamorous. But I think satanic witches come from a place where it's not just ritualism, but you have to, like, use your common sense to survive in this world. You have to use your attributes to get places sometimes. Do we play stupid? Absolutely. Because sometimes playing stupid will get you exactly where you need to be. So I think that there is a lot of psychological magic that goes on and a lot of the lesser magic that goes on with satanic witches versus a like more pagan style witch. It's more it's more of a modern witchcraft, as you would, as I would call it. It sounds like you're talking about instead of sort of like subconsciously being seductive, which I think a lot of people do. They may not even realize that they're doing it. It's acknowledging like within your femininity, there is this insane power. This is the thing that brings human life to the planet. And you can, you don't have like being aware of that and using it to improve your life doesn't mean you're a bad person. But in, but what are the words for someone who does that? Horseslet. That's it. That's it. It's all the like, whereas like in generally with like men, it's like, well, you're a natural leader. You're an alpha. You know, nobody's like, you're a fucking whore. Look at you. Like, yeah. Honestly, and to what I can say in satanism, people might get mad at me for this, but I've been around for a long time. So if you've been around longer than me, then you can get mad about it, I guess. But there is a difference between the females and the males in satanism. The males with not all of them, I can't put everyone and lump them. But in my experience, they fight, they fight over power. They, they change roles a lot. And you see the satanic witches more in support of one another, that they act as like a legitimate coven and have each other's backs. And you don't really see them getting on an online tips or anything like that, because I don't really think it's necessary for women to feel like they harness all the power, especially coming from, you know, being a satanic witch. The whole thing about harnessing the power sometimes is not known, the other person not not knowing that you're doing it. You know, so I think that women have come off a long way in using satanism and with and satanic witchery to their advantage. What is, you know, this is something I have noticed in my association with people who do magic. And it's, I think it's an archetype, but in also they say in shamanism, it happens too. But wizards in fight, you know what I mean? Like there's wizards are always fighting each other. Wizards and warlocks. What is that? Maybe it's a stereotype. I'm sorry, I don't want to piss off the wizards at warlocks either. But I have noticed like they're generally there's struggles that happen within that world. Like there's, you know, I never really thought about it that way, because I don't really like, you know, my mind doesn't really go to wizards and warlocks, but man, does that make a lot of sense? Yeah, I mean, there's this agreement. It's power struggles. It's curious. It's curious. So another stereotype that I really want to get this out there, because this is all whenever I hear people talking shit about satanist, and boy, you know, if you, I know I don't get it as much as you do, but from time to time, you know, people will say, Oh, great. So I guess your friends with pedophiles, I guess your friends with people who abuse children. So great. That's who you're friends with. Can you set the record straight here for folks regarding this thing that comes up that satanists ritualistically abuse children? So that is not true. Where that comes from is from a book during the satanic panic, like Geraldo Rivera days, and it was called Michelle remembers. And it came in this book, it's about this girl's experience being molested and abused in a satanic ritual and by satanist, and a satanic cult. But it did come out that she lied about it, the people that wrote it lied about it. So I believe like really that stuff started during the satanic panic during those Geraldo Rivera 90s days. And I don't think that satanism has quite recovered from that. Right. And I hope that one day it will. But really, I think that that's what put the nail on the coffin for satanism. I mean, it made Anton LeVe go broke. He had to sell the satanic, you know, the satanic church. He still was able to live in it, but he wasn't able to forward the mortgage, you know, he, you know, that's why a lot of Zena and Nicholas Shrek stepped up during that time to kind of give it a new vibe and feel and that wasn't that successful. So yeah, I think that the satanic panic days really had destroyed satanism there for a little while. But I feel like it's coming back. You know what it didn't destroy? Catholicism. God. What the fuck? What the fuck? Like, that's to me the real chin scratcher is like, what? Like, how are you, anytime anyone sends me these things, I'm like, are you, are you sending these to your local diocese? Or why are you sending it to me? Like, I just don't understand like all of the sexual abuse cases like that are coming out. And it's just like, how do you hide that many hide that many sexual abuse cases? Catholic church, tell me. They didn't. They didn't hide it. That's the thing. Yeah, that's true. I guess that in a way that is true. But you don't hide it. You just listen list of people. It's horrible. I can't imagine, you know, like, I know someone who is going through lots of therapy to overcome being abused by a priest. And it's horrible because it's like on top of I'm sorry, for some reason, this really pisses me off on top of taking I think it's because I'm a dad now on top of like, you know, when you have children, you realize shit changes and you see like they will believe anything I say and to imagine like implanting into them a story that terrifies them for their entire lives. I mean, that to me is abuse like outside of the other shit that isn't that abuse. I mean, the thing is, is like it is horrible when people use a platform such as religion to abuse people. It's like one of the lowest that lows of the lows because that's supposed to be a place where you can totally trust. And it's a foundation of trust. And that's completely broken. You know, I mean, just shattered, especially I think to men have a harder time coming forward with abuse. So I do, you know, being a victim of childhood abuse myself, sexual abuse, I commend anyone that can go forward and be open and get therapy and talk to someone. It's important. Don't be ashamed of going and getting help because, you know, I thought that, you know, I can handle, you know, trauma is not going to hurt me. And, you know, eventually all comes crashing down. So don't feel ashamed. There are so many places that will help you. There you go, Christians. What a truly, we must be talking to the incarnate bodymen of evil here. Hail Satan! Hail Satan! So, okay, so thank you. I think that you've covered all the misconceptions that I know that people have regarding your tradition, your religion. Now, we've got a little bit more time. All right. This is one of my favorite months. We are approaching Halloween. This is a traditional satanic holiday, a traditional satanic month. Yeah, my busiest month. Can you tell us some rituals that maybe we could do in the days leading up to the 31st or like some ways to kind of tune in to the occult energy of this month? But before that, why is this month associated with witchcraft, satanism, spirits, and the occult? Well, they say that, you know, hollows Eve is the thinnest veil between the spirit world and our world. So, I think, you know, with Satanists, we kind of, a lot of us are into that, man. We're into the spooky stuff. It's our season. You know, we, I think, you know, as far as rituals go, there are just so many rituals that you can do. I think that, you know, getting the satanic rituals in the book would probably help find out what direction you want to go in personally. But I think that because it is so close to the spirit world that the energy is a lot more open. See what direction, like I said, you want your life to go in. What do you want? Do you want to do a compassion ritual for yourself? Do you want to do that for someone else? You know, are you upset at someone? Hey, that's, that's all up to you too. I think that, you know, as far as rituals go, I would just kind of make that more of a dedicated to oneself and what they're kind of going through and what they're looking for. Okay. You know, not to give a generic answer, but that's kind of, it's a great answer. Not a generic answer. Do your research, folks. Buy that book. Buy the book. Get this satanic ritual book. It's available on Amazon. Now, do you ever wonder to yourself, Standora? Sometimes hanging out with y'all and thinking about it. Do you ever wonder, am I a Christian and the Christians are actual Satanists? You know what I mean? Like is the whole thing so upside down that I am actually practicing an authentic form of Christianity that is not about hating oneself, but about loving oneself through loving oneself, generating love for others, but also embodying the other thing people when they're talking about Jesus sometimes leave out, which is there's a ferocity to Christ. There's a, it's, you know, what does he say? I come with an axe. I'm a jealous God. I'm a vengeful God. I'm a vengeful God. And I will separate brother from brother. I come with an axe. You know what I mean? Do you ever like kick that idea around that like it's everything's gotten so warped that convert or die? Let's not forget that. Fair enough. Fair enough. But you know what I mean? Like sometimes what is the difference? What's the difference between, I'm not talking about fundamentalist, the, the, theocratic fascism. I'm talking about like kind of the hippie psychedelic idea of self love, compassion, appreciating life, not hating your body. What's the difference between Satanism and that version of Christianity? I think that Satanism is a more sexed up version of that, for sure. But they're really, you know, I mean, what's do, you know, I think like it's hard for me to explain this, I guess. I think that Christianity isn't all bad. Look, like if you, if it works for you, hey, I'm all here, I support you. If you're a good Christian and you go by those Christian values, hell yeah. Do they always go by those values? No. But I think that there is just a, you know, a similarity due to that being a Satanist doesn't mean you got to be a bad person. You know, like, of course, like, if you, you know, it's like a Christian say I for an I, same thing with Satanism, you smashed me on one cheek, I'm going to smash you on the other, you know, and, and I think that like, do under others as you know, they should do under you is kind of like, don't fuck with me and I won't fuck with you, you know, and that's kind of how Satanism is too. So I think that in those ways, there are similarities, but it is just interpreted it so differently. It's like Christianity with a stinger. Yes. It's sexed up. And sexed up. Now, what, what, let's, we have about five more minutes. Do you have time? Do you have five more minutes? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Eight, six more minutes. Okay. Because I kind of, I think I like dodged the lead here. What does satanic sex look like? I know nothing about this. Like, what is satanic sex versus regular sex? Is it BDSM? I know something about that. But what's satanic sex? There are satanic rituals, you know, not all of them include the sex acts, but they are sexual, you know, you do have normally a nude altar. It could be of any sex orientation. It's up to you in your ritual. Hold on, let me get my pen. Nude altar of any sex. Okay. Okay. Usually, I know that this is a misconception. No animals are involved in our rituals, especially during sex acts. I know you guys are disappointed out there. But as far as like a satanic sex on like a personal level, I think that also is up to your kink, you know, I think that for me, I manifest a lot during sex. I consider myself a pretty good lover, you know, I think that you invoke a mood, you invoke a feeling. And I think that the other person can feel that it's not all just chemical, it's how you're projecting your feelings and your wants and desires as well. So it could be pretty cool, pretty passionate, pretty sexual, sometimes kinky. Like I said, that's up to the satanist. Let's go back to the human altar. Okay. Now, so like, this is someone like on their hands and knees. Sometimes they're sitting up, they're not on their hands and knees. Remember, no animals, we don't really even have women, we don't put women in those scenarios or men or them they, you know, however you identify. Mostly sometimes they're on their backs. Okay, good news, because I'm thinking that's gonna fuck my backup. There's no way I'm holding that posture for a whole ritual. You know, it's like when you go in, have you ever gotten a bought your figure drawn? No, I'm a never knew that sounds like a nightmare to me, but I know what you mean. Yeah, you have to pick the best position, right? You can't like have a position where your arms up for like 20 minutes are just gonna not it's not good. So it's like a relaxed you want to be in not not too relaxed, but you want to be in a sensual pose. You know, you don't want to be like, I mean, like doggy style is, you know, that's pretty sexual, not sensual. I mean, hey, I don't those who have a doggy style alter though. I'm just thinking of functionality here. Like, what do you put the candles on? And you know, I don't know, like, you know, you put candles like next to them. And then sometimes you can do the candle wax on them. Sometimes there's fake blood. Whoa, fake blood. Wine. Wow. Well, that sounds real cool. Yeah, more people should do it. Thank you so much. Thanks for being my friend. First and foremost. And thanks for doing the show and for all of your knowledge here. Thank you. I appreciate you, Duncan. I've always admired you and your work. And I think you're a pretty goddamn cool human being. Likewise. And you're one of my cherished friends. So now, if people want to reach out to you, do you do any kind of, do you offer any services? Like, do you help people with men? I don't usually do ritual work, but I do work in domestic violence as a case manager. And I do help people from time to time who are going through hard situations regarding that or suicide and mental issues. So I will say that if you are a Satanist and you're going through anything, feel free to reach out to me. I don't want to hear about the situations that you're having with some deity or whatever. It has to be a real situation that's going on. But yeah, you can always reach out to me on Instagram or my Facebook. I'm here for you.

Go to Squarespace.com and use offer code DUNCAN to get 10% off your first order. Hello, friends. It's me, Duncan Trussell, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and I'm traveling right now. I'm visiting my dad in Fairhope, Alabama. I'm recording this into the on-board microphone of my laptop, so I'm not going to spend too much time doing an opening monologue, and in fact, I thought I just won't do an opening monologue at all, but I had what I would consider to be my only ghost experience while in New Orleans, and I want to briefly share it with you guys. I welcome any kind of refutation. Is that a word? Refutation? Is that a word, Cora? Any of you skeptics out there, I want to shoot it down. I welcome your volleys of truth, but I want to tell you what happened to me because I keep going through my head trying to figure out how I could have had this experience and it not be somehow supernatural, so here's what happened. We're staying at this hotel in New Orleans. I won't name the hotel, fuck it, I'll name the hotel, The Omni in New Orleans, a very nice hotel, and the first night there, I have a dream, and in that dream, I'm in the arctic, sleeping in a tent, and something wakes me up coming from a tent in front of my tent. It sounds like something's shuffling or scuffling around, so I open up my tent and look out, and then one of my friends' tents, this black, shadowy, cat-like thing, goes running out of the tent, and as I'm sitting there, staring out into the arctic, I have no idea why I'm there, there's the sound of something hitting the ground, and basically it's a body, like a body kind of in a body bag that has fallen out of the sky and landed in front of me. It's really spooky, and in the dream I'm tired, so I think to myself, well, that's a dead body, what's the point in bothering with it now, I'll just go back to sleep, but rather than going back to sleep, I went to the body, to the body bag, opened it up, it was like a blonde-haired guy laying in there, and in his pocket was a suicide note, and the suicide note was written about my girlfriend, which pissed me off, because I'm like, what the fuck are you doing, how dare you commit suicide as a form of hitting on my girlfriend. Jealous even in my dreams, but the, so, I sort of like, I'm like, getting angry about this when the dead body wakes up, like kind of reanimates, and the long and short of the dream is I sort of escort the dead body out of this camp that we're staying at, I'm pissed, and it was such an intense dream that I woke up and wanted to wake my girlfriend up to tell her, it was really shocking, so the next night, we're hanging out at the Omni, and we're talking to someone who works there, asking her, you know, is the place haunted, what do you think about Voodoo in New Orleans, anything spooky, and she tells us that at that hotel, after Hurricane Katrina, this guy had, for whatever reason, strangled his girlfriend to death in a Voodoo shop, in an apartment above a Voodoo shop in the French Quarter, cut her body into pieces, shoved the pieces into a mini fridge, and when the pieces started stinking, took his remaining $1,500, spent it on drugs and strippers, went to the Omni and jumped off the roof and killed himself with a suicide note in his pocket. The guy's name was Zachary Bowen, and he kind of looked like the person I saw in my dream. Now, normally, I'm completely skeptical, somebody had told me the story of Zachary Bowen's suicide after Omni prior to that dream, I just would have thought it had gotten into my subconscious mind, but as far as my recollection goes, I have never dreamed of a body falling from the sky with a suicide note in its pocket, and the fact that I had that dream in a hotel, possibly next to the balcony that this son of a bitch jumped off of, to me, is a verifiable ghost experience. So let that rattle around in your ghost cans, sweeties, because it can happen. Don't let these skeptical miracle leeches suck the goddamn ghosts out of your universe. That can happen. You get too pulled into the gravity of the people who think they know exactly how everything works, the next thing you know, you've accidentally blinded a very ancient part of the human sensory apparatus. You have limited your ability to experience the transcendent. You end up turning into the very thing you thought you were fighting against. You become a superstitious skeptic, and you ignore or revoke all data that doesn't fit in to your normal version of the universe. It's a problem, and I think it's something that happens out there, because so many people, people who theists, loon-loon worshipers, people who are in cults or organizations that have unprovable concepts, become so invested in these organizations that they can't back down or change whatever it is that they've believed in their entire life based on an overwhelming amount of data proving that whatever they think is wrong. But in the same way, I think some people get so invested into the skeptic's mindset, so invested into the material universe, a universe of atoms and explanations. Everything is explainable, and that which is not explainable will soon be explained, but ultimately everything is just some kind of void filled with atoms taking on certain configurations from time to time become sentient, and those sentient configurations are called human beings, and that's it. They don't configure in the form of fairies, ghosts, gnomes, aliens, little green men, whatever you want to call it, angels. And maybe, because people get so invested into that mindset, they somehow end up missing out on an entire data set that is accessible only to the mystics and the mad man. It's worth thinking about. Honestly, I kind of like the skeptical universe because it's safe. I like a world of just atoms and provable data. It's safe. It's safe. I don't want to live in a universe where there's the disembodied, disincorporated, phantasmal specter of murderers floating through my hotel room late at night. I want a good night's sleep. I don't want to deal with the implications of the possibility that when we die, some residual energy could hang around the place where we died, especially if we died violently there. That's a disturbing thought. That's not a, that's not, that's, to me, that's less desirable than a universe where upon your expiration you just evaporate into infinity and all traces of your memory, all traces of your consciousness, all traces of your personality, all traces of your ego are eternally obliterated by the cessation of your organic life. But that might not be the way it is. And that's kind of spooky to think about. You read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, you read any of the, any hippie literature, you read any religious scripture, and they all point to this terrifying concept that there is some residual trace of us that remains after the body dies. It's particularly terrifying in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and if you want to see a, a wonderful visual representation of what happens after you die with some pretty awesome DMT visualizations, check out the movie Enter the Void. Okay, that's enough of my rambling. Sorry for the bad audio quality here. I'm recording it into my laptop. I'm in a hotel room in Fair Hope, Alabama. So forgive me. We got a great podcast though. My barber, Brian Gurgus, is a super cool guy, and I've got my hair cut at his barber shop, the new California barber shop on Sunset Boulevard many, many times. And suddenly I realized, man, we have these great conversations. Why not have them on the podcast? I also wanted him to tell a story, which he tells in this episode, which to me is one of the most amazing stories of how if you go for it, the universe will provide. It's a really inspiring story. So listen for that. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. Today's episode of the Duncan Tressel Family, our podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.com.

Not only has there never been a better time in human history, for starting your own business, but there's never been a better time in human history for pranking your friends or parents with a serious seeming website. It's so easy to create a website centered around some dark crime and your father's past. Once I sign my father up to receive emails from the North Korean news. And I sent an email to North Korean news from my dad telling them that North Korean news was his favorite source of news in the world. And he preferred to go there than CNN. My dad's response to this was to unplug his computer and threaten to throw it away because he thought that since we'd signed up for North Korean news, at any second we might get attacked by snipers. It was a wonderful, wonderful moment in my life and a bit of a frightening one. I invite you to play pranks on your father, create a fake website, do something to horrify him and let me know exactly what it is that you did. But it's not just good for pranking. Squarespace is good for everything. It has a beautiful design. It's simple and powerful. It has 24 seven customer support via live chat and email and it's only eight dollars a month and you get a free domain if you buy it for a year. I tried out their customer support. It works very well. And the ultimate thing about Squarespace is you can start a trial with no credit card required, which means you can test the service out to see if it's something that works for you or not. Also every website comes with the ability to sell stuff. I've said it before, maybe I've said it too much, but I know a girl who has made a lot of money from selling her socks online. Think about that. She sells her socks. It's an easy product to produce. It's a, the profit margin is insane if you consider it. And if you have friends, if you have girlfriends with stinky feet, then you could create a veritable sock farm at your house. Think about that. It'd be so easy. All you need is a few treadmills and some dirty girls. Have them put socks on, take socks off, put them on your brand new Squarespace website and bam, you're going to be a millionaire in less than two months. Go to squarespace.com today.

He runs the New California Barber Shop, which is located in Echo Park in Los Angeles. If you or someone like me who's got a beard and doesn't trust himself to cut his own hair, this is where you need to go. Gurgis is amazing. We've had so many awesome conversations and so I decided it made sense to have him as a guest on the podcast. So please, everyone, squeeze out as much happy juice as you can from your pineal glands and send blasts of transcendent ephemeral love vibrations through the as of yet unidentified, holy matrix of truth that connects all organic life, not only on this planet, but in all known and unknown planets in the all regions of the multiverse, so that it comes raining down on the sweet and beautiful Brian Gurgis. Brian Gurgis, welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family, our podcast. Thank you for coming over here and doing the show. Yeah, it's my pleasure. Thank you. How long have I been getting my haircut over your place? I would say probably one year and one half, maybe, yeah, probably something like that. Man, I gotta tell you, like it was before you were, you did a show at the shop because I had met you then and that was that was a year and a half ago. So before that, you're in eight months. But you like that fascinating thing about you as my barber is like you hear like all these old school things, which is like how important it is to have a good barber and like the weird friendships you develop with your barber, we become friends. Like I, when I have to get my haircut, I don't just want to get my haircut. Like I look forward to coming in because of conversations we have. It's nice to hear. Thank you very much. I feel the same way when you come in. I'm like, oh, all right, Dunkin's here. It's not like back to work. Yeah, but you've developed a skill of like having conversations with people as you cut their hair. Like how much of being a barber is about cutting hair and how much of it is about holding a conversation? I mean, shit. Both are so important. You can't have one without the other. It's like, you know, you got to be a good barber, right? It's like you can't just be a barber. You could be any kind of barber, a shitty barber, you know, a good barber. But if you want to be a good barber, you have to be able to talk to people. And you have to, you have to like people. You have to look forward to seeing you and not like pretend I'm looking forward to seeing you. You know, it's like there's nothing worse than that. Like what is it? It's just like patronizing like at your service, Dunkin's. You know what I mean? It's like you got to be like interested in the people that you're going to develop, you know, relationships with. Because you end up with like knowing people for years. Hopefully, you know, I'll be getting my haircut at your place forever. That'd be ideal. I mean, shit. Well, probably not forever. It's going to fall out as long as it's up there. And the barber shop, it'll be like gone in 10 years. Who knows, you know, it's out of our control, like the future, obviously. But when, so when did, when did you decide that you were going to start cutting hair? When I realized I'd had enough selling groceries, I guess, you know, so I mean, I was just racking my brain trying to decide what I liked in life. When I was, when I knew that I didn't want to sell groceries anymore, you know, like, oh, shit, how do you mean sell groceries? I worked at a grocery store for 11 years as a cashier, pretty much. I did a lot of stuff there. What grocery store? It's called Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco. Wow. Have you ever heard of it? Nope. It's a worker-owned co-op. It's a great place. Big. It's like a Whole Foods, you know. How does that work, a worker-owned co-op? Well, this one's unique because the workers split the profits. Wow, that's cool. It's cool. So at the end of every year, we'd get like five to $10,000 each. And of course, you'd have to pay taxes on that, you know, and it would also be dependent on how much you worked, how serious you were about the job you did kind of reflected. A lot of times, or there were people that would like steal to, you know, they'd like pad their time cards, you know, so they'd get these huge chunks of money. And it was full transparency. At the end of every year, everybody's finances were posted on the wall. So you'd see who got what? Who got the most? Usually a guy who essentially started the place 30 years prior and was always there, like, you know, maybe like 50 to 80 hours a week, you know, and he was on the head of the board of directors for the store, you know, and he was just always there. So he clocked a lot of hours, had high hourly pay, and all these things were in a lot of seniority, because he was an early, like an early worker. So the seniority adds to the profit margin? Totally. So not just the hours, like if you've been there longer, you start getting more money. Yeah. Which makes sense. Yeah. The whole thing made sense to me. How much would he get? I can't quite recall, but I remember there being some hefty sums. I would guess like 20 grand to 30 grand at the end of every year. I mean, yeah. So you worked there for 11 years? 11 years. Yeah. San Francisco. So anyway, that's not a normal grocery job, though. That's like, you're hanging out with, that's a different kind of person you're hanging out with. Totally. You're not getting exploited in the normal way. Well, no, but, you know, like a lot of the grocery cashiers and everything are like union workers and stuff. So who knows? I've never actually been like a cashier at Safeway. So I don't know how good or bad that is. I do remember like romanticizing the fucking grocery guy when I was a kid, though, you know, like I was like, man, that looks like a great job. He's like, I don't know. He was actually the boyfriend of a girl that I knew, you know, and he was like 18 and I was like 14 or something. Maybe he was 19. And he just seemed like a professional. Yeah, sure. And I was like, I think that'd be a cool job to have one day. So, but I never like thought about it again. It was kind of like with cutting hair to, you know, complete the thought. I guess sometimes I still think it's a cool fucking job. Like when you go in there, there's something that seems like hypnotically awesome about standing there, scanning the items, the weird little bleeps and clicks and that kind of just constant stream of humanity coming in front of you and watching this weird photo. I wonder if everybody feels like this or is this just like you and me having a strange idiosyncratic thing in common? Because to me, I feel the same way. It's always been like a draw. Maybe that's the way everybody likes to shop. Everyone just inherently has like the the want to be in the store for whatever reason. Well, yeah. And this whole goddamn hierarchy of fucking labor that exists in people's brains where it's like, ah, a clerk or like, it's like, shut the fuck up, man. It's all badass. Like I've said on the podcast before, but my favorite job outside of podcasting, but right up. Forgive me, guys, but right up there at podcasting, but this only means how much I liked it, was washing dishes and chilies. That was like one of my favorite jobs of all time. And it was a, it was, you know, exactly what you think it is. It's a assembly line style job, plates come in, you wash the plates, you put them down, you know what your work is, you know when the work starts, you know when the work's done, there's no question about it. When you get off work, you're covered in dish grease and slime and you smell funny, but God damn it, you feel good, because you've worked, you did a hard days work or hard nights work rather, and you go home and you take a shower and get fucking worked. It's great. Yeah, I like that feeling too, man. Seriously, it's like, are we unique in this? You know, I don't think so. I think this is like a huge, I mean, this is like, but I know so many people who refuse, like who refuse to find any joy in, in a fucking day of work. And for me, I'm like, I fucking enjoy, pardon me, you know, I enjoy a day of work. I just do. I feel good when I'm done with it, you know. Yeah, it's, and that's a, that is something that is, I don't know what, when that becomes that big Christian Republicans, we're Christian Republicans. We're like, are we working class heroes? I was listening to a job, Duncan got a job. I was listening to John Lennon as I was driving and he's singing that song, a working class hero is something to be. Oh, yes, dark, dude, it's heavy. It's a dark fucking song, but it's like, they beat and they scare you for 20 long years. And then they expect you to choose a career. It's really like this, you know, this anthem of rebellion against, you know, the exploitation of the worker, you know, but goddamn, if it doesn't sound pretentious coming out of the lips of somebody who's probably sitting in a bubble bath. Such a fine line though, right? It's like, um, being part of that and being like, like rebellious to it as well, you know, it's like, I mean, you know, opening the shop was like major for me for that, you know, it's like, you know, having a job, right? It's like mundane working for the man. It's mundane. It's like, just the fucking wheels spinning and you're just a, you know, a gear in it, I guess, or whatever, you know, uh, but it's like, well, I like it though too. So how do I do it on my own terms, you know, and you're never on your own terms because you're paying the IRS, you know, and it's like, you're always, uh, you know, you're always plugged in basically, not necessarily just to the internet, but not, you know, that too, but, uh, you know, to the grid PG or whatever, you know. But so having the shop, it's like a major commitment to that cycle, but also a more major for me in my mind step in my own, maybe it's just my head, but in my own direction, you know. How terrified were you when you first? Not at all. I mean, not at all. What's there to be scared of? It's like, um, I didn't think it was going to fail. I knew I liked to do it. I knew I was a good haircutter. I've gotten enough compliments on like, you know, the way I could arrange a house or something, you know, that I didn't think the place was going to be nasty. I always like, I've always kind of been a, a bitch, I guess, about like, like appearance, you know. So when I walk into a room, it's like, I really get like, uh, either annoyed at the lack of thought put into it, like, ah, fuck, they could, ah, you know, or I'm so blown away by right, like how cool the thought was or, or whatever, you know. So, so I knew that I was like, picky enough to like, create a good space, you know, I don't know. I didn't have any fears at all. I mean, no fears, but that's terrifying. I, like, the, the idea, for some reason, it's really weird, but, and I don't know. It didn't come without panic attacks. I think that might be different, you know, but uh, I never felt like the shop was like, not gonna do, become a stable way for me to pay for life, you know. Well, I, I was not raised in a way where you were taught, you know, you could start your own business. Like that was never anything that, I was in, in a middle-class family where you just had a boss, you know, that's just the way it worked, like you. Well, what did your folks do? Well, my dad is a real estate manager for, uh, shopping centers, he got in a real estate, and my mom was a psychologist, and my mom, at one, eventually- That's having your own practice. I mean, that's like- But for a long time, she was working at other people's practices. And before that, she was just in college, but you know, it's like a lot of people, they're family- But look at you, your fucking independent business. But, but it became an, it was an accident, and it's, and I remember when I started discovering- Well, hang on, but then you do comedy and you act and stuff too, so it's like- But I had a desk job for years, I worked as a talent coordinator at a comedy store, and then- While you were on your way though, to become an independent- Before that, I was a telemarketer. That's the bigger fear. I mean, it's like, you want to talk about like fear of failure, it's like, you know, when you put your money and your time and your life into like, uh, being an entertainer, you know, I mean- It's a terrifying, ridiculous proposition. At least I have a shop, I can blame everything on the shop. Yeah. But that, you know, it's like- It's still, I just, what I love is hearing stories about people who manage to start their own business, become their own boss, because I think that there's so many people completely unaware of the fact that for all the horrors that our country is responsible for, and for all the very bleak and dark aspects of capitalism, we're inside a machine. And you get to pick what part of the machine you want to hang out at, and this is a machine that is developed in a way where it's completely normal to start a thing called a business, which if you study, if you look at Karl Marx, as I did in the most rudimentary way, but now I've decided I'm a Karl Marx expert, he points out the fact that, uh, the way it works is, it's completely normal to, if you've got the money, if you have the funds, you can use that money to create a machine, whatever the machine may be, whether it's a barber shop or fucking Halliburton, and that machine creates some kind of product, and you hire people to run the machine for you. And unlike the grocery store you worked at, the normal way that that works is, they get something called a living wage, and you get a profit. And the more profit you get, the more you invest in another machine. That's a very difficult thing to come to terms with, honestly. Like when you're a business owner, an employer, and you've been an employee for your whole life, you know? Because you're cutting those checks. Yeah. You're cutting those checks, and you know what you're making, and you know what they're making, and you've got to rationalize in your mind that your profit is, that you deserve your profit, and that they don't deserve that profit. Yeah, it's strange. It's a strange thing. I'm not fully comfortable with that at all. It's hard to get used to. Because it's like eating meat. You have to like, if you're going to be able to- Which I know nothing about because I was a born and raised vegetarian. That's cool. Well, for me, eating meat requires either a healthy level of denial about what's going on. That shit's dangerous, but necessary, but fucking dangerous. Denial? Yeah. Well, yeah, it is. Yeah, it's dangerous to deny, but then, or you can go to the other side of the spectrum, which is instead of denial about the suffering of the meat products that you're shoving into your mouth, you can think the suffering of this animal is worth it for me to enjoy this meat. And some people say, well, that's- it's a survival issue. You know, like, I eat meat for survival. I eat meat because- and that, of course, is the- that's the biggest pile of- that's the- I love that. My- if you're going to eat meat, like- It would imply I'm dead, you know? Well, it's just like, shut the fuck up. You ain't starving, bitch. What are you talking about? Like, you hear- you hear, like, a meat eater being like that. I- we need meat to survive. Shut the fuck up! Yeah, you can survive with that. You can survive with the jar of peanut butter probably for, like, a hundred years. Don't act like when you're pulling up to that Carl's Jr. Your hands trembling with, like, fatigue and- I'm just getting so hangry! For real. No, it requires either denial or you just have to think, I so enjoy the taste of meat that I am willing to- to cause the suffering of countless innocent helpless beings. That's the truth. See, I can't identify with it on that level, so I have to take it to, like, something I do that is, like, where I deny myself, like- or where I deny, like, the repercussions of what I'm doing. You know, because with meat I can be high and mighty about it because I was born and raised vegetarian. Every now and again I'll have bites of stuff just to see, like, what it tastes like. And there's certain things I romanticize, like, maybe, like, um, cured meat, cheddar cheese, soft roll. I've never had a bite of that, but it sounds and looks good. So, um, so yeah, so it's like, I can be- I don't- it's like, I don't identify with it, so I think that you should have that same power to not- to not identify with that, you know? It's like, I'm not special because, like, of that, it's like, we all, like- Right. It's like, you make the choice. You're strong and you understand the negative, like, ramifications of this, so get off the fucking, like, cycle, you know? But it's you- every single- this is where you get into, like, you know, the cycle, as you're saying, is like a really curious cycle because it- I love the Hindu trinity because it represents the different points in the cycle, the- the point of the present moment or the thing holding every single moment together. The harmony that creates the potential for there to be a planet with an atmosphere that we exist in. That's Vishnu, right? That- that's represented by the preserver, Vishnu, the preserver of time or whatever you want to call it. And then you've got the creator, Brahman, the creator- creative force, the pre-singularity conditions, that the spinaret, that the stuff that is preserved by Vishnu comes out of. And then you've got the part of the cycle that most people really don't like thinking about, which is Shiva. And this is when you look at the National Geographic video of the fucking hyena taking a bath in the stagnant water that's accumulated in the carcass of an elephant that has died on the savannah, and it's just, like, just loving it. Yeah. Like some terrible thing when you look at the, you know, the way that certain animals hunt, fatigue hunting, where they like- It's like dogs and socks, you know, used socks or like used underwear. You're like, why are you- why are you hoarding that? What are you exactly? All of those distasteful things. Yeah, they're all exactly- they're exactly part of the universe. They're all part of this beautiful universe that we're in. And so we- Okay, okay, go ahead. Well, my problems don't even remotely come from eating meat. Like, you know, or my imagined, my perceived problems, you know. Like I fully believe that the human beings are omnivore, right? And it's like the hunter-gatherer, like, you know, like that's how you get food. A certain amount of all food is probably very important. And me lacking meat is like, you know, maybe if I had it, I'd be a more rounded human being, you know. But, uh, what do you think about hunting? Well, that's just the thing is in this day and age, it's like so many of those ideas are convoluted. So it's like at the base, it's all good, right? But like so many of the ideas are convoluted by like money-making schemes. And that's where shit is- and that's why it's so hard and why a big problem, you know, with having a small business, maybe not a problem, but a big thing to deal with is, you know, like we just talked about the paying, the people that work for you kind of thing, you know. So as soon as you start putting money behind like something like hunting, I mean, what do I think of hunting? I think it's great, you know. I think it's great if you want to take a bone arrow and go and shoot a deer and then eat the deer and feed yourself and your family. Way better than getting hamburger meat at Gelson's. But if you want to like, I mean, I think hunting gets ridiculous when you are the dentist and you, you know, and you spend, what do you spend? 25 grand at least on that whole vacation just for sport. It's like fucking go play catch. Fucking necrophiliacs, man. Yeah, it's like necrophilia. It's like a deep schism. It is like necrophilia. Like is what you see, to me, it's like when you see those big game hunters and it's the post-kill pictures where they're doing these weird poses with them being- Seriously sick, dude. But it's like, is it sick or is it like when- It's as sick as necrophilia. But my dog, if my dog comes upon a nice patch where a thing has died, my dog likes to roll in it. He's going to do it. If he comes upon some nice stinky bit of where an animal has left this dimension, he's going to be like, oh, let's roll around in the remnants of this thing. So it seems to be something deep inside a person to want to like, to want to like, it's- It might be, is the best I can like, agree to right now. Because you know, same thing, my fucking dog, you know, like a mouse came into my house the other day. Yeah. Shelly Long just like stopped and like stared at the mouse for a little bit. You know, there was no like kill instinct happening, you know, and it was really unique. I was like, whoa, and I was relieved. So I'd have to clean up like a dead mouse or something, you know, and it's just like, there are so many examples of either one you get to pick. But there's got to be one fucking uniform thing in you, right? There has to be, right? Like what connects us? There has to be a uniformity, I think. I think that's what makes me feel like a part of society, you know? It's like, I have so many things that I can identify in other people, and hopefully those other people can identify these similar things in me. But what are they, you know? Right. Well, I mean, you don't have to, the thing is the problem is like using the excuse of like, well, my dog does it. Then it must be okay. Yeah. You can't really do that. It's just a human being gets to decide how much suffering that the human being, the idea is like, one question you can really ask yourself. Like before we started recording, we were talking about budgeting and like, how much money do I actually need to be spending? Well, imagine there's a currency of suffering and imagine that every day you spend a certain amount of suffering dollars in the world and induce a certain amount of suffering in the people around you, either directly or indirectly. And just a simple question is, how much can I reduce the suffering on a daily basis? What are ways that I could reduce the amount of pain I'm causing people in the world? And there's some real obvious answers to that, you know? For me, it's like, don't drink. You know, if I want to reduce suffering, if I stop drinking, then the amount of suffering I experience the next day is instantly reduced and the amount of emotional suffering that I might cause to the people around me, just because when I drink, something goes wrong in my brain sometimes and I decide to turn into, I went from having, it sucks, man, I went from having fun to turning into, is there anything worse than a drunk who feels slighted? You know what I mean? Like a slighted drunk, a drunk who's like bitter, who gets self-righteous because somebody looked at him the wrong way or is like, what do you mean by that? You said that. Unpredictable. Unpredictably bitter, you know? It's like, oh, it's the worst. And god damn it, if like, I didn't find myself going into those places when I was drunk and it's like, well, I can't fucking drink anymore, even though from time to time I still do. And every time I do it, the answer I get back from the universe is you can't do this anymore. Well, I was going to say, I mean, I think that ultimately is the truth. But like, get control of it more than don't do it anymore. I think it's a task a lot of people obviously. I don't want to roll the fucking dice. And I still will. But it's like, I don't want to roll the dice that whatever stupid synaptic vesicle in my brain that's producing the bad juju juice that's making me into a little sour little prick, if I drink too much, is going to activate. I mean, maybe it won't activate and I'll just be a jubilant, happy, sweet guy. You know if it's there though, not to fuck with it. Why? There's so many other better drugs out there. But you know, that reduces the suffering to some degree. In the same way, one thing that I haven't done yet that haunts me is that I know if I stop eating meat, damned if I'm not reducing some pretty intense, insane, hellraiser levels of suffering in the world. Maybe start like, like if that's a goal of yours, you know, start nothing. I don't even know how you eat, you know, but it's like, if you want to stop eating meat, then maybe start thinking harder about the meat that you're eating first, you know, so make it like, and then it becomes maybe a little more rare and then after you maybe realize that, then maybe, then maybe you'll have less of an interest in it. I'm just, you know, I've been, I don't know, it's such a cheat. I don't know, God, I'm not even going to give this fucking excuse for causing innocent little beings to go through the hell. And I don't even know why I would try and convince you to not eat meat. It's a good thing to convince people of because it reduces suffering and there seems to be an instinct in humanity to reduce the amount of suffering. It's large. I think it's large. It's large on the environment and the economy on, on soul to soul contact. You know what I mean? Like animals are, they're, they're souls. They're it's like, it could be your soul. Well, yeah, man. And like, have you ever done the thing where like sometimes when I'm looking at the rotisserie chicken I'm about to eat and I pluck the leg off the chicken and slurp that thing back. Sometimes as I'm plucking the leg off the chicken, my unrelenting mind will say to me, imagine if you are pulling the leg off of your poodle like that. That's the same kind of leg. You're just ripping the leg off a creature right now. And then that's pretty bad. Pretty bad. And that makes me know. I have almost no. Well, I'm a big appreciate. I appreciate. I'm a big appreciator of the egg. I eat a lot of eggs. I love eggs. So I do, I appreciate the chicken for laying the egg, but a fucking chicken. It's like, are we going to get into an animal rights conversation about chicken? It's like, that's one that doesn't motivate me. So I'm like, ah, fuck it. Duncan eat the chicken. But you know what I mean? It's like, but it's like, is it where is that soul worth saving the chicken soul? It could just be like, and then it dies. Just some kind of like just a robot. Yeah. Just some kind of, well, that's what Descartes thought. That's what the scientific materialist thinks is that and the guy who came up with, I think therefore I am, and please someone refute this if this isn't the case, but that motherfucker from what I've read was like Jeffrey Dahmer level sadist where he would, like without anesthetizing them, cut open dogs, like vivisect dogs while they're alive and hold their hearts as they stop beating. Like that, that's where he was at because he thought the whole thing was an automaton, that there was no soul, that there was no spirit, that it was just that if you could put together just the right combination of cells, then metallic cells or whatever, then you would have a little robot dog that would just be the same as the living dog. That's what he thought, man. It's too cold for me, but it's like I can be cold, but that's too cold for me. That's pretty fucking cold. But that POV can lead to a lot of serious fucking problems when applied to the world at large. What is that called? Is that being like a sociopath? Cutting open animals? Just being able to be completely devoid of like emotion towards a thing, like you can perform a task like no. Yeah, that's a sociopath, but it's like a logical sociopath where it's like you want to be able to excuse your violence in the way you've come up with the method to relieve the sense of the cognitive dissonance that comes from knowing that because you like fried chicken, some being has gone through what would be the most intense and incredible saw level, like saw for level birth and death that any human being on earth could imagine. And because you like fried chicken and the taste of that fucking shit that you put in your mouth, you have decided the reason that it's okay for me to do this is because the chicken is like a clockwork thing made of meat. Doesn't love its kids. Doesn't have any affection for its chicks. Its chicks don't love the mother. They're just little meaty, little delicious robots meant to be fried up and eaten. You either have to do that. Purpose servers. Yeah, purpose servers for my stomach. You either have to do that. You have to do what I'm doing, which now the more I hear myself say this shit, I want to put a gun in my mouth, which is like some level of denial mixed in with a little bit of like neilism or some kind of just lazy thinking, or you've got to have a real reason for it. Like, man, because of my particular genetic makeup, if I don't get this kind of protein in my diet, I get really sick. Or you just have to make the decision my life as a human is more important than the life of animals. Okay, so stop there. Because I immediately say that and I imagine the worst shit in my head all day, right? It's like, a dog is going to get hit, or my dog, and then the human, do I save my dog and let, you know, and I mean, shit, can you imagine? You saved the human. But yeah, you got to save the human being. But you're not saving any, the thing is, again, the argument of eating for survival if you're in America, eating meat for survival, just shut the fuck up. You're not eating meat for survival. You're eating meat for pleasure. I think that you've got to admit you're eating meat for pleasure. I don't know. I really fucking don't. And I don't, well, and I know you're alive. You seem vibrant. You don't seem close to death. When was the last time you had meat? No, it's true. It is a luxury. It's a luxury. But like, what is an omnivore then? Like, you know, like, is it fictitious? Like, what is a carnivore? Is it, is it nothing? Like, well, I mean, again, we can't, I mean, an omnivore. I mean, there's a lot of things human beings did in the distant past that if we decide to live like that, because our evolution had as one floor on the great skyscraper of human evolution on one floor, we were hunting and eating meat. And therefore we say, OK, well, now let's hunt and eat meat on this floor. It doesn't, that argument doesn't necessarily work because the times have fucking changed. If you want to adapt, that's the bottom fucking line, dude. Adapt. Adapt. Don't live like, you know, well, you just have to do it all the time. You have to adapt, you know, because life's going to change. So if you're 50, learn the fucking Internet, you know what I mean? Yeah, right. It's like, yeah, that whole thing, the whole like, I don't know, you think, yeah, yeah, that is, you better learn. That is not a, to me, that is not, that is no longer like that. And a lot of people do that in the same way like you have, like, and you're not one of these people. But, you know, you do have the like, so people, the pleasure people are getting from not eating meat is not just the empathetic connection they have with all of nature in the sense that in their own small tiny little way, even though it might be like shit into the ocean, they have in some very small, small way transform the universe for the better. And that gives them a good feeling. A lot of people, when they're vegetarians, the real joy they're getting from being a vegetarian is having a platform that they can look down on other people. Instagramming their vegetarian status. Yeah, right, right. Telling someone, I'm so vegetarian today, man. Yeah, it's so great. Oh, it's so great. It's so fucking great because boy, you can really like, you've got something to. I'm proud of it, though. You know, it's like, it's a fine line. It's like, you want to be proud of the thing that you are doing and excited and tell people everything. So it's like, but you also don't want to be a fucking turd about how proud you are of it. You don't seem like a turd, but you do seem like an animal rights person. I am to some degree, but I wear leather, but it has to be secondhand. You know, like, I mean, there's probably a pair of shoes I'll buy out there someday that are new and made of leather. But, you know, I figure like by that token, I'm like, you might as well use all the fucking thing. You already killed it. Motherfucker, you might as well fucking skin it and give it to me. Right, right. So I don't, I'm not like, sew up my own ass about it, but I definitely like, you know. You're not Peta level. No, but it was the first place that I ever gave money to as a kid. You know, like I, Patrick, I gave them like, I don't know, 10 or 20 bucks. Like just because I was into it. You know, I was like, it was about their euthanization thing, right? Like how they like adopt or people give them the animals and then they kill them. Yeah. But doesn't everybody do that? What they have to euthanize what's left over, right? What's not adopted. Yeah. But the difference is fucking Peta. It's like when you bring your animal to Peta, you don't think it's going to get a goddamn injection. But if you think that you're, that Peta is going to keep it and give it a good life where you couldn't and you're just passing the buck and you're kind of like, Yeah, but that's a fair thing to think. It's like, if I, It's a kind of a blind thing to think, you know, I mean, Peta's, Well, they don't announce it. They do it. Yeah. You see that thing? It's like, they do it in the back. Like, you know, and these like gnarly dark incinerator things. Yeah. If Peta was like underneath their slogan, if they were like had like, you know, McDonald's has number of people served. If they have the number of animals, they'd euthanize. Yeah. Oh, shit. It is one of the insane ironies in life that like Peta is like a massive murderer of animals. But the bottom line there, too, is there's just too many fucking animals. What are you going to do? It's like, there's too many animals. There's too many people. There's too many fucking animals. It's like, we're breeding animals. Yeah. For people who want to fuck you, get the dog that's, that's, that needs a home. No, look, man, I'm totally agree with there's too many animals. But the Peta thing in particular, if there are rationalization for killing fucking animals, basically, secretly, is that there's too many animals. Peta sucks, dude. I have nothing good to say about them. They're snotty like to me as a human. And it's like, and they do shit like that. And you're just like, you're just a fucking million dollar corporation. And once you're face on the magazine, the first time you stuck a fucking youth needle into a puppy's neck and killed it, you ruined all the great hard work you did. And they did, they did. To me, like a lot of the good that they do is like, whether you like it or not, they shove into your face the reality of your decision to eat meat. Oh, it's true. No, it's true. And they shove into your face the reality of like the laboratories, experimenting on animals. There's so much good work that they've done. It's all good work. But then, god damn it, why the fuck do you have to have a Freddy Krueger boiler? Freddy Krueger, dude. It's like the brutalist of two-faced shit, you know, like not just like, they slapped a dog. There's video of them kicking a dog in the office. It's like, no, they fucking exterminate them underground in the cellar. They pick them up in vans and they kill them. Now, I'll tell you, this is an interesting facet of the universe to me, because now I don't believe in Satan. But things like that do kind of make me think, my god, it does seem as though there is a refraction in the lens of the universe that takes a thing and will warp it inside the thing. Because you hear about this version of this again and again. Like, take, never ending, never ending conversation. You know what I mean? It's like, you get every, it's like the seedy underbelly of everything that seems beautiful. Bill Cosby. Jared. Oh yeah. Well, if you, I guess Subway never would like said, our mascots don't molest kids. So you can't like. I never put them on that high of a pedestal. Cosby though. But the church or like, you know, again and again, you have a thing, like almost inevitably, like if someone has got some very strong opinion that they're very vocal about regarding some thing, then you're like, who the fuck are you euthanizing in your basement, man? Because it's almost like an organization that is very vocal about whatever it is. Fucking SeaWorld. You know, SeaWorld. This, when I was a kid, we'd go to SeaWorld. It's a wildlife preserve, isn't it? Yeah, and they've got these super intelligent creatures who are withering away in these shit aquariums. Yeah. And like, but the United States, and the free home of the brave. It's like a party that, you know, it's like the greatest party ever. The only thing is, don't go in the basement because you'll find out that the generators for the party that are creating the great music and lights and delicious, the equipment to make the delicious food are being run by death. They're being run by the destruction of human beings. Feed it a heart or a soul, you know? It'll go on forever. No, it's so true. Fuck, it's like, so don't look. There's no answer. I mean, that's the thing. It'll go on forever. Just don't look too close. Don't look in the basement. Yeah. Just know it's there. Know that there's probably a shifty ass underbelly. That's why being a human is so hard. We walk around with all this like, oh, the fucking, all this guilt. I know all this horrible shit. And I pump gas and like, God knows what else I do. You know, like I buy airplane tickets and I fly at places and I leave this horrible footprint and I just want to kill myself because I don't want to be part of the problem anymore. Or you just decide I'm a fucking locust. Like, which locust do you want to be? Well, as soon as you decide that then, then you have like carte blanche to like be like, whatever fucking horrible kind of locust. And now you can be the person who prays on everything because you just decided that, YOLO, you only live once? What's up? It's like no big deal. I'm a locust. Like, you know, no, I'm not saying I am, but in a way you are, if you are. As a human being. If you pay taxes. Yeah, every human being's a locust. Every human being's a locust. So it's like, here are these locusts, these very, very intelligent, creative, amazing locusts swarming this planet that have somehow, and we don't know how, climbed out of the skin of the planet like maggots. Only it's like we, the skin that we climb out of looks like the human vagina. You can see the face I'm making. We do. We clamber out of these, we clamber out of these little greed, these, these bloody gushing holes in between the legs of the females that have emerged from other gushing holes in this planet. And we climb out and then we proceed to transform the matter, the biosphere, the matter of the biosphere into technology or into whatever industry. That woman was a massive birth dust too, so she was already like fucking the whole universe too. So it's like, we're just like, here we come to like do it again. You know what I mean? My mom was ruining this like years ago. Years ago, we just keep this, we keep doing it. All you can be is a carrot. It's fucking all you can be. What do you mean a carrot? Just like you're a seed, you get planted, you do nothing at all. You just wait until someone grabs you and eats you. It's like, that's it. Yeah. That's like the most like, I don't want to fuck anything up, just I'll be a carrot. Well, you got to, you know, you can, or, or, I mean, this is the weird thing. It's like, or you just decide, I'm going to reduce the suffering as much as I can. And then once you've made that decision, whatever that decision may be, enjoy your fucking life, pick your battles. Who knows? Maybe that's like, I mean, the, this is like that great George Carlin joke, one of the, my favorite of his jokes that a lot of people really hate, which is like, you know, people on this planet, I'm going to fuck it up. But it's like, you know, people on this planet are like, animals, the animals going extinct. It's like, there's, that's what this planet does. Things go extinct all the fucking time. They say that we're in the midst of like, I don't remember which extinction, the six or the seventh extinction on this planet. Number six, there's been five before us. That's the way it works when you're on a fucking ball in the middle of space. I don't shed too many tears when I hear stuff like that. You know, like, oh, the bar that's been there for 30 years is closing. I'm like, yeah, you know what I mean? The owner probably wanted to do something else who cares. Like, I hope you all got your drinks there while it was open. That's the way it works. That's the way it works. Maybe sometimes you just got to spread those vampire bat wings out and go flying in the direction of the next juggler vein. You're going to suckle and stop fucking mulling about it. Get it early. Get it early so the blood is like, yeah, hot and warm. No, I think there's something to it, man, because it's like, this is in the Bhagavad Gita, the verse that is so abhorrent to a lot of hippies who haven't maybe read the Bhagavad Gita and then finally sit down and read it. It's not a book about peace. It's a book about God telling someone why he needs to kill a bunch of people. And the essence of it is Krishna is saying, I've already eaten these. These men are already dead. I've already killed all of them. Early Krishna appears in the universal form and Arjuna, the warrior, is like, I see in your teeth the bones of humanity. I see, you know, you're eating the entire universe. Like a giant fucking Pac-Man eating this whole fucking thing. And so this is the messages. Listen, man, all things are vanquished. All things are destroyed. Do your duty. Follow your dharma. Do what you actually are and discard all this silly, sentimental fucking weakness for the wise man. Mourns neither for the living nor for the dead. I'm trying. I'm trying. As a 39-year-old adult, I'm trying to do that. Yeah, me too. And it's such a glorious place to be. But god damn it, are you a sociopath if you mourn neither for the living nor for the dead? How many times like, you know, caught in the middle so much, like, you know, it's like, you're always kind of caught in the middle. It's like, you know, on your best day, you're caught on the right side because the photo wasn't a view pumping gas, you know what I mean? Like on your worst day, it's like, you know what I mean? It's like you're caught like doing the, like, you know, maybe you're hungover or something, you know what I mean? But it's like you've been caught doing the vice, doing the terrible thing that's ruining everybody, you know? And just let yourself, see, this is why I think it's fun and where the divergence happens between popular normal consensus reality and the freaks of the world is that there's something really exciting about the concept of allowing yourself to place the handbags of guilt that you've been carrying around with you down and just fall backwards into your own vice. Not as some kind of, not as long as you're not doing it in an ambience. Like, so the reason that guy on the airplane recently you pissed on the people in front of him. No, I didn't even hear about this. How'd I miss this? Sounds good. So the reason that guy is not as interesting as he could be is this guy on an airplane wakes up, takes a piss on the people in the seat, drunk, just wakes up wasted or something. Ambien, he's on Ambien, you know? Or he's wasted, who knows? He's like, I don't think that he autonomously made that decision to piss on the people in front of him. So he was just in a kind of hypnotic stupor, had that man woken up, clear as a bell, lucid, completely awake, looked around and been like, fuck this. I'm going to take out a nice, hot fucking piss on the people in front of me just because I'm bored on this plane. That would be one of the most- Well, of our flight, that's like hour eight, right? No, that's hour seven or something. Because right after, you know, you can get to New York without doing that. But once you're going to like Europe, those other six hours, just fucking heavy boredom. So hour seven, you're like, what am I going to do? Seven more. We are over the fucking Pacific Ocean. Five hours of this shit, dude. And we've got another seven hours, and these people are going to have to deal with my fucking piss. It's the only thing I can think of that sounds exciting right now. That man, that man suddenly, he's not a good man, but that's an interesting man. That's a man you want to interview. That's a man you want to read his manifesto. Because there's something in that decision, like, I'm just going to do this. I'm just going to piss on the people in front of me. So he turns out to be the drunk guy, though, who just like- Just ambient. Yeah. I didn't realize where I was. Ambienes. Did he even whip his dick out, or he just like stood up pissed on himself? No, he whipped his dick out and pissed in between the cracks of the seat, apparently. Can you imagine sitting on the plane? You're just sitting there halfway on your way to Hawaii, wherever you're going. And suddenly you're like, what the fuck? That doesn't- What are you doing? What are you doing? But they say that he just went back to sleep. But you know, is that worse than the plane going down? That might be worse than a crash. If you're sitting in front of him, it's not a good flight. For the rest of your flight, you've got to deal with some man's piss on you. But the point I'm trying to make is, if you're living in a lucid way, if you're not blundering through the dimension, fooling yourself, living in a state of denial, pretending that you're somehow better than you are, but if you just come to terms with the fact that you are a destructive, locust-like force burrowing through the sweet flesh of Mother Earth, destroying thoughtlessly- It helps. To me, it's more noble than to be like, I don't know what I'm doing, man. I don't know. I just eat meat, and I just fucking drink and say shitty things to people. I don't even know. If you're in that callus-like hypnotic stupor, there's really not much interesting about you. Just as bad, almost just as bad. Or being hyper-aware, right? So you're hyper-aware of the situation, and you get out and you are yelling at everybody, but you're doing the bullshit, like, you know what I mean? Like, oh, you got Taco Bell with your friends after you went to the fucking rally. Yeah. You're a vegetarian, but you still went to Taco Bell, and you didn't get the meat food, but you were just at the animal rights rally with your friends, and so you got vegetarian. You know what I mean? Yeah. If you're standing there yelling at people, or, you know, not even yelling at people, but if you're standing there speaking out loud about this is the way it should be, and then you just go and subvert, that's why, like, I went to an anti-war march in San Francisco, like, maybe once, maybe twice, but I can only, like, remember once. It seemed like, oh, maybe it'll do, maybe it'll do, there's never been one. So it's like, but, you know, I went and marched in the streets for like two hours, fucking walked off the path of the thing, and went to a movie. Right. You know, it's so stupid, such a dumb way to end that day. Like, you know. What were you supposed to do? Exactly. There's nothing else to do except for what you normally would do. That's the absurdity of it. You've got to sink back into your normal life. Totally. So it's just, it's like, it's such a shallow feeling, though. I don't know. Maybe just like being, I don't know. I mean, you have to revolt. You have to stand up. You have to talk shit, but no one cares about talk. Talk is cheap. Talk is cheap. Yeah. Yeah, it's like, what is there, because the rebellion has got to be like, the revolt or the rebellion has got to be an internal revolution. It's got to be. It's got to be economic. I think straight up period and a discussion first. It just has to be where you don't spend your money first. Ah, right. I think that that structures the gnarliest thing. I think that the human being has built is the economic like, you know, I've always thought classism before racism, like, you know, I think one. Right. Classism, poor people, it's like about poor people and rich people. You know, it doesn't matter what color the rich people are or the poor people are for a minute, for about one, for about 30 seconds, because it's just about rich and poor first. And then you go, and then when the poor people are all together, then it becomes even like, well, we need something to be above someone else. Right. We'll take color on this one. And so, you know, it's like the economic structure is the first thing where it's like, watch where you fucking spend your money, please. Doesn't mean you can't get gas, but maybe, maybe don't, like, maybe just don't do, maybe, I don't even know what you would do to make any kind of impact. I have no fucking clue. It's an app. I think that the, the, the, it's, it's crazy and I don't see how it could happen, but it could theoretically, right now, there's the opportunity for an economic rebellion that was never possible in any other period in human history. Something that makes marching look like just a fart in the wind, which is some genius, and I don't know who it would be. There's two things that have to happen. One, a genius has to implement some kind of app that allows millions and millions of people to boycott certain organizations with the aim of creating transformations in society, according to whatever is the right thing. Would the app spread information only, you think? It's some way to organize boycotts. It's an app that organizes boycotts. Because, you know, close is kind of the thing where you can, like, I don't, I don't use this and it seems silly, but it's also really useful. Like you scan a, like an item, right, at a grocery store and it tells you that whatever it's, wherever it is, if you're trying to diet, it'll tell you if it's good or bad for your diet or if it's owned by some, if it's owned by, fuck, general mills, you know, it'll tell you, oh boycott this because this little, you know, so there's apps that do that kind of stuff. So it's like, oh, interesting stuff. It's a universally accepted version of that. Now, maybe it's like we're looking at, like, 15 years down the line when everything's augmented reality and everyone's wearing glasses that projects some kind of data field on top of everything so that when you go walking through a grocery store, just what you're saying happens so you recognize which products are being supplied by corporations that are funding politicians you don't agree with or so that the corporations experience a direct impact on their profit margin based on the lobbyists that they're paying off to create. We have to invent this thing. I already just invented the name for it. What? The app of righteousness, like an act of righteousness, maybe? App of righteousness, yes. That amour of right. TM. Someone will invent this. I mean, this is the horror of the, this is the horror of the, of fascist corporations is that technology does inevitably subvert and give a tool to poor people that has never, ever existed. It's just the organization has to happen. I mean, can you imagine, and again, this is just like a thought experiment, but imagine if somehow there was some app and I don't know the mechanism, the means, I don't know exactly what it would do or how it would organize. But if there was some app that convinced 10% of the human population on earth to no longer buy for a certain period of time some product, let's say Coca-Cola or BP, oil or, I don't know, what's an evil corporation? Both of those are plenty evil. So, somehow, 10% of the human population, I mean, this is like huge numbers, but just as a dream, imagine 10%, somehow stop doing, stop buying whatever the fucking thing was in the name of some cause so that all of a sudden some massive corporation begins to experience on a daily basis the loss of billions of dollars. Like what the fuck, the whole car, yes. Even better would be if, if these people that were making the billions of dollars would have one conscious thought in their fucking head and do something. For one day, Coca-Cola is going to give all of the money, not just the profits, all the money it makes to a country, you know, to a city, you know? One day it's going to be like, oh wow, like Bloomington, Indiana just got a check for two billion dollars from Coke, period, you know? And Coke guy, Dr. Coke, will still be a filthy fucking rich megalomaniac and the town might be able to like feed a homeless or pave a road, you know what I mean? It's like, that's the bigger issue. It's like, how do we like change the mindset of humanity, right? So, it's like, I think that we're going in that direction, honestly. If we had kids, we'd be going more in the direction. Like the office, like, you know, there's like an evolution of humanity. It's happening slow, but it's there. It seems to be happening. I mean, that's the dream. The dream is it's happening. Now, whether it's really happening or not, we don't know. I mean, you do see the... We're in the wrong part of the cycle to tell because it's so like the 80s and like 70s and Reagan and everything is like so fresh, like Bush. It's like, Jeb Bush is running for president. That's not very far from Ronald Reagan. Bernie Sanders is apparently doing really good. And that commie son of a gun has got some ideas that are definitely moving in the direction of what you're talking about. I'm down, Bernie. But we do see the other thing that's happening is how very overt it is when you run into the invisible barrier set up by the power structure. Because when enough people run into that invisible barrier set up, the men in the Darth Vader outfits and the tanks come into your town. Like you do see that, you know, like Ferguson, Occupy Wall Street. One thing that's been really cool about these protests is it activates a certain level of the defense mechanism of this invisible fortress that produces these strange looking Darth Vader people in the riot gear with a fucking poison gas. It's the hand of God. Yeah. And it comes out of nowhere. Like so, like everything's running smooth. Everything's super cool. We've got this normal day to day existence happening and unplanned. But every once in a while, a certain group of people will trigger something. The trap door fucking opens and like these psychos, these thugs and fucking crazy fucking military gear who are just like, no, no, no. Guess what? No, it doesn't even fucking matter that you have weapons. It doesn't matter that you've got your AR-15s or your shotguns or whatever the bullshit amendment is that let you have all these weapons that you think is going to defend you. And you could really, you're not going to be able to rebel against us. We have the most advanced military technology on the fucking planet. We have micro, they have these weird microwave weapons. We got a vote for Bernie. Everybody, we got a vote for Bernie. Vote for Bernie if you want to. But those sons of bitches are still going to come out of the fucking woodwork. Those guys, as long as those guys are appearing whenever people are like. But in, see, this is a thing. That's why we're caught in the middle because we'll see that maybe in 80 years. Like, you know, we'll see that diminish. Hopefully. Well, maybe. I mean, I don't know. I mean, that's the big quite the bit. So it's like the, I, who was it? There was a senator. This is always stuck with me. Who is the senator of California? What's her name? I don't fucking know. Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi. She's senator. I don't know. Who is Nancy Pelosi? If they think Nancy Pelosi. She was like a Sanford. I think she's that's how it makes sense. Let's see what she is. She's a congresswoman. She is the US representative for California's 12th district. Nancy Pelosi. Sounds like a senator to me. Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives. So Nancy Pelosi said something that is stuck with me for some reason, which is weird to have anything that Nancy, as somebody said, stuck with me though. She said power is never given. Power must be taken. Power is never given away. So if it is true. Sounds good. If it is true that one 10th, or what is it? One 10th of a percentile of people on the planet own 90% of the wealth, or I don't remember what the awful math is, which totally makes sense based on the idea that as long as we have a system where workers don't get the profit of the corporation and the profit goes to the CEO and a few top people in the corporation, then that creates a situation where all their resources and all the money go to fill up this balloon controlled by a very small group of people. So if that is true, then one of those people, if Nancy Pelosi is right, then those people aren't going to be like, you know what, you guys can have the fucking balloon. They're never going to do that. They're never going to do that. That's never going to happen. It's never going to fucking happen. Which means that, and God, I'm sorry for going on this ramp. This is why we've got this supposed revolution that's supposed to happen every four years in this country where people vote to create a new power structure because the idea is that pressure that fills up the fucking balloon. What ends up happening is once that balloon gets too big and all the resources have been sucked away to a very obvious level, then the people who've had the resources sucked away from them wake up to the fact that there's infinitely more of them than the people controlling the fucking balloon. And that's when a violent, bloody revolution happens. And that's an inescapable, unavoidable bit of political physics that the founding fathers hope to subvert by creating the idea of a vote every four years. But since now all these motherfuckers are bought and sold and they're not really representing the will of the people, but they're representing the will of corporations, then this apparently puts us on a trajectory that can only lead to some kind of fucking awful, bloody, shitty, crap revolution. But that's where technology comes in. And that's why- Well, I would agree with that. Obviously 100%, but people are just their force-fed complacence in the most huge helpings. It's like complacence is going to take the place, there seems to be, I mean, idiocracy, the movie. It's like by the time that there's enough people that are, if we continue on this terrible path that we're clearly on, then when the numbers get so skewed that the people would then be forced to revolt, those people will be like, man, out my balls, you know? Like TV program, like, I don't care, man, program. And that's kind of, that's like, I'm like- I don't know, man, I think that's, I don't think you have to, I think it's just, the problem is it's just disorganized, chaotic, and ultimately results in like some kind of like, you know, subvert yourself to the will of the particular government that you are being controlled by or get executed. And in between that, there might be some uprisings that essentially get vanquished. But I don't think people get- It's just like, you know, who's not dumbed down, a father who can't feed his kid. That's not a dumbed down person who's like, let's just watch TV. If it gets to the point where there's enough fathers or mothers who can't feed their fucking kids, or there's enough fathers and mothers who are living in like those kinds of conditions, then revolution happens. It's just the way it works. Now, if the shit has to get really bad, I mean, way worse than it is right now, shit has to get really, really bad, but man, I- I think we're 80 years from anything really like good or bad happening, you know? 80? Yeah, maybe like 80. I don't think it's 80. I think it's like the, so the idea is, here's where it gets really creepy. So, okay, I'm a, I'm a fund, I'm a factory owner. I've built a factory, whatever the factory may be. And because I built a factory, I've employed workers to create some product, which I'm selling at a profit. And I'm taking the money from that I'm getting as a profit, and I'm investing it into research to try to mechanize my production, so I don't have to pay the workers anymore, because the more that I can mechanize the production, the more my profit margin increases. So I start figuring out little ways to mechanize the production, so I now, now I can lay off this person, that person, that person, my profit margins increase. Now I'm applying that money to figure out even more ways to mechanize my production, etc., etc., until finally we hit the point which people are saying we're going to hit in the next 15 or 20 years, which is full automation of something like 35% of the current workforce, thanks to artificial intelligence and robots. And this is the end game in capitalism. That's why I became a barber. It's like, how can I not be phased out by a machine, you know what I mean? In my lifetime, you know what I mean? That gets phased, easy, easy, easy, easy. They tried it once, dude, the flow bee didn't stick. Wait till you see the, wait, it's true though, man. It's like, are you need to, to... 3D download. The one thing that will, that cannot be replaced yet, as far, and if it can be replaced, then shit man, everything's over as far as we know it, is the human connection between you and your fucking barber. But then on the other hand, if I know that I can go to some barber, no offense, but if I know I can go to some robot barber and sit down at some weird futuristic barber shop and like a drone is going to come and like place something on my head, scan my hair, and give me like some exact cut. But prior to doing it, show me images of myself with that cut, so I can dial in exactly the haircut that I want. Okay, so it's like we're dealing with lasers and blades at this point. I'd rather the laser cut than the blade, you know, of these swings. Oh yeah, there's going to be some disasters. There's going to be some fucking disasters in these barber shops where someone's going to, like all of a sudden you'll feel a little like mosquito thing on your head and then it's like, wait what? Brains. Man, they're optimized. Yeah, by the, by the, but, but so, so the, so this is going to happen fairly, fairly quickly, according to a lot of people and, and we're experiencing the very beginning of it in the Uber strikes. When you see an Uber strike, when you see the taxi drivers threatening the Uber drivers, you're witnessing the very first tumult in what is going to be the catastrophic disruption that comes from huge swaths of the job market becoming automated or becoming transformed through technology, which means that the hope, the hope is that somehow using technology, we come up with a way to do a digital revolution that creates the shifts that we're interested in having in the world through what you're talking about, through economic upheaval coming from the people and being organized by some kind of device app website that makes it very easy and obvious for enough people to boycott corporations to create the kind of changes that we would want. That's going to happen, man. Someone will definitely invent one of those things and that person is going to have a little fucking brake accident when they're driving home one night. Dude, I just don't know, man. My fucking car just started accelerating. His car accelerated and ran into a tree. I love how that shit happens. Davey Jones, the man who invented the righteous app, was found dead today. Suicide. He committed suicide. He was a depressed dude. He was obviously kind of a little cynical and jaded. He was a fringe. He subscribed to fringe ideas and I guess that he had manic depression. And yeah, he ended up somehow. We still don't know how, but he hung himself with his hands tied behind his back. By the same token, don't bother following who's a Tesla guy. Elon Musk. Don't bother following him on Instagram. Kind of boring. You'd expect it. I follow him because I think Elon Musk is really cool. He's cool as shit. Yeah. I'm like, man, this guy is fucking awesome. I love Elon Musk. I'm going to follow him on Instagram and I'm going to see great photos of shit. I like it's nothing. It's like, well, A, literally he posts almost nothing. And it's like, hey, man, I'm following you. Give me my money's worth. And then like the other day he posted like he posted a bunch of stuff and it was like seven like pictures that were like this thing landing. But it wasn't even like a real thing. It was like, you know, animated yet none. Just like, it was like he was reading some book that had seven cool pictures. He just took pictures. I haven't posted them all. Musk! What the fuck are you doing, man? That's like, I never see you. You show up like, you know, in force today and I don't even want to see anything. I want to see like Musk's like pantry. I want to picture what the fuck he's eating. Exactly. What's in your refrigerator, Musk? What do you think's in his fridge? La Croix or La Croix. Yeah, just all La Croix. I think it's like, here's my guess. Elon Musk's fridge, some La Croix, some kind of like yogurt snack. Definitely yogurt, yogurt. Uh, what else? What else is in there? I think he's probably living off that. He's got to boil down to his science. All I need is one bowl of this and one gulp of this. What do you think? He had two boiled at hard boiled eggs. I see you in 2000 years, Duncan. He doesn't know it's in my way. Musk doesn't know it's in his fridge. Musk has got to assert, like someone like Musk is like, he's probably hasn't seen his fridge in a month because he's got a living chef who like makes him these delicious hummus bowls and like wonderful savory brown rice. The more we talk about him, the more I love him. I love him too. I'm just like, I love him. I don't even, I don't know any fucking thing about this guy. I don't know the slightest thing about this guy, but I'm like, I love him. He owns SpaceX, right? SpaceX, Tesla, PayPal. He wants to get a... What does he want with PayPal? That's what he's, I think he started. That's not very spacey. He started PayPal. I think that funded it. It's convenient. I use it. I do too. But he, like the cool thing that he wants to do, apparently... Not at the barbershop. Did you hear that, what, you don't use PayPal at the barbershop? Oh, you can't. Do you have to use a... I probably could. You could actually. Yeah. So when we just be like, oh shit, I like, my phone's stuck. I don't have any money. Yeah. Home Depot takes PayPal. I was at Home Depot. Like while you're there? When you do the self-checkout, you could choose to use PayPal to pay for it. Whoa, that's crazy. And they say shit's going to go towards Bitcoin eventually, where you could use it. No, Bitcoin already came and went. That's gone already, right? I don't think it's gone. I think it's gone. I think it's still there. Really? Yeah. I think Bitcoin stuff. Some alternative crypto. No, at the end something happened and like, there's no worth in the Bitcoin anymore. It's very sad, man. I remember like when the Bitcoin bubble happened and like, there was that guy who like, I don't know if you heard about it, but there was a guy who had us in his hard drive somehow, like millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins, but he threw the hard drive away and he knew it was in a landfill and like, people were speculating about like, spending like $100,000 to try to dig up the hard drive. That does not count as buried treasure. No, I guess it does though. That's sad. This is a modern era and that counts as buried treasure. Oh, the horror of like some tech nerdy like, ended up like, oh yeah, fuck it, Bitcoin. It's like a penny each. It's a scandisk flash drive about two inches by one inch. Yeah, in a landfill, in the like, in the mulchy soil, like maybe you'd be able to decrypt it. It's got a billion dollars on it in Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin still works. I do. I've never spent one, I've never seen one. I don't know anything about it. I try and stay like, blissfully ignorant to as much dumb shit as possible. I don't think, do you think that's dumb? I don't think it's, I got to, it seems cool, fuck. Like it's like, some kind of like, it's like, I'm dunking this stink out right now. There's no way, dude. Come on, what's interesting about it? Because it's like, for Bitcoin, I mean, it's interesting. I'm not going to lie. It's interesting. So it's some kind of like, I don't understand it that well, but apparently like, there's these chains of numbers that require processing. It's like magic to gathering, but computer money. Well, yeah, or yeah, I mean, if you ever read Ready Player One. Sounds good, though. It's a great book, but I've just started reading. I've people have been advised me to read this forever, but it's sort of about the future when virtual reality is basically everyone's hanging out inside of virtual reality. And there's a main world called the Oasis that everybody hangs out in. But the currency of the Oasis, the currency that they're using, the digital currency is a completely valid currency. So like, and there are valid digital currencies right now, and I can't remember which one it is. Like, you know, there's World of Warcraft Gold, for example. And I don't know if you could still do it. See, all I know about that is that World of Warcraft's a game. Is it? So I've never... So there's gold in World of Warcraft. And with that gold, you can use it to obtain items inside of World of Warcraft. So... Can you... Are those real items you can buy and use in everyday life, too? Well, you can... Can I get a toaster oven? But you could sell... People used to sell the gold. So in other words, you could like... Oh, shit, all right. You could convert the currency in the same way if I had Canadian dollars. Like on Craigslist, if I look up like World of Warcraft Gold, yeah. I bought... I remember when I was addicted to the game, what is it like a PlayStation or was it computers only? Computer, PC. But when I was addicted to the game, and you would see like people would inside the game... Is it a gauntlet type game with swords and shit? Yeah, it's like a first-person game. What's called a massive multiplayer online role-playing game. How massive? Fucking giant, man. Like how many people are you playing with at one time? Well, now the numbers have decreased, but I don't know the statistics for the server population when it was at its height, but there was a lot of people playing. And it took a long time to get gold together in World of Warcraft. So you would be sort of traveling through this fantasy realm, and you would see people saying buy 500 gold for five bucks here, and there'd be a website. And so I'm like, you know what? Fuck it, it's five bucks. I can't remember the amount for five bucks that you get, but it's a lot of gold, right? A lot of gold. So I'm like, I'm going to try this just because it seems interesting, weird, and why not? It's five bucks. I don't know why I wasn't afraid of getting hacked or my identity stolen, but I went through one of these websites. There's a number you call, and someone with an Asian dialect answers, and it's like, what do you want? I'm like, I want to buy gold. Here's the info. I think I gave my fucking credit card. Maybe I paid. You're fucking crazy. Maybe I PayPaled the money to them. I may have PayPaled the money. It was, I know whatever I did was not safe. So I PayPaled the money to them, and they're like, okay, meet me. There's a place in World of Warcraft called Ogremar, and they're like me. So you're like, your characters meet each other? Yes. And it's like a drug deal. They're like, meet me outside of Ogremar at this time, at this coordinates for the deal to go down. So I go to the coordinates. I'm sitting there. This is pretty fucking interesting. It's fucking trippy. I'm like, you know, you're looking around in Ogremar, and it's like, you're in it basically. I guess it looks like, I don't know, Utah or something here. It seems to be based on Utah. Ogremar. Ogremar, hang out in this little village. Ogremar, Ogremar, Utah. And Ogre comes up to me, offers to do a transaction. I accept, bang, I've got a fuck ton of gold all of a sudden. For five bucks. For five bucks, I'm loaded. Hell yes. He vanishes. Now here's where it gets very curious. And it gets back into our idea of how a lot of profit comes from evil. As it turns out, supposedly in China, like political prisoners and prisoners were being forced to mine gold in World of Warcraft and sell it. It was a job. It was a job online. So somebody, with someone's job, you better find that gold. Find the fucking gold. Online. You better find that gold online. Chinese gold harvesters. So one part of the population of World of Warcraft was composed of Chinese gold miners getting gold from different places in World of Warcraft and selling it to the West. And that was a job. That's pretty far out. It's like, you'd think, come on, let the peasant worker be the rich guy in the game. And it's like, no, you would be a fucking peasant mine digger in the game too. Yeah. You're a mine. Yeah, they're still miners. They're just in real life and fake life. You're a mine digger. Digital miners. Yeah. And Bitcoin was the same way. So Bitcoin, you have to like to get a Bitcoin. But what are you buying with the Bitcoin or the gold? You're paying for people to get killed. You're buying drugs. Bitcoin is really cool because it's an untraceable currency. So. But can you buy a car with it? Like that you can drive tomorrow? Buy fucking anything with a Bitcoin. It's just like any other bit of currency. Only the difference is it's untraceable. So that's why there's the dark web, which I've never been on. But apparently there's a thing called the dark web, which seems awesome. But you use something called a tour browser. Soon as you fucking type in dark web, dude, choppers. Yeah. Yeah, I'm terrified of the dark web, but it seems super cool. But you use like a tour browser is what it's called, which is some special browser, which allows you to get to like the. So the internet that we know, I'm sure you're aware of this, is the very tip of the iceberg of the actual internet. I'm sure. I've never thought too hard about it, but I can only imagine. We only see the websites that the search, the crawlers. I know which websites I only see. It's like three of them. None of them are, you know, good to mention. Porn. They're all they're all embarrassing. It's like the Yankees, my email and some porno. Yeah. Same here. Same here. The cycle of like, you know, Reddit, Facebook, X, Hamster. Just refresh, you know, every five minutes. Maybe there's some new email I got. But there's a whole dark web and you get to it through some weird browser. And that's where the Silk Road and all the drug accessories. And so the currency that people use to buy shit on the dark web is Bitcoin. Well, crazy. Cryptocurrencies. I get into less trouble being a simple idiot. So it's like, you know. Yeah, right. You're not a simple idiot. All smart people say they're simple idiots. It's one of the first adaptation mechanisms. Smart people adopt so they don't get their asses kicked. So I wanted to, and I'm meant to do this in the beginning of the podcast. I hope you have. Do you have a little bit of time? Oh yeah, I like it anyway. So, um. And I like your health. Thank you, Sarah. So I wanted to, could you tell that story of the time you found all that money in the pocket? Which time? No, yeah, definitely. But that's the thing is like, that's not as much money as then it took to open the barbershop and I was like, you know, almost found money too. But how much money did you find? 6,000 paper dollars. No Bitcoin. No, uh. You found $6,000 in the pocket. Of a suit coat at a thrift store. Talk about that. Can you talk about that day? Yeah, yeah. So it was like Memorial Day or Labor Day is a national holiday. And me and the girl I was going out with at the time had decided to go thrift store shopping as we always did. And so we went to San Jose and went to a thrift store there. And you know, she was like, you know, kind of shopper who pours over the store. You know, I'll be like in and out in like 10 minutes. If I don't see a couple good shirts, I'm like, I'm done, you know. So I was done. And she was like, oh, I'm not done yet. And I was like, all right. So I started just like, you know, shopping more and more in depth. And you know, I just put this coat on and I just felt this like chunk in the hip. And I thought it was like an alarm, you know, like a store alarm from a department store. And I opened it. There wasn't anything in there. Put my hands in the pockets and felt on the inside. But you know, it wasn't in the pocket, but it was like the inside breast pocket that there was like something substantial in there. So then I opened it up and put my hand down the breast pocket. And as soon as I touched it, I was like, that's a wallet, dude. Like that's a fucking wallet. You could just you could just feel the stack, you know, like the sandwich of money, you know. And I fucking pulled it out. And it was a hundred dollar bill with a rubber band around it. Like with many bills underneath it, you know. And, you know, I was immediately just like scared, you know, like, oh fuck. Like it was just a weird feeling, you know. And I didn't even grab the coat. I just took the cash out. I put it in my pocket and I walked over to her and I was like, let's get the fuck out of here. And she was like, you look like you've seen a ghost. And I showed her the money and she was just like, good Lord, man. So she bought her stuff too. I like stood in line with this like cash in my pocket, you know, just thinking of all the different like, you know, scenarios like how it could have gotten there. And she paid for her stuff. We went outside, got in the car and I threw her the money and I was like, count it. And she takes the rubber band off and it just crumbles off, you know, like, and it leaves just residue. So it had been like that for years, you know. And the newest bill was 1996 too. So this was 2007 or something like that. 2006. She just starts counting and it's just one after another. All $100 bills. Were you crying? Did you start crying? I don't even remember. I just kind of was just staring at it. Just like, like excited shock. It's like, what the fuck? Yeah. And and she just got to the end. It was $6,000 and $100 bills from the thrift store. And it was just like, well, it's what we're going to do. There's no idea. There's no anything. I'm not going to like someone leave. $6,000. You know, I was just like, I needed the money too. You know, I was going to go to Barbara. I was going to Barber School, you know. And I just started the $7,000 tuition. I just started to get like Bank of America loan shit going. I was doing paperwork and like, you know, getting my. So you also the universe suddenly funds. Funds Barber School. So I don't have to be in debt. And it's like, oh, this is great. But that's this is happening as you're about to get a loan from the bank. Yeah, exactly. So wait, I mean, now think about that. Like in a movie, if that happens in a movie, no one believes it. Real life is if you live it and enjoy it and you're like, you know, out the house, real life's 10 times more interesting than a movie. But but that level of like, so if I'm watching a movie about a guy who is working at a grocery store and wants to start his own business at a Barber School. And he starts getting loans out from a bank. And then he happens to be at a thrift store where he finds what happens to be almost exactly the amount of money he needs to go to Barber School. Yeah. You're you're in the movie. You're gonna be like, that's lazy fucking writing, man. Yeah. Like, yeah, sure. He finds $6,000. But that actually fucking happened to you. Yeah. Like it's so it's so weird. It is so weird. Because it's it's not as though the window within which it's not like you've always been applying to Barber School. It's not like for your whole life you've been trying. It just happens. Dude, it was a small window. I mean, it was a tiny window, you know, like six weeks, you know, from when like, I mean, I work quick as soon as I realize this is a direction I'm going to go in. It's like, you know, I wasn't like, I should be a barber for years. You know, I mean, it was a it was like April to July, like, you know, decision process. I remember going on this tour with this girl who was going out with a band member that I was with. That I was in the band with and she owned a salon in San Francisco and she was cool. You know, she was like just kind of like, you know, she didn't seem like a business owner or whatever that might mean. You know, she just didn't seem like she was overly busy with stuff or like, you know, overly stressed about her business or anything. You know, and I was like, you know, wow, that seems like a pretty cool lifestyle. She had her apartment and she had like her her shop, you know. And so she was on the tour and that's when I really started talking and she was like, oh, do it. If you're thinking about it at all, do it. You'll never regret it. And I knew it. I knew it like almost immediately, you know, and then started looking for a minute just to find where I should go, you know, and then it was the Barbara College. Because if you ever saw like the website for Paul Mitchell or whoever Vidal or, you know, whatever, if you ever saw any of these websites, you'd be like, yeah, I'm going to be a grocery clerk for the rest of my life, you know, you wouldn't want to be a. It's just that kind of school seemed terrible. I'd actually done that before, too. Like I'd been like, like, you know, friends had gone to like stylist school, like cosmetology school is what it is. That's the difference. Cosmetology, you have cosmetology school and barber school. Yeah. So I had friends do that and I would let them cut my hair. So I'd go down to the fucking, you know, Paul Mitchell school and, you know, give my friend all of like three hours to cut my hair, which was no better than this, you know, and she was like learning her way through and it's like short hair. So it's so I'd seen it already known that like lifestyle and was like kind of turned off by. Yeah. Like this is drag. Right. Like just a bunch of smoking, like bleached tips, like 19 year olds, you know, that sounds awful. Yeah. But then barber school was definitely no better. It was like a bunch of like kicked out of school for stabbing, like, you know, like, like, you know, they went to high school, got kicked out in 10th grade, went to continuation, got kicked out in 11th grade and now they're getting paid by the state. That was the other insane thing. Like, you know, you got to be so down and out to get free money. Yeah. Right. If you're like, if you have a job and you're actually paying your own rent and everything and you want to make a conscious change, then it's like, you better do it yourself, asshole, you know, no shit, which is maybe beautiful because you need it. Then you'll you can get it, you know. But this but if it's a luxury, if me changing my job is a luxury, then it's good luck, you know. But you got, but like, the universe gave you what the government gave some other people. Yeah, totally. And the, and it's, and they're, to me, I had this dream. It's really frustrating because in the dream, some being was saying to me, Duncan, what do you think you're here to learn? And I answered the being, but when I woke up, I couldn't remember what my answer was. Interesting. But if you think about, if you look at the idea of the universe as like a training program to help you overcome fear, take risks or dive into the unknown, then what would happen is, if you did these things, then the, you would get points, right? And it's again and again, again, I keep hearing stories about like this, where somebody dives into the unknown and almost instantaneously as if it's programmed into the fucking machine itself, there's this huge reward. Like, oh yes, that's it. Like, people are, they're, you know, they're afraid because they're impatient a lot of the time too. It's like, you know, you can't give yourself, like the, you got to always look big picture, right? Because you're going to be here for so fucking long. If you die tragically, the odds of that happening are this big compared to you living to some 70, 80 year old, right? Like, you know, so it's like, if you're always thinking like, I didn't see any payoff in two months, you know, then you're always going to be like, you just got to not think of, you got to do other stuff so that you're not thinking about that thing though, you know, but God, what was the fucking ultimate point? You were talking about the payoff. It's the fucking, it's the idea is it's like big picture when you take, when you, when you set out into the great unknown, go ahead. No, I just remembered the, the, the weird point that was like this on a small scale. This is like, it's like, where do you, where do I start learning the lesson that you get, that the chance you take works your way? Like, you know, where do I start learning that? You know, and it's like, you know, a bunch of different places, but one thing that I always, that sticks out to me, it's always been interesting is since I moved out of my folks house, you know, like at 18 or something, it's like you pay rent, you know, and you don't have a job that, you know, I didn't have a job the first time I moved out. I also didn't have much rent. I was moved to Santa Monica and was like moving, like moving in with a friend of mine whose grandma owned this cool place and she didn't have to pay rent and I wasn't paying rent. That's cool. Yeah. So then I moved to San Francisco though. And to do that, I went home first to the desert and I worked for three months at Walden Books. Um, and then I took, you know, a couple of paychecks and I moved to San Francisco to pay $400 of rent, you know, right? And it's like, uh, you know, scary. Yeah, scary. $400 of rent. So now I'm, you know, I take my job with me. I transfer and I'm making like $800 a month and paying like $400 and the well time burrito like I was talking about, you know, it's like, um, but so then after you pay 400 bucks for a while, maybe you find something better. It's 600 and you're still like, ah, it's expensive, you know. And so then you're paying six and you're like, oh, shit. But then after a while, it doesn't matter. Like, you know, you work enough hours, like you figure out a way to figure it out. Yeah, it just doesn't, like, you know, and then you move into the $800 studio and that was the big one. Like, dude, dude, $800 rent. I've never paid this in my life. This is insane, but it's a becomes a non issue. You just, you know, and it's just like, it just works. It just works. It works. You know, like, I have to move back to the one bedroom because it's, you know, it just works. It works, right? Take the plunge. That's the thing. And the really cool thing is if it doesn't work, if for whatever reason you meet catastrophe as you're pursuing these endeavors, you've still won because you have, like, what is the most glorious way to die according to all mythology? To die on the battlefield, right? Yeah, in battle. To die on the battlefield for a righteous cause is the great glorious way to die. And it's like, well, this is the battlefield. But it's not as romantic when you don't die. You just move back into your mom's house. Oh, that's worse than death. Yeah, totally. But you've still, the thing is, like, when you move back to your mom's house, when you go back to a lower level, you can tell people, I reached too high. I went for it, man. And it didn't work. But guess what? I'm going to go for it again. Exactly. You start again, you know? Man, people are so timid. They're so scared of, like, of immediately not, this is the patience thing, immediately not having to pay off, you know? You ever looked at a skateboarder's leg? Just, like, bolts and scars and, like, you know, how'd you get that? It's like, well, I ate shit 2,000 times, you know? Yeah, look at a professional skateboarder's fucking leg. And you will written on that professional skateboarder's leg is the truth of what it's like to go for it in this universe. And those are beautiful scars. Every single one of those fucking scars on that skateboarder's leg, they don't look at that in shame. They don't point out, oh, yeah, that's where I broke my fucking leg, trying to do some backflip off a building. They're like, I went for it. We're so fucking insane as people. It's like everybody has to go through the same fucking thing. If you want to get good at something, you have to do it to death and be so bad at it when you start. So you have to go through that, like, humiliation of, like, I can't do this thing and people see me. Yes. And it's so in everybody that, but we have then no patience for. And once you get good at it, you have no patience for the kid trying to get good at it. You know, it's like, we have just no compassion. We have, like, it's like, everybody's got to go through this. We all understand what it takes to be there, but we're all, like, once we're there, we just want to, like, look at that and look down and laugh at you like you're trying your best. Trying. It's so embarrassing. I don't have to try. Yeah, right. I just do. You don't do that, though. No. Well, I try not to, but, you know, it's tough when you work around. If anybody ever work with is ever going to hear this, they're going to be like, you fucking, but, you know, if I ever work with anybody that can't cut hair, right, I'm like dying. I'm like, I hate looking at your fucking haircuts all day. You know, it's like, it's just like. I'm the same way. And I've been there. Like, I got my job because people just liked me. Like, you know, I got a job at the shop that I had no business working at. You know, I could not cut hair to save my life, but I was a decent company. Well, you got to understand that the pressure exerted by people we respect to become excellent at whatever the particular profession is, is actually part of the propulsion that moves us in the direction of getting better because we so want those people, you know, in comedy, like the first time like a successful comedian told me, man, you're pretty funny. Oh, it's like amazing. But also the fuel that it's fuel and the it's so it helps, you know, and maybe there is something built into the universe where people have gained success aren't always like, oh, you're doing a great job when someone's not. I mean, it's like when your kid brings you a crayon drawing, you don't want to be like, this fucking sucks because your kid isn't going to become a professional crayon drawer. But in the same way, it's like my friend was, I guess I can't say, my friend was over at a famous comedian, a very legendary. Seinfeld. I can't say. Jerry Seinfeld. A super famous comedian. It was Seinfeld. Even more legendary than that. And this comedian has like kids or maybe even grandkids by now. I just think he got had sex with by Bill Cosby. That's all that means. But no, he was not Bill Cosby, but he he was saying that this comedian's kid was trying to crack jokes at the dinner table. And the comedian's response to the jokes was he would be like, no, that's just not funny. And that's because the comedian wants his kid to be a good comedian. He knows that the way a comedian is forged in reality. I'm not just like staring at their haircuts like, you know, I mean, I am. No, in reality, that is what I'm doing. But in the grand scheme of things, you know, I'm like, I am trying to get through this with the person and giving them like the best pointers I can and like, you know, part of me can be a good teacher. Another part of me wants nothing to do with the process. Once I've gone through it, you know, yeah, right. But, um, that's true. Nothing to do with the process once you've gone through. And that's right. Yes. It's just too like too bad going through it. It's part of isn't it part of like beautifying the universe is like when you see somebody. I'll pat you on the back for going through it. You know, like great job. I'm really proud of you for doing this. And I'll be here for you. But you know, I mean, don't drag me back to that place. God, man. Thank God there are people who fucking decide to go through it again because there are. And those are the mentors. Those are the patrons. Those are the teachers. Those are the teachers. There's like a 20% part of my abdomen right here. They're on, you know, where I'm like, I'm going to become an instructor of a Barbara College. So I know that it's a place I could go and feel like, yeah, like good and useful, you know. And I mean, not just that, but like, you know, I mean, I don't think being a barber is like really anything. It's just a job. So it's like, if I talk about it, like, it's just, it's just the most recent process I've gone through and live, you know, so, you know. But it's cool. I mean, that's the thing. And small things, all things. That's, you know, so it's like the. I had to go backwards, right? Because if you keep going this way, so you got to go, I'm going back to some small things here. And I don't think you should de-emphasize being a fucking barber. It's like one of the most important parts of my life. So you can't like. Mine too. And when I have a hair out of place, I'm freaked. So it's like, you know, I know. Come on. I mean, I would love to exist in a universe where I didn't give a shit about the fucking weird protein strands blasting out of my head. I want you looking good. See, that's how I know I should be a barber is because Duncan, I fucking, I need you to look good. So bad when I see you on the street, Duncan, if you don't look good, I'm going to be like, come on. I'm so glad you found that money. Come and get a haircut. I'm so glad you found that cash, man. And I think that, uh, yeah, I think it's super cool that we've gotten to be friends. Oh yeah. And, um, I hope folks listening, if you live in Los Angeles and you want to get a bad ass fucking haircut, we'll do it. I'll do it. New California barbershop on Sunset Boulevard right down the street from the American apparel. That's like the biggest, uh, landmark you can give it down there. Cause I'm always trying to explain that. I'm like, well, you know where that American apparel is? Oh yeah. And then it's like, yeah, that was right there. As for Brian Gurgus or, you know, Eric Rodriguez or Nasty Nancy Rodriguez, you know, Danny, Ryan just hired that guy. You know, so there's like a bunch of good people working there. A bunch of good people, but you're talking to the best. I'm the best. I'm sorry. I don't know if you are. I don't know if the, by the way, I don't know if those guys, I'm sure they're great. I'm sure they're amazing. I'm just a better listener. How can people find you? Um, you're not on Twitter, are you? No, but they go to the barbershop, you know, they go down to the barbershop. But you know, the shop has an Instagram, you know, so you could go to the new California and follow it on Instagram or, uh, basically like, uh, you can email me. What's, what's, you don't want to. Nobody would want to email me. Just come down to the barbershop. Go to the Instagram, go to the barbershop. Tell them hello. Thank you so much for being on the show. Yeah, I appreciate having me.

Thank you, bluechew. And we're back and now it's time for a family update. We're moving, the baby's having separation anxiety. Hey, listen, here's the thing. There's a lot of people out there are going to tell you that the best way to find happiness is to lose some weight, get in shape, get some biceps, some triceps, some abdominal muscles. And then there's a whole other camp of people that will tell you that the best way to find happiness is to achieve some transient success in the material world. They'll tell you that the number in your bank account is an indication of whether or not you're a good person. Then there's some people who will tell you that the best way to gain happiness is to worship them, to join their commune and go on the top of a pyramid and suck their dicks or lick their assholes. And then there's a whole group of people that'll tell you that actually the way to happiness is to go into therapy. The problem is you're a tangled knot of trauma that needs to be gradually uncoiled. And then there's people that'll tell you the way to happiness is through cheesecake, scooping up big bowls of cheesecake and bread. Some people will tell you that the best way to gain happiness is through the ingestion of some kind of drug. Maybe smoke some DMT or drink some ayahuasca, eat some mushrooms, and that's how you're going to get happy. And then some people will tell you that the way to happiness is through years of meditation. The truth of the matter is there's no way to happiness, friends, except understanding that you already are happy. What are you going to base your entire activity in a very transient, temporary plane of existence? We call human life on the way the animal part of yourself feels on that knotted, bundled bunch of disparate emotions. Sometimes you want to fuck. Sometimes you want to sleep. Sometimes you want to kill yourself. Sometimes you want to kill other people. Sometimes you want to be the president. Sometimes you want to run a BDSM dungeon in New Jersey and fist strangers for Bitcoin. You're going to stake your claim on any of these very transient shifting emotions. Are you really going to try to build some kind of castle in the melting ice sheets of your interior self? No, the answer is unfortunately as simple as simple can be. You just got to love every single particle of what you are as it is right now. All of it. You got asymmetrical love handles. You're going to love them. You're not happy with your belly button. Maybe you got an Audi when you wanted an any or an any when you wanted an Audi. Maybe you have a micro penis or you're like me and your penis is too big. Your lovers feel too much pain when you make love to them, whatever it may be. All you can do is love it. That's all you can do. Let's face it, we've all been forced off the diving board of our incarnation, plunging towards some abyss on the other side of that vast and penetrable singularity. There could be paradise. There could be nothingness or they could there could be hell. But the fact that mid flight, you've become deeply concerned with whether or not you could do a perfect swan dive into the great void is a waste of processor power. You know, I get the feeling that human incarnation might actually be a belly flop contest, not some professional diving competition. And do you know how absolutely egregious and embarrassing it would be if a professional diver from the Olympics got into a belly flop contest and then in the midst of the contest did some ridiculous dive? How insecure would you have to be in the middle of a belly flop contest to do your stupid Olympic diving? No one cares. Oh, really? Wow. You did the thing during this little transient meat journey from one abyss to the next. So you got a couple of mansions or bought Bitcoin at the right time. Who cares? Nobody does. And the people who do care, they're crazy. So if you're belly flopping, sweet babies, just belly flop, make it a great show. And to quote Khalil Gabron, if you're in a belly flop contest, don't fucking dive. We got a great show for you. Russell Brand is here with us. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. A tremendous thank you to feels for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH feels it's a better way to feel better.

Now welcome for the first time to the DTFH, the great Russell Brand. Russell, welcome to the DTFH. I'm so happy to see you again. And thank you for, and you know, I don't want to see manic here, but how after you get to talk to Russell Brand, so we got to move quick because I got some big questions for you. Do you think humans have a soul? I think humans are primarily a soul and that our physical form is a kind of superficial fluctuation emanating from that soul. So yeah, I think we have a common soul, I think we have an individual soul, and Duncan by God, I think we have an our soul. Not me, my friend, I meditated my ass all the way. Now, that's the part that I always get mixed up on. Ram Dass was big on the soul, and he would look out at the retreat and he would say, I see you all as a soul, that's what I see. And the Hare Krishna is also very much, and any theistic religion has some component of the soul is the sort of mechanism that carries whatever the particular data of your identity onto the next incarnation. But where I always get mixed up is that sort of place where there's the universal soul and the individual soul, because somewhere in there I get really confused. Is the individual soul some kind of like quantum packet that has like a membrane that separates it from the universal soul? How does that work? It's very difficult to physicalize and materialize these abstract and metaphysical ideas, isn't it, Duncan? I was thinking the other day when I spoke to John Hagelin, the quantum physicist and transcendental meditation, spokesperson, that when he spoke about potentialities, like the way that we have to understand an electron is it's here, it's there, it's both, it's neither, that there are these potentialities that may be realized or unrealized. I was talking to a shaman just now, and they were talking about the sort of rediscovering the wild self. And while she was speaking, I was thinking about the idea that either within you, within I, there are so many unexpressed, unrealized potentialities, people that we might have become, people that we might be, that we haven't had the cultural experiences, we don't have the biography, we haven't had the stimulation to become these people, and yet somehow they live within us. I think the idea of place, the idea of time, the idea of space, whilst they are underwritten by physics, of course, I'm not in a position to refute that, they are also no doubt phenomena of scale, phenomena of perception, ultimately can time and space be said to exist beyond human perception of them. Can the idea of a self and other be underwritten, undergirded when you reach a point of transcendence? I would say that this idea of a, you know, like an individual soul versus a universal soul kind of collapses in this realm of potentialities. It is both individual and universal and neither because all of these questions come about as a result of perspective that are temporal and prerequisite on our individualized incarnation here. Our experience as individual in our case, men communicating with one another. So I don't see necessarily, of course there is a contradiction, of course there is a conflict, but there is no contradiction in contradiction when you reach this point of transcendence and as I'm sure you're aware, you know, not to go out on this rather non-separateness. Yeah, it's like the keyhole experience of the human incarnation produces a kind of illusion within which all of this complexity emerges or all of the, everything gets kind of scrambled here from being sort of inside a thing that is clearly not a whole on or whatever you want to call it, but that being said, you know, do you think that at some point, maybe it's already happened, some technology will emerge that allows our species to see beyond this limited human perspective where we're kind of like leashed to our identities? Do you imagine that in the same way we sort of achieved flight or in the way all the amazing innovations that have emerged from the human mind, do you think at some point we might actually transcend the spatial limitations of being identified with a body technologically? Do you think it needs to be technological for us to accept it? Because I noticed that the sort of the metaphorical language that's used to describe the human condition often usually is a reflection of the kind of technology of the age, the machine idea of the human being coming about in the sort of like industrial age when people sort of began to understand mechanics and materialize and realize mechanics and when you were saying that about a technology, you know, I just don't know, it's such an area where I'm particularly clumsy and unaware, God knows that there is a large and complex map where I find myself inept, but mate, already the technology exists, like today before talking to you, I went to a funeral and I watched how sort of heavily ritualized, obviously the process was a Catholic funeral and I was a pool bearer, so I held my mate's father for a little while and I watched the very young priest conduct the rituals and communion and how kind of, you know, bizarre it is, I'm not Catholic, to sort of watch that stuff play out and the theater of it and when I came back home, it was in London, I live outside of cities now usually where possible, I can't take it, I can't take the intensity and I do these breathing exercises, I recently learned of this teacher called Biet, this incredible breathing exercise where you sort of sit with your arse on your heels and you breathe in, throw your head back, exhale, you sort of inhale with head back and exhale forward, inhale, sort of right big belly, breath, dunk and then on the final breath, I always, when I get taught these breath exercises, because you know I don't take drugs no more, that people always recommend a certain number of breaths and I sort of gradually incrementally add more and more breaths to it anyway, like on the final one, like having done these head back and forth inhalation, exhalations, you sort of stand on your knees as it were, you lift your bum up off your heels and stand on your knees, you take a big inhale and you push that belly out and you hold it and then you do the exhale with a bam bam, like a defibrillate in yourself, man, like I really like, now for like, I'm sorry you hate your chest, I'm sorry Russell, you're saying you literally hate your chest, whoa okay, yeah you literally hit your chest right on the heart chakra on the exhale, bam bam, smash that out and you exhale on that and what I experience is a sort of a total sort of foreclosure of individual consciousness and yet an awareness and a strong sense that the thing that I experience in that state is a continuum, a continuum every bit as real as my individual identity, I was Russell when I was a little boy growing up in Essex, I was at Port West Ham, I got married then this happened that happened, oh no I've got kids now, oh look there's the dog, like this sort of linear idea of my life, this sort of a parametered boundary sense of self, I feel that entirely evaporate and yet there is still awareness, I feel like I temporarily perforate, puncture this world where there are rules, where there is a language but I don't know it, I don't know it, it's beyond even semiotics Duncan, I can't even formulate it into oh and this was like a figure and that was happening, it's sort of not like that, it's too everything, too nothing, a vibrant nothingness and now I know a medical person would say well what you did there is you simply hyperventilated but actually what it feels like is access to a continuum of consciousness that is not predicated on my individual awareness and the systems of taxonomy that I apply to reality, I'm me this is that, that's what's happening here, this is language, this is imagery, you know so I would say the technology already exists. Much thanks to Shutter for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH, I actually approached them because I wanted to do an advertisement for them because I love them, I'm a horror movie fan so I love horror movies and I'm a horror movie snob and Shutter has got the greatest curated collection of horror movies in the world, they're amazing, not only that but they're making new movies now that are fucking scary, Host by Rob Savage on Shutter, you want to freak yourself out with the best pandemic movie ever, watch that, legitimately scary, it was uncomfortable fear too which is my favorite kind of fear to feel, if I'm watching a horror movie I don't want to laugh, I don't want to, I'm not, I don't want to watch a comedy show, I want to be freaked out and not be able to sleep and that's exactly what happened when I watched Host, they're amazing, they're on every streaming service, if you're looking for some kind of like curated selection of horror movies that if you're a Fangoria fan, which I am, if you grew up reading horror magazines, if you're somebody who wants to legitimately be freaked out, then Shutter has an unparalleled collection of exclusive and original films and series, horror classics and blockbuster hits, they're amazing, it's not just the stuff that they're making now, they've got all that, all the movies that you would have to like find a specialty video store to discover if you're 46, if you're not that might not make sense to you but there's a time when you couldn't stream stuff, Shutter's expertly curated collection includes titles like The Acclaimed Tigers Are Not Afraid, One Cut of the Dead, Revenge and the Creepshow TV series that my friend Rob Schropp directed, if you're a horror movie fan like me, subscribe to Shutter right now and you can try it for free for 30 days, go to Shutter.com and use promo code Duncan that's S-H-U-D-D-E-R it's Shutter.com promo code Duncan and the first thing you should watch is Host because it's scary and you will not sleep well that night, thank you Shutter. Okay, two things, number one, I'm sorry about your friend's dad and I hope you're feeling okay after a funeral, funerals are, I get, no matter what, no matter how like, you know, Bhagavad Gita, We Don't Mourn for the Living or the Dead and all that, anytime I go to a funeral, I feel it for days, like some kind of, you know, when you walk out of a cigar shop or something, you smell like cigarettes, when you leave a funeral that vibe soaks into you, how are you doing with that? Well, pretty good because as I say, it wasn't the person I knew well and I love my friend very much and he was behaved so well, I watched him with his young son, them two, they did readings and they behaved sort of so beautifully and they remained present and obviously there was sort of a moment where I thought about my own death and I thought about, you know, both my parents are alive, I know you've lost your mother and I think you made such a wonderful piece out of that in your show man, that was such an incredible episode but I was sort of like aware of that, I was aware of that, I tried to remain present and death I feel like it brings you close to God, it brings you close to God and like you though mate, I know that there is no panacea for that the impact of death, like my cat died like a couple of months ago and it just tore right through me to that like I'd had that cat for 17 years, it was only a year in recovery when I got him and I felt like a deep unraveling but because of the sort of work I get to do on my spirituality, it meant I was able to experience that death and not ignore it or avoid it or forego it and it was painful and beautiful and so I suppose like the funeral, I think I was sort of in the car because I like you mate, like you just indicated, I somehow expect myself to be able to just breeze through these experiences to not have the tobacco or the nicotine sort of lacquer on me but I was like today feels bleak for some reason then I thought you just come from a funeral mate, you've just been staring death in the face and it was a you know the curtain straw, it was a cremation and there was the surface and it was in England, it's raining, I mean Jesus. That's yeah, that's whoo, I just, I always, I love to imagine myself as some kind of transcendent yogi or some shit and you know we can pull that off, I can pull that off with spirituality, the self-deluding part versus like working out, you can't fake yourself into thinking you're in shape, you see your body and you're like I'm not in shape but with spirituality you can, I can go through a couple of days where I'm like oh I think I've truly achieved realization and then a thing like that, a funeral loss of a pet, even more so loss of a pet sometimes and then there it is, you're at the abyss and you just are, you know, whatever part of yourself is still rooted in this world, all the implications, you know, all the implications, that's the part that gets me, you know, the great reality, you know, there's a, you know about this of course, I'm sorry, this Buddhist concept that one of the great miracles in the world is that most people don't really believe they're gonna die, that's one of the great global miracles is that people are going through this thing like it doesn't end, you know, and then walloped right, you know, just smack right into that windshield of suddenly there's your friend's dad, there's your mom, there's your dad, you know, so that being said, you Russell Brand seem to have gained some kind of actual realization, if you follow the map of your life, which is a map, you know, which many people know because you're a celebrity, but when you follow the map of your life, comedian, sober person, that's when something starts shifting in you. And suddenly this role that, you know, that it was a role, you're playing the role of this like, this part is not a role, you're clearly like a linguistic genius, but you're a comedian, you're a party person, you're wild, you're wild, a rock star, and then sobriety, and then now you have this beautiful podcast where you have really taken on this role as a spiritual leader. And so tell me, Russell, how do you, from a day to day, how do you deal with the fact that you really are somebody who has become a kind of teacher to a lot of people, a leader, someone who isn't afraid to like, maybe put down the role of rock star comedian and pick up the role of a sober person who really seems to have a legitimate interest that doesn't seem narcissistic, egomaniacal, but a real legitimate interest in trying to help folks who are freaked out. Duncan, what a beautiful thing to say to me. I thank you, you're so kind and I value your opinion, so it's especially gratifying to hear that from you. I can only say, God must want me close because you made me so fragile, Duncan. I continually feel like, you know, don't take even the death of a pet or a funeral. In my ego, it's like, it's just out there. I can, my feelings can get hurt so easily. I'm continually reminded, you best not take yourself seriously. A mate of mine the other day said likely he'd had some spiritual realization about not taking life too seriously, but I, in my mind, that translated to don't take yourself too seriously. Don't take yourself too seriously because it, I get hurt easy. I take my, I find it very easy to be seduced. I can see why I became like a celebrity. I was very keen to sort of fortify some sort of identity and I had the kind of motivations that probably loads of people that are working the kind of games we working have had. If I want to be validated, I want to be verified, but I was also like, again, like I'm sure like a lot of people you speak to, had a continual awareness that this ain't going to work. This is not what it is. I don't know what that is. I mean, that's why I suppose when you, the first question you ask is about the soul, that I have such a kind of certainty about it. But the certainty is only awareness itself, awareness itself, return to the awareness. As soon as I kind of start to overly identify with, yeah, I did this, I achieved that and people like me, it's immediately followed by punishment. Like it's punitive for me to think that. I mean it very literally, I don't get away with anything. I'm one of them people that puts on weight easy. I'm one of those people that gets addicted to things. I'm one of those people that like, I feel experienced strong sort of sexual attraction and obsession and it always gets untidy, you know, like I, so for me, abstemiousness has been the path that I have been given. You know, I can't look at pornography. I can't objectify people instead of people. I can't treat my wife with anything other than respect. And yeah, I, you know, I fail, but now my failings have become, excuse me, a lot, the consequences, please God, have become less significant. Yeah, I can't imagine how someone as sensitive as me, as self-obsessed as me, ever went through a time where I'd like trip out on acid with lunatics and like, I'd like to hang out in crack houses and start fights and I like, I don't know how I ever did that. Well, this, so this is something I've been thinking about a little bit and maybe you could help me clear it up in my head. The, and this sounds like such an idiotically simple thing to say, but I've really been noticed thinking like, you know, you don't have to respond to your emotions. You don't have to react to your emotions. And then a piece of me thinks, well, is it phony? So here you are, this hyper sensitive being that really does. I mean, you are like, if you look at the human incarnation as in, from the rather negative perspective, some people have, which is it is a kind of trap that you choose. It is its own drug. It's in some other dimension. You and I are flesh addicts and we love to snort particular incarnations and get this very fleeting temporary eye compared to the length of the universe where we find ourselves in the material universe. We fool ourselves, wrapping ourselves in a blindfold of a limited perceptual mechanism. And for a very fleeting amount of time, we sort of wander through the world. Towards the end of our lives, there's a little glimmer of wisdom, maybe, and then we just blink out and you do the whole fucking thing again. But you look at these, that's one version. The Buddhist version is quite often like, you know, the human incarnation is a great incarnation, not because we can snort cocaine and do acid and fucking till our dicks hurt, but because you find yourself in this middle place between the realm of the gods and the hell realms. And there's a potential to break the literal addiction to humanity itself so that when we die, we don't go back to whatever particular trap house they sell human incarnations at. But what I'm saying here is like, on the other hand, you see the other path, the left hand path, tantra, Crowley, magic. And on that path, they're like, listen to that part of yourself, the part that wants to fuck till your dick hurts, the parts that wants to take acid with lunatics, go down that path until it destroys you because what else did you come into this realm for but to satisfy your desires and you, Russell Brand of all people, oh, if you wanted to think of what you could do. So you know what I mean? So I go back and forth between like, man, is it kind of phony to like resist all those grand impulses? That's the, you know, stereotypical Satan is Robert De Niro and Angel Heart thing. And then the other, then the other side of me is tuning into what you're talking about, which is like, well, actually, if I go down that path, I become a kind of like just a meat robot pointless ultimately. But tell me, Russell, is it phony for folks who have within them that thing that you have in a very deep way? Is it sort of like, is it really that we're just terrified of going deep into who we really are? And so we try to resist those impulses, imagining we're saving ourselves when it's just another fucking addiction. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that rant. It's just I go back and forth in my own head with that stuff, you know, like, fuck, I, I do, I know you mean man, if I follow my instincts, I'm going to be the worst husband, worst dad, and a complete self-absorbed piece of shit. But then on the other hand, I'm like, fuck, maybe that's just what I am. Well, I like it when you ran. You've got such a beautiful vocal range, such a wonderful conduit, a really, really great performer, mate. Thank you. Well, this is what I've been thinking about. Is I wonder how, you know, sometimes when I flirt with the atheists, I mean their ideology rather than the atheists themselves, of course. And when they say like, I think, isn't it interesting the way that the mystical has expressed itself in all these various traditions, both what the things they have in common, whether it's the idea of the virgin birth or the resurrection or just something as simple as totemism or the crucifix, like these symbols and emblems that are recurrent or whether, you know, in Buddhism, like the sort of, perhaps the sort of most austere and sort of rational of the sort of really popular and well-known ideals still has reincarnation in it, which is still a bit, whoa, okay, well, you're going to come back again. I mean, that's sort of beyond rationalism. I feel like all of these ideas, these ancient ideas that have been around for millennia, that are evolutions of even, even older ideas, intuitive and reified through scripture, I kind of awareness of what was to come. And the new understanding that in the subparticular realm, the what all of our rationalism falls apart, everything that we thought we knew is a local village custom. It doesn't matter even the stuff that we're made of in our own consciousness, our own bodies, the rules of thermodynamics, a moment, it all starts to unravel. It's like they intuited, oh, it's an endless cycle, you come back again, nothing is real, it's an illusion, all these ideas are embedded in it. I think a lot about sensitivity and I think about the language around it, you know, like I had a friend once that I used to hang with, I loved him a lot, he was a sort of, he was in my entourage type era, hung out with this dude who was pretty handy and on the periphery of criminality. And he used to be somewhat suspicious of the idea of addiction, he used to say it's just weakness. But I thought like, you know, addiction is commonly understood as a disease, an ailment, a malady, an illness. And then I thought of how that's almost a synonym for sensitivity, a particular sensitivity. I have this sensitivity, it's not particularly rare. A lot of people I know have this sensitivity to the world, where you feel it brush against them, rub against them, the abrasiveness of the material world. And in it I think is the intuitive understanding that we are experiencing, but a fragment received through the senses of all potential possible realities. And that there is an ulterior realm accessible to us. It don't seem phony no more, it seems phony in moments, you know, that's why I need a practice, because if I meet people that I'm attracted to, or if my ego is inflated, like, you know, even when you're saying nice stuff to me in the context of this podcast, I be mindful of the fact that as much as I value your love and respect and appreciation, your love and respect and appreciation can't save me, that this is a brief conversation that you and I all have, and you've got a family and stuff, and that you'll return to that, and I'll return to my family, and I can't become dependent on anything. I can't become dependent, and I'm lucky that I received those lessons in such a smack-in-the-mouth, plain way by becoming chemically dependent on E.G. heroin. It makes me realize, oh, I objectified salvation, I made it into something, and then it hurt me, and I had to let go of it. Sometimes it does feel phony. You know, I remember, like, it comes down to these sort of very basic questions, Duncan, about whether or not you're optimistic or pessimistic about human nature, about whether or not you believe humans are good, ultimately. Like, if you go deep, deep, deep down enough, the will is what you're going to find there. Is it going to be love, or is it something more cynical and darker than that? And I have to believe that it's love, and I have to rationalize that that love is some kind of certainty of oneness, or at least not separateness. Like, they did some sort of etymological analysis of the word love in various, various languages, and they found that what it most commonly meant was union, coming together, as if on some deep, pre-linguistic, pre-limbic aspect of our awareness and awakeness, we know that we are one thing, that what's looking at me from behind your eyes is the same as what's looking back at you. And I feel like this, for me, feels like a choice. Also, man, you'd love that thing that, William Blake's engravings of the Book of Job, where he says, like, where Yahweh and Job are depicted as sort of looking identical, and Job goes through these trials. Why does Job go through these trials? He was a good guy anyway, it seems, because he was unaware, he was unconscious, and Job, Yahweh shows to Job in these midst these trials. Here is the behemoth that I have made, and you see the behemoth, mate, and it's a scary looking thing as Blake depicts it in this engraving, it's like it ain't got no skin on it, it's just muscle and sinew and appetite, some roaring, priopic, ever fucking bunch of just larynx and dumb fucking thing. And then he says, here's the leviathan that I have made as I made thee, the creature of the deep, the serpent, of silky fangs and scales, and these things are in us, we are them. And here in this book, this sort of Jungian analysis of these engravings of Blake, it says that we might like, it indicates at least if it doesn't say it, if we ain't good, then God ain't good. That's why we have to become good, that's why we have to become holy, because God is ambivalent. It's all things, if we don't manifest glory, if we don't manifest good, then there is no good, it's important, we're not trying to get like a little badge or a stripe or some sort of approval, we are manifesting God's glory, because if we don't manifest it, then it ain't there. That is so beautiful and terrifying! It's terrifying. You know, at one point I was doing this visualization where I was trying to imagine I was hanging out with Jesus, and you know, in this case, I'll admit it was the white Jesus I picture, because that's the picture I've seen the most of, and I'm sitting with Jesus in some kind of Middle Eastern something, and I'm looking at him in this visualization, and that, to me, it was terrifying, because the being seemed beyond sensitive, beyond vulnerable. The being seemed like the being needed help, and that is the last version of Jesus I wanted my mind to create. You wanted Jesus, it's going to help you! Me, Jesus! Oh, Duncan, I've not been well! And you know, this is like, to me, what you're saying is so beautiful, and on one, just purely if you want to go Jean-Paul Sartre, I'll bug-eyed and fucked up on speed, and France saying anything you do, you give the world the permission to do. You're the arbiter of morality, and every act that you do, you're saying, anyone can do this to me. You want to lie, you're saying everyone can lie to you. You want to cheat, you're saying everyone can cheat on you. That's the just no afterlife, but then the other, what you're talking about, process theology, that, oh, well, see, here's the thing, we're the embryonic God right now. This, as it is, is it. There is no God, there's no more, we, God is still, like you're saying, the universe is ambivalent, but that's just because the rainbow wheel, like on your computer, is spinning. If the sum total of sentience and the damn thing veers in the direction, in the opposite direction MLK was talking about, then yeah, that's what we got. We got the leviathan, we chose the leviathan, and that's what we could become. But then, so what you're saying is so beautiful, I love it, because yeah, it's going against your instincts doesn't mean you're phony, right? It just means that you're, you're not an animal, you know, you don't, you do, but, and so I really do, I love what you're saying, and it did thank you, because it's something I struggle with, because it seems so beautiful to real, like for me, it's like, I don't have to feel every moment, like I'm completely in love with my wife, to express love to my wife. If I start limiting myself to that, some emotional set, to be the thing that determines whether or not I can be kind to the world, then, oh man, that's putting, that's, or if you know, we limit ourselves to moments of epiphany, that that's when we're going to start writing, or if we limit ourselves to whatever the particular emotional coordinate is from which our, our souls manifest into the world, then we are going to be perpetually limited by that, that's just another drug anyway. But to me, this is, this is something that I still, I don't mean to keep digging. Do, do you feel sometimes, and how do you deal with this, that this role that you've taken, you have these great Instagram posts, I have known, I've gotten jealous, women that I have been in relationships with, will show me, before we met, will show me Russell Brand Instagram videos, and be like, isn't this wonderful? And I'm like, no, it's not wonderful, not because I don't believe it, because it's like, don't look at Russell Brands. But what I'm saying, man, is don't, do you, you interviewed, you were, you were, Mooji, you interview all these spiritual people, but at some point you're going to become Mooji. Don't you feel like maybe you're holding yourself back from that, if something, do, do you, or, or do you worry that if you spend too much time thinking about this, what you're doing, that you'll end up once again, succumbing to these sensitivities. You know what I mean? Like, at what point are you going to go full David Bowie? You know, and really let go of the brand, the Russell, the Russell brand, and like become what you already, this teacher thing, you know, I mean, look at Ram Dass, some point he gave up being the, the, the closeted gay, brilliant psychologist and became one of the great teachers. Do you see that in your future? I don't, like, yeah, I suppose I do, but even like seeing it is a little bit, you can see that there's ego left in me, hey, to even have an attachment to that, to have an attachment to that idea. I'd see, I'm very comforted when you approach something that we found in like a, like the reason I like that book of Job thing, right, is because the book of Job is this, you know, thousands of years old bit of scripture, probably derived from folkloric things older than that, Blake, the 18th century British artist or 19th brother. And then, and then you say an existential philosopher, Satra is saying a comparable thing, like these truths keep realizing themselves through time. Now, like what I, you know, when you sort of take that back to sort of me and how I see myself, I like, I got that opportunity to go around the sort of celebrity rollercoaster and feel it and experience it. And I got to be decadent and hedonistic and all of that. And I know from myth and I intuit it to be true that the grail comes again, that the grail comes again, it comes to you once when you're young, it comes to you again in middle age, you're offered once again, do you want it? Do you want to heal the wound? Do you want it? And if you, if I, I can't ever again make the mistake of believing in my constructed egoic identity, I can't ever do it again. I can't go back to that. I can't go back to the idea of some repackaging of celebrities, some new version of this time, I'm going to do it this way. Because I've, I'm, I'm moted by, I was to always had those what felt like a simplistic as twin forces, even when, when I was a kid, I wanted to, I did stand up Duncan for a long, long time for nothing above pubs, like any stand up, you know, has to do it again and again and again for nothing in your crap and no one will pay you and people pelt you and physically assaulted and all of these things for years. And in that time, I, you know, I loved the art of it. I loved it. I loved it. But also I was hungering after the artifacts that the culture told me presented to me as fulfillment. They told me fame, celebrity, power, decadence, hedonism, this is what you are. This is your route. The clown is the shamed shaman. The shaman has been shamed and becomes clown. What? That is fucking crazy. Oh man, that's the coolest. Wow. What? Sorry. Go ahead. Oh man, that's so cool. Sorry, Russell, didn't mean to emote so loudly to cut. Stop your rant. That was a zinger. Please continue. So I feel that I have to resist that thing in me that likes the sort of, you know, holder knotted crucifix as I'm holding now and wears a sweatshirt with gratitude on it. And I don't get to, I'm not too quick to rush into the robes and the blankets and to stand. I feel so at home though when I'm there on that frequency. I've got to tell you, this is when I'm happiest. Having conversations like this, I'm having with you. It won't matter if to me if you didn't broadcast it particularly, although it will be a buzz if you did. And like, you know, like, and I like sitting on stage and doing stuff that's increasingly becoming like what they call it, satsang. You know, like my live shows when I was still doing live shows, it's becoming more and more people ask me questions. And I tell you, I had this experience once, mate. I was doing a film. I've done a film like last year, kids film. It would call four kids in it. And on the last day of it, because like, we are both things. We are both things. I am both the guy that does feel more comfortable in a movie hanging out with the guys that do the sewage on the trailers. And I'm also aware enough to know that that is a cliche to say that I am that, that I am the guy that prefers hanging. Anyway, I was hanging out with that guy. Like, I mean, that's all of the camp. Actually, I didn't just do the sewage. I'm just really trying to embrace that underworld idea to really give this is Hades. This is Hades at base camp, Duncan. And like, I'm like, oh, on the last on the last day of the movie, after I've done some dumb thing of getting a nice cream truck to drive onto the set. And I did it in a sort of a little bit of an obnoxious way. There was loads of kids in this movie. So yeah, I'm trying to be Willy Wonka and everything. Anyway, like this guy who I've been chatting to the whole time told me that his sister, he goes and my sister, I've told you about my sister, she's on the phone. And she wants to talk to you. And he'd already told me that his sister's son had died 18 in the street of like taking pills. And like, he'd just had a heart attack or whatever. And it was a couple of years ago. And he goes, here she is on the phone. Right. So then this woman, this mother, this grieving mother tells me this is like what she felt. And she tells me the particular details of her son's death. And in that moment, I don't know how to handle that. I don't know that the grief of a mother. But in that situation, I have to handle that. Like, I mean, it's like, that's where I am. So I have to. So in my little head, I say, please God, show just please talk through me because I'm talking to this woman now. And I cut what I'm going to say. Oh, I don't know that sad. I've got to tell her what she needs to hear. I've got to do it. And so she tells me the thing about the boy at the site and the she did. She told me like 148 I got a text saying see you later mum at 248 someone else on his phone telling me daddy died on the street in front of 300 people outside a nightclub. My boy, she tells me this thing. And I just open myself. I open myself. And I say what I feel needs to be said, perhaps, and perform most acknowledging the inability of anyone to ever say anything that can can medicate or heal such a deep wound. And I suppose what I'm saying is, is like, the person that wants to become a teacher is the person that can't become the teacher. That's the person I used to be. And I want to let go of him. And I like when I spoke to Eckhart told one time, Duncan, he said, you can like, you know, it's not just old fame ain't gonna make you happy or celebrity or orgies or Ferraris children being a father. Like all of the beautiful things won't do it either. He said, we can never be happy in the conceptual mind. We can only be happy by fully inhabiting the exact moment that we appreciate in the aliveness of the exact moment you're in. Yeah, return to this he says return to this. Well, this is so this is the to me like when I'm thinking about the concept of why we choose our incarnations. You picked a real riddle. And it's a real you it does imply a kind of like, you know, playing the video game on hard. I think this is why Buddhism starts with in the palace. And that's the thing I love about it. But it's Buddha starts in the palace. And, you know, you you you some people are very lucky. They, you know, take like God, the dildo can see Rinpoche, you know, him, he's the Dalai Lama's teacher. He was Chogyam trumpet Rinpoche's teacher. He begged from a very young age begged his parents to let him become a monk. And then he like spilled hot soup on himself burn himself was in bed for for days. And in bed was saying, please, let me just become a monk, let me become a monk. And then he went in like lived in a cave for years. And so, you know, that's considered like real good karma. Whereas, but if the capitalist world, the world that it seems like we might be leaving kind of, it looks at you in your life as the good karma. It's like you got the brain, you got to be a comedian, you got to be a celebrity. And but but really, if you think about it, the real puzzle that you're in is that you got all that stuff. And now you're beginning to experience Delgo can see Rinpoche's impulse when he was a kid, except you really are in you're still in the palace as long as you're in the Russell brand body as long as you're the you you can't go out and you can't go walk around. You can't if you have a problem with your ego getting inflated, you can't go in public. Wherever you go, you go to you're the guy who goes to a restaurant. And everyone pretends you're not there. But they're all like, Oh, fuck, that's Russell brand. Oh, fuck, Russell brand's eating. Oh, fuck, look, and they pretend not to look at you except for the one person who comes over and says, Hi, all I'm saying is what a what a beautiful trap. You don't have to suddenly get the taste for the things you're getting the taste for and then simultaneously still be in the gravity well of the identity of a celebrity. To me, wow, that's amazing. How what is how are you going to solve this problem? Well, some of that those some of that's not that hard, because I think that in that same restaurant, if Jay Z or Justin Bieber or Adele or any one of thousands of people came into that restaurant, that my presence would suddenly be irrelevant. So and also it is a reminder to I cannot allow myself to go unconscious. I cannot go unconscious. I have to stay present and aware in the moment. I can't live in other people's perception of me. I can't allow that to be who I am. I love your palace metaphor with self, you know, theology like that starts in the palace. And yeah, and it's his journey begins there in the case of Buddha. I heard once might be Joseph Campbell, I can't remember. But like they said that when you know when they knew that Christ was coming, they check the palaces and new king is coming a new king is coming. So they think they saw that the palace is where we're going to find this guy. If a king's coming, he's going to be born in the palaces. But where is the king born? The king is born in the stable. Where do you find your sovereign? You find your sovereign among the animals, you find your sovereign among the poor, you become a king, you become in throne and enshrined in poverty. Now like I grew up in a pretty ordinary background. I'm a single parent, only child just with my mom. I felt inadequate. I was overweight and like this the rush of like celebrity Duncan, it sort of was euphoric. It was a hurricane of stimulation and acceptance. It was overwhelming. It was saccharine and I drowned, you know, I drowned, but it killed me. It sort of and it kept killing me. And I was awake in the middle of my death in the kind of this isn't working. And the times that from the outside looked like the best times were torturous, were torturous. And I've been slowly trying to descend, descend into being a real earthed father, into being a husband, into being an awakened and authentic expression of who I am. I participated in a men's retreat the other day and I ran a couple of sessions at it and I spoke to that dude James McLeary. James McLeary is part of a group called Inside Circle. There's a documentary called The Work that you can see where in false and prison they run men's groups. He's so cool, man. I told this James McLeary, he's a great teacher. He said like I called him out before because I'm running these men's group. I'm thinking of doing some like some of the work they do. They do role play stuff, mate, where they get men to reenact like traumatic events that happen to them in childhood. But bearing in mind they're doing it in false and prison, there's these guys that are out of the crypts or guys that are our white supremacist gangs in the chapel. It's a sacred space of neutrality. So they will all work with one another. But it's like people that are in prison for murder reenacting events from their childhood. They also bring in men from the outside. And I said to James McLeary, I wanted to try some of these exercises. I said, I don't feel like I'm ready to do it. He said your humility is attractive. But I feel like you're ready and you'll be all right. I still didn't feel ready. I checked him with a couple of other other men on the group when we did it. I'm thinking of doing this thing. I thought some of them have seen that film and know the work. He's sort of common comparable to Gestalt type stuff anyway. And this guy, Willie, who's one of the people to do the group with, he goes, yeah, yeah, try it, try it. And I ran it with, I ran an exercise with a sort of young man and it was sort of without blowing this dude down and him, he sort of father stuff, the sort of stuff you would anticipate. And afterwards, I called James McLeary and I said, I did it. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the confidence. It went well. And he said, he said, like, and I told him how I'd done it as well. I told him that when this guy sort of said about particular incidents, I told him about stuff that happened to me with men when I was a kid and how I'd felt humiliated and not heard and sometimes intimidated and physically friend, et cetera. And he said, James McLeary, he said, your authentic self will trump imposter syndrome every time, every time. Yes. That's it. That's what I'm talking about, man. God, Jesus, that's so cool. Man, that is so beautiful. This is what I'm talking about. This is it. Thank you. I just struggle with that shit so much, man. My head is a legion of like comedians and cynical friends and cynical people. And anytime I want to start opening up about just even to imagine going to a men's group, a cacophony of people in my head are like, oh, come on. The number of eyes, talk about the leviathan. The leviathan in my head has millions of eyes and they all roll, roll backwards. You know, so to me, I think that's, to me, that's some, one of the many things I love about you and feel really inspired by is that you threw it off. You threw it off. But Russell, wasn't there a time in the liminal phase between where you are now and where you were? There must have been some of your friends who are like, what happened to you? What's going on with you? One of the things that's fortunate about being like in recovery is you sort of accept numerous deaths, the death of the drug addict, death of the sex addict, the death of pornography, the letting go of this. And so there's, there were, I called up a mentor I have and I like a sort of, when I stopped being, living in Los Angeles and being involved in that entertainment and everything, I came back here and I got really suddenly immersed in activism and that's thing really blew up. And before I knew it, they were talking about me in their houses of parliament, which is the equivalent of your Congress. And I was in the newspapers all the time. It got really out of control and it sort of blew up and it collapsed. And the reason it collapsed is because my ego got involved, if you're interested, because I started to think, me, I am powerful. And it immediately fell apart. I forgot that what was actually happening is I said things that other people felt. And so like I became a kind of a conduit for them. Then I thought, no, it's me. It's me. And I tried to take it. I tried to wear it, Duncan. I tried to wrap myself in the fleece and it all went dark for me. So like I am, like at that point, my whole, I remember calling up this guy, my sponsor, and it goes to him, I feel like I could walk away from everything in my life. I feel like I could walk away from the house. I live in my friends, everything, the job I do, I feel like I could walk away. And he knew well enough to say, you know, to sort of talk about Dante and like a half, at the halfway point, at the halfway point, when suddenly you can see there's more behind you than there is in front of you, you start to evaluate, who am I? What am I going to, and like I experienced another death there. And before too long, I was in Bicom Incidents was in Glastonbury is where I went to, which is obviously a really sacred sort of place in England with the woman I'm now married to, where we sort of went there and hung out together and sort of practiced, like unc, without stating as much, can we be together? Can we be, can we live together and do this? And so I accepted that death, I accepted that death. And I suppose we have to continually accept that death. Like he says, Campbell, what does it matter if Christ died on the cross 2000 years ago, if you don't die unto yourself every moment and become reborn, reborn in the moment, that we're not the same men we were at the beginning of this conversation that we have grown. And I love that thing you did, that vision question. I would love to hear more about how you did it where you sort of hung with Christ and he was fragile, real calf Jesus, shivering and pale and hopeless white Jesus in a crate I'm able to cope. I sometimes do like imaginary sweat lodges with like another think of who I have this sometime I have like Muhammad Ali there and Bill Hicks there and John Lennon and some yeah, yeah, yeah and Foster Wallace. And I imagine that we're sat hanging out in like a sweat lodge. And I think I sort of meditate and I pray with them and think of their like them going, yeah, you'll be all right, you'll be all right, they encourage me on or sometimes maybe it'll be Gandhi or whatever depends on what sort of thing I think I need. And I like to use these sort of imaginary somewhat mystical exercises. Yeah, I heard about it in chaos magic. This whole, you know, the idea that you can, you know, everybody's picking these deities just because they're like, you know, Jesus is like the celebrity deity Buddha. It's everybody knows Buddha. But the idea being that Oh, no, you you're still in the part of your consciousness where you think it needs to either be a global figure, religious symbol, where in chaos magic, the idea is, Oh, no, you can actually summon Batman. You can sign because you're, you're plugging into the archetype of the thing that embodies those particular symbol sets, not the symbol set itself. And so you can send your own sentience into anything you want. So the Jesus thing, it did wasn't anything more than I was listening to a televangelist saying you should talk to Jesus. And so I, I parked my car and just sat there. I was like, okay, Jesus, let's talk. And there it was just right there. And it was like, Oh, no. Oh, no. But to me, I think that that's, you know, the idea everyone's like, well, aliens, why would they look like us? Well, the reason they look like us is because they're more advanced. And they made themselves look like us to say hello, not because they happen to look that way. And I think that's probably the same with any kind of archetype you contact. It's not that's not the way Jesus is, but that's the way Jesus decided to show up for me in that moment. Being like, what are you going to do? Lean into a symbol and pretend everything's okay. Meanwhile, you're, you're, you're being an asshole in the world. I need your fucking help. And that, that's beautiful. So to me, that's really beautiful. We only have five minutes and I'm sitting here trying to think of some pithy way thing. Last question to ask you. And I, this is cheesy. We can cut it out if you don't want to do it. You want to, will you say a prayer? Yeah, all right. I'm down for a prayer. Always. Well, okay, let's start. Oh, God, however we can conceive of you and off the back of what Duncan just said about how archetypes will be realized, however we can comprehend them may all listening to this understand a benevolent and kind presence in their life, perhaps as personified by someone they knew or an experience that they've had, or perhaps by a God from the superstar panoply that me and Duncan will go for one of the greats, the Buddhas, the Jesus, the Mohammed. Be careful if you, if you imagine him, keep it in the imagination. Don't render him physically or you'll irritate a lot of very, very devout people. Or perhaps it's from the celebrity world or even the comic book world, but to recognize that there are sacred super material beings, energy systems accessible to you. And I pray, I pray for us to reach our highest good. I pray for the great light within you to realize itself. I pray for it to grow for it to connect into the light within each of us. I pray that we will be held together. I thank you, God, for the gift of Duncan Trussell for his wit, his passion, his rasping excellence, the orchestra that is his voice, the beautiful John the Baptist madness that is his face. So thank you for his creative voice in the world, for his ability to tell stories and to pull together references from across culture. Please, God, help me to become the person that you would have me be. Please, God, forgive all the things that I've done that are out of alignment with the moral code that you've planted in me with the intuition I feel in my belly, the own moral barometer where I feel when I have strayed. Show me more clearly, God. Give me the knowledge of your will and the strength to carry it out. Allow me to help the vulnerable people in this world. Allow me to bring about laughter and wisdom and please allow me to walk the path that you intend me to walk. Over to you, dear Duncan. God, thank you so much for giving me the ridiculous pleasure of getting to do a podcast with Russell Brand, who just poured a lifetime's worth of transformative data into my brain and answered all the questions that were eating me alive. Please, God, don't be afraid to take my poodles bark out of his mouth from now on, but please keep him alive. I love Gatsby so much, but if he interrupts the podcast one more time, I don't know what I'm going to do. And finally, God, please continue to inspire Russell Brand, because we need him. Vulnerable white Jesus needs Russell Brand. Thank you, Russell, for being on my show, man. That was such a delight. I am so grateful for your time. I can't thank you enough. And I mean, it's a ridiculous thing because you're Russell Brand, but how can people find you? I don't, I just, if they do find me, they should tell me where I am. I love you.

Put a crown on your grandma and rub your dog's paws. Here he is, loosening to your ear buds like Nutella in the vagina of the queen. It's Duncan Trussell! Hello, it's me, Duncan Trussell. And you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And did you know that at this very moment you could be making memories for your future children? It's true, and it's science. This is from the Telegraph UK. I'll post the link on the comments section of this podcast. Memories can be passed down to later generations through genetic switches that allow offspring to inherit the experience of their ancestors, according to new research that may explain how phobias can develop. Scientists have long assumed that memories and learned experiences built up during a lifetime must be passed on by teaching later generations or through personal experience. However, new research has shown that it is possible for some information to be inherited biologically through chemical changes that occur in DNA. Researchers at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta found that mice can pass on learned information about traumatic or stressful experiences, in this case a fear of the smell of cherry blossoms to subsequent generations. The result may help to explain why people suffer from seemingly irrational phobias. It may be based on the inherited experiences of their ancestors. This is a pretty awful experiment. They took these poor little mice and they would fill the air with the smell of cherry blossoms while electrocuting them. And then the offspring of these mice freak out whenever they smell cherry blossoms. So the idea that memories, phobias, fears can be passed down genetically from one generation to the next, obviously opens up the doorway to so many psychedelic ideas that so many different people from new age movement to. Clarevoyance to, you name it, have been saying for a very long time, which is encoded within us, is this kind of library of information. And the name of that library is the Akashic Records. If you don't know what the Akashic Records are, I'm just going to go to our digital Akashic Records Wikipedia. It says that in theosophy and anthroposophy, the Akashic Records, a term coined in the late 1800s from Akasha, the Sanskrit word for sky, are a compendium of thoughts, events and emotions believed by theosophists to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the astral plane. Has science discovered the Akashic Records are not in some hokey crystal-gazing astral plane, but in fact exist somehow within our very genetic structure? Is it possible that science will eventually be able to uncode and to unravel all the memories of our ancestors locked into our DNA? What are these memories? Are they memories? Is it some kind of genetic switch that gets turned that somehow encodes within the depths of the chromosomes, of baby mice, of fear, of cherry blossoms? What does that look like? How does it work? Does this point to the idea that there is no time and that at every single moment we are connected to all the ancestors who are currently existing in the multiverse and a kind of multidimensional sandwich of happening? Could it be that in the future, super advanced computers will actually be able to do a genetic scan and show us memories of those that went before? On metaphysical mumbo jumbo aside, there is something incredible about the idea that there is the possibility that certain experiences that we have will continue to move through time genetically into the future as long as we have little babies. It's also incredible to think that the experiences that we inflict on other people don't just end with those people but have the potential for moving into eternity. That really is crazy to imagine that decisions that Hitler made are continuing to roll through the chromosomes of all those who are affected by his monstrosities. It's also a hopeful thing to imagine that the wonderful experiences that we allow other people to have could potentially continue to reverberate genetically through time like some kind of chromosomal bell ringing through all the positive actions of those who have been encoded by whatever experience that was good that we helped to engender. It's a really amazing thing to imagine. This really lends credence to all the religions that have some component of ancestor worship or praying to the ancestors. And there is also a very small but real bit of comfort that comes from knowing that within you exists all of the loved ones that you may have lost that somewhere inside of me maybe there are some of my mother's memories hiding out in my chromosomes or the memories of my mother's mother or mother's father. Wild stuff. Thank you science for helping to affirm my basic belief that we exist in a spectacular universe and that your unraveling of the great mysteries of this universe don't lead to dullness or stasis or stagnation but actually only increase the beauty and novelty of this incredible dimension that we happen to be floating on a genetic raft through.

It's called In Ruins. So now everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, The Bitter Buddha himself, Eddie Pepitone. Eddie Pepitone, welcome. Thank you so much for being on the show, man. Thanks for having me. It's been too long, my friend. It has been too long. Yeah, we tried a little bit, but it's hard, man. It's hard. I was just talking to a friend about, you know, the intensity of schedules and just the intensity of life, like how much we have to do as comedians, you know. Other people, you know, screw them. I think people who aren't in show business are cowards. I've always said that if you're not in show business... Very popular opinion. And I'm talking about everybody. Firemen, policemen, like they're just cowards. I think that's what Obama ran on for most of his election, isn't it? That concept. Yes. He was like, it was the Broadway platform, like, you know, if you're not in a play, you're not living. That's it. Yeah. But anyway, it's the tyranny of, like, the tyranny of, like, all the stuff we have to do, because of the internet, for instance, we have to promote, like, it seems like it's endless work to do. Yeah. You know, like, oh, go on Twitter, go on Facebook, promote. You know, like, be funny, be funny on all these forms, all these social media forms. Yeah, there's that pressurized... I think that's such a... That's one of those things where, when that thought oozes into my mind, before shame follows, thinking of the... Shame is never far behind. Whatever I do, you know? But I do think about that kind of, like, you know, there's the comfort that comes from a job where you get a paycheck every two weeks, and you know for sure it's coming. That weird comfort you get, and it's a very nice comfort, too, where, you know, like, shit, man, at the end of this two weeks, I'm getting this exact amount of money. It's what I always get. I know where the money goes. I can't even imagine that as you're talking about it. Yeah, well, I mean, it's crazy. For us, there's always this creeping feeling, you know? Are we ever going to get any money again? Yeah, well, it happened again. Is this going to keep happening, or are we at the precipice of destruction? And that can be a real mindset. It's amazing how you have to kind of put all that in abeyance and, like, leave it and just trust. Like, okay, I'm just going to do what I do, and then just trust that it's all going to be okay. That's a big issue for me, is trust. I'm always like, I'm always trying to control everything. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, okay, if I do this, then I'm pretty sure I'll get this. And you know what? Never fucking happens. Never happens. The way I think it should. You know what I mean? Like, if I tweet this about my album, then I'm going to get all these people to get this album. No way. No way. Doesn't happen like that. I've noticed that things tend to work out more for me when I am spending time on things that don't have anything to do with what I want to succeed. I think you're right about that. It's a weird law of friction or something, where if you apply a repetitive action, like a meditation practice, exercise, daily writing, or any kind of thing like that, if you apply this kind of repetitive action, then other parts of your life start heating up. And my friend, Mikey, was telling me, he saw in a, I don't know what weird movie he saw, but one of the characters was giving advice to the other character and he said, if you do any one thing every day, if you've come up with anything to do, no matter how absurd the act is, and he gave the example of pouring a glass of water into the toilet every morning, if you just do that and stick to that every day, magic will start happening in your life. Interesting. Interesting. That must be something about discipline. Like when you're disciplined, that form that you bring into your life enables other things to come into it somehow. Like by adhering to a form, it enables content to come through. Whereas if you're formless, I don't know. I can't figure it out. And that formlessness is one of the dangers of being a comedian, right? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And I kind of work form, like I do a lot of formless stuff on stage when I stand up. Like I like to like just go where my mind takes me. And sometimes that's a danger too, because I'm not structuring anything, you know? And I feel lost. I feel lost. How much of your act is planned out versus written? You know, when I go on the road, I plan a lot of it because I feel like, well, I don't know this audience when I'm here in LA, which is my home base lately. I don't plan anything. But when I'm feeling a lot of love on the road, then I really kind of just go with everything as well. Like I can just be in my present moment if I'm really feeling good. You plan nothing. Right. I try not to plan it. Like that's, no, I have stuff that I can go to because as you know, when you get in front of crowds, there can be a point where, holy shit, they're not going for this little mind bubble I'm into. Yep. And I can, you could panic and go, whoa, whoa, they're not digging the old Eddie. So let me go to this tried and true stuff. You always have to have kind of a bag of tricks to go into. Do you start with an opener usually, or do you start with improv? You know what? I always think it's a good idea to have a good solid like opener. So they're immediately with you. Lately I've taken to, I just come screaming on stage, why do they keep taking Liam Neeson's kids? I mean, I understand they're filming, taking four. Is it just that he's in a tent of like, without even saying hello, I think that's a cool way to like, whoa, the audience is like, oh, shit. Yeah. You know, he doesn't care about us. And I love that. He's so confident. You got to, you kind of have to instill confidence in people. Right. If you come out like, oh, hi. Yeah. Oh, well, this is a funny weird thing, huh? Yeah. People, that's the one that people do respond to confidence. It's almost like confidence is more important than being funny. And that's one of the people, that's like the black, the black magic comedians are the ones who figured out that if they just emote this confidence, they can get away with so much. You know, that's, That's true. It's almost like people are laughing at their rhythm and tone. Yeah. Instead of the content, which is the opposite of what standup should be in a way, but that's the way it goes. Right. Well, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, that's the cool. Yeah. It does seem like technically on paper standup is supposed to be about sort of well written jokes. Yeah. But then when you think about it, sometimes confidence is one of the funniest things ever in the, in the sense that we are in a universe where everything is going to die, dissolve, be destroyed. The profession of comedian is, come on. It's like, what are you doing? Really? You're, you're hypnotized. It's a, it's a form of like, Yeah. That's a great way to put it. Like it's a form of hypnotism and it really is. And again, getting back to the trust issue, it's like the confidence is based in the fact that you trust that you're funny enough, just as is. But that's a tough thing to do for me sometimes when I'm traveling because travel takes it out of me and I've been traveling a lot. I get on fucking planes. Like I get on a, you know, a six, an eight a.m. flight at LAX and I can just be, you know, really kind of tired and stuff. And, you know, sometimes I feel shaky when I'm over tired. And it's like, I don't have that like confidence or trust in that I'm funny because I don't feel funny. You know what I mean? Right. And that's when, you know, material, like the, like the material you know works can like catapult you. Okay. Okay. Now I feel good again. You know. Yeah. You need that, you need that feeling of that initial launch pad feeling of like, okay, they like me. Now I can fully be myself. Right. It's the same thing as being an insurance adjuster. If you walk into your office and you are like, oh boy, there's no coffee. Don't it. Where are my pencils? Yeah. Damn it. That's it. You know, you're going to other people in the office and I'm sure all the insurance and just adjusters listening to this are going to be like, yeah, I wonder if people think I'm really arrogant, you know, like boy, he really thinks comedians are the be all and end all. I promise you that people, that there are a few people out there who think that you're arrogant because on the internet, there isn't at least like 5% of any people consuming media on the internet are the most poisonous cunts that I've ever seen. I've run into a few of those on the internet and it's kind of disturbing, but. Well, they're disturbing and kind of like is an individual that the troll, the classic troll, is an individual is like, it's like getting to see like a very deadly ASP at the zoo. And you're like, oh yeah, this class is separating me from this ASP and you look at it, but then when it gets sinister is when you imagine what would happen if by some accident in the universe by some catastrophe, any one of these people managed to get real power. Just so you know, then then we then we enter into you mean like Dick Cheney. Exactly. And his ilk, all the people who run the war machine. Yeah, yeah. Well, right. They did it and the media. They did it, but I'll tell you, man, in some ways, and this is a, forgive me for saying this, but in some ways I would almost rather Dick Cheney have control over a nuclear arsenal than some internet trolls who have tweeted to me because Dick Cheney. Oh, you don't think Dick Cheney started criticizing like people like Louis C.K.? Imagine if that's how like Paul Wolfowitz got started. In the early days, you look back at Wolfowitz's tweets. Right. And he was just going after Carlin in prior. Yeah. You insufferable hack. I don't know who you think you are. You're just an insufferable hack. Insufferable hack. But that's the other aspect of the internet troll is that the language choices that they make are straight out of days of our lives. They always talk like a soap opera millionaire would talk. For some reason, that's their affect. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Never in my life have I encountered such an insufferable hack. You know, you know, do you engage them? No. Because I know some comics love fucking with them, which I think is great, but I'm one of these guys. I can't engage them because, you know, I just feel the attacks too personally sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes. And I'm just like, because whenever I've engaged them, it always turns out to be a bad thing. Just like when you invite a vampire into your house. Yeah. It's the exact same concept. Yeah. You never invite a vampire into your house and you generally, unless it's like. Unless you have a lot of garlic. A lot of garlic or you're just ready to go or you've got some info on the troll that they're not aware of. Like you've gone a little bit deeper. So you know their real name, for example, or you can connect somebody to their job. Then you could like. Yeah. Yeah. Like really do it, but ultimately even that activity will only lead to more negativity in your life. Right. So I have a. The moment I get a dart from somebody, I just block or even better. That's what I do. Better than blocking. Muting. I saw somebody tweet about how the satisfaction they get from knowing that the trolls think that they're getting through and it's just going into a. Oh, how do you do that? You can just press the little gear and click mute. Oh, really? Yeah. So they think that they're like, you make me. Oh, that's nice. I didn't know about the mute thing. Yeah. So that's another way to really. So like if that's another way to torment the trolls is they. Do you get a lot of it? No, thank. Well, no, because I think I don't get a lot of it because I have a troll blocking policy, which is I immediately block them. And I think by now there's, there's very few left. Right. Right. I just immediately just. Oh, okay. Right. Oh, you wish that my, your hope is that my mother suffered the most painful death that anyone ever suffered. Oh, I'll just block you from my existence forever. It would be funny if you were one of these people and there are people like this who go, I want to thank you for your response about my mother's death. But I disagree, but thank you for your input. That's another way to fuck with them. Thank you so much for your comments. I've often felt that way about my mother as well. So I understand that you could feel this way. I like that. My one of, one of my favorite verses from the Bible, maybe it's not even a verse. I just heard it in an action movie is vengeance is mine. Sayeth the Lord. I love that because it said, you know, it means really any vengeance that you think you can inflict upon your enemies is obviously going to be such a weak vengeance compared to the vengeance that they're already, that is already being inflicted upon themselves. I always say that, you know, I always say that punishment in this world is immediate. Like in other words, if you throw out negative energy, you're already cutting yourself off from life. Yes. Right. I've done it. You know, I've attacked you online without you knowing it. You know what I mean? Like, you blocked me, but I actually make many. We find out that we're just the only trolls attacking. We both are making fake accounts and we've been attacking each other nonstop. We are the only two trolls on the internet. Like that's the twist of this whole conversation is that we are responsible for all negative YouTube comments. How amazing would that be? How amazing. We are like, we barely have time to do this podcast. Yeah. We got to get back. We're actually looking at our phones right now, putting. I got it. I got it. I got to get on Yelp and slam a Mexican restaurant. But that thing. Think of that impulse. I like to think about that impulse because you know, man, this actually reminds me of something I was thinking, which is that the so these, the object of hate, right? So you have like a Twitter critic or Yelp critic or whatever the thing is. Yeah. The object of hate is like the top of a weed, right? So if you have, what do you like to consider? Like everybody has, or most people have, not everyone, many people have probably a top three list of people that come into their mind and they think about in a negative way. Like that person's a fucking prick. People have lists of like hundreds, but I'm going to guess that a lot of people have three recurring characters in the, in their mind. Yeah. When those, when those people pop in, there's usually a negative feeling or there's like, I've noticed certain people have a person they like to bring up in conversation like, you know, blah, blah, blah. Did that again? Yeah. That thing, right? Yeah. And I know I've been that stuff. Me too. Me too. So gossipy shit. And usually there's like one sort of character, the symbol for all that. But if you follow that character down, like if you look deeper into that character, don't, don't the roots of that thing always lead to that kind of undigestible thing inside of yourself. Absolutely. Where you're identical to that person, but you can't accept the fact that you have those. Where you're identical. That's interesting. So you're basically hating yourself. Oh yeah. You're hating on yourself. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that's a good, like you're attacking a person, but the reason you're attacking them is because you embody that exact quality that you're attacking. Exactly. And you don't know it though. Yeah. You don't, well, you can't, you can't accept it. Right. You don't know it. You do kind of know it. If you just, that's why meditation is great. Right. Cause if you spend just a little bit of time sitting still, and this is another cool thing I like about this idea is that all of a sudden it turns all of these symbolic entities in your head that you'd loathe and despise into X marks the spot on the treasure map where it's like, oh, dig there, dig there. Because if you dig in those spots, it's like giving Nancy Grace a map of a forest where toddlers are buried and how happy that would make it. She would be out there every day with the cameras digging up a new toddler corpse in the same way you dig down into those X's where your enemies in your mind exist or your genesis or people you think are, are bad. And you always will find that it's like, oh, not only it's usually it's like I'm that person, but I'm angry at the person in the external world because they're less subtle than I am. You know, and here's the thing too is I heard that ego, our ego always needs something to hate and to fight. We always, our ego in order to survive our ego, which seems to run 99.9% of the planet ego instead of the real self, you know, when people listen to your podcast, I think we'll know what I'm talking about. And if they don't, I think right now they should go kill it. No, they don't. Our ego needs, needs enemies because if our ego doesn't have enemies, it's got nothing. In other words, we think we're quote unquote great or special because there are other people who aren't. We can only think we are greater special in comparison. Yes. Yeah, that's right. That's it for sure. Yeah. And that's why we attack others so we can feel good about ourselves. Yeah. Yeah. Because if we don't attack others, then we have to just sit there and go, hmm, I've got a lot of issues with things like really face the truth about another words, another words by attacking others. Here's the crux of it. By attacking others, you don't have to face the truth about yourself. Yeah, that's it. It keeps you well in, in, in, right? Yeah, I think so. And your attack on the others or your mental attack is usually most people are not overtly attacking a person. Maybe they are doing it anonymously through Twitter, through Yelp reviews or whatever, but ultimately it's like an anonymous but really the, when you consider just the neurological framework for an enemy, it means that somewhere in your brain on the molecular level is some kind of chemical pattern, which represents whoever the person is that you think did you wrong. You are literally, you know, it's like a little, in the circuitry of your mind, there is a circuit or two that your mind has sewn together or plugged in, which represent, it's a representational neurological corollary for a thing that exists in the external universe. So you are literally hating yourself in the sense that that particular reflection that's been captured chemically in your brain is a reflection in your own brain. And that, that sector of your brain that is meshed or formed the image of the thing that you hate most in the world, you are literally hating that sector of your own brain. Yeah, it's kind of, it's trippy. And I, I though have a problem with, because, you know, I do that, like I have a problem with people's success. And I look at this like when I, when I see other like comedians, other particular comedians get some big thing, I always, like I immediately think, God, like my first thought is fuck. And that's so ridiculous. Like I think their success is gone is somehow a reflection of, of me not being as successful or something like that. Like in other words, their success means fuck, there's something wrong with me, but I will hate on them and hate on the system. But where I do have a problem with stuff is when I think I really do have a reason to like hate the government, hate the military establishment, hate the Wall Street establishment that, you know, creates poverty and suffering. I'm thinking, well, that is a good thing to hate. And I don't know if, I don't know if hate is the right thing even at that level. Well, yeah. What do you think of that? And it's draining and it's negative. That's what I'm dealing with lately. Yeah. Well, I think it's exactly goes back to the same thing that you were saying before, which is that this is all distraction techniques that you're using to try to turn your eye inward to find out where the little poisonous nugget is inside of you. You know, like the inevitable tweet from an animal rights person of the inside of a seagull's stomach, inevitably at least once a month, someone will tweet. They dissected a seagull. Look what these, they're eating your trash. So inside the seagull, wedding ring, condom, hypoderminal. Can't digest these things. And so in the same way, it's like, I think the psyche is like that where there are all these things that you, that are inside of you, the desire for power, the desire for control, the desire to conquer. It would be funny if we cut open a seagull and we found the desire for power, the desire for control. Like, holy shit. Do you see what's in this seagull? No, but I have a problem though, because I am a big animal rights activist and they are abused. They are abused. Now, literally they are. So what do you do with that anger at that? Well, it's never, I mean, anger is, I've very rarely, if I've seen an angry person. Get anything done? No, it almost de-legitimizes a person when they're like raging. But anger fuels some of them. Anger is a fuel if used properly. Well, yeah, I mean. For good, if you can, if you can, you have to be an alchemist. You know, use the anger that you feel, you know, the injustice in the world to the powerless. That's my thing, like picking on the powerless. I think that that is the equivalent of fossil fuels. Anger is the psychological fossil fuels. It's incredibly powerful. It will get a lot of shit done, but ultimately it's polluting your own environment to get these things done so that... But, you know, but here's my thing and I've been asking this to a couple people, you know, like how do you stay aware in the world, like aware of what is happening, you know, like the war machine, the war on terror, you know, all the people in poverty because of the inequality of wealth. How do you stay aware and know why that is and yet not get furious at it? Man, I... Do you just not give a shit? No, so you... Yeah, and you're like, ah, fuck it, you know, it's the way... Like, that's the thing, like, I think, like for, you know, like when people say, ah, that's just what is, you know, well, doesn't that then abdicate you of, you know, all this responsibility? Here's a question for you. What's the most positive, one of the most positive things in your life right now? My dogs. I knew you were going to say that. You did? Yes. And the... And they're just unconditional love. Yeah. And think about the impact that has on you being around these beings who, they're not, you know, they're intelligent in a different way, but they're not, they don't have human level intelligence, but the healing power... Thank God. Thank God. But the healing power of that love that comes out of them unconditionally for me, like when I come home, if I'm feeling freaked out and this little poodle and my little Chihuahua meet me at the door and they're dancing. I know. They're dancing. They're dancing. That's a great way to put it. They dance when you come home. Yeah. And that feeling of poison that was inside of me, if there was one when I'm coming in, it is like lesson. It's an immediate healing force. So think of the impact that these little guys have on your subjective universe with only loving you. So in the same way, if you think of the impact you could have on the world and all these things in the world that you, that are disturbing you, if you could figure out a way to actually, honestly, not holier than thou, bullshit love, but if, but in some way, you could beam that same kind of love in the direction of all these things that are so awful, including the seagull murders or even worse. The seagull murders. The fucking assholes. Ladies and gentlemen, please do not adjust your sets. The seagull murders will be right back. Or ISIS, you know, like think of like these pictures of ISIS. They're like, I saw this awful footage of these bastards cutting the throat of this woman, the shirtless woman and draining her blood into a bowl because she was a Christian. How do you love that? Right? How do you love that? I don't know how you do. Do you? Well, I think that it has to. But genuinely not, not intellectually say, okay, I'm sending love to that, but really heart feltly being able to take that in that brutality and then transforming it. You know what I mean? What does, what does Ram Dass say about that? I know he does stuff to say about that. Well, Ram, Ram Dass' foundation is called the Love Server Member Foundation. So. Boy, is that arrogant. Go ahead. The guy, the guy trolling the Ram Dass love serve foundation. Oh, God, they do that. You know what? Hey, Ram Dass, nice. Hey, you know what I wish on you? No, I got one of those, you know, because I'm doing this. I'm doing podcast at this retreat coming up and I already got this terse tweet from somebody going. Nothing worse than a terse tweet. A TT, I call them. I got a TT. The TT was, so I can't remember. I'm sure this is going to be more than however many characters are alive, but it was as the thing was, how come some of the major universities allow people to go there for free, but the Ram Dass retreats charge money for people to come if they want to go to the retreat. Oh, the money angle. Yeah. The response to this is name the university that's giving away free Hawaiian vacations, because that's what this is. It's a Hawaiian vacation. And if you can find a place where you're getting that for free or that weird idea that. How much is it, by the way? $70,000. I think it's a bit much. And I would send a terse tweet. Can you put a price on awakening? I'd like to, here's the commercial for that. Have you been awakened this month? Come on down. Come on down and get awakened here and away. $70,000 and you're done. You're done. You're enlightened. All your baggage is gone. You're hating people no more. You ain't hating anybody no more. Come on down. We're up at $24.7. Yeah. But the idea is love everyone. So, so hard. Love everyone. Tell the truth. Love everyone and tell the truth. That's what Neem Karoli Baba said to Ram Dass. Ram Dass. His guru? His guru, Neem Karoli Baba. There's a great story because Alpert Ram Dass was a really angry guy. In India, he was like around all these people who had been drawn into the gravity of this Neem Karoli Baba. He just sensed all their bullshit, all their ego. Yeah. He didn't like them. He started hating them and he freaked out and like, I think he like threw something or he just had this fit because basically a guru, you know, everyone thinks that a guru is someone where you get around them and it's like, I think that, well, they either think a guru is someone you get around and they end up like having sex with your wife and destroying your life. Right. Which is not a true guru. That's not a true guru. Unless he's really satisfying your wife. $70,000. Then you got to tip your hat to him. Thank you. So the theory behind the thing and I have never been around, you know, I've never been around a true, like being like Neem Karoli Baba. I only know about them from stories, but the idea is that they are, because they understand them, they've gone through the work, countless incarnations, understand themselves all the way through, have forgiven themselves all the way through. They're capable of understanding you all the way through, seeing the nuggets of indigestible psychic shit floating around in the lower levels of your ecosystem and recognizing those things and seeing them not as a reason to hate you, but as actually something that they can convert and heal by emanating this love. Now I'm adding all this mind shit to them. What people say about this guy is that when you got around him, it was just like being around a nuclear blast of love and it was just you around him and you just are all that shit inside of you that you've hated yourself for. He seems to be able to see it. He loves it. He loves you. And something about that creates this healing because if this guy loves you, you're going to start loving yourself too. And then from loving yourself, that's when you're able to start loving everybody else because you can't do it until you love yourself. If you don't love yourself and you're down on yourself and you hate yourself and you loathe things about you, then all that's going to happen is everyone around you is going to, you're going to hate them too. How could you not? It's like having a water filter with shit inside of it. Your water is always going to taste like shit. So that's the, so yeah, I think you can do it, but it, you know, I don't know. There's a lot of, you know, people talk about this all the time, which is like, when do you fight? When do you pick up the gun? When do you kill? When is there war? When is it okay to go to war? When do you, when, how do you, can you love and kill the Bhagavad Gita set on a battlefield? Yeah. You know, like is it? And the real wisdom is, I think the real wisdom is there really isn't a time like no fight, don't fight. Like I love the word surrender. I love that. What, like sometimes when I'm just flipping out, no, I'm just, and, and I flip out a lot, meaning I just have so many fucking thoughts. Like it's just, look at this. What the fuck? Hey, there's a hummingbird. That's beautiful. Hummingbirds are really, really fucking beautiful. What the fuck is over here? Why is this fucking, why is this fucking fence? It's just, it's just the most minute. It's just the most trivial shit. Why is this fence like who the fuck left the fence like this in the middle of the fucking road? You know, like I just go and then, and then from there I'm like, boy, I had a good tweet a couple of minutes ago. You know, like, yeah, on and on and on. And then I think of one word surrender. And that sometimes word, like sometimes attached to a word is a healing vibe. Love, love, love, it doesn't have the same, it doesn't have the thing I need right now. I think different words, you know, certain words too, in certain times of your life. But right now for me, it's surrender. Like, I just want to surrender, you know, to everything because I've been fighting everything for, for so long. Greatest quote I ever heard at one of these Ram Dass retreats is from Sarah Swaddy Marcus, who teaches the yoga classes there. The bridge between suffering and grace is surrender. Isn't that cool? The bridge between suffering and grace is surrender. Yeah. Cause, you know, grace, of course, being that place where the synchronicities are happening, the birds are singing, suddenly you're back in the Garden of Eden and suffering being the essential state of human, the human condition. And then the moment you release, you do just give up the fight. Like you just give up, you give up the big battling, the big wrestling match that you're having with. It's tough because, you know, a guy like me, I grew up in an unsafe environment and I've carried that with me. So I always feel like I have to be on guard, protecting, you know, my family. You know what I mean? Yeah. And it's the opposite, I think. You should be alert, but you don't have to be like, who is that? Oh, hi Al. It's always like that too. I'm always like, oh, what do you want? What? Oh, thank you very much. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, totally. You're being, it's like on one level, because all these things are happening at once. So like on one level, you're being devoured by the universe. And we are going to die. You're actively dying right now. All right, take it easy. No, trust me. Are you done with your tea? Trust me. Did you finish the tea? Trust me. You drank that tea. You're dying. You ever hear the course in miracles? Yeah. Where they say nothing real ever dies. And you, meaning your ego, was never born. Yeah. It's all just, it's all just life. That's grace. That's grace. That's grace. And that's where you want to get. And you are there right now. Because the focus, it happens to generally land on the... Can I just say this? Please buy my new album? No. No, because that's the trip, you know, that the ego gets in. It's like, yeah, you know what keeps you from grace is like, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. I got this going on. Even the quote unquote, good shit is a total trap. I got this going on. I got this going on. I got this. I'm doing this. I am this. I am this. And they just tell you to say, I am. Not I am this or that. Do you do course in miracles work a lot? No. No. But when I'm all spun out and I'm on the computer and I'm having to do shit, I'll like Google in course in miracles. And yesterday I just looked at it and their basic message is to realize that your thoughts are just total bullshit. All of them. All of them. Yeah. You know, just all of your fucking, you know, all thinking, you know, I need to say, you know, obviously you have to think to get things. You have to like have practical thinking. But when you start getting it wrapping it up and, you know, ego and stuff and the way we see that they deal with a lot of course in miracles, like our perceptions are completely prejudiced. Like we never see the tree for what it really is. We see what we think is a tree because we have a preconception of a tree, you know, that's how they work. It's a little, it's a little, it's a, they kind of try to retrain your mind to let go of all preconceptions and just be here now. How often do you hit places like that in your life? I try to do it at least a couple times a week, three times a week, four times a week, five times a week, six times a week, seven times a week, no, every day I have to do something spiritual. My friend, Eddie, another friend of mine is like, you know what, people like us, meaning really tightly wound people. He said, if we don't fucking do spiritual shit every day, we're fucked. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, when you're tightly wound, man, you gotta combat that shit. Well, it's like, you know, when people say you go off your meds, it's like go off your meditation. Same. That's great, by the way. Same. I'm off my meds, meaning meditation. I'm not meditating and whatever that means for you, but if you're not taking a little bit of time each day, but this is like, you know, I think this is one of the, this is a cool thing. One of the things I love about the teachings Ram Dass gives us is this very gentle thing where he says, listen, if you're off your meds, if you're not meditating, if you're not being spiritual, if you're not doing whatever, just watch that too, study that pattern. Don't judge it. That's another thing. There's three things they say not to do every day. Do not judge, do not attach and do not resist. If you could do one of those three things for a minute each day, like don't attach to anything, meaning, okay, just as a stupid mundane example, but what I do, like if you tweet something, don't expect people to love you and say, how great this tweet, just tweet it and don't attach to it. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be funny using Twitter as a complete metaphor for spirituality. He would have, Buddha would have done that for sure because he, and I, and that is a really beautiful thing about Buddhism is that it all gets used, like anything in the external universe could totally be used. Buddha definitely would have tweeted and he definitely would have some kind of pride. There would be the scripture of the tweets or there'd be the tweeting. Yeah. Well, you know, tweeting, you know, tweeting, it's all just that there's a Leviathan of technology right now. I mean, just technology and the particularly specifically digital internet age that we live in is all consumed. It's a huge thing to deal with. It's consuming people. I mean, there's been studies about how it's rewiring the brand. I mean, it's consuming people. You know, it's, I mean, talk about the ego, talk about instant gratification. See, that's an enemy too. And I'm really, really susceptible to that. Like, like I love instant gratification, like I just want to be pleasure. And pleasure is a trap. Yeah. I mean, you don't want pain, right? So pleasure and pain are two sides of the same coin. You've heard that, right? It's like, so if I constantly want pleasure, which is my fucking Achilles heel, and I guess a lot of people's, but I want pleasure. You know, I want to go on now. I want to go online. I want to look at porn. And then I want to buy things online, and then I want to, you know, look at how great I am online. And you know what I mean? Like that's a fucking trap, man, because you're, you know, I don't know, the, the enlightenment, the stillness, the grace. Grace is not pleasure. What is it? Go fuck yourself. I don't know. You tell me. It's your podcast. The hell is this? I don't know. Grace is not pleasure. Grace is, um, what is it, grace? Grace is, is just being absolutely fine with what is instead of being like, see, pleasure, and I get overstimulated. Like, you know what I mean? I think, I think, I think the digital age and all this computer stuff and everything on our fingertips, it overstimulates us and ultimately makes us fucking miserable and drains us. Yeah. It gets you out of your head for sure. It's, it gets you out of your heart, into your head. It's all mental. It's all, it's in the, it's always in, when you're online, you're generally always in your head. I think so. Yeah. But this, you know, I really love this, um, practice of mindfulness because what it, what it, the idea is, uh, even when you're in your head, you know, there's all these great like, I can't remember the scripture. It's in this Joe, I'm reading this great book, Mindfulness by Joseph Goldstein. I've been reading it forever. It's amazing. I know that book. It's great. Is that a great one? It's great. But it, it's, uh, sort of commentary on the scripture that the idea of mindfulness emerged from, or one of the, I'm sure it emerged from a lot of scriptures. What particularly mindfulness basically just means being, uh, being the witness to what you're thinking. Right. And that's always difficult for me too. That is a very difficult thing. And it's a basic tenet of mindfulness, but it's always so hard for me to step back from my thoughts because I believe I am my thoughts. Well, you, you, so it's, it's a kind, there's a aspect to it called noting where instead of trying to step back from your thoughts, um, which is another trap, you're, Oh really? This is my, you're, you're, you're enlightening me now because that's what I do because then think about that. When you're stepping back from your thoughts, it's like a, you're running away from yourself and there's the implicit judgment that I'm, this part of me must be malfunctioning. Okay. So tell me what's to be done. Okay. So God, I'm glad I came here and penetrate your bro. There's different states of mind uses kind of noting. And so you would think like, so when you're, when you have an impenetrable, impenetrable mind, when you're in a state of this is not going to get better, I feel so awful and shitty today. It's not getting better. The, the, the definition of depression is what that is. Impenetrable, impenetrable. So you would think an absolutes like I'm stuck for good here. So then you would think, Oh, I'm stuck and that's it. And then, and then when you're not stuck and you're in a flowing, open, graceful mind, you go, Oh graceful mind. And then when you're sitting and meditating, when I, when I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out. I'm breathing out. So it's just a very basic sort of not trying to change the state. If you're, if your mind's going crazy and you're up in your head and it's all going nuts, it's not step back. It's just be aware of like, Oh, mind going crazy. When my note it, note it, it's called noting. And when the mind isn't going crazy, you think, Oh, mind not going crazy. And even those labels are considered to be an intermediary state to get you to this place of, which now is theoretical for me, but it's the idea is universe perfect. We exist in a perfect universe, non malfunctioning universe. I am part of the universe. Therefore, if the universe is perfect, then I am perfect and I'm not perfect because of what I'm going to be after a million lifetimes of meditating. I'm perfect because of where I am right now. And every single thought that I'm having or the proliferation of thoughts is also a part of a perfect universe. And the surrender would be not trying to change those things, but just being like, Ah, this is what's happening. Ah, look at it go. Look at the thoughts go. Here we go again. Here it comes. And then somehow from that, just awareness of the thing, it does begin to shift. I think that's the, you know, don't judge, don't resist, don't attach. I think that's don't resist. Don't resist what's going on in your head and don't judge it, you know, don't treat it the way that your parents treated you when you were being bad because that's what you do to the thoughts is you're just like, you look at you, you look, whatever it is that you're, you digested. Yeah. Because meditation, I think, like I, I have an on again, off again thing when, when people ask me if I'm meditating, I just do like the Facebook relationship thing. I say it's complicated. Yeah. And I have a complicated relationship with meditation because I think I judge it too much like you just nailed it with, it's like my parent, like being a parent, a disapproving parent, you're sitting there, you're breathing. And I swear to God, this is probably why I don't meditate because when I'm sitting there and just breathing, I'm going, you stupid fuck, look at this shit. You know when it's painful and, and hard. You know what? I, and forgive me for saying this. Those of you guys out there who are into Chogyam, Trumpa, but I think Chogyam, Trumpa, who is this Tibetan apart. Yeah, I know Trump, but he would say when you said that, I think he would be like, you are, you, this is for you because that honest assessment of your mind state when you're sitting down is exactly what he said is the beginning of a practice. And he said that when you first start meditating, if you don't see, he doesn't say if you don't, but it's like, it's ridiculous. What you're doing is ridiculous. You're going to feel fraudulent. It's going to feel completely nuts. And all of those things are exactly what should be happening. And when you realize that, that there's no right way to meditate, but the thing that's just, you're sitting, you're, as Jack Cornfield says, you're taking your seat at the center of the world, at the center of the universe, and you're just letting what comes come. And you're letting what goes go. And, and you're becoming aware of the way that everything that arises also dissipates. It's just cool. You're watching. Are you saying Trump is, is saying something different than Cornfield? I think, well, I think that Trump, I think they have different teaching styles. I think they're both saying the same thing, but in different ways of getting to it. I think so too. Yeah. Trump is very fierce. Trump's style is fierce. He's very. Hmm. Is he the one who wrote Spiritual Warrior? I think, yes, he is. And he wrote Meditation and Action, which I like, I've got a bunch of lectures by him. And I get really mad at him sometimes because of his ferocity when it comes to, when it comes to a practice, because in, in, and I actually, I talked about Cornfield, I did a podcast from the retreat in Maui and talked to Cornfield about that very thing. What do you say? I'm sorry if I misquote him, but it's, he said, hmm, Trumpa can be a bomber sometimes, huh? That's all. It's just like a downer. He's like, Trumpa can be a downer sometimes. Yeah. And, and, you know, he was like, you know, here's Cornfield, this glowing, focused, sweet person. And here you are in Maui, you know, enjoying the beauty of this retreat. And I've been reading this Trumpa stuff and he's saying like, no matter what, wherever you think you've landed, like the awakening state, whenever you get to a place where you're like, ah, this is it. Or if you're experiencing this kind of like this ineffable joy state, you're just tricking yourself. That's not it. That's not it. That's just another delusion that you're allowing yourself to have to escape from the essence of what the, the, the problem is, which is that you're nothing, you're nothing and you're trying to escape from the nothingness. My favorite, my favorite example being like, it's, this stuff gets so crazy sometimes. It gets crazy, but he compares it to somebody standing on a floor made of razor blades and it's so painful that to escape this experience, you fabricate an illusion, which is whatever your ego, identity, life is, you climb into that thing and you make it your home and you live in this kind of delusional thing. And so he says it's like, you know, a lot of people, they actually deify, they deify their confusion by saying, it's so great that it's beyond words. It's so great that I can't possibly understand it. It's so great that there's no way to describe it. And he's like, that is insanity. What you were saying is that you're worshiping your own insanity. Your inability to label a thing does not make the thing suddenly glorious. It just means that you are, um, right. But you know, again, he's very, he's very fierce when it comes to that. And, um, I think that his disciple, Pima Chodron, is a better at dispensing. No, yeah. Yeah. I've listened to her. I've listened to her. I go in and out of, uh, digging her stuff. Like, uh, well, first of all, it's so funny. I don't know if you've ever heard this, but some meditators, I think, try to be funny. It's almost like Rachel Maddow doing the news. If you ever watched her, like she thinks she's funny for some reason. She tries to kind of like, she, she tries to do it. Like, yeah, it's like, what are you doing? You know, you're not funny. Just, you know, I like your politics, you know, you don't have to be funny. And whoever told you you were funny is wrong. And sometimes when I'm listening to Pima Chodron, she's also like, she's getting, it's just so funny as a comedian listening to these live lectures and when she's in front of people and, and you know, joking about the pesky ego and everybody's laughing. I'm like, Oh God, this is so not. You're talking about, yeah. Fuck. There was a name our friends came up with for that, which is the kind of like, yeah, spiritual comedy. It's just too precious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sometimes, do you know what I mean? Like, oh boy. Yeah, yeah. It's like, come on, you're not, you know, you know what makes it okay, man? Is that when you listen to it on a tape and you're a comedian, you're going to recognize the shitty jokes just because that's your job, right? Your job is to come out. You've been doing it your whole life. Yeah, yeah. But when you see it in person, the thing about it is, man, these people, they are blasting out this energy that comes from a lifetime of practice. Skeptics, roll your eyes all you want. I'm telling you, when you get around these people, they're putting something out there. That's beautiful. It's beautiful. And so, suddenly, the bad jokes, you just get immediately forgiven in the same way you'd forgive them. Yeah, I hear you. No, you're right. You're absolutely right. I'm being kind of catty as a comic. But you can be, though. That's the whole thing. Be fucking catty. The other beautiful thing about these people is that my experience with them thus far is that I have yet to be able to really offend them. And if I do, and the times where it seems like maybe something like that has happened, it always is followed by this laugh, this wonderful, honest laugh where they're just like, whatever. My only thing is, you know, like Pema Shodran, she gives these talks from a place, a beautiful place called Plum Village, right? That's Tick-Not Han. Tick-Not Han, but Pema Shodran is there as well. Oh, is she there? I didn't know she hung out there. Forgive me. And my thing is that I think it's far easier to be quote-unquote in a state of grace in a place like Plum Village than it is to be in Los Angeles. Like when I leave this, this taping session, I have to get in a car and get on the five and, you know. Have you ever done a float tank? No, I'm scared to do a float tank. Why? I'm scared to do a float tank. Why? Well, I have claustrophobia. Right. Well, and I feel like I would lose. This is funny. I feel like I would lose my mind. See, here's the thing. Think of a float tank. If there's ever a place, I can't think of a place much safer than a float tank. Really? You're in a few inches of water, laying on your back. You're in incredibly buoyant water, heated to body temperature. Why does that panic me? Well, because what's happening is you're separate. You're removing all the external universe and witnessing completely your internal state of turmoil without anything to blame it on. You're just in a, you're just like, wow. And so the idea that at Plum Village are a place that's actually stripping away the distraction mechanism, somehow that's going to make you more peaceful. I think that's not necessarily, I think it's going to make you freak out even more because instead of having the thing to escape into now, there's really no way to avoid it. You know, that's a good fucking point. Yeah. It's, yeah, you freak the fuck out of these things, man. Like the first few retreats, Ramdas retreats I went to, which are really apparently compared to other retreats like Vipassana and all those 10 day hardcore meditation retreats. Bootcamp. I, but these Ramdas retreats are the first couple, man. I was on my phone constantly. Were you, you couldn't deal with it. Looking in there every time you couldn't deal with the silence. Couldn't deal with the love. Oh, the love. Fuck. Love is hard to set. Yeah. That's a good point. In my head, these, these flotation tanks, I always just feel like, I don't know what the fuck it is with me and in closed spaces, you know? Well, it's, you know, it's, I think all of us have very turbulent states. And it's funny with the thing you're saying, like, ah, because my mind does the same thing, fucking whoever it is in their goddamn spirituals teaching. Yeah. You know what? Put me on a fucking cloud, floating me in space and you with a, with a mute fucking, give me a, give me, put me in a nice temple with some incense burning and gongs everywhere. And I'm going to be spiritual too. But it's really, it's like, okay, let's put you there. And then let's see what happens because if you put me in a fucking temple with gongs and incense, let's start a timer and I'll stop at the first time I find internet porn and jerk off. And I bet that timer is going to be like, what, six hours? You know, I know. That's the thing, man. Is that habitual? What? That we do that? Is it, is it? It's just another form of escape. It's all, it's all, you know, trying to like, it's. What are we so afraid of facing? I, you know, man, uh, I think that, uh, it's probably different for, for everybody, you know, I, I, I think it's, I think what, I think I know what mine is that I'm insignificant. I think I want to be very significant. I don't know if that sounds weird, but I think that I want to be like fame, chasing fame, you know, I think that I need to feel like I'm making some kind of big impact on the world or I don't exist. But why do you want to, what, maybe you're, maybe you think that you have to earn love? I think so. I think, yes, I think that's even more to the crux of it, uh, to the heart of it is that I feel like just doing nothing and just being, that doesn't, I have not, you know, why do I deserve anything? Like, like, I don't, I think that's really it. Like, I don't deserve, you know, love. That's it. Yeah. You're going to earn, you want it. So it's like, you got it, you have created, as I have and most people I know have, have created a series of impossible acrobatic feats that you must do before you deserve love. It'd be funny if right after this podcast, I completely drop out of comedy and like just, you know, just, I just go on a, you know, I just, I'm like, fuck it, fuck it all. No, because I realized that the only reason I want to be a comedian is to prop up this, this thing that I think I need instead of just feeling like, in other words, and, and I've heard this talked about before, if I, if I felt truly worthwhile, truly worthwhile and truly loved, if I felt truly loved, why the fuck would I be getting in front of all these people trying to make them laugh all the time? Yeah. Well, yeah, it's, it's, I think that the, the, the, the, uh, what would happen is if you accepted that the entire universe that you are significant, in fact, and that you're so significant that there is an entire universe of love around you, just dying for you to put down your, uh, the various force fields you've been putting up. Keep it from loving you just, just, yeah, like your mom, like your dad, like all your ancestors, like your dearest friend. No, did you just attack my mother? Yeah. Mom is horrible. That's one of the things Ramdas told him. It's weird cause Ramdas never tells me specifically to say things, but he was like, if you see Eddie Pepiton, tell him his mom's an asshole, would you? I guess, I guess he knew it. Boy, that's his one thing. He trolls my mother all the time, but, uh, but, but the, the, the, the thing that you realize is that the big wrestling match here is a wrestling match with, with, with love, like you are the winning this wrestling match means existing in a, in an emaciated state of not getting the love you need. That's winning the wrestling match. That's winning. That's winning. So winning the wrestling match means that you don't get love surrendering means that this entire universe, apparently this entire universe, it's like a person who seeks love through success is like a person who drinks water from a well, who goes up this long mountain where there's a well at the top with brackish water that they can drink from when at the bottom of the mountain is just a lake filled with the sweetest, sweetest water. And if they wanted to, they could sip it and drink it and swim in it and do whatever they want it. That's what we do because God damn it. It fucking feels creepy to be completely loved because we don't love ourselves and that weird little obstruction, that's the little, isn't that the, that's the error in the lens or that's the, the thing in the lens that's fucking us up. So, uh, I don't know, man, that's my wrestling matches. I can't accept. I think you nailed it, man. And, and, and I get that. Here's the interesting thing about that too, is that I've had that insight before and, and like all the, the major insights I get, even though I am getting better, I can't hold on to it. Like I realized that's the practice I need to practice. Ultimately the practice is self, you know, loving myself and not in a really corny way, but just like being okay with who I am and that I. You know, I am okay, I'm enough, I'm enough and I don't have to do, like you put it, these unbelievable acrobatic things every day to feel like, well that, I've earned my existence. Think if your poor dogs had to do that. Like if before you pet your dogs, if what you taught, if like your attitude to your dogs, some people do that to them, like beg, do this, roll over, like, yeah, you know, well, yeah, imagine that though, if that's how you like, if with my, my dog, uh, will shit on the floor and piss on the floor sometimes and I'll clean it up and I get, yeah, he's good. Trained him to do it. Actually, whenever you come over, Eddie, I've been. Ram Dass, that was his other thing. Train your dogs to shit when he arrives. Yeah, he did say that so weird, Eddie. I don't know how you know him, but, but, but, but, uh, the, uh, the. Imagine if you had to do this with your dogs, you were saying, you, you do that to yourself. It's unreal, dude. You an animal rights person. You a person who loves animals. You a person who, uh, you get so anger and people abuse animals. You being an animal because you're a human being, you treat yourself in a way that you wouldn't even treat your dogs. Unbelievable. What is that? Well, I think too, like in my head, the external world, meaning, you know, the people in it always need stuff from me and that I'm not delivering or something like that in my head. Yeah. Cause you know what I mean? Yeah. Cause you're not giving it to yourself. And that, you know, the moment that you like hit, hit that, uh, the moment you see that thing inside yourself that's so awful, whatever the thing is, which really is an awful at all, but the moment you see it, you get to start working with it, right? So the moment you see it. First you've got to see it. And then when you see it, it's like, Oh, okay. Now I'm going to try, even though it's ridiculous and I don't feel it. And it's an absurd attempt to love that thing. It's, it's, you'll realize that the impossibility of loving whatever you think the greatest enemy is in the world, it's an equal impossibility to loving yourself. You'll find that is the identical, right? It's the same thing. I can't do it. Yeah. Not only can I not love ISIS, I can't let the part of myself that has no integrity and is, is, is lazy. You know, like, you know what I mean? Like that thing, but if you can work with it and start figuring and, and, and just practice. Treat, what is working with it? Mean the same thing as when you bring a rescue dog home. So it's like, when you bring a rescue dog home, that poor little guy, he's been fucking kicked around his whole life. He's been like, you know, dislocated and fucked with and not enough food and emaciated and guaranteed that nugget in yourself that you hate so much. It came from the same goddamn thing. You know what's amazing? Here's the amazing thing about all this is that it's us who has to heal. Like we have to heal ourselves. And there's a little bit of a catch 22 there because the reason why we're fucked up is because of who we are or who we, who we've been conditioned. Conditioned is the better word who we've been conditioned to be. And we've got to unravel that somehow and start like being a good parent to ourselves. Yeah. Just be, just treat it like a rescue dog, man. It's like you were able to be loving to your rescue dogs. You know, I, you were able to love that little, little guy or girl. And I guarantee that that sweetie was not like a bundle of joy when you first took them home. So sometimes they are, but sometimes they shit places. They bark, they freak out. Oh yeah. But if you just love them, you love them unconditionally. So it's the same thing. These parts of yourself, man, they're rescue animals. No, you know, that it's an amazing thing. I don't know if you've been aware, but like a lot of guys who come back from war with PTSD, the post traumatic stuff, there's been this big stuff where dogs heal them, rescue dogs, heal them. And, you know, the dogs in general, you know, because of that unconditional love, unconditional love, man, it is the ultimate. It's like a light there. It's, it's, it is the ultimate power. It is, it's the, it's the sun. It's, it's a, it's like a kind of sunlight that when it shines on things, it doesn't just, it brings, what does the sun do? It brings things that are dormant back to life. That's what love does. It brings all these dormant things in it. But it's not, you know, it love is like a word like God. It, it has people just hear it and they turn off, man. Yeah. Oh love, right, right, right. You know what I mean? But it's deep. It's a deep, deep word. Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a, yeah, you're fucking right though, man. That word is just like chewed gum. It's like, it's like peeling the chewed gum off. Chewed gum is a good way to put it. It's like. Six flags pole, eating it. But it, but, you know, it's a fun thing to experiment with even in a little, in a, in small ways throughout the day, which is this when you, that's like this mantra Ramdas teaches is I am loving awareness. That's something he recommends chanting when you're in line at the grocery store, when you're waiting. Yeah. Instead of going for your phone, start thinking in your head. I am loving awareness. I am loving awareness. I'm loving awareness of the concept. Sir, I'm asking for your Ralph's card. I'm loving. Yeah. Can you hurry up? You're like so into it. Like you're just beaming at everybody and they're like, come on buddy. And you're like, oh God, do I love you guys? Oh boy, here comes another love person. They're so slow and they're so, they're so slow. Eddie, you got to tell me about the, your new comedy album. Well, my, my new one, and, and this is all leading to this. What we just talked about. My new album is called in ruins. That's true. And it's available on iTunes and people should get it. And that's it in ruins. It was a Netflix special. It's now gone to iTunes.

And I still remember that, but I'm not going to give the bit away. I don't know. Do you still see the bit about the, I won't give away the punchline, but about the, the, the Make-A-Wish kid who does, I haven't done that in a long time. I'll never, that's one of comedy that I, you know, like how some comics have bits that you just, is that the main kid who's like, okay, that's the punchline. The punchline is this kid. Eddie does this great. Make-A-Wish kid. He's getting to do stand-up comedy, but he's actually an insult comic. His, his final wish is to do stand-up. And he just is like, um, hi folks, everything hurts. Everything hurts, especially your face, sir. You know, like he's a Don Rickles. Don Rickles, Make-A-Wish kid. But Eddie, uh, yeah, I hope people, you guys have got to get his album. And then what's your website? Uh, eddiepepitone.com is my website. And, uh, my Twitter is at eddiepepitone.

229^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 555: RamDev Dale Borglum Transcript and Discussion^2023-03-12^Greetings friends, it's me Duncan and this is the Dunkin Trussell family hour podcast. Good morning to you Well, if you're listening to this in the morning, I'm recording it on a Saturday morning. Here's something exciting I am attempting to shift the DTFH to video mode I know I've been saying this on and off for the last many years But it's actually happening and so I would love it if you would subscribe to my YouTube You can find it by searching Dunkin Trussell on YouTube I'm gonna start doing video intros. I actually tried to do one today But ran into some technical difficulties you video streamers make it seem so easy Don't you so easy to set up multiple cameras multiple angles perfect audio, but it's not It's really hard, but I'm gonna do it. So go to my YouTube. Won't you also? If you want commercial-free episodes of this go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe you'll get commercial-free episodes And hopefully you can get access to our discord servers for those of you who are having trouble getting into the discord It appears not positive about this, but it appears that our entire Discord server has been reset because one of you Cretans out there posted some horrible image or something I don't know. I send an appeal to discord. I'm trying to figure out what's happening But stay tuned for that normally when you subscribe to the patreon you get access to discord But until we work out whatever horrific thing someone posted apparently it's gore. That's what I got in my email We won't be able to get the discord running and I won't be able to get to that until Monday so Hang tight we will restore our homeland Today we have a wonderful guest Recurring guest Rom Dev. I love him so much. He's really tight with Rom Doss He actually got to hang out with Neem Karoli Baba and Rom Doss in India and he's got so many cool stories that if you're somebody who has Tuned in to the Rom Doss wavelength you may never have heard before and some of them Are here today you like Rom Dev check out the Living Dying project go see him He has a retreat coming up which we talk about in this episode and come see me I'm gonna be at wise guys in Las Vegas next week. It's March 11th right now. So that's gonna be March 18 17th and 16th in Vegas you can find tickets at Dunkin Trussell dot com And now everybody welcome back to the DTFH Rom Dev Welcome back to the DTFH how goes it? And so glad to be with you Duncan always a pleasure You know, I here's my question for you that popped into my head You're a long-time friend of Rom Doss in that community One thing that's always been interesting to me is Rom Doss's connection with a manual the channeled entity and I want I wondered if you had any thoughts at all about that relationship What was it and what are your thoughts on channeling? okay, well for those of you guys who don't know a manual was a disembodied spirit and When we were back in New York Rom Doss and me at a whole bunch of the Maharajie people ended up in New York Studying with a woman named Joya Who that's a whole other story that we maybe can get into some time. It was very dramatic She ended up being a wonderful meditation teacher, but sort of needed to feel she was the highest human being highest female being in form It was a cult right and Anyway, we were back there and Rom Doss met a woman in Pat Rodegas to channel the manual And Rom Doss had this line that just because you don't have a body doesn't mean You can't be wise or smart or something like that. I don't know So I actually went to a reading with Pat Rodegas the manual talked to me He said I was gonna fall in love and get married at a certain time. It didn't happen He told me a bunch of other things that didn't happen But he seemed to have some kind of good generic spiritual wisdom that Anybody could have gotten out of a book. So I was a little bit spec. I was a little bit skeptical and but Rom Doss knew the woman who was channeling Pat who was a very good friend of another friend of Rom Doss's and I Don't know really what to say. I mean to me it just felt like a little weird I have to admit but You know at the same time we were around Maraji and all kinds of completely crazy things happen, right? The the the main book Rom Doss put together about Maraji was called Miracle of Love and What what the title kind of is implying that Maraji could do all these miracles? He could know the past he could know the future seemed like he could be in two places at the same time But the real milk the real miracle is how much he loved that that put all the other miracles to shame, right? Right, and I didn't feel that from a manual he had some wisdom, but it didn't seem like a big deal to me and So I mean even the things that Maraji did that or a manual that could seem like Miraculous or out of the ordinary if you really start looking at quantum mechanics these days They're kind of showing. I mean some guys just got the Nobel Prize for Quantum entanglement that shows that basically there's only one thing the universe one song. There's just one sub-act it's all one and So that if you're living at that state of non duality This idea of time and past and present and future and here and there and all that stuff It doesn't make any sense anymore because you're everywhere and everything so From that perspective There are people like maybe you could say they're tuning into Jung's collective unconscious that it's not a miracle that Everything's out there all the information that's happens gonna happen Parallel universes. I mean who knows right? Yeah, so Do you so is Pat still around? Is what's up, I don't know I have no idea. I mean I kind of doubt it. She seemed to be about maybe Ram Dass's age, but You know he he would be like about 90 years old now probably no he'd be older than that He'd be like about 94 a few were alive. I think you know because he was he was 11 years older than me So he'd be he'd be 91. I don't know my numbers are all crazy here. I've got a PhD in math But I can't do arithmetic. What do you know about that? Yeah, I understand I get that I'm the same way except mine is the PhD in math the okay, so So I'm interested For a few different reasons One being you know you you all were sort of in the nucleus of what later became known as the New Age movement and Channeling was such a big part of That culture. I mean you had Rampha you had Emanuel you had a myriad other of these People who claimed to be able to become host to these entities. My mother was so into Ramda and a Ramtha rather she left Ramdas to Ramtha very into Ramtha I went to see Ramtha channel at in Asheville, North Carolina And I did feel something but then you know, maybe I'm a sucker. I don't know but I did feel like a palatable energy shift I felt a Presence I Also had a very skeptical mind Wanted to believe it's true and I had a channeler on my show live once now This was one of the one of my bigger podcast mistakes because by that time I got very cynical very skeptical And the friend who suggested this channeler I he was connected with all these spiritual people in New York and Wasn't the sort of person who would just like to give you something that was bullshit, but the channeler comes to the show It's live podcast we're doing and he just seems real normal. And so I'm thinking to myself. Well, this is gonna be a bust I saw tickets for this. I feel like an asshole He starts channeling this entity and people in the front row They just start crying. It was and it was like sitting next to like Too much energy it was you it was hard to stay still it was like whatever was coming out of him was like waving out rippling out into the room and He the way he he does Some channelers are possessed. I guess that's pretty nicer word for them possessed But they the being comes out of them. He does Audio clear I can't remember the specific name where he the thing comes out of him. He hears it and repeats it So this thing machine gun Way too fast so fast it's spitting out these brilliant sentences, but It's like a it's it's obviously it's English, but it's like Moore's code or something So those are two weird experiences I've had with it and both to me confirm that this phenomena Whatever it may be I get why people are drawn into it So it's interesting to hear that a manual to you Which is kind of felt like somebody picked up some new age books and was regurgitating some of that stuff Well, I'm not saying that exactly maybe it sounded like that and if I did I apologize I guess what I'm saying is like for instance, I just saw a zoom workshop over the weekend and somebody wrote to me and said I really loved your stream of consciousness the way it was structured and Yeah, so I mean like what I try to do like right now when I'm with you or all the time is get as open as I can get I'm gonna have this embodied mindfulness I try to open my heart and then just like let my mouth start flapping around and Is is is Dale Romdev doing it or his is Maharajee spoke is speaking through me or I don't know and it might just be that Pat Wrote a gas than the person on your show was a very high being who could go into some altered state where the wisdom of the universe flows through and They happen to call it romp or Immanuel or maybe they're doing that for marketing reasons or whatever But I mean, what was Maharajee channeling like what are you channeling right now? I mean, it's all kind of levels of channeling. You're a step at me. That's what I was trying to get to you leapfrog Me that's what I'm trying to get to that's what I wanted to get to that's let me give you a quote Okay, you're a quote that I just read in a book by my friend Andy Lamont yesterday. She's the best God is the worst nickname ever Okay It's like what you it's when you're vomiting it's like there has to be a better thing than just starting with that G It's not hard. Yeah So but what I'm saying is that we're all channeling God Right, I mean, whether you call it Jesus or Immanuel or Rampha or Maharajee or Duncan's Deeper voice or whatever it is. I mean, it's like I mean basically spiritual practice is about Disidentifying with ego structure and identifying with true nature and just letting that flow through you unimpeded, right? Right, so that maybe some of these channelers were people that had a certain ability Maybe they're not enlightened But they had this one ability at least to really get out of the way and tune into the wisdom That's always floating around. I mean like if you think about it right now The worst rap music on the worst radio station in your neighborhood is going through your body, right? It's I mean, it's all there all all those radio waves Yeah, right all the if all the information is available in some way, right? So these these channels are able to tune into that you're able to tune into it sometimes to a certain degree I am well, no, I mean, I know that this is exactly I'm cured This is like that. This is what I'm very curious about is, you know If you if you do with the slightest self-reflection in the midst of talking and try to tune in where the words coming from well if I Had to spend any amount of time Contemplating the next word out of my mouth then I would stutter. I wouldn't be capable of maintaining any kind of conversation at all and Somewhere in there it feels like the bottom drops out that you you we so want to lay claim To what we say, you know, it came out of my mouth It must be me But when you analyze the situation of just speaking at all You're not really spending too well if you're me you're definitely not spending much time Thinking about what you're about to say. You're just letting it letting it go But somewhere in there you also have to let go of ownership over what you say even though people are like no You said that asshole what the fuck you can't let go of ownership when you look at it You realize like yeah, but I wasn't thinking about what I was there might be some feelings behind it but the articulation of reality itself Seems to be emerging from an abyss and I would love to know your thoughts on what that abyss is Well by there's this this Famous quote the mind creates the abyss the heart crosses it and There's this fundamental paradox in spiritual life That because we're suffering because we're conditioned we're trying to find a safe solid space from which to View life live life, but in fact reality is groundless There's no permanent self. Everything's impermanent. Everything's changing There's not really an eye when you get right down to it in Buddhism. They talk about a Nietzsche Duca Not to the three characteristics of existence. No permanent self impermanence unsatisfactoriness, so There's this tension between Some part of me that wants to be in control and know what's going on and I'm Dale and I'm Ramdev and I'm doing this stuff and And hopefully you're gonna like me and all those kind of things and there's this other part that's just like it's all spaciousness It's nobody's doing anything. There's not an eye and For most people it's a very gradual process of trust Trusting this dying into life life or you could even say dying into love That the abyss I mean if you really think about loving somebody it's an abyss. Yeah, because it's it's it's this Mystery between two people or between you and God or between you and your true self or something, right? It's like it's this unknown thing. It's a mystery you surrender to the mystery and Then you pull back and say wait a minute. That's too big. That's too spacious Yeah, I mean when I was going to these long meditation retreats back before I became a parent I Had this this these experiences where my mind would get really quiet and I think And I just I just be watching that I wouldn't be thinking at all actually and then some thoughts would come And I'd be aware of the thoughts after short and not so short amount of time They'd go away There'd be spaciousness and then some thoughts and then some awareness of thoughts But if I really paid very careful attention because I was curious Why would I start thinking when it felt so good to be resting in the abyss? Right and right before I started thinking there was fear of the abyss there was fear of death Yes, there was like I believe Descartes. I think they're for I am so let's start thinking so I can reify the ego structure Rather than just resting in this bliss of openness. Yeah, because there's nobody doing the resting. It's just it's like Just floating in the vast sky of mind and One part of me is saying hey, this is fantastic, but the ego structure this part of me that's Based on survival right it says hey wait a minute. You're forgetting about me. Come back here. Let's let's think Let's let's have some dualism here, right? I don't like the abyss the abyss is very big Well, you know, it's like if you go back and apply like this same Conundrum when it comes to speaking Or thought origination I know in like neurobiology, there's some very creepy Data that seems to suggest that before you even become aware of What you're going to say your brain is already determined now. This is what we're gonna say similarly with thoughts You know, if you've started any kind of sitting practice where you're allowing your thoughts just to do their thing Without reacting to them so much you can run into the same exact identical problem, which is You know, you're not like cooking your thoughts up in some kind of sulfuric kitchen that we're a guy Let me just think the worst fucking thing ever throwing a little Ukraine war tossing a little COVID mix it up with some Pope global the polar shift and pending apocalypse and then I don't know. Yeah, I think about I was a shitty kid Let's see. Let's tile those things together and then wallah you think some neurotic thought No, the neurotic thought comes from the same abyss So when you talk about this well, you know, I decided to start thinking Who decided you that seems to be yet another trick It's it seems like at some point making enough contact with that nucleus or whatever you want to call it Abyss seems like a little sinister. I like that. We're calling it an abyss I mean anyone who's having any encounter with emptiness doesn't really feel like when I think of abyss I think of HP Lovecraft. I don't think, you know, it's like tentacles But this is more of like come like a waking like oh, this is what I've always been saying and then These safety parachute thoughts that are that you're ejecting to desperately try to Stop your plummet into whatever this thing is. You're not even deciding to eject the parachute, right? Like it just is it just seems to be an automatic function when you are in that zone Like that, but you're not really deciding to think you you know what I mean? Like you're not like oh shit I need to think because that's a thought too So that I mean it even goes into the body that Before you decide to move your hand to pick up the fork The hand is moving before the mind says hey, I think I'm gonna do that. Yeah, I mean Round us has this great metaphor that the spiritual life is like jumping out of an airplane and part way down realizing There's no ground. Yeah, I mean screw it up part way down realizing you don't have on a parachute Yeah, and then a little further way down you realize it's okay because there's no ground, right? But in that space in the middle between no parachute and no ground It's really scary because you think rocks might be coming up as you're falling down here, right? right Yeah, and The you know so somehow within whatever this is you're you're essentially Experiencing death right like that's the idea is that prior to You know whatever Analogy you want to use deploying your parachute using your anti-graph suit whatever the thing is you want to do Prior to that you've already come home, right? Like that's the idea It's like right before you decide to start the machine up again That the experience is one of like oh this this is me. This is what I've always been this is more me than me I don't know why that is so terrifying though. I agree with you I mean I've certainly gone scampering away from that so many times Meditating on psychedelics or whatever just like right I need to be Something I gotta I gotta it be a thing, you know, but Why because it seems like a real encounter with a thing is not really I wouldn't use the term frightening But I mean to me it seems like Duncan that There is so much conditioning from early childhood where we were conditioned out of trusting our Openness our natural impulses that you've got to be socialized. You can't piss on the floor You can't write on the wall and you got to be quiet because dad's trying to read the paper whatever's going on Yeah, so you've got you've got to listen to the superego You've got to listen to this voice that's telling you how to behave and that voice is telling you I'm the voice of survival if you don't listen to me. They might not feed you. They might not Protect you anymore. You got to be a good boy. So there's there's two responses either. I'm gonna be a good boy Or I'm gonna be a rebel and I'm gonna be a bad boy, but they're two sides of the same coin Right so that we grow up we grow up and we're still doing that we're still believing that's the voice of survival and Spiritual life is gradually learning to trust that we can we can die into the next moment and For many of us is dying into love. Can can can we trust our heart? Can we trust the heart space enough to die into the next moment that that love brings a sense of mercy and softening so that this surrender this dying is Dying into this vulnerability is something we can bear we're learning to bear What was previously unbearable? through practice I want to thank Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH my glorious loves Squarespace has been a long time friend of the DTFH not just as a sponsor But as the provider of the insane technology that allows us to continue to have one of the most beautiful podcast websites on planet earth Squarespace has got all you need if you're trying to start a podcast if you want to create a home On the web for any of your content.

You're just you're just different size of the same coin I think this is that what you're trying to say. Yeah But then again, you think about somebody like Brezhnev coffee leaping on the stage or will he mays catching a fly ball or something There's nobody doing that so that whether you're a meditator or an athlete or a creative person or something Or you're taking psychedelics or whatever it is that we seek out these places in life where we go beyond I'm doing it Where we're letting life flow through us. We're letting Shockty just letting that juice just be expressed through us And just getting in that flow feeling that That that connectedness One of the one of the defining heart one of the defining qualities of the open heart Is is connectedness Right now Do I feel connected to you? Do I feel connected to my own self? Do I feel connected to the guy with the bad nickname god, right? Do I? Or am I disconnected on my back? I've got to protect myself. I've got to figure out what's going on And that sense of connection is going beyond I me mine Right. What what you were looking for is who is looking? But it we're so conditioned That that we're we're practicing from a feeling of inadequacy And need and and poverty and we've we've got to find something to become better And when practice deepens enough we get to the place of abundance and richness and And we're we're practicing because we're living because we enjoy it because god's expressing through us life is Is flowing through us and that's a big shift where You're not feeling I've got to meditate. I've got to do this or that because I'm no good until I do it better right Right well, let's talk about since we spend a lot of time talking about the connection Let's talk about disconnect be the experience of disconnect. Uh, can you describe what that's like for you? Well I was just talking yesterday with a friend of mine and I was talking about my connection with god, which is one specific issue And maybe 10 or 15 years after tomorrow as she died I felt like he abandoned me. I felt disconnected up until then I dream about him I could feel him and so for a year or two I felt disconnected and I felt like I'm a bad devotee. He's abandoned me because I'm I've been goofing around too much, right? Yeah, and and then I got this message that no He's just saying it's time for I'm I'm going to stop holding your hand. It's time for you to Jump out of the nest mixing a few metaphors here and fly on your own right And so that it was not being connected with some idea of god or maharajie in the pictures or You know christ in the monitor or whatever it is, but just just trusting true nature trusting who I am And just in the last few weeks though, it's feel it's been feeling like that Really sweet presence is coming back whether you call that maharajie or whatever but all of a sudden now something in me is trusting that there is that connection And sometimes I feel that with people. I often feel it In bed late at night Like I'm going to bed And I put my head down on the pillow am I putting my head on the pillow or as I'm putting it in god's lap and I'm lying there And I've got this job where I meet a lot of people who are dying and suffering and grieving and all that so I try to think of these people and and Just say my mantra and feel love for people Not not that they're broken and I need to fix them Not that they're even people that are separate, but that I go into wholeness And connection and then I connect with them Like when I was younger and all these yogi swamis llamas Roshis were coming to the bay area and I was like a big yogi and I needed all the help I could get I'd go to these people And I'd ask them my test question the test question was What would I do if I had a friend who were dying? And they'd never meditated and I really wanted to help them. What would it be the best thing to do? And almost all of them said something like Merge your mind with the one mind And then merge your mind with your friend So you're not looking at them as a dying person or you're not looking them as something separate from you But you're looking at them as as their one with god and your one with god and then Like there's that line in the JD Salinger short story where this little enlightened kid saw somebody drinking milk and he saw God pouring god into god Right. So that that it's all connected. Maraji would say sub-ex, sub-ex all the time It's all one and once again these people just got the Nobel Prize for there's just one thing in the universe, right? essentially universe one song only one so The further I go down this path the more it's about Surrendering into that oneness and less about Me trying to do something to fix something That it's letting go of I'm in this big self-improvement project but that that that It's like Suzuki Roshi my first meditation teacher said to students. You're all perfect, but there's still some room for Some improvement Right now. Okay. So to me I feel like this is the sort of uh The double-edged sword of the guru Is that it produces an addiction an inevitable addiction you become you how do you not become addicted to somebody who is Reminding you of home who is like Smell, you know, like when you walk into your home after a long trip or something, you know, it's like, oh my god this place How do you not get addicted to that? And you bringing up this sense of like being pushed out of the nest or whatever This is where it gets really curious. The entire self-help help movement So much of the teacher-student relationship that appears in capitalism The teacher needs to sell books. They need to eat In other words to push the bird out of the nest To you know help them get to some place of like no, you don't need me anymore because you are me It actually could hurt ticket sales. You know what I mean? Like this to me seems like where Things could potentially get a little weird Which is I'm not denying that some people have like made a profound connection To this place But it's odd, isn't it when like you need to keep telling stories about the place But you know what I mean? Like you have to tell stories about the place instead of getting people to the place to tell their own stories about the place You know what I mean? I hear what you're saying, but I really think there's a difference between a teacher and a guru Okay, and you say that you say that you become addicted to the guru, but if somebody really is a guru All they want is your happiness your freedom And when you get to the point where you don't need to be addicted anymore then they help you break that addiction Whereas somebody is out there selling their CDs and their books and their workshops and all that stuff Uh, maybe that's much more of the beginning and Middle stages of the path and people Need to have those teachers people need to learn how to meditate and learn how to trust themselves and stuff but there's this final surrender into wholeness into love is is a whole different level of the game that we're talking about and Uh, certainly there are people who claim to be enlightened beings and You read stories about their sexual indiscretions or their scamming money or who knows what they're doing so Somebody once asked maharajie. How do you know if somebody's your guru and he said Do you feel that they can completely bring you to total liberation or not? If if you don't feel that then they're not their guru. They're just some teacher along the way Wow cool Wow, that must be an incredible thing to be around that To have no doubts about it to to to know for sure that whoever this being is They could do that for you. What is that? What was that experience like for you? Well, so about think about it in the beginning You do have to doubt you do have to check it out. Is there somebody I can trust or not if you just come in there with blind faith You're gonna end up with some shai shi guru. You're gonna end up with some Phone. I mean you might and I'm not saying you will but there's a chance that you're just somebody you want your money or your body or whatever They've they've got a few good lines of teaching and here Give me all your stuff But then eventually if you're keeping doubting and checking it out all the time You're really limiting the depth of surrender that can happen. So you You you get to the point where you choose Is this my guru? Is this not my guru? And if you say yes, then you let go of all the doubt you just completely dive in there and certainly there are people that have made a mistake at that point, but When I was around maharaj in the beginning I was kind of believing who he was because ramdas said so and ramdas seemed to be My older brother. He'd been with maharaj before he knew Maharaj way better than I did right in the beginning there at least And I remember there was I mean, let me just tell you this one story. So I was with maharaj right in the beginning of getting there And there was me and this guy steve Who's now his name is mohan and a bunch a bunch of other devotees And maharaj he turned to the two of us westers and he said How much do you guys pay for milk in america? And steve made a quick calculation in his head and said x rupees per kilo maharaj And maharaj he turned to the indians and said can you believe How much they pay and he talked for 10 minutes to these people about the price of milk in america And i'm starting to doubt that ramdas knows what he's talking about that. Maybe this guy's senile I didn't come to india to talk about the price of milk in america. I wanted god. I wanted important discussion, right? And he turned back to us and he said how much was it again? and mohan said x rupees per kilo maharaj and maharaj he turned to the indians and Once again, he was going into this whole big talk and i'm saying this is this is crazy And all of a sudden I had this explosion in my mind Where I knew it came from maharaj. I can't tell you how and he said we could talk about important stuff We could talk about god. I could try to convince you because i'm so clever or something But that just makes the mind busy if we're just talking about bullshit just the mundane There's this ocean of bliss that's always available right now And I just I just fell into this ocean of of bliss and I was It's so deeply in bliss that I could barely do anything for the rest of the day Right, right so that so that maharaj in that moment Uh Showed me that it wasn't about my mind. It was about surrender and when I surrendered Which we can do right now. It's got nothing really to do with being in india in Kenchi at a temple or something like that That right now it's possible for us to surrender in that way And that the greatest love the greatest openness is available And then the ego says but wait a minute. That's pretty scary because what happens to me then You know my ego's trick around that is not that scary I'm waiting my ego says it's too easy That's my my ego isn't afraid of it. It seems like or hasn't gone to the fear card yet. Usually the card it places You can't that's too easy. No, no, no you have to suffer Maharaji stood in a lake and stared at the sun You got to go into a mystery school. There are thorn thorny belts You must lash yourself with her You know pain torture crucifixion father. Why have you forsaken me? You you know penance Burn off the karma man. You can't just Dive into an infinite believe that what That you have to do penance. You have to have a Belt of thorns and and and stand in a lake for a year to be enlightened not at all my ego Thanks that but anytime I've experienced it quite You know initially yes my I believe that but you know, I know what you're talking about You know and and and when I first met Ram Dass uh and he he uh You know, I was in a swimming pool and I couldn't believe I couldn't believe it like I'm hang out Ram Dass Right after my mom died and then he pointed at me goes. I want to talk to you He said it really fun in a funny fierce way, you know And then and then when we were in his house, I remember he wheeled up to me And it's just what you're talking about. You know just what you're talking about that experience like what is that? and uh Yeah, and he just he pointed at his head. He said you're here And then he pointed to his heart and he goes You have to get to here and he goes we we can do that You know, he was he didn't use a lot of words obviously because because of the stroke. So right he had a very concise way of saying things but I I I remember saying to him well, that's that's hard And because I'm thinking you know, I'm thinking that's not as hard. That's you don't know me man I'm not getting out of my head and uh And then he got this big smile and he goes no, it's not And and so this has been my experience lately and but but within that experience there is a It's very funny the reaction that the part of you that wanted to work for it as You know, it's that story. What's the story? Uh in the bible. You probably know it A guy hires workers in the morning Then in the yeah, I forgot I used to know that Hires workers in the morning Hires and he pays them and then he then he keeps paying them the same amount at the end of the day And the one pays them all for a day's work and the one ends in the morning You're like what the fuck they work for like 20 minutes. You're gonna pay them for a full day's work. That's not fair And then that's sort of one of the I think the stories about the kingdom You know, it doesn't matter your work. This isn't about work That's the world the world wants you to sweat and grind away to get the ferrari or whatever This thing is go ahead. Sorry Yeah, let me make a couple of points here. One is that Maharajee maybe needed to stand in the lake for a year and stare at the sun and things because He needed to be a teacher of the level of Maharajee Right like for instance in buddhism There are these things called the jataka tales where the the bodhisattva who was the buddha before he became the buddha He vowed to become the buddha. So he had to go through all these incarnations Not to get enlightened but become the Become the actual buddha like for instance in one incarnation. He was like walking out in the woods And he heard this sound and he looked down on this ravine and there was a Tiger that had fallen in there and the tiger and her two tiger cubs Were there and they were going to starve to that because the tiger had heard herself falling down into the ravine So the buddha so the bodhisattva threw himself into the ravine so the tiger could Eat him and he could save the three of them at the cost of his single life, right? So he was going through all these incarnations to become the buddha. So maybe you and I don't need to become the buddha We just need to become enlightened Duncan enlightened ramdev, right? and Ramdas was he needed to be ramdas. He had some kind of karma. He had this really big karma To affect hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. I don't have that karma I affect a few thousand people maybe and it it's not really about numbers, but some people have that other kind of karma Well, wait a minute. Hold on. Let me stop you before the gurjeef You've been talking about quantum entanglement. You've been talking about how we're all intrinsically Fundamentally connected how this thing that everyone knows got it, right? So and from that perspective You let me tell you Would you rather? What's what's worse? Old age disease death living an entire life are getting eaten by a tiger I mean we're getting eaten by a tiger in slow motion It looks like the universe and it is eating us and it eats everybody So I would argue if this is a consensual relation thing that's happening here in other words if we chose this birth Then we just we were we signed up to get eaten by a tiger the size of the universe. So You're getting eaten by a tiger right now Yeah, but it's maybe a little bit. I mean first of all I'm enjoying life I mean If if I actually had a tiger come into my room right now and started chewing on my leg It would be a lot less pleasant than talking to you So Our next partner is athletic greens friends I slurp down Athletic greens because I am not capable of maintaining a regular vitamin schedule It's just not in my karma.

What is it from there? Yeah, okay? Well, thank you. That's nice to have people that would have been amazing if you said otherwise I would rather be by a tiger than continue to do your podcast would be uh What was the story you mentioned? Drinking the milk. How does it go again? That maverigie was talking about the price of milk and I got all bored and then no not that the story about the kid in that short story um Oh, it was the j.d. Salinger not maverigie the j.d. Salinger story one of the short stories in franny and zooey or raze hide the roof beams carpenter whatever it is Where there was this enlightened little boy looking at another child Drinking milk and what he saw was god pouring god into god Right, so tie boot up pouring You know the same things true for the Buddha and the tiger we're talking about like if you know that that You're you're from the outside. You're like what the why did my friend just feed himself to a tiger? We had meat back at the palace You know that's something that story I always think about like didn't he have a sandwich? like What wasn't there though? Wasn't there other things you could feed the starving tiger than yourself? But then that's taking a metaphor literally. Yeah, I was just going to say it might be a metaphor But but the point is The point is that to become a Buddha you got to do maybe a different kind of practice than to become an enlightened duncan You know that's my my point and the other point is that gherjeev said that the first thing you got to do on the path Is let go of your attachment to your own suffering Right, and that's a hard thing to do because yes, it's it's so my victimhood My suffering is so comfortable and familiar And to be somebody who's not doing that means that who I think I am has to die. I've got to become a different person So like think of the metaphor of somebody's been incarcerated for like 20 or 30 years I used to teach meditation in san quen right and there are these stories of somebody's been In the joint for a really long time and they get paroled and they don't want to leave because It's so big and scary out there, right? There's freedom out there, but they're so comfortable being in the cage right, so oh, yeah, so that That spiritual life is about gradually Getting used to being out of the cage And then you go back in for a while and then you let me try that again And then you go out there and maybe you can spend a little more time out of the cage But you want to sleep there at night because it's when it's dark out It's too dangerous to be outside of the cage metaphorically. You hear what i'm saying. It's safe. My dogs like they're crates You know, they like to sleep in them at night. It's like, you know, they're they feel safe in there. I mean, there's one of my favorite Examples of this is if you ever read The Painted Bird by Yersey Kaczynski. No, I have not Oh, it's good and it's it's horrible, but Little boy, you know wandering through the countryside Towards the end of world or two. It's awful, but Encountering just horror after horror but one of the things that Like there's a rabbit hutch And he and he's like sneaking around there sees this rabbit hutch and he feels bad. There's this big fat rabbit stuck in the hutch And so the little boy goes and opens up the rabbit hutch and Kaczynski just describes this beautiful forest that is in front of this big fat rabbit And now the rabbit kind of hobbles down Sniffs the air outside its cage and then just walks right back into its cage And then and yeah, it's it's he's pointing to this same phenomenon. I mean, this is like when you're how many times I'm sure you've heard this before Your friend has been bitching about their rotten relationship forever And you have been saying to them. Look you this is bad for you. Like you're miserable. What are you doing? And then finally They do it In the relationship Then they call you three weeks later. They're like, we got back together You're like, what are you doing? It happens all the time All the time all the time because because it's that familiarity It's like you would rather be in a familiar hell than a brand new heaven. It feels Safer to be in hell. It's so odd humans are really messed up But then think of the function of the guru that you're hanging out with this guy or this woman and They keep seeing the place in you where you are whole They keep no matter how neurotic or horny or scared or inadequate you feel They just keep seeing the place in you that's whole and you begin to start believing that a little bit I mean, there's this there's this one teacher of non-duality. I don't even remember his name, but they asked him How did you get enlightened and he said well my teacher told me I wasn't I believe them? So He is obviously Ready to do the surrender trick there, but That is what's going on here that that Love is contagious those who haven't got it catch it from those who do And whether it's from a guru or it's from your dog or it's from your wife or it's from your kid Or it's from the tree in the front yard or whatever it is That there's this process of beginning to gradually trust the Surrender into wholeness and into love There's this wonderful roomie poem where there's this guy in the poem He's complaining that I've been praying all my life and I've never heard God reply I pray and you don't say anything And and in the poem God replies to the guy the longing you express is the return message The grief you cry out from draws you toward union your pure sadness is the secret cup You know, so so it's not like I mean, it's even this it's even talking about it's even wanting to know how to surrender even that is the response That that God loves us exactly the way we are And we've got this thing in our heads. We've got a change to be more lovable And that's what I'm talking about That's the paradox because and I think this is like, you know, what this is where I connect with the second noble truth Because you know, everyone thinks initially you hear that's like, yeah, right You're attached to money your sex or this or that But they never think no you're attacked. You're you you've become completely attached. So it's a pain It's a suffering And this is seems ridiculous because why would I be I'm not gonna I'm take my hand away from the hot stove What are you talking about? I'm not gonna do that. I'm not this this victim your book on you. It's to become a victim Is this look luxury almost, you know, now you're a victim You don't have to do anything. You're trapped. You're in the cage. There's no way out And you don't want to deal with the possibility that Yeah, but you know, it's what is c.s. Lewis say the gates of hell are locked from the inside. Oh This is this is hilarious. This is hilarious It's a good line. Yeah, but to to sort of Realize that. Oh my god. I am literally like I've met my dream girl Finally, yeah met my dream girl, but I'm just gonna stick it out This monster that I've been it's been cheating on me lying to me sneaking around stealing from me, you know, I definitely Uh I don't mean that literally in my own life, you know, I but I but I'm I'm saying like when you meet this thing It's a lover. We might elect trump again What's that? We might elect trump again We did elect trump again, but they lied about the polls. Did you not do you not watch tucker carlson? I forgot about that I guess I missed that show But the point is that I mean even collectively we're doing the same thing that we're talking about it's not just you and me It's it's the collective Yeah, yes, that's it. The collective is in an abusive relationship with their shadow And just lost in it just lying and you know, like any other abusive relationship. It's an egregore Have you ever heard that term before egregore? I have not It's a great term. It's a it's a word for When enough people believe in a thing Whatever it may be It becomes real and within the minds and then in that way it kind of takes on a life of its own outside of the minds via the Action of the collective the egregore. So in this case The the world has fallen in love with the egregore of the apocalypse We love it. We are engaged in it. And if you compare it to it If you compare it to classic abusive relationships, it's really not that different, right, you know, and and and Because it's not real necessarily any more real than the fact. It's always been the apocalypse since the world existed the The the the thing itself the forms it takes it's the news doom scrolling fixation on war never ending fear of disease reactionary attitudes towards Things that are being held in front of you by the priests of the egregore, you know the the media And and and it's a it's a it's a terrible love affair. What you're talking about Is the soul me, you know the that that is just Patiently waiting for you to wake the fucked up Delete the number delete that the apocalypse is number out of your phone block it Come watch Netflix with me. Maharaj. He said be peaceful. I am always with you. I'm always in communion with you And that he's not just saying that to somebody who happened to be in india and happened to bump into him, but that that God christ buddha Whoever is it that presence that that wholeness is always there and that conversation we were having about a quarter of an hour ago about What you have to do to get there And the superego and the the inadequate self saying you've got to try harder and And suffer a lot to get there. I mean in a way it's it's so as you pointed out and we kind of Slipped over that point we uh That to me is a really important thing that it's of it's It's so simple and so easy that we miss it. It's so familiar That it's here all the time and we don't notice it that wholeness And that we're always getting fixated with the content of experience or the or the observer on the other hand And really it's just consciousness being with experience that there's the singer seeing the scene you let go of the seat The scene and the seer all that's left is seeing they were just seeing what's going on, but there's nobody doing it and Consciousness is creating form according to quantum mechanics without consciousness. There's no form So that it's it's all consciousness. It's all god And it's so simple. I mean from the standpoint of non-duality talk about Being aware of being aware or awareness watching awareness instead of getting lost up in all the content Or from a from a devotional standpoint of dying into love just I mean suppose Instead of paying attention to your breath You did this sort of like devotional of a positive thing where you're paying attention to unconditional love in each moment What what does that feel like in your body that love that's permeating every cell of your body and just hanging out there The best it's like it's like holding my children the uh the You know, I like You know, if you're on your first date with somebody May tell you they're complicated You believe them You better believe if you better believe make that your last date Make it your last day. I mean, I think that if you want to sort of like because we're dealing with like I don't a phantom But it's the phantom that gets embodied in all the myths It's the phantom of You know, Jesus in the desert. It's the phantom of mara. It's the pre-enlightenment But what what do what do they all have in common they're fucking complicated Mara is complicated satan is so complicated Like there's contracts. You you're messing around with the devil There's like long complex contracts in the in the myth, you know, and I think that that represents The opposite of what you're talking about. It's like the world is complicated. There are forms You can't just get a colonoscopy You got to fill out a hundred forms before they will shove a tube in your ass You know what I mean? Like this is the world and so What you're talking about it's like it's so unfamiliar to people It's so unfamiliar that it that it seems Impossible and then if we give a little life to the complexity Little intelligence, you know, well in the same way a shitty person will say that that's way out of your league, man You don't deserve that. Look at you. You're not so much of a look at you. Have you seen your ass lately? look in a mirror So Duncan when I was younger I was in very complicated relationship with very exciting Women and there's like a lot of drama and passion and excitement and complication And I'm old enough now that I'm not interested in complication. I've got a simple relationship finally in my life I mean somebody who's mature and loving And we'd rather be happy than complicated, you know, I mean and yeah That's cool. Not just a relationship with another person, but my relationship with myself my relationship with you or you know with what I'm doing It can be simple moment to moment. I mean imagine So There are three qualities of the totally awakened mind one is clarity the knowing quality the second is spaciousness the empty nature of mind The third is naturally arising compassion and activity So like imagine that in your life Whenever you're going to do something your motivate motivation was Compassion not do they like me? Am I getting enough? What is foxy who's going to think? But what is the compassionate thing To help me to help other people compassion is It's not an emotion. It's the open heart meeting the suffering of the world including your own suffering And and and to the extent that I'm just resting in that compassion and saying What's the what's the thing I can do right now that's most compassionate for me for Duncan for the audience How can I be in my body? How can I be expressing myself so that The most healing happens in the world and and as I'm doing that it's not me doing it anymore then Because the heart is fundamentally spacious and sky-like So it's not me who's Doing compassion. It's I am compassion and the I even then dissolves in the compassion Yeah Yeah, I mean this to me. This is the this is where the rubber it's the road especially these days You know, it's always been true But in the worry now this like it seems like without What people think compassion is is the opposite. I mean the kaliyuga version of compassion is rejecting people You have different Rejecting people who whose current views you have decided to make their eternal view You know for getting that at one point you also had crazy ideas So you so you don't even people are encountering each other in this terrible way Where they feel like well, yeah, I'm not being compassionate to the nazi But I'm being compassionate to all the all the people who aren't the nazi by rejecting the nazi And you know what? I mean this to me is this is where the This is where we're running into some real trouble. I I was like god forgive me. I'm it's not right Don't take this the wrong way, but I was trying to deep fake martin with her king's voice the other day and I'm listening to this speech. He's giving on non-violence And oh my god this articulation of like it doesn't work It's not effective. It's not go. It's not going to bring us any closer to where we want to be We're outnumbered. We're outgunned We can't fight that way It just isn't going to succeed And it's so beautiful and it's not just bullshit like You know cowardice disguised as sophistication. It's the most I mean it's It's the bravest thing I've heard he died because of saying stuff like that and and and so it's so to me You know Whenever I run into the situation of realizing my god this person thinks they're so great They feel so compassionate They feel like they're helping the world by rejecting reviling humiliating shaming You know what I mean when yeah, they're not helping anything other than they're just pouring gas on the fire So once again, one of the qualities of open heart is connectedness and one of the qualities of grief or the quality of grief is separation and Rumi has this great line grief Is the garden of compassion garden is this place or something wonderful beautiful tasty growth so that One big chunk of the spiritual life is transmuting separation and grief into connectedness and compassion And to me it's really impossible To heal the world through divisiveness that that The democrats are saying the republicans are destroying the the republican the The republicans are saying the democrats are destroying it. We can't trust each other I there was some statistic. I was reading a couple days ago in the new york times something like 80 percent of republicans think that Democrats are evil or something like that and 60 some percent of democrats think that republicans are evil And that if we just let them do what they want to do they're going to destroy the country and You know at the same time I work with dying people and In the beginning I thought my job was to rescue people to go in there and help them die better But the more I've done this I realized that Suffering is only suffering. I don't say that to people But that cancer doesn't cause suffering resistance to cancer causes suffering Republicans don't cause suffering Resistance to republic republicans cause suffering, right? So that if if if we can begin to see how we're creating this suffering if we can begin to Realize that when you are dying donald trump and joe biden are going to be in opposite sides of your bed As you're dying smiling at you It's terrible But don't tell that to anybody ever again They're not going to be there. But the place where you automatically make that shrieking noise is going to be there in you Yeah, right. So that as long as that stuff is unconscious It it's it's it's holding us down. It's pulling us down And that spiritual life is making conscious with that which is previously unconscious that That by seeing all this divisiveness and the thing I was saying before about dying people I kind of lost my train of thought that Sometimes you have to suffer more Before you get to the point where you say I'm willing to get out of here that like in the 12 steps the first step is you admit How messed up it is and it's out of control for you Right, so that as long as you think I can do this no matter how screwed up it is How matter how fucked up the politics are the climate is but When we individually and collectively get to the point where we have to surrender and say I'm a patient I'm willing to suffer now. I'm willing to see this is how bad it is and I can open to this I can be with this. I can I can have compassion for this Then change in healing and connection is going to happen But you've got you've got to admit you're stuck in that place in the first place and Collectively we haven't done that. So maybe Maybe through climate change and war and And pandemic how many billions of people have to die to get the message? I don't know Look, you know, I think the first step is stop aligning yourself with any political party I've realized I've been doing that. It's like, what am I doing? They've got me They got you ever been around a huckster In a huckster. Well, like what what they do is like you avoid some opinion this or that And the huckster will be like, uh, you you You're smart. You're you're one of us. You know, I know if you're if you're looking for friends or you're lonely You'll be like, oh, I guess I am. What what else do you believe? You know, I think they'll tell you how we believe this that that Okay, I'll believe that too even though you might not right and you know And and this is this is to me like this stupid political Division in the world is so dumb It compartmentalizes people it frees people And they're like, oh Whatever way you're believing now is what you're always gonna believe It tribalizes And to me like we all you want to take a bro You want like you don't want you by the way, I shrieked not because Trump and Biden were sitting at the edge of my bed because they weren't in bed with me You poor boy making making love making love to me. I just love american presidents. They're so sexy did no the the uh Let's let go of this thing man. Let's just for a second Erase whatever the hell you think your party is or the other parties. It's really fun It's really fun to just be like, I'm neither of those things and no, I'm not a centrist and no I'm not a libertarian. No, I'm not an anarchist. I'm not a communist You guys can play that game. It's really fun I recommend it. I recommend it. I mean, I I don't mean to like did Rail the beautiful things you're saying into political commentary But I think part of the letting go situation you're the compassion situation here is Step one is you got to stop saying you're this or that Just let go of it, right? It's really quite liberating. I mean they did a good job Making people think you're gonna be one or the other They did a really good job there both sides like congratulations. It worked. You've got everyone thinking I'm this or that It's almost heresy to say that doesn't like you know, it's supposed to say that But I think that letting go of that binary is really healthy for people No matter what side of the aisle you're on when you're caught in that divisiveness They're suffering and the problem is people are so into the concepts. They don't know they're suffering The first step is you got to slow down enough to feel what you're feeling Yes, and like when ramda said the point it was had you said you got out you got to get out of your head into your heart As long as you're in your head, you're not feeling How you're suffering and getting down into your body getting down to your heart even down into your belly Then you begin to feel the pain you begin to feel the suffering you begin to Feel that abyss that we were talking about before But like politics is pretty much done from the head from concepts And some concepts are appealing to somebody's the other concepts appealing to somebody else But Martin Luther King and Gandhi and Nelson Mandela and the people that really did create change Even though they got killed along the way some of them Change often happens through Some charismatic figure who is able to be nonviolent and connect with people And I mean it's a tricky thing because like in Tibet The Dalai Lama was nonviolent toward the Chinese and they just took over the country and rape tortured and killed Right and a lot of young Tibetans feel that they should have been more violent more Aggressive in dealing with the Chinese having some asymmetrical terrorism going on there So yeah, I'm sure that the Tibetan Buddhists would really be able to repel an attack by the People's Republic of China that seems to be not very loud. I don't know how long you're gonna be able to hang on Up there It wouldn't have worked. Well, then North Vietnamese beat the American army when you think about it Yeah, but I mean we're talking about one of the most like powerful militaries on earth the last I checked that So bettons didn't weren't exactly like a powerful military unless I just No, they weren't they they had a few they didn't have an air force. What do they have a tank? They didn't have like buddhist tanks I think they were sitting ducks. I mean, I'm sorry. I had no offense to anyone out there. I mean, I understand I mean god knows when you see what's happened And you read stories about it was like before the invasion and you see like they've got a kodak shop There now. Yeah, it's the most rancid thing you've ever seen in your life. I could understand Why people Would think we should have started we at least we could have taken a few out But I don't think it would have been very effective based on my very limited understanding of the Chinese military versus the Tibetan non-mil No, they didn't have a military They have a name muskets Old cars and muskets Well, but going back to the point though, I mean The buddha even said that hatred is not healed by hatred but by love alone and You know, love is kind of corny. Uh, I don't it's it's I I have these groups I teach. I have a really big one on saturdays. In fact, anybody can just Come to the living dying project living dying dot org and sign up for this free spiritual support group We have every other saturday morning But when I say the words 9 to 11 9 to 11 california time okay But but the point and I'm doing an in-person retreat at hollyock farm up in British columbia made 10th through 14th. Oh, wow cool But the the point I'm making is that like if I talk about love and god I don't know what people are hearing because I've got my wounds about loving god from growing up as a lutheran And other people are catholic catholic and jewish and atheist and So when we use those those terms like all you need is love and the beetles say all you need is love It's a kind of a vague concept and Can we really trust the surrender that romloff's was pointing to in the swimming pool Of trusting that we don't have to understand the bible talks about the piece that passes understanding Right that you you don't have to stand under all the stuff, you know, you can just that's there you've got your training You've got your degree. You've got your knowledge whatever it is But what we really trust is our connectedness with each other with the sangha with life with with ourselves Okay, I got something for that Oh, if you don't mind may I read a quick poem? I know we're running out of time here. This was sit Do you mind you got a no no no go for a few more. Okay, so I um One of the first buddhist teachers was a wonderful person named tejo munich And she teaches in ashville at this place called the great tree temple Yeah Anyway, we had a wonderful like podcast on saturday and it's i'm sorry. Yeah great tree temple dot org for folks who might be interested um And she sent me this she's a zen priest And she sent me this and she's the real deal man like and she uh after our conversation She's giving me this poem reminds me of what you just said All right, how do you say it rilke rilke. Yeah rilke Be patient towards be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart And try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue Do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them And the point is to live everything live the questions now Perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer Wow, that's beautiful Isn't that awesome?

230^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 554: Dr. Will Cole Transcript and Discussion^2023-03-05^Greetings, friends. It's me, Duncan, your noble podcast host, and this is the Duggar Dressel Family Hour podcast. Most of you probably know I'm a huge fan of Terence McKenna. For those of you who might not be aware of who that is, just check him out. There's probably seven trillion hours of his brilliant lectures on psychedelics, mushrooms, shamanism, and just about everything else on YouTube. He has the most incredible way of articulating the psychedelic experience to the point that sometimes in the past when I was reading his books, I felt like I was high as a kite. So you can probably imagine how excited I am to discover that Terence McKenna has more than one brother. You all know about Dennis McKenna. He's a genius and hopefully one day will appear on this podcast, but I was completely shocked to discover that Terence McKenna has another brother, Matt McKenna, and many of his lectures are available if you dig around YouTube, but to save you some time, I recorded one of them and I present it to you now. The mushroom speaks to you in the whispering voice of an eternal being, the harmonic buzz of a mycelial larynx made whole by its symbiosis with your synaptic cleft. It whispers in your ear and says let's go to a strip club, let's order lap dances and delight in the erotic outflow of optical pleasure originating in the exotic dancers. Thong and its luminous spangles jingle jangling against the golden pole. Here the pole is not just a mechanism upon which the exotic dancer acts out the primordial rite of instantiating souls into the material reality via the mechanism of human reproduction, but becomes a serpentine phallus. And as you watch spellbound, the mushroom invites you to order a lap dance to remove the space between you and the other and merge fully with the exotic dancer. And so you surrender to the invitation of the mushroom. It's all you can do what you were before you consumed those five dried grams of fungal matter and climbed into your mini Cooper and what you are now might as well be the difference between the paleozoic and the Cretaceous era to even contemplate the you that once was married with children would be like some advanced galactic civilization attempting to analyze the motivations of an insect on some distant world. You are now a new thing, a thing with a pocket full of $20 bills and so you render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and invite the dancer into your proximity by waving your money in the air, a kind of nod to the inescapable absurdity of a civilization that prioritizes the collection of rectangular bits of colored paper over experience itself. The mushroom compels you to invite the exotic dancer back to your suite at the hotel you reserved earlier. And when she asks if you have cocaine, the mushroom tells you to tell her that yes, you do have cocaine and that there is nothing wrong with cocaine that in fact cocaine is a sacrament in many cultures used to open up to the physical reality to embrace the purely physiological non-intellectual aspect of your own humanity. The exotic dancer has a tattoo on her sacrum of a mushroom from Mario Brothers and you are stunned by the impossible synchronicity how even outside of hyperspace even here in the flashing lights of the golden butler gentlemen's club, little cosmic winks from the great mysterious eye of the earth still managed to penetrate the veil. And so you bring her to your hotel room and with the frothing madness of a romantic poet proceed to eat her ass. You indulge yourself in the pastime of the great philosophers who were unafraid of taboo and in that ecstatic exploration you become one with all the other initiates who dared be led blindfolded into the druidic catacombs where they were offered psychoactive nectar from clay chalices engraved with symbols of the goddess. It is there you are no longer a participant in male dominator culture but a happy servant worshiping the ass of the goddess and the mushroom is there with you watching. It watches you from the closet smoking a sacred cigarette and pleasuring itself. You return home and like every explorer of the forbidden you climb through your window. You wash yourself in the shower and sleep as you never had before dreaming of your next rendezvous with the great mystery. Amazing lecture, truly life changing and we have an amazing podcast for you today that also could be life changing. I know you've probably heard of Goop and that means you've probably heard of Dr. Will Cole. He's the host of the art of being well podcast which is a great podcast but he's also written a lot of books including one that truly changed my life. He's got a new book coming out that I really hope you will pre-order makes a big difference for these people. It's called gut feelings healing the shame fueled relationship between what you eat and how you feel. It's a book about the microbiome something that has always freaked me out to imagine that beings living in your digestive system are actually having some kind of weird effect on the things you want to eat and your behaviors and your mood is mind-blowing and we talk a lot about that in this conversation along with a lot of other things. So strap in the first we subscribe to my patreon it's at patreon.com forward slash DTFH you're gonna get commercial free episodes of every podcast along with access to our discord and our vibrant thriving community of beautiful geniuses.

Alright everybody let's do this. Welcome to the Duncan Trestle family hour podcast Dr. Will Cole. Dr. Cole welcome to the DTFH. It's so great to see you. How are you today? I'm doing well man. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Oh my god are you kidding? I can't wait to talk to you. Now before you go on what's hanging behind you on your wall there? What is that? So my day job is I started one of the first functional medicine telehealth centers. So for the past 13 years I sit in this room for 10 hours a day and I'm gonna if I'm gonna be somewhere 10 hours a day I want it to be as zen as chill as you can. So what's behind me is eucalyptus and then on the side of me is like some cacti and just like trying to bring some forest bathing inside my office. Dr. Cole tell me something as a doctor who has I'm one of the many people who've benefited from your hard work do you feel a little like it's paradoxical that you are helping people like me while simultaneously being glued to your office? Yeah I do it's it's paradoxical and I've thought and people have told me that online social media before like just knowing when I do it like shouldn't you I you know I take I have healthy boundaries that work for me I go on trips with my family I have very much an introvert so I get to spend the weekends with my family as much as possible even if I have to travel for work I take one of my kids with me and really use it as sort of family time that's cool so it's I've created sort of my bubble of things that work for me and when you love what you do and it's helping people and I have an amazing team around me it's like family vibes like so much in my life that it seems like a lot and it is a lot in some ways but I have mitigated it as much as I can right now that's all you could do right I mean I this is um you know finally we begin to utilize technology in the way we all knew it could be utilized meaning we don't need to be at these offices why why do we have to like be like driving fucking up the environment to get to a place to do a thing that we this technology this technology can instantaneously do but then now we're all just stuck at home I mean this is something like that I work from well I work in a back house behind behind my house but yeah I all the time thinking maybe I should just go back to the office because is it good for my kids to see me kind of come in and out of the house that confuses them is it what are your thoughts on that do you the distinction between work and a home that's interesting you said this so I'm in my clinic right now I so I leave my house to come to work I like the synergy of this the separation of family at home and I like this yeah I like a separation from working home because it's like clear turn on turn off sort of thing you know you know when you love what you do you really fully turn off that's right it's still a little different but it it's like an energetic shift at least and I love the physical synergy with my team here like most of my age my HQ team is here like my corporation team the friend s friend end of the clinic is all here so I love that sort of collaborative in person and look I know people say the zoom meetings are one thing and like the asana boards and all that stuff the slack channels it's not the same it's not right so it's to me I love because I am on telehealth all day long with patients looking at a screen I like turning the screen off when I'm meeting with my team so for me that sort of break from the screen is like when I get to meet with my team for like patient case reviews and I'm like with my people in a room and not in a screen so I try to break it up as much as I can got it okay here I want to talk to you about your book now I know this isn't your you've written many books but I gotta tell you I got this book and intuitive fasting and I'll admit I have ADHD I didn't read the whole thing but I read enough I read I read enough and I'll tell you man it peak pandemic way I was over 180 pounds I think 184 pounds bloated just look like shit felt like shit I started fasting I'm down to 163 pounds I never thought I could in my whole life I never I'm sure you deal with this with patients who have more weight on them than they might want to have there's a sense this will never go away this is I know you might have some method or there might be this diet or this method or whatever but my fat as opposed to other people's fat is committed enthusiastic in love with being attached to my body and it's going nowhere yeah and it seemed like that also I quit drinking simultaneous I mean obviously that's not helping but I now I'm habituated to fasting I don't I like it I don't I just don't eat like I used to eat and but all of a sudden I've noticed on the internet op-eds pieces popping up fasting is not good for you anymore now it'll cause heart disease heart attacks it's you you're dooming yourself by fasting so now I'm in this neurotic place where when I get on the scale and I've lost a little more weight I'm like oh my god here you are you do you need what are you messing up your life so can you address I don't know if you've noticed this new wave of anti-fasting stuff out there can you address that and let those of us who have managed to discipline ourselves into fasting I don't know whether that stuff's true or not sure and that that sort of maybe anti-fasting conversation was going on whenever like the intermittent fasting bubble like the zeitgeist is really going on a few years ago too but I think there was just so much excitement around it that people didn't hear but people that were in the space like myself I was reading both sides like all the time and how I think the media and articles would their perspective of a study and I think you know context matters with all of these things and their headlines and the sensationalism isn't always as it's it's sexier than sometimes the data around it right the way that studies are formulated and what actually was like looked at matters and in a lot of the studies if I don't know specifically the ones you're citing to talk about it but I know that the way that I would advocate people to do intermittent fasting is to never fast their way out of a poor diet and I think that sometimes when you get in a research space they want to see where the benefits coming from comparing them to placebo and if they didn't change anything in their diet what if they just fasted fasting is a hormetic effect on the body it's a hormesis and it may be one of the parts that you read about an intuitive fasting but it's this good stress just like people are talking about high intensity interval training or even re-hit like different types of high intensity training or cold therapy and cold plunges or yeah on a therapy those are all hormetic things so they're not good or bad it's how you use them and who's using them right how and how much are they using them right always in the sauna that too much sauna wouldn't be good for you you die too much cold plunged would be good for you because you die too much high intensity interval training isn't good for you so same with fasting and the ketogenic diet would say too too much stress on your body isn't a good thing yeah I could see that for some subgroups of people putting too much stress could probably impact heart health if you're like eating doing omad and like eating best but next to nothing for years on end that's not advantageous more isn't always better so I think that it's good that science and the culture are exploring these things but that's why I called that book intuitive fasting yeah so you can find out what works for your body instead of like these sort of blanket statements well this and this is yeah this is that it's not like I'm not eating anymore and I get but I could see how someone could with an eating disorder could rationalize the eating disorder by thinking that they're doing something healthy when they're not getting enough calories and starving themselves I eat I mean this is what I love about that your book is it's sort of encouraging you as the individual listen to your body you know because whenever when I was overeating I wasn't listening to my body my body was like what are you doing my body was like an Amazon employee like are you kidding me really like another chorizo are you really doing huevos rancheros we had them for breakfast you didn't have that for breakfast and lunch so chorizo's are your thing that was your thing no my my thing was just dumping food into my body out of habit out of you know I don't know why and and and then it just changed and now and just like you say in your book like it it just my body like reharmonized with and and and now I don't have those weird like spikes of hunger yeah and hagginess cravings yeah it's metabolic flexibility that's what you built for yourself so you can eat and fast intuitively that's it's a beautiful thing now on to the next one and this ties into your new book have you been watching the last of us at all no should I be oh yeah it's so good it's so good I've been I tell you I don't get out very much I don't like I'm in this room too much Dr. Cole it's just a beautiful incredibly scary awesome series but the uh the the apocalypse in this case is it zombies it's a fungal disease it's spread through the world it's gotten into people's brains it's controlling them I've always been creeped out by the idea that there are colonies of things in my intestines that are sending signals through my body that I'm confusing as my own compulsions when in fact it's something inside of me you know this is being like another gummy bear more sugar come on another beer let's go can you is my assessment of an accurate or did if I just sort of overblown what's going on in the relationship between the human mind and the gut it's you hit it right on the nail on the head but it's it sounds science fiction it does it sounds creepy like what it's this thing going on but we co-evolved with it and in some ways you think about it we exist because of it we it it in many ways I think created us and it's these trillions of bacteria it's upwards depending on the study that you look at it's a hundred trillion bacteria that live in our gut and on our skin and cross talk with each other and then cross talk with us meaning the physical self us so if you put that in perspective a hundred trillion bacteria we have 10 trillion human cells so we are 10 times more bacteria than human yes you never had to tell me that oh my god that's another thing to wake up in the middle of thinking about thanks dr. Cole what I know crazy man but you know what I think of you know in the 90s there was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and there was that I think his name was Crang where the the villain had the brain inside the robot that's what I think of when I think of the microbiome it's this thing inside of us that if that left us we would be just a meat a meat machine that just fell over because we need the microbiome to make neurotransmitters we need microbiome to regulate hormones we need the microbiome to actually make our immune system I mean 95 percent of serotonin is made in the gut and stored in the gut 50 percent of dopamine is made in the gut stored in the gut so we lost 95 percent of our serotonin and dopamine 75 percent of our immune system is made in the gut so these things actually influence everything for their own survival because you said like the cravings there's studies that show that depending on the colonies you have in your bacteria it will influence what you crave like the you said I don't even know why I was going for the trees I don't even know why I was going for these things well the bacterial overgrowth the dysbiosis I quantify on my patient's labs are associated in scientific literature to these insatiable cravings it's not the fact that you are weak or you had poor will yeah weak willpower and you just were a horrible human being because you had to crave that junk food that's what happens with the microbiome and it's this vicious cycle then because you want it's causing you to eat more of what these opportunistic apathogenic bacteria or think of them as like weeds overgrowing in his gut garden that want these things that don't love the human body back hey nothing I love more than taking a stroll through an English gut garden that's so brilliant oh look at your beautiful microbiome let's throw sugar on it the uh okay so um you now when you are doing panels on your patients you're saying that you can take somehow you what are you through blood what what is the what is your measuring book stool test uh so we have people basically poop and what looks like a fried dish but you're not putting fries in this thing you're just you're putting a bowel movement in and we send it to the lab the patients are in themselves so if you have a partner you can like make it a thing like a bonding experience now um yeah you wait wait hold on honey can you help me poop in the friedish so you can yeah you can collect it and then send it out male classic valentine's day yeah classic valentine's day okay so you poop in a friedish and you send it out and then from that you you can tell what's going on and that's not just stool test I mean you're talking about gut health specifically but blood does tell us a lot so between stool and blood when you're talking about gut health that's going to give you a lot of different biomarkers different data points to look at the metabolites that are produced from certain bacteria measuring any of those weeds that I was talking about the opportunistic pathogenic bacteria that influence things like cravings and influence things like mood issues I mean things like anxiety and depression and brain fog and fatigue oftentimes have their roots and what's going on in the gut so it's not just about digestive issues it's also brain health issues and inflammatory problems like autoimmune problems and 75 of the immune systems in the gut and the fact that many of our hormones are converted in the gut too for example 20 of the thyroid hormone is converted in the gut so a lot of people sluggish thyroid hormones it's really a gut health problem that's causing it if you do scroll like I do you might think that the economy is collapsing like some kind of neutron star sinking in on itself and

and I honestly have just rolled my eyes because it seems like bullshit like it seems like such bullshit they've got these whatever it is pills filled with bacteria I guess what's in those pills the little you know what I'm talking about like probiotics yeah probiotics so these are bacteria pills right they're not that's not you're not gonna brand them bacteria pills but they're bacteria pills and so some of them will be like these are for women these are for men and I've always thought come on really like you're like there's some of these work better for middle women is that nonsense or is that true it's most that's mostly branding in my opinion it's marketing it's it's it's trying to I think communicate to the consumer and what they will do isn't like this deceptive what they will do is probably I don't know about the specific brands but what I have seen done sometimes that they will put some different colonies that have been researched to be bent the study was more done in women so they will say okay this is beneficial in the studies for women so we're gonna then sell it to women or what they will do is get something that's that's not a probiotic that is complementary to women like an herb or some sort of mineral that women are deficient in or the herbs been shown to support for women so they're sort of getting sort of a women complex in that area but you're right it's the wild west when it comes to probiotics there's just so much out there not all is worth the money and the it's you know I think food is first that's where my mind goes to and like food to eat actually influence the microbiome probiotics and postbiotics and prebiotics all have their place but to me they're secondary to food okay so what so what are the foods please don't say kombucha what are the what what what what what what are you right I don't like it man I get creeped out by the youtube videos where the hippie is like look at my colony oh god forbid someone offers you homegrown kombucha you're like no I'll pass thank you I don't want your mucoid jar so but what what do you what do you recommend when people you know what I was that guy about 10 years ago I was that guy but I was I was like my friends you want this scoby you want this scoby it's like he's a doctor you're a doctor you're a doctor I'm talking about like a music festival somebody like dirty feet hey man they're probably right you're making me think they were right but tell me what do you recommend they need to everybody else needs to google the picture of a scoby and what you're talking about it's pretty trippy looking but the it's this gelatinous symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast is what it is so kombucha look fermented foods like that can be a tool if you're talking about probiotic rich foods uh kombucha kefir or kefers you can do water coconut regular dairy like grass-fed organic dairy kefirs um yogurts cheeses uh all the probiotic foods have their place but also prebiotic things that's just gonna be foods with fiber in them basically fruits and vegetables mostly and and and beans if they you tolerate them some gluten-free grains if you tolerate them but mostly fruits and vegetables provide fiber which is food for the microbiome they eat what we eat and they will then ferment those fibers and make what are called short chain fatty acids which are basically needed for the human immune system and needed for our brain and and and everything in our body so um the more diverse the beneficial microbiome is the it's associated in the research to be more beneficial to us so the more diverse we can eat as far as plant foods like fruits and vegetables are a good idea and um certainly the probiotic foods have their place too and then you can supplement with prebiotics probiotics and postbiotics too like post a postbiotic would be something like supplementing with butyrate which your gut makes but you can give your body extra of it to get some added gut supportive benefits and there's one called urolithin A that is kind of newly researched it's another postbiotic but those are some foods to focus on okay so describe to me what happens when you have an overgrown untended gut garden and you start introducing probiotic prebiotic foods into your system what's going on down there what's what change is happening yeah and this is something i've really mentioned in the newest book it's one something i'm really exploring in my new book called gut feelings because it's a conversation that i'm always having with my patients this sort of bi-directional relationship between mental health and physical health and you know in the west we like to separate mental health from physical health but the reality is mental health is physical health our brains are part of our body and when you're bringing in any food changes you can notice a lot of ship especially of probiotic rich foods like kombucha or sauerkraut or kimchi these fermented vegetables if you're having too much of it it's not a good idea because it's gonna really shift your microbiome too fast you can feel like crap really easily i've noticed that i've noticed that exact thing like i get manic i'm like i'm going to take a bunch of probiotics what's the recommended dose there's no more we're gonna we're gonna bomb this gut garden with this stuff and i'm gonna feel better right away and then yeah i've noticed that i get it makes you feel weird oh yeah it's too much and it's higher some of those fermented foods are higher in histamines too so histamines are a normal part of the immune system but too much histamines your brain is actually rich with these histamine receptor sites so it can impact the way that acetylcholine and serotonin and dopamine are because of this crosstalk between your gut bugs and your brain so there it more isn't always better there there should be done judiciously to tolerance and a little goes a long way i guess is a good way of putting it okay all right i get it so but but okay so are these new the new colonies you're introducing are they taking over or is it a symbiosis are they attacking like what what is happening they pro all probiotics meaning all beneficial bacteria act as in in in a way they act as antibiotics meaning they do regulate things so even that it is in a in a way be you everybody has their own microbiome in a way it's it's kind of an experiment your own end of one experiment by having these foods especially in higher levels because everybody's microbiome is going to respond differently because everybody has different levels of different microbes of 100 trillion bacteria if you're bringing in a new thing look there's so much research around these probiotic foods and beyond research there's humans have had them for so long that they are generally well they're well tolerated and they're a healthy way to support bacterial bacterial diversity but you know that's why i would say be judicious with it because you're you're shifting you're modulating your microbiome and there's going to be a shift and you can have what's what we would generally refer to as herxheimer responses or die-off symptoms because there may be some opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria that going to release these life of polysaccharides these bacterial toxins when you are killing them off by bringing in more good guys so it's not necessarily a bad thing but i don't want you to feel horrible from eating some kimchi or sauerkraut so it's just about being smart with it so just slow and easy just a nice yeah slow and slow low and slow okay so i don't mean to i mean you're a doctor so everyone listening i'm sorry it's gross but i've been fascinated by ever since it like became popular ish fecal implants i don't know if you ever saw the south park where they were like they were trying to steal i can't remember some famous football quarterbacks shit because everybody wanted to give get there you know do is give themselves a fecal implant is this non is this really work like if you take another person's shit and put it inside side of you you you the stories are insane like suddenly people start craving different foods people want to eat more fruit people so tell me about the the data on this this is nonsense well it is a nonsense but it's not a magic cure all either so it's actually i did i talked about fecal transplants in gut feelings because it is fascinating compelling science around this again crosstalk between you take somebody that has a one microbiome and you give them someone else's it can influence so much things the way that brain the brain functions mood changes and the immune to the reason why people are doing it mainly and the people that are the the the current candidates of how it's being applied are people with very um well c diff like treatment resistant c diff c diff acille um that are having horrible gastritis digestive issues and certain auto immune issues are being explored too and they basically have for lack of better word like a very dis decimated dysregulated unhealthy microbiome and those people have tried everything and they are good the doctors have determined they were good candidates for fecal transplants um and i think the tactical term is fecal microbiota therapy fmt i think is what they call it um but we typically use the term fecal transplants so that's empty sounds so much better yes instead of a poop poop transplant yeah people like d i'm sure i don't know if you saw this but like on youtube i don't know if they've taken the videos down or not but like years back they people would do their d i y like poop in a blender and enema full on so that's not how i would advocate to do it but there's certain many hospitals i shouldn't say many there are several hospitals and mainstream medical institutions that do this for patients that are good candidates for it nfl season has come to an end but in my bookie the

that are good candidates for it is it a shit enema I mean what's how do they do it yeah that's what it is it's a fecal enema is typically how it's done I know there's certain bioengineering companies that are like tech companies that are looking and I don't know where they're at in the development of it but just like trying to get it in a pill form that would be in a capsule that's done that way but the way that it has been done in the research world and in certain clinical trials is it an enema type protocol and it's not that the caveats are it doesn't work for everybody it can cause I've seen I've heard horrible flare-ups in the negative because it's kind of it is uncertain of how you're going to respond just like a medication certain people can have side effects from it this is going to modulate your microbiome in a way that you don't always know so that's why doing it properly with a doctor is a good idea because you know what type of microbiome you're getting you're vetting and looking at the specific colonies of them and you're getting it done appropriately and I've had some patients that have had to do it and we coordinate with with every all the variables and make sure they're doing it right and it can be a game changer for people that have tried everything but it takes multiple sessions it's not just one and done like get a poop transplant and you're like a new person it can be a game changer for some people but that's rare normally it takes a series of months and even over the course of a year plus to really start to modulate their immune system in a positive way well that's disappointing I always thought if I blasted a healthy person shit up my ass I'd feel better almost instantly so the question is who would you pick if you had to pick whose microbiome would you go to my tinder propha it's right there I'm just I'm kidding I'm married but I don't know you know if I this is the kind of thing where if I was like the most disgusting mad scientist on earth I would be really interested in doing not just athletes but musicians writers artists I mean that your book the work you're doing it just forces everyone to ask the question who am I how much of what I am or what I think I am is within my control and how much of it is the bacteria inside of me and you know but the it's I think it's so unseemly uh that that you know it's it's not sad it's maybe the least I mean well to each their own but to me maybe the least sexy thing to like blast someone else's poop inside of you but the but you know the the implication behind it is bizarre it's you know you hear these stories people get heart transplants and their personality changes people you know this the connection that you were talking about earlier between one's emotional mental state and what's going on in their body it's something that I think maybe people don't want to it to really contemplate because there's an implicit sort of like who you think you are it's not quite as solid permanent and and real as you might be imagining it's might just be a reflection of this wild harmony going on inside your body well especially I think around mental health issues right especially when you're talking about things like anxiety and depression it can be very and usually we're triggering it could be very controversial to say well this may not be just a quote unquote chemical imbalance which has flimsy science at best anyways could it be something going on in your gut could it be inflammation that's that's driving your anxiety and depression it's not as accepted yet in our culture and can be offensive for someone that just thinks that's just the way that I am I I just have anxiety I just have depression right why do you have this and I think that this this these are the things that researchers are exploring and what I really I just was such a passion project to write got feelings because it's people don't have to settle for feeling lousy there's so much agency that we wield over our health if we start tending to this garden in the way that I think I've seen really work for our patients are do you are you getting pushed back like I imagine you I mean there's so much money behind SSRI's and there's so much money being made from these things even though I you know recently it was like all of a sudden it's like they don't really work like it appear and I've I've I've friends who are psychiatrists they're like yeah it's like we're finding out that like it's all that what we thought was efficient in treating depression is maybe not doing anything or barely anything or maybe actually worsening the condition by this constant like mitigation of dosage and the type of medication are you getting pushed back do you do you get slammed or attacked or do you find yourself yeah maybe I mean I don't pay much attention to it because again I'm always with patients I'm not really listening to it but I I would assume that this people and like those of us in functional medicine I mean the Cleveland Clinic has a functional medicine center center so there's the by no means fringe it's like so we are like hopefully more and more permeated within the mainstream but yeah I think we're pushing the envelope and people that tend to go through the weeds first get scraped sometimes and I'm okay with that but the reality is it's not an either or thing I mean antidepressants work for some people and if they're a tool within your toolbox that work for you then great yeah I just think there's there are many people that it just doesn't work for them what are they supposed to do so that's what I'm talking to the people that are doing everything their doctor's telling them to do and they're like dang I still feel like crap like I'm still depressed I'm still anxious what do I do well these other pieces of the puzzle may be the reason why and oftentimes they are and that's interesting that you know some researchers are looking at antidepressants maybe the way they do help some people is that they may act as a mild anti-inflammatory that it's really the mild anti-inflammatory benefit that you can get but yeah so they don't they have merit but there's just more in my opinion more effective ways to lower inflammation without the potential side effects that some of these medications have and look if you even if you look at the power of placebo I think there there are other studies that are saying well yeah they work marginally they're basically the same as placebo in most cases there's nothing wrong with that I mean that's the mind over matter right there's something good about someone believing something will work and it's shifting placebo shifting physiology I mean just like there's the no-cebo effect like people that believe the worst about things it can like kill them it's pretty crazy too so it's they have their place I'm not shaming anybody who chooses to go on them oh me either you freaking king it's in my arsenal of potential things I'll take if I get when I get depressed I yeah I hate medication shamers I say let's use all the weapons out there to try to feel better just be honest about what's working and what's not so for my friends out there on medication well you know me I love drugs so okay so so okay now this forgive me I'm sure by now you've ascertained I'm not a doctor I realized that I don't really understand what inflammation is like I've got all kinds of teas and uh supplements that claim to reduce inflammation and I happily take them but I realized what what is inflammation like I I always have thought of it is it like you're swelling up or something what can you tell me what inflammation actually is sure it's an acute inflammation can look like swelling up right if you someone like twists their ankle it swells up or like hurts their knee it can swell up that's acute inflammation and that is during an injury and there can be swelling around that that injury that acute injury and because of that inflammation is not inherently bad it's it's a part of the immune system it's it's it's needed like human beings will not be there if we didn't have healthy measured inflammation levels to fight out viruses to fight off bacteria it's a healthy inflammatory response and as I said earlier 75 of that response originates in the gut so um the the problem is when inflammation becomes chronic it's that sort of that forest fire that that is burning in perpetuity that's the issue and it's homeostasis it's like a lack of balance in the body and that's inflammation too high for too long and that chronic inflammation is associated with just about every health problem under the sun I mean autoimmune issues type 2 diabetes heart disease cancer to um brain health issues I mean anxiety depression brain fog fatigue it's called in the research the cytokine model of cognitive function cytokines are pro-inflammatory cells so it's researchers looking at how inflammation impact how our brain works so even this again when I said earlier like relegating mental health is sort of this abstract thing it's quite physiological because our brain is a part of our body just like anything else and the brain has its own immune system the old research used to think that the brain because of the blood brain barrier that nothing could get into the brain and the brain was what they would call immune privileged that like didn't have its own immune system but now we know it's not immune privileged it has what's called the micro glial cells which has it can trigger an inflammatory or neuro inflammatory response that things like anxiety and depression and brain fog and fatigue are implicated with so inflammation is an immune response and it matters to a lot of people and most people don't even know it and in with our patients we measure inflammation and work to get it down but then part of bringing it down is to ask what's causing the inflammation because inflammation is the commonality well what's causing the chronic inflammation in the first place so that's what I really get to exploring gut feelings like there's the gut and the feeling stuff there's the physiological and the psychological both matter like the physical stuff like we keep talking like we talked about like the underlying gut problems and the chronic infections like we see a lot of mold toxicity and different like chronic Lyme disease those things will impact things like anxiety and depression for many people but then the feeling stuff also will impact inflammation and I think that gets overlooked of things like chronic stress and trauma and and intergenerational trauma even will impact will raise inflammation just as much as that chorizo or cupcake what we're talking about my darlings many of you know that I moved to Texas and one of the differences between Texas and California is that unfortunately they don't have dispensaries here now that normally would have been a disaster for me but it's not thanks to our beautiful sponsor Lumi Labs and their magical micro dose gummies I've had a long relationship with THC sometimes a great relationship sometimes a terrible relationship and the terrible part inevitably happened because I ate too much now I know a lot of you are scared of edibles and you should be because sometimes you eat too much of an edible and it feels like at any second the thing from alien is going to come exploding out of your chest and have a long conversation with you about what an absolute piece of shit you are or how your friends are actually demons pretending to be your friends paranoia baby but micro dose gummies has dialed in the perfect ultimate glorious dose a micro dose even better it's legal everywhere you can fly with it I fly with it to shows it helps me sleep takes the edge off it is absolutely wonderful micro doses available nationwide to learn more about micro dosing THC go to microdose.com and use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order links can be found in the show description but again that's microdose.com code Duncan thank you micro dose can you send me more back to the show things like chronic stress and trauma and and intergenerational trauma even will will raise inflammation just as much as that chorizo or cupcake what I'm talking about yeah especially if the if the person giving you the treat oh so it's also beating beating you in the streets yeah even worse even now that's a dumb joke I'm sorry okay so uh what are the markers for inflammation like I've always thought it was this kind of like ambiguous thing I didn't even realize you could quantify it in a human so you could take someone's blood and say you're inflamed like you have crime oh yeah for sure yeah yeah that's that's that's my day job that's like Monday through Friday no way yeah it's at least your conventional tests I'll tell you about all the conventional stuff you don't even need a functional medicine doctor like yeah we can run it for you but if you even go to your pcp and ask him for these tests they can run these so high sensitivity reactive protein hscrp the american heart association the cdc uses this as a what they call a relative risk factor for heart attack and strokes that's why they're typically running but if you look at on pub med and like the nih is like studies there is so much research of hscrp c reactive protein being implicated in many different issues even things like anxiety and depression and the things that I talk about in gut feelings the and autoimmune issues I see a lot too so we want it and so does the a american heart association so does the cdc we want it to be under one hscrp and it's a simple blood draw it's a very inexpensive test for most people or insurance covers it for most people um homocysteine is another very conventional test we want homocysteine in functional medicine we want homocysteine to be optimal under seven the conventional range is going to be a little bit higher than that and I guess that's a bigger conversation of where we even get those reference ranges but right we're looking at optimal they're looking at average in in conventional medicine so we want it to be in the healthier zone under seven but above seven's been shown to act as a neurotoxin it can act as a basically this low-grade source of inflammation on the brain and it's associated with what they call it's another like creepy term but they call it leaky brain syndrome but things are passing through the blood brain barrier that shouldn't be able to pass through the blood brain barrier that is associated with neuro inflammation and then the conventional doctors are typically running homocysteine to um look at heart attack and stroke risk too so um those are just two conventional tests that pretty much anybody can get if they have access to a doctor if you spend any amount of time like contemplating cultural implications of inflammation you know like this sort of as above so below like if you know or like we're all like socioeconomic impacts on what foods we consume you know and then if this the foods we're consuming are causing inflammation the inflammation is causing mood shifts the mood shifts are causing behavior patterns have you ever considered like the the big picture of because that is where we enter into zombie invasion land you know it's not clearly i'm not i'm we're not zombies but it's if we are mostly bacteria and our foods are changing our mood then that means that the the impact of like a fucked up economy inflation all of these things it's more than just people not being able to buy eggs or milk or the things they want it would show up in the form of unrest it would show up in the form of uh crime right if you if is there any research on this sort of holistic impact of shit diets on like society as a whole there has been as far as behaviors for sure i mean people that start for example there's been studies to show that when populations that are maybe higher crime or abusive situations when they eat a more whole food diet for example anger things like anger and quantifications of anger and violence go down wow many studies that look like similarly to things like meditation sort of these mental emotional spiritual things because they lower inflammation the way that meditation and breath work and things work is because they are putting the body more into a parasympathetic state which is the resting digesting hormone balance state it's the anti-inflammatory state because cortisol what's cortisol cortisol is an endogenous immunosuppressant so it's a natural anti-inflammatory so in states of stress cortisol is coming up and in part not just to regulate blood sugar and blood pressure and like get you out of there that situation you know from an ancestral perspective but it's also attenuating calming inflammation levels so oftentimes on patients when they are super stressed or like irritated we measure inflammation and cortisol cortisol is really high inflammation is really high because cortisol is trying to calm that inflammation levels so I think about the philosophical stuff all the freaking time because I think about the cascade societally of what's going on like if everybody's feeling anxious and exhausted and wired and tired is how they explain it to me and there and I look at the labs you're going to have increased rate of things like anxiety and depression brain fog fatigue people make decisions that aren't in their best interest and they make they make decisions that are in the best interest of society as a whole so it's a massive problem but I even think like the as above so below actually that's funny that you said that in gut feelings I use that phrase that's the first chapter I don't know if you know this but like that's the first that's the first chapter of the book is as above so below because I'm thinking of the sort of this planetary problem you think of environmentally of climate change what's going on the sort of dysregulation of the planet there's physiological climate change in the form of chronic inflammation that's happening in every human being because we're intimately connected to nature but then going back to the microbiome our gut microbiome is intimately connected to our planetary soil microbiome which is also disrupted and it's this big reckoning that's happening right now in the form of dysregulation on a physical level a planetary level and socioeconomic level and a geopolitical level too it's really bizarre because you you could sort of you know I don't mean you are I get to say stuff I know you're a doctor I don't know how much you can like say talk about woo stuff or even want to but you know one one very creepy aspect of being alive today is like you can look at a bunch of different sort of eschatological predictions book of revelations some indigenous cultures and all the things they predict that would happen at the collapse of society and you know it would seem magical if you didn't know like what you're talking about but you could almost like just based on population growth technological acceleration resulting in disruptions and you know biomes across the planet you could just knowing what you're talking about you could almost set up a timeline just based on inflammation rates like it's so weird to like if this is first we must you know you have many others have this is impacting our emotions our emotions impact our actions our actions the sum total of all human action is culture civilization so you could use existing blood panels right now as some kind of bizarre metric set those like up against like social unrest and all the crazy stuff that's been happening in the world and you you might be able to show this is why it's happening it's not happening because of anything other than bad diets the diets are being are bad because it we want instant access to food that's missing the stuff we need it's really wild man as above so below it's very it's really quite trippy because the coverse of that would be if we could figure out a way to get people to reduce inflammation on a global scale it's the age of Aquarius baby have you ever thought about that you ever play around with that idea no 100% and I you know even if you think about it like even on a global level like what came first the chicken and the egg like it's it is this vicious cycle because in many ways like the things were marketed to the foods that people were fed the things were we're told to have and the the amount of sort of mind numbing FOMO inducing content people are sort of like trained to like go for these foods that don't love them back and make them it's highly addictive it's it's selling and at all the while they're really depleting and messing up the soil microbiome and messing up the environment and all of that stuff but then once that happens it sort of feeds this beast of this sort of let's say pathogenic bacteria this pathogenic microbiome that yeah causes the whole problem I would love to look at that I mean we need to do that you and I need to do this research together and just like collect like millions of people's poop and just like ask for some like high high corporate guys poop that's like messing up the environment and like Duncan Trussell from Goop hi you may have heard of Goop or Dr. Will Cole going to the browser look I'm here to collect some poop I know what you're thinking you know ask them world leaders will let us have it just get a fried dish squat down we'll be fine see ya we gotta get Putin to shit in a fried dish let's do it mission mission this is our mission Dr. Will Cole this has been a very educational and fun conversation I really appreciate your time and I cannot wait to read gut feelings because I'm telling you as someone who struggled with depression and noticed an instant change in my mood states by well through fasting but shift in diet I can't wait to see all of the research and hard work you've put in to this particular area of health because I think we're all going to benefit from it when is it coming out gut feelings gut feelings comes out March 21st and we're talking about like all the gut stuff and the feeling stuff I mean it's just again it's conversations that I have with patients all the time and I really wanted to share with people the research around stress and trauma and intergenerational trauma it's that sounds science fiction too of how trauma can be passed down through generations how it can literally be stored in ourselves okay wait you have a few more minutes to talk about that okay so this is a this is uh one of my favorite studies that I recall and I'm sure you've heard of it you expose it's a horrible study because animals are being tortured but you expose mice to I think it was cherry blossoms the smell of cherry blossoms or something some some smell while they're like I think they were shocking them it's fucking horrible mice have children expose the mice to the very the smell they've never encountered stress reaction epigenetics used to be junk science they used to say this is nonsense it doesn't translate you can't translate trauma generationally now it's being proven no no no you know your parents were your grandparents even how I don't know how far back it goes but can you tell folks a little bit about this and what's what what studies are out there yeah sure it's there's so much on like the good side and sort of the negative side too but it's called intergenerational trauma or transgenerational trauma it's something it's a section within gut feelings we're talking about it's not just that like one of the things we have patients fill out is an a score adverse childhood experience score and I talk about it at length in the book too but the higher the a score the more likely people are prone to different autoimmune issues and metabolic issues and and mental health issues a hypervigilant nervous system and it's things that we have to work on and like some of the practices that I talked about in the book like EMDR and somatic practices and breathwork and meditation and even psychedelic medicine how these things can help to sort of disentangle the that sympathetic fight or flight hypervigilant nervous system but intergenerational trauma is stuff that has passed on through your family so the research that I talk site in the book has to do with two different geopolitical occurrences one was in the or both were done in the early 20th century one was in Ukraine and we're taught you mentioned about Russia but it's it's it was Russia it was Joseph Stalin who made a had a man-made famine against the Ukrainian people and history repeating itself of just like this sort of subjugation anytime the Ukrainian people wanted to have independence they were subjugated and he did Joseph Stalin did this in the 1920s of this basically starved and like mass genocide of the Ukrainian people and researchers generations later found that this these methylation or genetic expressions passed on one two three generations down literally being expressed expressed in their descendants of the sort of genetic epigenetic heirloom if you will being passed on and same research being done in the Holocaust survivors descendants as well and that's again it's heavy stuff but it's just as trauma can be inherited and just as trauma can be stored in your body so can healing and I see see people breaking the chains of dis-ease and dysfunction all the time and healing not just themselves but their children and their children's children and generations don't ever get to see so while it's heavy we know that you can actually shift your biochemistry and shift your genetic expression and pass it along and break the chains wow it's so that stuff is so weird now before you mention the negative side I honestly I've only heard the negative side of epigenetic or genetic trauma what are you saying that positive like I don't know positive experiences I'm trying to think about the opposite of trauma is like can be can also be passed out well yeah I mean health can I mean the healthier microbiome is the healthier that the healthier you are when you the couple that I'm talking the proverbial couple that I'm talking about the healthier you they both are when they conceive and their the baby is growing in the mother's womb the healthier the healthiest that baby's gonna be so I see this all the time with my patients like them and their partner getting super healthy they came from really shitty backgrounds but they're getting themselves very healthy so they can have their kids have the best shot at it not we all have junk we're all gonna come in with some messiness and that's okay but there's a lot that we can undo by the choices we make in our life so this isn't a message of man I'm screwed because let's like my great grandmother went through this horrible trauma it's like no what can I do today start moving the needle for myself but also really shifting things from my family I feel like you're telling me that I should not be arguing with my pregnant wife about the interior design decisions that she's making because it'll impact our baby yeah yes leave her alone no I'm not once I realize that's the answer everything got better right away um yeah okay this has been a really enlightening conversation doctor I really appreciate it if folks wanted to connect with your clinic is it can anyone just work with work with your clinic where do we find you yeah everything's at drwocoll.com that's d-r-w-i-l-l-c-o-l-e.com they tell a health clinic information's there gut feelings the pre-order for the

Why did I go there? It was a long time dream And I've always kind of lived A little bit like that where I come up with these visions These dreams and then try to Find a way to make them happen Maybe I had a friend who went and worked on there Once he went, in my mind I was like, okay, it's possible now Once I knew someone Previous to that, I'd seen just like Werner Herzog Documentary, read a little bit about Shackleton Who's one of the most badass People in history Can you talk about Shackleton a little bit? Shackleton is one of the true heroes Of the Early explorative days In Antarctic history He led a few missions, he went to Antarctica A couple of times Most of them failed Including the most famous one Where he went in an attempt to Traverse Antarctica It was in 1911 1908 And they got stuck on the ice for two years And they never made it to Antarctica It was like a crew of 64 people The ice came around And Frozen the boat in the water And they got stuck there So what did they do For two years? I mean, past the time I don't know Two years They celebrated Christmas dinners Down there They were hunting for seal They did have their supplies Their rations But eventually those started to run out The ice was slowly crushing the ship To the point where eventually then They realized we have to abandon the ship And just take the row boats And now sort of try to Field some It's like Miraculous escape And they were able to do it 64 crew members And not a single one died How did they escape? They slowly made their way across the ice At times having to get in the boats And sort of sail And then drag them And then sail drag them And they knew with their maps That there was an island of South Georgia And And they thought If we can get to that island we have a chance Because there's on the opposite side of this island There's a little outpost And So they They didn't know It was kind of like blind sailing And I think Worley, I think was the name of the captain Who was the navigator I mean You couldn't He just knocked it out the park basically In terms of navigation And sailed them Through horrible storms I mean that part of the world gets The waters are frightening The waters so ice cold They're freezing to death basically They have no water, you can't drink Isn't that water so cold that if you fall in you're dead Within 10 minutes you're like Hypothermic And they had no drinking water They finally What were they drinking? Nothing They had Some melted ice that they had But that ran out And so the first thing The image, because there's all these diaries that were kept And the first thing they did when they landed On the island was there was a waterfall And they all just went and ran up to it And it was just trickling down And they just put their lips to the rock To taste the rock Can you imagine What's going through your mind Month 3 Into being trapped In Antarctica You've got your wife, a lot of those guys had Like girlfriends They knew what they were doing They knew they were going into A expedition where Death was There was likelihood of death Or not, yeah That their technology didn't really Suit them for that Place The clothing they had Was fairly ridiculous Not barely waterproof Or anything like this How much did they know about Antarctica? No one had stepped foot on Antarctica Until 1904 Or 1904 Or 1902 But no one had even seen it until 1890 something They just know there's a big Mass of ice up there But it's unknown There's so much of it that was this unknown territory And most of it was being Motivated by this sort of Arbitrary goal Of reaching the South Pole Which is The axis of the earth So it's got significance in that respect But other than that, it's just a place Are you familiar with Hollow Earth theory at all? No See, this is kind of interesting And it's one of my favorite conspiracy theories Obviously I don't believe in it But I don't think you need to believe in a conspiracy theory To really enjoy it But the concept is that So At the poles There is a portal Or like an entryway Into the inner depths of the earth Where there's actually another earth Underneath us And it's tropical down there It's somehow Heated by this It's heated by some kind of Luminance Luminous I don't know what, there's theories about how it's heated But there's all these interesting stories About people Who get up that way And see some weird shit You hear about people seeing weird stuff up there There's a story of a German Summarine commander Who took his submarine Into some kind of subterranean cavern And like Came out of the water Into a cave Where there were mammoths Weird stuff like that All these prehistoric creatures Fled into the interior of the earth So Antarctica in that part of the world Is a fascinating place Even if it isn't an entryway into a place Where there's still mammals That used to be tropical Yeah, once upon a time And there's landmass actually beneath the ice 9300 feet of ice At the south pole Can I also tell you what is physically Beneath the south pole My last night Because I was working at the south pole station And I stared at the south pole every day And It was phenomenal, it's a flat Nothing in place, but in the last night We go out Led this mission There's a metal marker That actually marks The south pole and it moves every year Because the ice is sliding But we go out to it and he pulls it up out of the ground And He had stashed a joint there So there's Why that? So that joint Was charged The energy of the entire planet That's got to be Some kind of energy conduit That's got to be some kind of Was it a quote? Tell me what it was like to smoke a joint That had been seeded By the energies of the pole It was exciting It was an I would go out there On a regular basis Because I was there as the breakfast cook At the south pole station I was making breakfast for 250 people As part of a larger kitchen crew That sounds incredibly stressful I'm not a chef How did you get the job? I said I had cooked in I had done A little bit of cooking So I guess based on what you're saying There's not a lot of people in line To cook breakfast in Antarctica I got lucky I couldn't believe how easy it was For me personally After years of thinking about going there To try to get myself to Antarctica And the best way was to work through For the United States Antarctic program It was a government job I have even awarded a medal from congress It's kind of cool in that respect I actually feel good about that That is really cool I don't know Now you're the only person I know has a medal from congress What is the process In applying for this job? Tell me from the very beginning Something clicks inside of you You're ready to make this leap To go to Antarctica You do have to physically qualify Which I thought was going to be A pretty good title Of like okay I'm fit I'm in good shape I've got my go to the dentist Make sure you don't have any cavities Think about the headache If you have any of that stuff go wrong Down there they have to fly you out There are medical staff on hand They're trying to avoid everything I thought showing up in Antarctica Was going to be part of this Fairly fit crew of people It's amazing How not true that was Some people Not very in shape What do you mean just There's obese people out there Antarctica is about 80% obese Really? No But there were some big boys and girls It seems dangerous to be a big boy But there's also some big boy jobs Down there that Most of it is Maintaining this Insane It's inhospitable It's a station in the middle of somewhere That no one should be What are they studying? Specifically at the South Pole They're using radio telescopes To map the universe Using light that's like Left over from the Big Bang It's about light that's 400,000 years old After the Big Bang It's been traveling Through the universe for about 13 billion years I do indeed That is crazy to think There's some crazy What do they look like? What are the gauges? They look like a sort of giant satellite And they're not visual They're not visual light telescopes So you're not zooming in on a star And seeing this beautiful nebula Electromagnetism It's just microwaves And that's what light is Right? It's just like the most Sensitive camera in the world That's detecting the tiniest Faintest microwaves Left over from the Big Bang That are Like traveling through the universe And as that light would bend Around galaxies And stuff They can detect that So they can create a map Of the universe Even I was like I would go to the telescope after work And try to get this explained And still doesn't quite make sense But They could create this sort of And the map looks like Green dots Clusters Almost like static But what those clumps are Clusters are galaxies And Huge But that's only also looking at like Temperature on the sky Universe man It's insane And it's insane that they're these kind of Cosmological wizards Who have Become so interested In what the universe is That they've created an entire Essentially a temple to science In one of the most inhospitable Parts of the world So that they could study the first The first I guess Breath The first breath of creation They're up there studying the very first Exhalation of Matter Trying to find if there was any sort of Pattern or any sort of Like structure behind how All this was formed And on a personal level A lot of these guys were the same age And that was the part that for me Was You know, I mean I dealt with that in my own ways Go back to my room and cry Because I'm cooking the breakfast And had committed their lives to this Science and this pursuit of Oh, you felt that there was some kind of hierarchy there No, not even a hierarchy But I was inspired by them And felt like, wow, you know I've been trying to chase these different little Physical pleasures in my life And trying to You know, have fun, go to shows And whatever, whatever Go to the beach Meanwhile, these guys are just Probably locked themselves up in A classroom or study hall For 15, 20 years And now I was paying off Because they're part of this sort of International science project To map The light From the Big Bang And how the universe was formed I mean, it's fascinating Yeah, it really is, but I don't think you should be so hard on yourself I think people are You know, man, like that thing Where you're You look at these brilliant Scientists studying Microwaves In the South Pole And then you look at your own Personal life Of what you seem to consider to be Edenism to some degree Self gratification And you think, ah, man What have I done? All this time I could have been Locked up in a classroom Learning how to peer into the heart of the universe Into the lifeless Empty Dead Inexplicable Part of the universe If you were sending people To a planet To explore the experience of existence And they were all getting different assignments True. I have a feeling the people Whose job it was to sit in the coldest Fucking place on earth staring at Microwave signals, if that's their mission They're gonna be jealous of the guys Who got sent to the same dimension To experience orgasm True. Great beers Incredibly good times You know, it's all Isn't it weird though how there's this like Hierarchy of experience or like There's certain experiences which are considered mundane Pedestrian And somehow unimportant Which is generally the experience of like Getting high, going to a bar Playing video games, having sex Enjoying walks Going to barbecues Somehow that Is less of an exploration Than exploring the deep In a recess in the universe Of existence at all. It seems like it's all A worthy exploration, isn't it? I agree. I mean ultimately And yeah Ultimately it's like this way I feel We Have been given this Window into this to be able to be Alive, okay, regardless of what it is Uh How real it is or whatever We're here and we have the ability To observe and we have the ability To have curiosity and so I guess no matter what direction you Explore that in, whether it's to The far reaches of our limitless universe Or into The interior, the far reaches of The mind and whatever It doesn't matter. There's no such Wrong way to be alive As long as you are Think, like this is what I personally think As long as you're actively exploring And staying curious, my friends Yeah Yeah, I don't know That's kind of what's marked my own life And led a lot of the decisions that I've made in my experience To try to Just to try to Take a sip from every glass or whatever I don't know, I mean Yeah, I mean there's certain things I'm like Okay, I'm not gonna do that, but at the same time I don't know, that's what I think, so Ultimately I guess yeah, I don't actually feel that Sorry for myself for being the breakfast cook Or whatever like that, but Because without the goddamn breakfast cook Those nerds aren't going to be able To survive long enough To stir their best stupid microwave Man, by the way I'm obviously joking about that I consider those people to be kind of Some, to me those are the magicians Or those are the wizards And what they're working with With science, which to me it might as well be magic Because I don't understand it At all, and I don't really I'm not drawn into the deeper Understandings of things like that I just trust that those people When they articulate what they're picking up That It's real, and it does seem so Fantastic That to me it's So many people For whatever reason Feel like science and god Can't really get along That There can't, that Conceptualization Of a Higher intelligence That breathed all of this creation Out It can be made To apply to science, but that Application is always wrong And that application is Plugging in a primitive, archaic Paradigm Into a brand new paradigm And the two Can't go together, but I just can't disagree That more, I think that If god represents If you look at the old descriptions Of god, there are always things like The highest of the high The In a supreme dream The supreme dream In the Hare Krishna's call it Bhagavan, I believe Which means The greatest of all things, so the most Attractive, the most intelligent The most beautiful, the most perfect And everything is An emanation from That Thing that they call the godhead And so Those scientists They're peering into The godhead They're peering into This inexplicable Energy burst And within it All information All data, they're recording That initial exhalation Of all data Into time And how is that not god? Isn't that god too? Why can't you worship data? Why can't I worship the sum total of all data? People do, people already are Yeah I was inspired by their work And I was there in the summer Okay, here's the other thing I was in there in the summer, it's population 250 while I was there Four months, it's light the entire time Weird So you don't see the night time, the sun just Does spirals in the sky I would start my day at 2.30 in the morning Walk out of my little hut And just get full blasted Sunshine Every day is like you are leaving a rave Yeah And there were good parties Down there too People are cutting loose Down there, especially the scientists This is their chance to be in the field And enjoy The fruits of the present What kind of intoxicants are they taking? A lot of alcohol A lot of alcohol And that's because a lot of alcohol Is government subsidized So it used to be $10 For a bottle of any booze And then slowly, the year I was there It was $30 Anyway, big parties on the weekend Dance parties, scientists cutting You know, cutting loose Dancing into the late hours People passing out around the station And a lot of people are pumping Yes, free condoms in every bathroom At the South Pole, in Antarctica basically Any US base, because they know What's going on, it's a small Isolated population People are fucking And how do you deal with that Such a small population Aren't people jealous of each other There's horror stories Of relationships gone to shit Full couple swaps In the course of a winter Because the winter Specifically at the South Pole The winter is eight months Six of those months are in complete darkness So it's the opposite of the summer And during that six months Things go a little squirrely So there's stories of I mean Things go a little squirrely In the six months of darkness It sounds like the Beginning of What you just said, it feels like It should be followed by a story Involving vampires Like ice vampires That's where they I mean, they talk about Things like that They talk about things like that My first day on the ice When you're there, it's called the ice My first day on the ice, my boss And his assistant Without being Solicited, they mentioned the graze What they say about the graze They said don't fuck the graze You can make love to anyone on the base But the graze They're very jealous Because they're going to get weird on you Don't fuck the graze Yeah, definitely don't do that No, they just said You won't see them much in the summer Because they mostly come out in the winter And both of them had done winters I had one small experience With sort of an unknown Element And there was a couple there They said they were from Colorado I mean, this is absolutely true From my perspective of experience They were working in the kitchen I love them They were great, good people But they said they were from Colorado But they had these accents That were bullshit You know what I mean? That's not a Colorado accent If anything, it sounded like From Spain or I don't know Something was off And There were a couple Three years they'd waited to come down to Antarctica Antithesis is my experience where I applied And suddenly a week later I had the job So they waited three years And they were working as dishwashers Who waits three years to become a dishwasher? Okay, whatever That's another point One day they're in the Dish pit and I'm Taking in some dishes from breakfast Whatever And I walk in on them having a conversation And it was I'm not joking, they were speaking in a language That was not English It was not Spanish And I just didn't recognize it It sounded Digital, truly! Can you imitate it a little bit? Can you try to do it? I mean I'm gonna Just give it a shot I swear So they're doing clicks Yeah, there was like little clicks And just like I said, digital sounds Okay, and The way I walked in Is the female Kind of part She had her back to me She couldn't see me She was the one talking Her husband Was kind of at an angle Towards me Face of me So he eventually saw me out of the corner of his eye And she's still talking In this language And eventually he looks at me He sees me and he looks at her And just says, stop What? He said stop Holy shit What do you think that was? I have no clue No clue You connect it with the gray thing The gray thing was mostly fun You know, it was fun to like Point around, we'd sit there I would sit there with one of my co-workers And we'd point out who do you think is the gray So the concept is that Some of the people Working in that Station could have been aliens Or They're Exactly, for some other reason And that's some kind of spy language That they're speaking Could be I kind of would keep my eye on what they would do With their free time With their free time around the station Because there's parts of the station That you can explore Each person kind of carves out the world That they want to inhabit while they're at the station So for me, it was a lot of walking outside Taking in the actual Antarctic landscape Going to check out the science With them, I don't know They kind of stuck to themselves a little bit Kind of fairly quiet They were great, like I said, they were great And I did start Like a little Rumor That I had heard all this And that I had a thought That maybe they were aliens Or something like this, you know Did you get any blowback from that? I did, eventually Last week there at the station It's like any place where At the end of the season, a couple big parties People open up about everything And she goes She goes, you think I'm an alien? And I was like, hey I don't know I just don't know Yeah, I heard you Remember that day in the dispatch? She was like, yeah I don't know What are the cliques? Did you ask her what the cliques were? I don't know Because you know what ended up happening instead? We were all drinking In some symbolic gesture This obviously doesn't do anything But it's a cool story We expressed how much we really Just ultimately liked each other And working with each other And her and her husband and me We all leaned in and tried kissed So I was in my mind I always pretend that I Made out with a couple aliens You Made out You had The kinkiest Makeout session That's the oddest make out Now that is the strangest Makeout session Perhaps I would guess That day on planet earth If there was a way To scan and say bring up the top three Strangest make out sessions that happened today In this 24 hour period Yours would be number one It feels like a privilege to be in that group A human made out with a male And female alien In a base in the north pole And found in some kind of way In that moment perhaps you Unity, connection To the whole universe In that moment it was You don't even know When everything was teetering in the balance You could have created an alliance With some race that Yeah Listen man, you know, that's what That's the funny thing about hollow earth theory Because you are not clearly the people That they know about this You do know that a lot of people say The UFOs and the grays don't come from outer space But they come from within the interior Yeah And this is the, so the mythology is There's all these stories Of these subterranean beings That, you know Dwarfs Creatures that live under the earth They're in all kinds of mythologies And Many people say That there is a race Of beings That live within the core of the earth And that it's actually kind of strange That We as humans have decided to live On the outside of the spaceship Right And that the fact that we have decided To make camp on the outside of the spaceship Is Not something that happens In other planets So Because other advanced Species after Infinite catastrophes Involving Meteor impacts Realized that to truly build A lasting civilization You can't do it on the surface Of any planet because Those planets are always being smashed To pieces by meteorites So you gotta go inside So Mars Pluto Venus, all these planets Are just the exterior shells Of these spaces And they're just watching us thinking Fucking idiots Yeah, they're watching us Maybe they'll figure it out Yeah Of course, again man Earth is incredible, we have the beach Yeah, we have the beach, we have the mounds We have so many varied landscapes Even here in the United States The more I travel The more I realize that We essentially have From a landscape perspective We have everything you would ever want From other parts of the world Oh, you mean the United States? What we have, it's so crazy That we have that I was in the Olympic Peninsula last weekend Up in Washington State It's a rainforest That centers around Mount Olympus But it's big, so it's a peninsula So there's coastline all along the exterior It's a beautiful part of the country It's pristine, it's Fairly empty, there's not much Many people living up there, it's nice to know That these places still exist We were in a small little fishing village In LaPouche And then there's beach camping You hike in three-quarters mile And that night we were camping And it was a new moon So there's no moon, but also It's the Pacific Northwest of the Olympic Peninsula It was completely fogged over So you couldn't see a single cloud I mean you couldn't see a single star You couldn't see the moon So there was no light We had a little beach fire going Just perfectly It made no sense to us because there was no light So we get up, we walk closer to the beach And we realize it was phosphorescent Waves that It was bioluminescence in the water And every time it was churned up It would essentially create That energy that would create the bioluminescence To light up So we watched these waves Just crash and create these little Green lines Of light down the whole coastline Wow Man, that is so... You are a traveler You don't stick... You've made this decision You're not going to get caught up In any kind of single pattern You're always doing things like that While I'm inside With the home of the air conditioner And the binding of Isaac The video game I'm currently addicted to iTunes, Netflix Game of Thrones Which is a portal to anywhere that you want to go Well, yeah, but it doesn't There's no, as far as I'm aware Bioluminescent waves That I can watch it I'm not making out with aliens in there yet Yeah But you are someone Who's done this thing Where you've decided To plunge Into the energy of life And you You're an adventure When I was 16 years old I'd been studying Chinese in high school And then Again, someone before me At the school went to China for a year And it's not an exchange program It's just you go to A little school year abroad And that opened my eyes And I went to China at 16 I only did a semester because I didn't want to go too far When I was young So six months in Beijing And the first time I'd Been exposed to other culture And everything And in that six months I learned more about Not only the world, but myself And everything Meanwhile, just taking an incredible New array of sights and sounds And flavors, whatever And Made great friendships For that time You're always making friends I realized immediately that My true education was going to be defined Through travel So then it became this hunger To go explore as many places Because the more I started to travel, the more I realized There is no one right way To live It's what we have Our greatest Characteristic as a species Is our diversity, truly In the way that We started Studying social anthropology At college as well And that kind of Reinforced that Because you started learning about Ethnographic societies that Experienced the world with sight I mean smell as their primary sense As opposed to sight Or you know Yeah, all these There was a group of people In South America that believe Humans are real Body form as a snake And we take We put on like a body To experience this world, but as our spiritual form It's like you It's like almost like you zipper down the Front of your face and peel out of the skin And you're a snake I want to ask you your opinion on this I'm reading right now this Great, I'm really enjoying this book By Sam Harris called Waking Up Sam Harris is, I haven't finished the book yet So if I say things that he That he doesn't That he says later on, I'm sorry For those of you who are big Sam Harris fans And I know a lot of you are He Talks about The idea that certain Religions, most religions Christianity Islam About theosophy Madame Blotovsky He talks about a lot of these Very esoteric Metaphysical systems As though They are kind of impediments To a person's Discovery of truth So a person who believes That he has a snake inside Of him And I'm sorry, I don't mean to speak for Sam Harris I might I don't know what he would say about that person Necessarily, but I think Maybe you could, it would be safe to say That Dawkins, someone like Richard Dawkins Would say That's a bunch of superstitious bullshit There is no snake Inside of you my friend You're a person with bones And cells and a spine And though it's quaint and cute That you believe there's a snake inside of you The reality of the situation is That belief in the long run Is impeding you From achieving the kind of Health Perhaps longevity Or The ability Or technology that can only be Obtained From coming into direct contact With quantifiable truth So when you say Diversity Is the most important thing The most beautiful thing How would you respond to the concept That this diversity Is much of this diversity Is made up of Superstitious thought patterns That are completely Unverifiable and have no basis In reality Well, who's reality first? Okay, reality is this Is what you make of it In a way, or you choose truth Is you're making those choices all the time To live in what the world you want to live From my perspective, when I think about that And those two very different Points of view, I think first of all How lucky I am to be able to sit here And know that both exist And make my own conscious decision about Which one I think is valid or Choose in my life when I want those points to be valid But outside of that I I, it makes me happy To know that There were people Who were existing in their own Slave community, where that's How they found meaning It doesn't matter, it like What are we chasing? What does Richard Dawkins want? What's his end game goal? I don't know what he wants, but I can Guess what he doesn't want And what he doesn't want Is the people who believe That there's snakes inside of them Or the people who believe That their god Telling them that Homosexuality is evil Or the people who are saying From time to time You need to put on dynamite And walk into cafes for the lord I know that Dawkins And I'm pretty sure Harris Don't want those people To have any kind of Political power Because if they do They fuck shit up And if you look at the age of faith And the breaks that were put on Human evolution by the Catholic Church, the Christian Community, they went from being These kind of quaint Interesting sweeties And I don't mean the Christian community The fundamentalists, because the Christian Community is its own diverse wild beast But the fundamentalists Went from being what they currently Are, they went from being Rather they went from being Essentially like if there is a Satan In the hand of Lucifer on earth They became the The wall That got in the way Of the great thinkers, they killed a lot Of the greatest thinkers, in the same way ISIS is demolishing Ancient temples in Syria In the same way that ISIS is throwing gay people Off of roofs And I know there are very small cluster of people That have probably been inflated in danger By the media, but still they exist That's what It used to be like Everywhere Which was that you would get burned at the stake Tortured, executed, and destroyed For your beliefs Because many of these religions Which in small microdoses And thought patterns seem very quaint And cool And you can really dig your teeth into And think, man, I can see I'm a snake If that expands Too much and becomes a dominant Paradigm Then the end result is The complete slowdown If not stopping Of technological progress And technological progress Holds within it the key For human beings To migrate into space And populate Now, by the way, what I did I have played devil's advocate there Because I don't know From two perspectives, it's like The great question is Here As population grows And its access to technology Becomes As technology becomes increasingly accessible To larger portions of the Human population Then what that means is That It becomes increasingly dangerous For people who believe In things like Angry Jehovah God I don't know about the snake people I don't even mean to bash them, man I'm just using them as a point It becomes increasingly dangerous What are we going to do When you can 3D print A fucking bio weapons laboratory What are you going to do When you're able to somehow create some kind of like When you're able to This is what I think I think the biggest lesson That we need to teach our future generations Is that Very simple concept That there is no one way To do things And I heard a 4 year old child Say this the other day He was playing with a friend And a friend was trying to build some blocks And the kid was struggling And so this boy came over 4 years old And he's like, hey, let me show you The way to do this And I was like, dude, the future Okay, there's some hope There's a chance I don't know I'm constantly conflicted with our current State Of things going on in the world I sit and Kind of think about this And have existential crisis all the time Because I'm not sure if this is the most exciting time Where it's like finally People are starting to Be able to recognize The folly and so many of the decisions Of our societal structure Especially western society For the last 500 years Or, you know, there's that view Or just think Fuck, the population is too big The people who did Begin the kind of clutch of power 500 years ago have now gone to A place where they control so much Beyond what we even know It's always Mind blowing to think about What we don't know in terms of Decisions that are actually being made on a day-to-day basis To run the world And think, okay, we're fucked There's no way So what are you supposed to do in the meantime? I don't know, I think all you can do is just focus on In your own world, I hear that The kids say that Or think about people Starting to maybe come back to Our earth and be like, oh, let's treat it a little bit better Or whatever like that and awareness for That and I think, okay Just live small And slowly Maybe they'll make A difference or something like that Yeah, I think you're right But it's so funny because when I think You make a personal decision Your first thing that you Mentioned with a 3D printer Is bio warfare Oh, yeah I mean, I guess that's a Realistic look at the world Here's the problem So the problem is this The technology Is an amplification device And the way it amplifies things Is like any other amplifier It can amplify The lectures of Ram Dass Or Jack Cornfield Or Gandhi Or it can amplify The YouTube comments Of Derek7964 Who wants to leave comments In every single video About how the person who posted the video Is A faggot And deserves to die You know what I mean? Now if you look And see, now I think YouTube comments As much as people decry them I think they're a fantastic way To understand The problem Of technology Because when you see an angry YouTube comment Written by a racist homophobe Maybe a 12 year old Maybe a 30 year old Filled with violence and just Pure deep sizzling Anger Essentially like putting a Stethoscope to the wall Of hell and hearing the moans Of the damned That's what YouTube comments remind me of I think if you were in hell Walking through hell You wouldn't hear people crying for help You would hear people saying You stupid fat shit Get the fuck away from me you stupid fat fuck You fucking shit fuck I think that's what you'd hear mostly in hell You wouldn't hear oh god please help me You just hear The lashing The lashing out of the damned Sure So when you Read YouTube comments We got one DJ Doug Pound And I And now J. Wang are as well We have a show called And we make videos for it And thank you On one of the videos Someone just said Eric why would you want to be faggots And I'm just like What is that coming from Well it's coming from pain It's coming from a deep Because you have to put yourself In the position Of a person leaving The comment And you also have to analyze So every time you Read a shitty comment It gives you a tiny Penprick of sadness You do feel bad Little bad maybe a lot bad It'll get to you but there's an initial It doesn't feel good No matter how advanced you want to be It still sucks So that's one little pixel of suffering That that person has generated on earth Now if you take the sum Total of all shit Comments being posted per second On this planet Then you can see that technology Is not only creating wonderful This entertainment and knowledge But it's also Generating a pretty Steady rate of toxic Emotional pain And it's probably For all the good it's doing You could say it's there's an equivalent Hopefully not equivalent But potentially equivalent amount of bad That's happening simultaneous And the problem with that is that Because of what Kurzweil calls The law of accelerating returns Those two sides are going To amplify their energy Is going to increase and increase and increase As we move Into the future And so what that means is that idiots Are no longer going to just be using youtube comments As a means to spread Their poison into the world But they are going to adopt Or they are going to use Any technology that they can Or anything that you give an angry person That person will use it to hurt If I give an angry person A pen The angry person within a certain amount of time Is going to write a shitty note to somebody About how they suck If I give an angry person a gun Depending on how angry they are There is a very high probability That angry person is going to use that tool To kill a person If I give an angry person Access To the entire Mind of the planet Anything they want to all of humanity To be recorded eternally In the digital transcript That is being created thanks to The growth of technology They will use that to imprint Not some beautiful thing But to permanently imprint A tiny poisonous Thorn Which will last as long as there is a planet Or as long as there is hard drives These curses and thorns I have heard you talk about the curses before How awful they are So I don't know what I am getting I don't mean to get so dire But the point I am getting at Is the next thing down the line And the next thing down the line Is going to be increasingly powerful When these shitheads Get a hold of it They are going to use it To wreak havoc Stupidity is Equally as big as an amplifier Where does that come from That comes from pain Not only pain But it also comes from Regardless of Whether it is temporary or permanent A very narrow View at life And maybe that is from the pain Pain has a way of Bringing everything down Into this little one tunnel Of vision and that is all you want to feel And You are blind Into all this incredible Positive energy that is around you So Personally This is how I deal with that And how I deal with people who are doing these insane things Around the world Killing people Creating Making people feel bad for just trying to express themselves In whatever way they feel Happy Happiness is whatever It is bullshit in some respects You think so? It is a shallow pursuit Happiness Because it ignores pain You have to accept pain As part of your daily process I think that sometimes If you really analyze pain You realize that it is actually making you happy too Absolutely I have been going through that quite a bit lately How so? I find myself That sometimes I like being Addicted to painful scenarios Because then it gives me something To brood about Or to think about And then when something in that situation changes Slightly better Then it creates this ephoric sense Of delusional sense That things are going to be great Like the wave form You are sort of getting off on the wave form Of course The story of Most of our cultures Is about riding that wave Between Happiness and pain We like watching people fall and rise And come up over again Because it reminds us of parts of our own day to day life Right But ultimately some people do feel more pain than not But you have to understand That is a voice That is one voice Our population is 7,000 people Let's think about the populations of people Who exist outside of ourselves Whether it be other Animals or plants on this planet Or People outside of Earth Everyone in that universe Is experiencing Some sort of level From pain to ecstasy And so At that point in your life You are going to feel every one of the motions That is in that range And so When I see people just crying out In such Like Terrible Agony or suffering And it just reminds me That hey That is okay, been there And I have a choice To either inhabit that space Or put more positive energy into the world That is how I personally go about my life Because I find that I enjoy myself more I enjoy the people around me more I enjoy this planet more when I am putting positive energy into the world It is that simple It is that simple ultimately It is that simple And it is just God Such a waste of time So it is a And I am sorry guys I have to always say Ramdas says Because he does say and I don't want to see him Like I am lifting his brilliant idea Which is that We Exist on a lot of different levels at once I just read this great essay by him actually Where he is talking about When you are playing Monopoly On one level Your friends Play a Monopoly Like hey let's hang out and play Monopoly It will be a blast Being friends You are vicious enemies trying to fuck each other over In the most extreme way And these two things are happening at once And if you remove The vicious enemies Or if you move the competitive aspect of Monopoly And it is not just happy competitive It is generally a kind of mean Competitive capitalist That is part of the fun of the game right So if you remove that Then it is not that fun to play You almost need both of those levels Functioning at the same time for it to be fun I don't want to have A friendly game of Monopoly I am sorry That is the most boring thing you could do I want to cutthroat Vicious Mean spirited Unhappy Poisonous game of Monopoly After the game you kind of have to like Me and my brother and my dad When we played Monopoly We actually had A dollar of shame And whoever won Could say right whatever Statement they wanted on the dollar bill And whoever lost had to sign Underneath the statement The bill is filled With things like my dad saying Like I am the greatest father That has ever lived You know like something like that We have to sign it but that is part of the fun So When we are On this planet You have You get to decide Which of these games you want to play Right Do you want to play the game of being the depressed Angry, unhappy, bitter, jaded victim Or do you want to play the game Of being an expansion Of the most beautiful Perfect, incredible Ever-amplifying Harmonized energy That has ever existed All that does exist Do you want to let that be the wind in your sails Or will the wind in your sails be A kind of zombie like Dull movement In the direction of fleeting temporary pleasure Generated from causing Your fellow human beings Pain I mean it's a no brainer for me It's been a no brainer for a long time I don't know why I feel like I had a lot of people growing up who were like Wow you know that already And I'm like what are you talking about How do you not figure that out Well some people fall asleep When I think about when I've been a true Cunt in the world In the times that I find myself Being a cunt When mindfulness comes back And I'm able to look at what I've done Or how I acted It appears that I've gone to sleep It appears that I've gone into a very Congealed State where I'm rushing From meaningless point To meaningless point A lot of people in hell Are always in a hurry To get to the worst part of hell It's like people In hell I guarantee there would be Long lines of angry people Waiting to try to get to certain Fire pits That are worse than the ones they were in That sounds like a perfect description of Los Angeles as well The interesting The thing that I've been playing around with Lately It all comes from that incredible And I'm going to mispronounce it again I got corrected by a lot of people last time I said this but there's this thing called The Emerald Tablet of Try I'm not going to mispronounce it this time Thanks for correcting me you guys There's this This thing called the Emerald Tablet of Trimest Trimestiges I was saying Trimestigeries The Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trimestiges Which is this alchemical Text That is very simple It's very simple It's just a few lines Let's see if I can find it Really short But the first part of it is True without error Certain and most true That which is above Is as that which is below And that which is below Is as that which is above To perform the miracles of the one thing I'll read the whole thing Why don't we read the whole fucking thing By the mediation of one So from this one thing came all things By adaptation Its father is the son Its mother is the moon The wind carried it in its belly The nurse thereof is the earth It is the father of all perfection In the consummation of the whole world Its power is integral If it be turned to earth Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire The subtle from the course Gently and with much ingenuity And descends again to earth And receives the power of the superiors And the inferiors Thus thou hast the glory of the whole world Therefore let all obscurity Flee before thee This is the strong fortitude of all fortitude Overcoming every subtle And penetrating every solid thing Thus the world was created Hence are all wonderful adaptations Of which this is the manner Therefore, am I called Hermes, the thrice great Having the three parts of the philosophy Of the whole world That is finished, which I have to say Concerning the operation of the sun That last part is kind of like a He's like a rapper Like what's thrice great He had to like He gave himself props at the end real quick Like he says all these brilliant things at the end He's like, I'm not great once Motherfucker, I've been great Three times, whatever that means But I've been thinking a lot about the That which is As above so below And I've been thinking about how I, and most people I know Want love We want to be loved We want to be loved so bad And when we're being loved We feel complete When love is happening we feel so good And so complete and like we're getting this incredible Sustenance, this food We're like Shackledon's men When love comes Lapping at the waterfall And drinking it up as though we've been Out in the ice forever So if you consider As above so below And imagine that that is within us And then just as a thought experiment Imagine that that is a Desire not just in humans But in all things That the entire world The entire universe and we're part of the fabric Of the universe is longing For this love And then you start Instead of trying to Pull that love to you Start giving it not just to the people Around you but to every single Moment as though All things were some super entity And you had been called here just to Love it Then that shifts you from one frequency To another Instantaneously And all of a sudden you look around And you think about the words of all David Jesus Christ Who said the kingdom of heaven is at hand It's here right now Of course Around you all the time You are truly in heaven The only thing keeping you from it Is the fact that you keep trying To suck Love from the world Instead of breathing love out Well when I've been truly in love In my personal life I find that What I Know about it most is it actually makes me Be expressive Towards other people In the world around me in a loveful way Like when you see someone who's truly in love They walk into a room And they are Beyond happy They are there Like an open Book Or cup or whatever ready to just sort of Drink in their environment Open window When you look into it you can see Heaven And that Creates Other openings and other windows And then before you know it There's no more windows It's just all heaven And then that's when you start experiencing Those crazy synchronicities I think I've told you this story before But it works perfectly about this Because the opposite of that when you're not in love Like we said you're closing your world down And you're seeing this such a narrow View and you're creating paint You're eating yourself up from the inside out Right? I had come back from Africa Ethiopia was the first time I traveled to Africa And It was a heavy trip Every time I've come back There's a post Post-trip Depression You just see certain Things Like what? People's day to day living conditions Their quality of life The sort of The conditions they live in That they didn't have a choice about That they were born into And they're being held at bay by Corrupt people and greedy people Because there's tons of money in Africa Whatever Tons of resources Yeah There's some crazy things going on in Africa And it just goes Fairly ignored But anyway every time I've come back I've been pretty depressed Why is it ignored? This is something I wonder about all the time Why do we ignore that? Why is that part of the world completely The world turns its back on Africa I don't know I honestly I don't know Like Africa and North Korea Like North Korea you can kind of understand People are just like We were not really sad about them We were just like I hope it doesn't make it over here I don't care if it Liquifies everyone over there Let's hope that they don't get on our airplanes It's kind of fucking strange isn't it? Is it because they don't have oil? Do you think if Africa had A bunch of oil over there Like if there was a Saudi Arabia level Of oil reserves That we would be helping them more Possibly There's still racism Let's be honest You think it's racism? I think it's a little bit of racism But I'll tell you man Racism has never stopped The United States military From helping folks If there's some fucking oil out there That's absolutely true There is this weird coincidence Isn't that a weird coincidence? That's one of these great coincidences Of our Military Our war strategy Is that it does seem like The most evil people are to be found around oil Like you definitely When we're going into like rescue And help people There's always oil nearby It's so crazy to imagine If the United States actually And maybe it's scary if they were Driven by some ethics Instead of pure financial desire Technology was done Just if that technology could just be done It'd be crazy It'd be wonderful If we actually started using all of our resources Not to suck oil from the earth But to help people Sending out troops to go into other countries And distribute food Why don't we do that? Someone let me know why we don't do that Write an email please I'd come back from Africa Feeling pretty Shit, just depressed Had a small fling That didn't work out It was compound stuff A fling with you in Africa No It was a relationship back home But it was these compound things So relationship going to shit Coming back from Africa Having seen some pretty hardcore things Like on that level You saw some dead bodies and stuff You see people On the side of the road who Who are Dying People are just dying In certain places Not all So this is In cities you see the most hardcore things How are they dying? They're just poor So this is The United States It's a pretty easy thing to forget That our version Of being down and out here Is a lot of people's version Of doing just fucking great In some parts of the world You can actually starve To death People don't realize that You can actually starve to death They just start like That guy doesn't have food We're not going to give him food So you saw that I've never seen that kind of poverty I've been to India but I don't think I've ever seen anyone Starving to death I've seen people very poor in India But They're taken care of to some degree Yeah, poor and sick And just don't have any No means There's no government programs in Africa Africa is so huge In Ethiopia Ethiopia is its own Place And I'm not Knowledgeable enough to truly Speak on it Yeah, I don't know I don't know what the deal was going on I don't know, there's just I wish I could talk about it So I'll just move on Come home Dealing with all these Issues in a funk First I think I can just Change it with my willpower Tell myself I'm okay But that's just Actually, I'm just trying to hide it Mask it So eventually having done Psychedelic mushrooms in the past And knowing that their ability to sort of Expose things going on inside Forced you to sort of take a look Inward and face yourself in the mirror I said I'm going to seek these out as a Tool as a medicine To try to Deal with this funk So I take them Myself at a friend's house I had his house for a little bit And I leave And I start to Go through my trip and I'm walking In the streets of Portland, Oregon And Eventually I I'm feeling all these dark, dark thoughts Just extremely dark and it's Working, I mean it is working In this To uncover all this And I go to cross a road And I think I'm walking At a pretty reasonable pace I had checked to make sure cars Weren't coming, but obviously my Perception of time was Off, I didn't get hit But I found myself, I don't know How long had passed But I found myself crying In the middle of the road While cars waited on both sides With their headlights on me And it was such a Raw moment where I was Essentially With all these lights and people staring at me On stage in a very dangerous way Of course, crying Feeling dark and shitty for Myself, and I immediately started laughing You know what I mean? Because I was like What a dumb ass move First of all, what a dumb ass move And second of all How ridiculous, like I did not, who leaves Their house and just thinks I'm going to cry in the middle Of the road today, so I started Laughing and then crying, and then laughing And then crying, and it was just like Back and forth, and I'm walking It's night time now, and I'm walking Down the road, and there's this little Window open to a basement And from the basement there's some sort of Church choir practicing Singing And from their perspective, regardless Of whether it's Christianity or whatever They were singing from a place of this love That they have for this thing, God or whatever My favorite description of God is that It's just love, God is love It's that whole salvation mountain thing So, they're singing And I hear this music, and I hear that Love in their voice for something else For the world, for God, whatever And I Stopped walking, and I stood there And I listened, and It was beautiful, as you can imagine I mean, everything's heightened as well But it just was So phenomenal, and then the song ended And I just saw hand reach To the window, and close it Wow And it was like, just a one Song glimpse into this world, or whatever To have that moment And I continued to walking And immediately, I Knew the moral lesson of this story And what had been eating me up was that I would rather love someone else Than hate myself You know what I'm saying? Spending that energy, I had been in that For two months, I had been Beating myself up, trying to just I don't know, fix it And I was creating all that energy Thinking about how painful and shitty my situation is And how fucked up the world is And yet, I could have been Spending that time Expressing love To other things You went from input to output Shifted the energy And the moment you shift the energy Whatever this stuff is There appears to be two universes Existing simultaneously And it's not even two It's a lot But it seems like if there is a lot With all the variances that can happen It seems like you could almost divide One group of potential Universes in another group With this very simple line between And one group, one universe is populated By people who are all input And the other universe has people in it Who are output And the input people are in hell Because they're trying to They're trying to They're trying to Scratch an itch In the exact wrong way It's like they're scratching the wrong part of their body They think that they have an itch on their foot When the itch is on their neck Only in this case The feeling of Hunger that they're having Or suffering Can only be quenched By giving love to other people And the moment you start giving love Out to other people All this other shit that was going inside of you Really evaporates But I think it's not easy though And it's easy to sit here and talk I think it's easy About these kind of lovey hippy ideas Or humanistic ideas about the world I think it's easier than you think I think you gotta do a thing where you give more Than you feel It might not work every time But I think that if you Identify somebody in your life Who needs help And give them more Than you think you should And do it Right after you finish listening to this podcast My guess would be That you will experience At least in that moment You will experience the opening Of that church window for a second And hear the singing of angels And it happens real quick Maybe you'll go away Maybe the window slams shut again But all you need is for that fucking window To open a few times And once you know it exists It always will This has been Just a wonderful conversation Thank you so much for being on the show How can people find you Well The main sort of creative thing I'm doing Is this two-way cruise show We make videos Supposed to be comedy It is hilarious And we have a live show At the satellite in Los Angeles So we do that Also my own person So I exist out there on the internet As well as here Mikey Kampman I'll have all the links online Thank you so much for being on the show man Thanks Duncan Please support Squarespace By going to Squarespace.com And signing up for membership You'll get 10% off your first order Also a giant thanks to Rob Crue For fixing the sound in this podcast And most importantly, a thank you to you For continuing to listen I love you guys We got some great podcasts coming up With Danielli Belelli Tom Green That's coming next month I hope you'll continue to listen For the end or week Bye In the books Telling you what I've read in the cook show You like me I hope you like me Oopie Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Yokey like me Thank you for watching!
232^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Daniele bolelli is the LOVE GURU Transcript and Discussion^2013-04-27^Hello, dear friends, and thank you for tuning in to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. This is me, Duncan Trussell, transmitting to you from somewhere in the depths of Los Angeles. I am really excited because I am going next week to Lemuria Maui to do a retreat with Ramdas. I am almost in a manic state of excitement and kind of nervousness because I have never done a meditation retreat before, but Ragu Marcus called and was like, you should do this, with all the shit that has recently gone on with you. I was like, you know what, fuck it, I will go to Lemuria. Sometimes you just have to go to Lemuria. I could think of a million reasons not to do it. All of them based in, you know, just it's something completely outside of my pattern or something that I would ever do in a million years, but why not? Why not just do it? I'm going to go. I don't know exactly what it's going to be like. Everyone's telling me that it's pretty incredible, and I've never done a meditation retreat. I don't know what's going to happen. There's yoga every day, really nice food. I'm going to be that by myself, so I'm kind of worried about that. I don't want to be this like weird, like lonely guy lurking among all the grass-fed, healthy, vegan people, but Ragu Marcus assures me that it doesn't matter if you go there by yourself. So we'll see what happens. So that's coming up, and I'm really quite excited about that. This podcast with Daniela Bollelli, as with all the podcasts with him, is so good that I don't feel like I just want to put it up because we just recorded it, and it was a really funny, interesting podcast, so I'm not going to do any more opening monologues, stuff, whatever you call this shit, but hopefully there is a small chance, and all of you guys who are into prayer, visualization, magic, and whatever multiverse navigation you're into, there's a very, there's a chance, maybe I can get Ramdoss to do the podcast, which would be, for me, a dream come true. Maybe that's going to happen. If not, no big deal. I'll still be able to tell you guys what it's like to be at that kind of event for better or for worse, but probably for the better. Okay, we'll start the podcast, but first quick business. Do you want to support the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast? Here's some easy ways to do it. You can go to, if you're ever going through Amazon to buy stuff, which I do all the time now, once you realize that Amazon can do next day delivery and that there's really no need to ever leave your house, you can just sit on your couch with the lights off and a veil wrapped around your face and the door, there will be knocks at the door and suddenly you'll have potato chips or a bushel of lubricant or a Gnostic scripture or all of the above. It's amazing. I don't know why anyone does anything except orders from Amazon. It's fun. Don't do it when you're drunk. You will order weird shit, but if you use Amazon.com, there's a portal located at DuncanTrestle.com, where if you click on that and buy stuff, they give us a small percentage and it doesn't cost you anything extra. So that's like, that's the easiest way to support this podcast. You can also, another way to support it is if you're into audiobooks, you can go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and you can get a free audiobook if you sign up for a trial membership, which means you can cancel and there's a lot of great books there. Oh, there's a lot of stuff by Rom Doss there. There's a lot of incredible audio books. Go check that out and we have a shop located at DuncanTrestle.com that a lot of the stuff is empty, depending on when you're listening to this. Just go check it out because we're about to get filled back up with sweet, soft, short design t-shirts. We got fucked because apparently in Thailand, they celebrate something for several weeks straight and we couldn't get the shirts. So anyway, but new shirts are coming, posters, there's posters there and all kinds of stuff. So that's a cool way you can support the podcast. And as always, we are sponsored and brought to you by Short Design T-Shirts, the purveyors of the softest, softest shirts. These are made from the vulva dander of Catholic nuns who have recently turned their back on the church. Something about the renouncing your religion causes the combination of your daily vaginal secretions and your underwear fabric to mix in a way that just really creates a wonderful material that you can make the softest shirts from. So if you want to wear something made out of the vulva dander of excommunicated nuns, then go to ShortDesignT-Shirts.com, put my name in and you will get 10% off of your order. Today's guest on the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is an Italian writer, martial artist, university professor, and he just wrote an amazing book called Create Your Own Religion. He's been on the podcast several times before. He's one of my close friends and an incredibly inspiring human being who always makes me feel better whenever I get a chance to hang out with him. He's got his own podcast called The Drunken Taoist Podcast, which I highly recommend. There will be a link at DuncanTrussell.com to this podcast or you can go straight to DaniellaBolelly.com and check out his podcast, which is awesome, and order his book. So now everyone, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, the super genius, brilliant, loving, fatherly, awesome, deadly, somewhat cynical, yet somehow transcendent super mind of DaniellaBolelly. It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. You know what I would like to do at my house? I want to plant peyote. Um, can you play a peyote? As far as I know, I mean, who's gonna bug you? It's like, it's a cactus. Yeah, where do you get the buttons though? That's the part that I need to, I don't know, I need to get the hookers. You gotta find the buttons. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, have you ever taken peyote? No. Well, I had it in a tea, but it was so mild. It was, you know, how about you? Never. Never? All right, let's get this thing going. Oh, it is already going. That's a good thing to get on tape. Your plans to grow peyote. Just kidding, DEA. Daniella, welcome back. How are you? Good, good, good. How are you doing? I'm pretty good. I'm okay. I'm pretty, I'm like, I'm on one level. I'm really good. And then on another level, I'm like, confused. And then on another level, I'm sort of blank. Tell me who needs to be killed and I'll take care of it. Nobody needs to be killed, man. That never solves any, that'll never solve anything. That's too bad, because that's the only thing I specialize in. Murder? Yes. No, I don't need anybody murdered. I just been pining after this girl. I'm, it's, you ever pine after a girl? That's life, right? Yeah. Yes, of course. But it's such a, it's a, it's a, it's a, a, um, hilarious. On one level, it's the most absurd, hilarious thing ever. And then on another level, it's the most dramatic, sad thing ever. Yeah, I only go for the second part. The first half, I don't find any fucking hilarious when you're into it and you feel it and it's in you. Well, no, if you look at, like, for me, it's like, I, when I, when I, if you really put it down on paper, the thing, it's kind of, it's an absurd, it's an absurd situation. It's something I, it's a situation I ruined, essentially. Like I basically, I manufactured the catastrophe. Well, I may have a little bit of inside info, but I slightly disagree with you on that. No. You manufacturing. For, I don't mind telling people, I tell them everything so they can, the, the, what, so what happened is I was, um, seeing this girl, an amazing girl. I, uh, I, I got cancer and, uh, she, I feel really weird confessing that she took it because make, because I will seem like a really, uh, an asshole. She took care of me while I had cancer, basically. Like she would like, she was not, not taking care of in this, I'm pretty much in a lot of ways. Emotional support was the most important thing. And so instead of, we, we hadn't been seeing either each other that long when I got cancer, but I really liked her. And, uh, you know, instead of doing what a lot of people might have done when they find out, oh, you're getting one of your balls chopped off, you have cancer, you're, I can't deal. I don't feel like dealing with this drama. I'm sorry. They, you know, they leave you alone to deal with it. She was there the whole time and comforting and like an angel. So then I started getting radiation treatments and I, um, if, if you've never gotten radiation, it's the, it's, you just get sick. It's like you're seasick for a month straight and you don't want to be around anybody and everything stinks. Like you can smell, you know, you just smelling yourself is almost enough to make you throw up, but like just smelling anything scented, anything really, your sense of, because your body's being poisoned and it's trying to identify the source of the poison and the way one way your body does that is with smell. So anyway, there's no fucking way you're going to be intimate with someone if you can't even smell yourself without wanting to puke. So in the midst of having this like awful, um, radiation treatments and, and I, when I, I, when you're sick for a month, is severely sick, you lose track of how sick you are. And so you start thinking you're better when you're not better. So anyway, somewhere in the midst of this, I decided that, oh, I don't want to be with this person. She's, she's too attached to me. Uh, really awful, stupid shit just because I was coming from this murky, dumb place. And so then I basically, you know, broke up with her and, and then, uh, um, which is just shit. I'm sorry. I don't mean to, I'm not applying for a spot as your personal lawyer, but please rephrase everything you have said there. Okay. You're in the middle of fucking radiation. Yes. You have cancer. You're entitled to say any stupid shit you want. And I mean, of course she's been an angel by sticking there with you, helping you being sweet to you, all of that. But brownie points for that. That's awesome. But at the same time, you are in the middle of shit. You can't just expect that you're going to just be tucked under the blanket ago. Thank you, sweetie. And everything is okay because you are dealing with so much shit, having cancer, uh, the physical effect of radiation, all of it. So yes, that's probably not the best reaction in the world. And you probably don't want to make big choices in the middle of all of this shit. Yeah, I give you that. But at the same time, on her hand, she should figure out that you are in, you're not, you're here in the middle of pure delirium crazy shit going on because of radiation. Give it a month after you are done with radiation and have that talk again. Well, I try, I mean, that's the thing. I tried to repair the thing after, you know, I mean, I haven't through this maelstrom of insane phenomenal catastrophic phenomena. And when I came back finally to LA, I tried to fix things up, you know, and explain this again. And it seemed for a second, like maybe it was gonna, I was gonna, like she was gonna like believe me, but it didn't work. And so she's sort of like, look, I just can't be with you. I'm, I'm afraid you're gonna, you know, hurt me because you're gonna get cancer again and radiation again. Or just, you know, if you dumped, if you broke up with me after I took care of you with cancer, when are you gonna break up with me again? That's, I can understand the logic in it, you know, but it's again, yeah. And anyway, the end result is the same, right? I'm pining after this girl shocked by the fact that I'm pining after this girl because I haven't pined. Yeah, I haven't pined in eight years. I haven't pined. So come on. This is my personal appeal to this lovely lady whose name I don't know, but we'll appeal to her anyway. The point is, what the hell, you know, Duncan has been pined in eight years. You are sweet and good. And, you know, you are sweet and good to take care of him in the middle of all this. He went mildly insane as it's more than entitled to in the middle of all this. Give the man a chance. If he hurts you again, then call me and I'll make sure to be team up for you. That's my personal promise to this lady. Thank you. But you know, it's like, if you hurt her, when you are totally yourself, then, yeah, you're a dick and you deserve to be treated badly. But in the middle of all that, come on, man, you know. I think she's got a boyfriend now. That doesn't mean anything. Yeah, right. Give it up, some dumb boyfriend. Don't do that. Anyway, man, that's, you know, that's like one thing I've been dealing with, but fuck. And another like pining is great because it teaches you about attachment, right? And it teaches you about how attachment causes suffering and it teaches you, you know, to sort of like step back and realize like, oh, this is a less, this is another teaching. This is a teach. This is of it. I'm just beginning to see that all the fucking great teachings, they are all like getting dragged around by a fucking gorilla. That sucks. Couldn't there be a teaching when you're getting massage and a pinacolada in Hawaii while looking at the sunset? Yeah, there's those teachings, but those things, I mean, that's like, no. I know, I know. They don't teach you. Those don't, I mean, they teach you like, oh, this isn't, usually when I'm in a really pleasurable place, the thing I'm learning is that I can't enjoy the pleasure because I'm pining over someone, or, you know, they're just depending the ass, aren't you? Yeah, I guess so, man. I mean, I guess so. I guess it's just I'm human and we're all sort of the thing I'm recognizing is like, no matter, I can only, it's almost like there's an engine of happiness. And the engine has, I don't know, how many cylinders does an engine have? Four? Four. Well, this engine of mine seems to have like four cylinders, maybe six. I don't know, I'd have to count them up, but it's like money, career, health, love, friendship, or at five, I think, spiritual life. And I can never get all those cylinders going at once. There's always one that's not going, and that one not going. Like you focus on that one greater than the other five. Yes. Why? Why, why, why? I think it's the, it's some form of weakness of the mind, because the mind produces thought patterns and of all types on every level. Some thought patterns are about God, some thought patterns are about girls, some thought patterns are about money, some thought, and then you tune into, there's certain thought patterns that you just gravitate towards, and then you begin to ruminate over those thought patterns. Yeah, I mean, I guess some of that is human, because it's kind of like when you get 30 messages that tell you, oh, whatever thing you did, a book, a podcast, or whatever, that was awesome, that was this, that was that, and you know, you take it in, it's great, it feels good, and then you get one message that says, you fucking sucks, you're the most horrible human being on the planet, I can't believe, and you're going to be thinking about that one, greater than the other 30 people who told you how cool it is. Exactly. So, no, I get it, I think it's natural, but I guess what to do in that situation, because yes, it's natural, yes, everybody goes there, it's kind of like jealousy, you know, we all know that jealousy is stupid, but everybody gets it, right, to one degree. How do you squash it? No, the jealousy part, I got that part, the focusing on the one tiny, maybe not tiny, but the one negative thing when you have several that are really cool going for you. Oh, I don't know, I can't figure it out, man, it's like when you get a goddamn mosquito in the room. Right. It's the old mosquito in the Taj Mahal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. God damn things buzzing around, oh, if only this, if only, I guess, you know, it seems like one trick that's working in this relatively minuscule bit of tragedy, it's really in the grand scheme of everything fucking cancer and moms dying and Boston bombs going off, getting rejected by somebody is like, come on, that's like a getting a cold or something when there's smallpox raging around. Right. It's like, yeah, it still sucks, but it's not, but anyway, that doesn't work, minimizing it doesn't work, trying to pretend like it's not a big deal doesn't work, all those things don't work. The only thing that seems to work is so unromantic and dumb, it's just exercise and, you know, focusing on other things and just kind of like, and also honestly appraising the situation for what it is instead of what you want it to be, because the real situation is that this is a girl who is seeing someone else. Right. That's the real situation and no one ever in a million fucking years has chosen the person they liked less. Well, no one does that. No, well, but that's not really, because that's not really a fair statement in that way, because it's not like you are in their situation, everything is great and fine and Mr X somewhere else in a situation there and fine have to choose go one way. Yes. She's with you, all hell break lose around you inside of you in every conceivable way. You don't handle it in the ideal possible scenarios, one wish one could handle it in there. She got hurt, run off. Oh, Mr X here, okay, console me. You know, that's a little different than there are two parallel situation and I pick one over the other. I know, well, maybe it's different for everybody, but I know for sure that if like I was in a flipped situation, there was someone I really liked and I'd been seeing someone else that I sort of didn't like or kind of I would just like, if it came down to a decision, I would pick the person I really like, especially if I was afraid, especially if I thought that person was gonna, for me, it's like if I'm in a situation where I think someone's gonna hurt me and crush me to pieces, I guess I'm a fucking freak, because that's when I'm like, yes, this is it. Oh my God, if this person can destroy me, then I'm in the fucking land of- Yeah, but you're a fucking freak. You should remember that. Most other people don't walk that way and usually tend to gravitate away from pain. So usually the choice is now, Mr X maybe is an awesome human being and is great in his own right. Maybe he's just safe and not red. There's not that experience of, fuck, I can get hurt. Like some of the typical scenarios that are complicated are awesome attraction to a human being in that way, but danger and weirdness and possible pain. All right, not too bad, safe. Yes. So not as high, but not as low. You know what I mean? The highs are not as high, but the lows are not as low. In many cases, the choice is shit. If I'm afraid to get hurt, that's not bad, because I still get some high, the lows are not too bad. The point again is not that most other people tend to gravitate away from pain and suffering and possible danger. I, you know, yeah, no, I think it's not that you gravitate. I mean, it's like if there's a, for example, like take the, if there's a nest of hornets outside, you know, you don't go shoving your hand into the hornet's nest because you're going to get stung, but it's more along the lines of like, hey, what do you want to do? Here's some things we can do. We can go to Disneyland or we can go to Peru and drink ayahuasca on top of Machu Picchu. Yes. Yeah. And in that situation, there is danger. Right. Of course, because it's, you're out of your comfort zone. You're in a crazy land. So it's like, that's what I'm saying. I'm not saying go chasing after pain, though, if you do want to go chasing after pain, I can definitely recommend some professional dominatrixes. That are fantastic. Yes. But I'm saying the inherent, the, the, the greater it's the classic thing, the greater the reward, the greater the fucking risk. Add one element to the Peru story, though, is you have already gone to Peru. You started having a blast. It was so much fun and they robbed you of all your money. And now you went back and now you have to decide again, do I want to go to Peru again for Machu Picchu or do I just want to go to Disneyland? Yeah, right. I'm going to go to Disneyland and ride on Pirates of the Caribbean with my safe boyfriend. That could be. Blah. No, thanks, man. Give me the fucking, no, don't give me the fuck. Actually, I'm, I'm, I'm, I don't want to be a catastrophist. I'm right. You know, but I do, you know, I do recognize, I mean, like, I guess it's just a product. She's younger than me. I guess it's a product of being old when you get old and you just realized you're, you're, you're, you're just going to get your fuck. You want your heart, just this duct taped thing and you just get better at taping it back together. So it's like easier to. That's one of the things that to me, in fact, if there are many, many aspects of life in which have been anything but brave, where I'm a big wimp, a lot of things scares me and all of that kind of stuff. But one thing that I've kind of never been scared of is getting emotionally hurt to me. It's like, and when I look around, I see the vast majority of human beings being dominated by this sense of what if I get hurt? Yeah. And I don't, I think it's because this is not because I don't feel the pain is because I think I'm so damn used to it. That is just like, so I got hurt. I got hurt anyway, every fucking day of my life to one degree or another, at least it might as well be for something fun. Like I remember as a kid growing up, it's not that I saw myself as better than somebody else. In that sense, I saw myself as having a bigger emotional range, which means my highs are 10 times as high, my lows are 10 times as low. The range is the same. There's still a plus and minus that equal each other. It just tends to go deeper both ways. So when you grow up, you know, you're a teenager, your emotions are all over the place, you maybe are a little weird and you don't, every fucking thing you feel, it's not like you're having a little bit of a bad day. You're having these emotions that are tearing you apart constantly. And I mean, that's how I grow up. That's how I've been for a really long time. So to me, the idea of, oh, I can get hurt is like, what's new? You know, it's a big fucking deal. Right. So that's, I hear it. I hear it a lot from people. I don't understand it. Well, it's, first of all, this whole goddamn non-conflictual, like it's a conflictual word, this word. I'm the one who doesn't speak English. This thing where people try to seek tranquility, you know, I think we've talked about this before, but it's like, give me a fucking break. You're not going to find it anyway. Like, you find the safe, you find a safe boyfriend. And I guarantee you there is a basement of an abandoned house in South Central LA filled with court slaughtered victims. It's just dead toddlers and cat brains all smeared all over the wall. Nice. You know, go, you find the fucking safe anything. And it's not, it's got a stinger. Everything's got a fucking stinger. So, yeah, I don't know. And I do apologize for doing Dear Abby with you. No, no, Dear Abby is awesome. I always wanted to be Dear Abby. I think it's my next reincarnation is what I'm shooting for. Getting relationship advice from you is always so good, man. It really is. But honestly, again, I don't know the day. I don't know her. I don't know the other guy. So that's totally speaking out of my ass because I know you and I feel. But in my mind, assuming that story with the other guys, not like fireworks and everything is amazing and awesome. If you are dead into somebody that you want to take care of them in the middle of cancer and they are doing all this stuff, that's amazing. It's sweet. It's really cool. You go that far. Well, go far enough that you cut some slack on when they went slightly crazy in the middle of it all. You say, okay, well, let's try again when you are normal human being. When you are a normal human being, you hurt me. Then, yes, I will call my friend Daniela Bollelli and have you shot. Yeah. That's honorable. I can get that. But it's the goblin effect. You know, the goblin effect, it's like you get what's inevitably when you are with someone long enough, the goblin comes out. And you always think it in the beginning, you're like, I just anything that they do is going to be wonderful, even if it's bad. And even everything, you like the way that their sweat smells. You know what I mean? You like every single thing about them. And you fantasize that they don't have the goblin, that thing, the golem and Lord of the Rings, the thing living in the dark under belly of the thing that's hissing over some stupid shit. Then that thing pops out. And inevitably it's always worse than what you thought you could deal with. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be a big deal. But inevitably this cuckoo clock thing pops out of the shadows and it's like, look at me. And you're like, no, that is, I don't want that. I don't want to be around that. And you know, unless you find the perfect fucking person and I don't think that that even exists, I think the whole soul name of crap is insane nonsense in a good mood. Yes. Yeah. It's tricky. It's tricky because on one end, yeah, right. I mean, 99.9% situation, you're not going to find the perfect thing. On the other end, sometime making compromises because it's like, well, I mean, this is better than nothing. And there are some highs, but then you are compromising because the blows are really fucking low and there's so much stuff that doesn't click. I don't know. It's a choice. It's like, do you really want to do that? Or do you just say that maybe being on your own and doing some stuff on your own until you have something that really heats quality wise? What you want is worth it. Yeah, I've got no fucking choice. Right. Because I don't know. To me, it's like the more forever I've been always pretty scared of being on my own. Yeah, something that always freaked me out. So I was always kind of chasing a relationship. But then I was also too stupid for my own good because my standards were insanely high. So if I meet this hot woman who's pretty well read, who's nice, I'll still be like, what is that thing that doesn't, you know, so I was thinking, yes, because I'm needy on one end and then I'm over judgmental on the other. Perfect recipe, right? But then like, I think now where I'm at in my life, something has turned the corner in some way because the neediness is pretty much gone. I'm totally fine. If you tell me you'll never have a relationship again, you're on your own. I'm totally fine with that. And that paradoxically puts you in a place in which it becomes so much easier to get what you want because you're not going to waste like you think that, you know, if I run into a super hot woman who's nice and sweet, but I don't come from a place of neediness, I'm going to see that. But I'm also going to see ways in which we're not going to click badly. I don't mean a little bit where clearly it's going to be, there are going to be real issues and it makes it easier. And so I don't know, I feel like in some way I'm seeing it from a different angle now that is not that, I mean, it's better, but it's not that I have the recipe to get there. How did you get to that place? I think in that sense is what we are talking about, which is you feel that you got kicked in the balls from every possible direction. Yeah, exactly. And at that point, yeah, I think you already got that part taken care of, right? So the ball attack has been done. At that point is where you feel like, fuck it, I don't control anything anyway. I can't really be needy of what, you know. I'm not going to get what I want anyway. It's all transitory. It's all impermanent. It's all out of my control. And that's when you relax and you just enjoy things for what they are right here right now with no plan. Because I mean, one of the things I do is like, if I would run into this hot, wonderful woman and I come from a place of being needy, I would start projecting, I would start imagining, and then we're going to hook up and then we got to travel to this place and then it's going to work this and that way. And it's like, why the fuck are you ruining this moment right here right now where you're having a good dinner with this woman and this fun? Exactly. And you're starting to put all this pressure everywhere. It's not fun anymore. No, now you've got this heavy old fucking thing. You're already planning it. Like, I was just talking to a friend of mine and she was telling me about, and a lot of people have different versions of this, but you know, sort of like how lately she'd been thinking about how she want to have kids because she'd been around a dying grandparent and the, you know, seeing this dying being surrounded by family and love made her think, oh God, if I don't have kids, then, you know, who surrounds me? And I said to her, you're already planning your geriatric death. The reason you want to have kids is because you want someone to die in front of. I'm going to have you so you can watch me turn into a human skeleton, gasping eyes rolling back in my head, IV needles attached, and a small trail of discolored urine running out of my fucking body into like a, you know, that's why I went, but the two guys love Duncan's new mood of the day. Isn't this inspiring? But, but, you know, and I've thought that too, you know, I've thought I want to have kids with a girl, but when I get old, like basically I want to have raised nurses. Right. Silly. Yeah. Really, what, you know, what we both agreed on is the thing that people want is love. Kids give you unconditional love. It's love. You want love. But in that, when, whenever you get in a situation, and I'm not advising getting in a fucking relationship with sociopathic people who are like into hurting and are like womanizing or man, not man eaters. But I'm saying if you get in a fucking situation and you actually are playing it safe, based on planning for the, like you're thinking like, oh, I just don't think that this is going to work out. Right. Well, what does work out mean? Yeah. Yeah. Do you mean you don't think we're going to fucking bury each other? Do you, is that what you were saying? Are you saying that I won't be at a churchyard or you won't be at a churchyard? Yeah. Watching dirt get thrown on my casket? Is that what it means? Not working out or what is not working out mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What does it fucking mean? The right here right now it's not working or what are you talking about? Yeah. And if it's working and then the thing is like if you have a real connection with somebody, a real connection, not a fabricated connection, but clearly there's like romance and passion and sweetness and it's nice. Then what the fuck? Why are you planning Act Three? You're barely through the middle of Act One. Totally. And I mean, depending on what Act Three is, if it's like, because I mean, really the only thing I can think of that makes sense in the regard is some people want to have kids and people don't. And unfortunately, there is a timeline in the regard. So if that's the issue, then talk about it and figure it out. And yes, if somebody's ultra committed, like I see myself as a parent, no matter what, and you absolutely don't, no matter what. Yeah. Well, there's an issue. We can have a little more fun, but obviously going in a different direction. It's not gonna work. Right. But other than that, what the hell else is there to talk about? What the hell else is there to talk about? It's like sitting in a wonderful, bubbly, sweet hot tub and getting out because, you know, the hot tub is going to turn off in 45 minutes. Right. Right. Right. Right. Precisely. And that's the thing about not living in the moment, which is dumb. At the end of the day, just it fucks up what the good stuff that you have. And kind of like what we're saying about the one bad thing, you know, rather than enjoying your Hawaiian sunset and the cool things that you have right there and right now, you're thinking about the thing in the past that pissed you off, that's still in your head and you carry it into spoiling the moment right now. And it's like, why, why, why, you know? Can I present to you my new model for attachment? Please. Now that you said that, because this is something I've realized, man. And it's, I call it the dead baby gorilla syndrome. Have we talked about this yet? So it's that video on YouTube of the mother gorilla hauling around the baby gorilla that died. Have you seen this? And I don't want to see it at this point. It's sad. It's a baby gorilla has died and the mother gorilla can't accept the baby gorilla has died. So the mother gorilla is carrying around this corpse of a formerly living gorilla baby. And, you know, this is the fucking jungle. So just think of the stink coming off that thing. There's flies around it. The other gorillas are coming up kind of like, hey, you know, you're stinking everything up with this fucking thing. Please, it's dead. It's not coming back. But she's like not having any of it. She won't believe that the gorilla baby is dead. She wants the fucking thing to like come back to life. She's stroking it, touching it, you know, doing whatever. This is it to me. The ultimate example of attachment because human minds are filled with dead gorilla babies that we think are still alive. And that can be either gorilla babies in the sense of resentment or anger towards people or more often it's like you think that, you know, in relationships, the relationship is clearly over. You feel nothing for the other person. They feel nothing for you yet you're still hauling around the stinking corpse of your former love through the jungles of your mind with some fantasy idea that it's going to do a pet cemetery and pop up and start swinging through the trees again. No way. All that's going to happen is it's going to decompose and you're going to be smelling worse and worse and worse and your brain is going to be filled with the flies of your delusion until you end up driving everyone away from you because no one wants to be around someone whose brain is filled with rotten gorilla meat. That's the best friend ever. Again, fitting your mood currently. But yes, I mean, that's exactly how it is, right? Is dragging along something that's dead and you're just trying to have done that a lot in terms of friendship where because I wanted to have my little tribe. I wasn't just into being on my I like this tribal idea. I wanted to have all these cool people. I would drag people around in that sense where clearly it doesn't fit. It doesn't work. They aren't doesn't mean they're bad people. So in that sense, they are not the total that baby gorilla, but they are not that. And you're trying to at all cost drug them is exactly actually how does spoken Zaratustra begin the Nietzsche book. Nietzsche I want toward the beginning one of the early chapters is about how this idea of dragging this corpse along. Oh, really? So it's exactly that Nietzsche had the psychically seen that that baby gorilla video on YouTube ahead of his time in the Germany of the 1800s and and about how let it go, you know, because it's done. It's over. And when you will run into somebody who's I don't mean meant to be like I'm talking about soul made shit because I agree with you that stuff make me throw up. Yeah. But so yeah, meant to be start of the wrong word. But is somebody who does click with you not because you are forcing them like you are clicking with me. God damn it. Let me force you into this hole because it really works that way. It's like it clicks because it clicks. No, it's forced. No, it Oh, if I only change 50% of you, then you would work because that's it never does. Again, I'm back in my dear Abby moment. I love it. No, because I mean, it's real, right? Anytime you want to change somebody, people will change 10%. So you know, you can get the edges off if something is pissing off and this a little thing, the edges can come off. But the substance doesn't, you know, it's like somebody's not going to go from being some like if only this huge thing about them was different. Well, it's not and it's not going to be so deal with the fact that the highest come with that. And if you don't want to pay the price is not going to change tomorrow. That's true. So it is. That's true. And that's kind of like my thing right now about relationships in that regard is either I'm going to be who I am 110%. And if you like it, that's awesome. And if you don't like it, no, there's nothing doesn't mean a why should you like me? You know, I can think of many, many reasons why you shouldn't. So there's no me trying to convince you me feeling like, Oh, that's because you know, we are always trying to like put the best face forward and trying to convince people that we are. So my thing is I'm going to be who I am without all the bullshit surrounding it, because then you're letting you're preparing the laptop when people realize that you're not at your best face forward constantly and suddenly it's like, shit, you gave me the three minute preview. That was awesome. And the rest of the movies okay, but it's not awesome. Yeah. Oh, none of that. I'm like, I'll put that on the table. Exactly. This is my personality. A to Z. You like it. That's great. You don't. I wish you the best life possible. Maybe we're friends once in a while. That's it. There's no compromises, efforts, covenants in none of that shit. You can't. And it's a lie. It's like now you made it work by presenting yourself as something slightly different from what you really are. Yes, man, in the iron mask, you've locked yourself into this goddamn mask. They think you're some kind of whatever the stupid thing is that you apprehended that they wanted. They think you're this thing. And then they really get into you because they're like, oh my God, I've met my dream man. It's like, no, you met a chameleon. You met a horny chameleon. Exactly. We're selling you a fantasy because he understood that that's what you want. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's bullshit for both in the end. You know, even the one who is offering the fantasy, not only the one buying it, is still doing something that unless you are a cynical asshole and they're only doing it to get laid and in the process, you're going to hurt somebody else, which means you are a sore excuse for a human being. Yes. But if you are doing it really meaning, oh, I love this person. I want to click with them. It's so cool. Well, that's really the wrong way to go about it because you just sold them something that's not real. They will realize it sooner or later. They are going to be disappointed. You'll feel like shit because somebody's disappointed in you. Why are you doing that to yourself? Because when that fucking mask falls off, inevitably, when you don't have the energy, when you've got your guard down, when you're a little too drunk, when you're a little too whatever, and that fucking mask falls off and they see underneath it, you're this scarred, wrecked, festering, pot-covered, howler monkey. Or maybe you just have a pimple. Yeah, whatever, I don't have your pimple. Yeah, usually it is just a pimple. Well, you know, when they see this thing, then that's when the fucking relationship starts collapsing because you don't have the energy to put up the false thing anymore. And so then you're just exhausted and you're like, no, this is what I'm like. Sometimes I love to play video games or sometimes I fucking sometimes I leave fingernails on the ground. It happens sometimes. And the trip is if you then run into somebody who sees, you know, you do something that's probably not the ideal thing you want to do, you do a and you have that bubble of dog reaction when you turn and you're like, oh shit, now I'm going to hear about it is going to be a bad or something. And they are okay with it. Yes. They're like, that's you think that's bad? That's nothing. Yes. Really? Because that's as bad as I'm going to get, you know, really doesn't bother you. God damn it. See, man, this is why I this is why I have this attachment towards this fucking girl because in the in the worst time of my life when I really was just literally debilitated one fucking ball freshly chopped off Mamda in radiation. Yeah, the suddenly this person was like, no, I'm totally cool with it. The only thing she wasn't cool with is the fact that I broke up with her after she took care of me when I cancer and how can you blame her for that? No, but at the same time, again, if he was only the you dealing with what you're dealing with your mom, the physical effects of radiation are going to fuck up your mind for a while. And that's so assuming that somebody is going to do the same thing that they did when they were in a state where you probably shouldn't be around them unless you are willing to take all sorts of shit that's going to come out of them. I think in that scenario, I think that's as sweet and nice as she was. She overestimated their ability to be able to take shit. Because in that scenario is you're not just going to be that is not like a flu where you are there and you need somebody to make you soup and put new blankets and stuff. You're going fucking crazy. Yeah. And one has to realize that they are going to go fucking crazy. And a few weeks later is going to go away. And if you still ride in the bull, then you'll be able to see it for what it really is radar then. So in that sense, I feel like, come on, man, that's why I'm giving her the money back guarantee. Money back guarantee. And if not, it will be my honor to personally put an end to separating his side from the rest of his body. Try me one more time or I will only talk about you on my podcast for the next 700 podcasts. I'm sure your audience is going to be really pleased. Every podcast. I'm just some old man. And you know what happened? Yeah. Well, whatever, you know, man, I'm already feeling better. This talking about it makes me feel better. You know, being around you makes me feel better. But man, fuck all of my baby high school, elementary school, people right now in Syria are pushing their intestines back into their body while their mouth foams from sarin gas poisoning. Fuck me. Let's talk about your book that just came out. Yeah, which is not sarin gas. There are no gas filling out. But yeah, it's create your own religion. Yeah, I've been working on this forever because the way I write books in general, and this one in particular, I spend a ton of time ahead taking notes. So you know, you're driving something come to mind. Oh, I'm going to jot it down when I get home. You know, you do that for a long enough time that you have a mountain of material. Yes. Then you sit down, you start seeing patterns, you put it together. And this was create your own religion is not like any other book for me is the sum of my life's philosophy. Wow. Basically. So, you know, it's a big deal. It's a big deal. Because this is the premise of create your own religion is there are X number of topics that are key to human life that anybody who's alive is going to deal with one way or another, sex, gender roles, a relationship with the earth, beliefs about the afterlife, you know, you name it, you can go down the list, there's a whole bunch. So my thing is, let's look at what some of the answers are by various religion about how is the best possible way to deal with these topics. I'm going to reject the stuff that makes no sense. So it seems horrendously unhealthy. I'm going to focus on the good ones or if there are no good ones, I'm going to figure out my own answers. And essentially in the process of looking at what's out there, the point is not just to study, but to create your own path, your own life's philosophy, create your own, if the world religion strike your own, you know, scratch it off and put philosophy, same thing in that scenario is about the life, a way of life. So you're saying you're kind of what you're talking about is like the antithesis of what the fundamentalists say, which is like, you must, if you're going to be a Christian, you must follow this word for word, Old Testament to New Testament, and don't throw in any other philosophies from any other religions. You can't make a melting pot. You've got to pick one and stick to that. And part of not only do I disagree with that on a fundamental level, because I don't think it's healthy, because I don't think it works, because a million other reasons. But among other things is their line, because when people tell you that they are following a religion, nobody follow a religion the way you are supposed. What they do is cut and paste the parts they like within that one religion and ignore the parts they don't like. Because inevitably, in any of the big major sacred books, you have lots of messages that pull you at 360 degrees in different directions. And inevitably, what end up happening is, if you are a certain kind of person, you're going to highlight the passages that resonate, which we are, and you're going to just quickly and conveniently skip over the passages that don't fit your life. And in the end of the day, you still make up your own shit. It's like, look at like the vast majority of Christians today completely skip over all the many passages in the New Testament where Jesus is railing against accumulation of wealth and arguing that, you know, I mean, when the dude tells you it's easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven, that's like the most radical condemnation of accumulation of wealth there is. And still a bunch of people are like, I love Jesus, I follow the Bible is my book, except that that shit about wealth, I like my big house, I like my boat, I like my this, so I'm just going to conveniently ignore that part and make up my own version of Christianity. You have to. So my thing is just be honest, since that's what you're doing anyway, even if you say you follow one tradition, yes, have the guts then to open up to since you're picking and choosing anyway, then do it for real, do it with a bunch of sources rather than doing it out of that one book. That's great. And in that process, and maybe you do realize that in that one book, there's 95 percent of what satisfy you. And you may find a tiny bit elsewhere, I doubt it, because there's so much school stuff out there. But be honest, you know, and there's no, what are you afraid of, of testing it, of trying things out? I find that intellectually dishonest not to try out to pick and choose some ideas, because how do you know whether you like some stuff or not, whether it works for you or not? I'm trying to think of a corollary that isn't religion, where there's rules about not mixing different fields of understanding. I use this a bunch, even in the book itself, the idea like martial arts. Yes, right. Pre UFC, pre Bruce Lee, martial arts was everybody's judo is awesome karate sucks. No, what are you talking about karate is great. And each one, each school of martial art, like any school, any religion was our way is the great way. Anybody who doesn't train the way we do, they do that because they are morons and they don't really get it, but our way is the great way. Unlike religion, the beauty of martial arts is that having a physical component, one day, somebody had the idea, let's lock them in a cage, let's see what happens because you can only talk shit so much how your way is the best way if you keep getting your head kicked in. Yes. And so eventually, that's exactly what happened and people came up with mixed martial arts, which is some styles are hopeless, but many other have some strengths, none of them have it all. So yeah, this creative religion is the MMA of religion. That's exactly what it is. That's it. And that makes so much that's so great because it's like what is religion anyway? What is religion? Religion is always a explosion of information coming from a person who generally has gained some form of deep self-realization or a group of people over time. I guess in Judaism, you have the prophets in that variety of self-realized beings sort of giving out this information. So to think that you can only drink from one fountain when there's all these other fountains springing up everywhere, it's always seemed ridiculous to me. I mean, it seemed ridiculous to me about martial arts as well before UFC. So to me, UFC confirmed exactly what I thought about mixing as applied to martial arts. Unfortunately, we can do that with religions. But in my mind, it's like, obviously, there's more than one right way in that sense that you do find cool things in multiple sources. What is your religion? So in that sense, my religion is, you know, my way, right? And where I take the most from, I tend to take the most from Taoism, some aspect of Buddhism. But then that's where the ball comes from. Then I'll borrow from a bunch of sources. And the reason why I take Taoism in particular is because it's not unlike 99% of other religions, it doesn't give you an identity. This is what it means to be a Taoist. I have to believe this. I have to wear these clothes. I have to do this shit. Taoism is the language of life and it's not trying to convince you, it's not trying to tell you, you need to believe, you don't need to believe in shit, is it's like gravity. It's a force that's out there. Whether you believe in it or not doesn't matter. It's really about how you use it in your daily life so that you don't put heavy object above your head and let go. It's not a scene if you do, it's just stupid. And so that, to me, is what Taoism is about. It's not about having beliefs that you cannot possibly prove for which you have need to have faith. It's not about trying to convince anybody of this is, it's speaking a language that I find easier to apply to life and to everything else for that matter. And what I dig is the fact that a ton of people can be Taoists without having ever heard of Taoism. How can you do it without the religions? It's like either you follow that religion and you have certain articles of faith that you stick by or you are not. In Taoism, it doesn't matter whether you even have read it out at Shing or not. In some cases you may be applying the same insights because you pick them up by looking at life and that's how life is, those are just kind of natural forces in a way. Yeah, because Taoism is this kind of super condensed articulation of the way nature works. Absolutely. Now, but what's really confusing to me about Taoism is doesn't it have a mystical element? Like isn't it there in Taoism and the practice of the religion? Don't they burn like incense and aren't there firecrackers to ward off demons and like a lot of like weird ceremonial things? What happened with Taoism is the same thing that happened with all Chinese religions, which is all Chinese religions are various forms of shamanism. Okay. And what happens is somebody come up with a cool philosophy, become popular enough, now you attach some elements of that to the shamanism practice within China. And now that's the religious component of what started out as a philosophy. So in that sense, Taoism, Confucianism, bunch of forms of Buddhism, China kind of are all the same. The only thing that they do different is that they put Lao Tzu as a patron saint versus Confucius, but it's really about the ritualistic aspect of animistic shamanistic way. So when I look at a lot of the sects of religious Taoism, they have very little to do with what I'm talking about when I speak of Taoism. Yes. The thing that I do like about it is that no matter which sect you are talking about, they tend to be open to the fact that there's more than one interpretation. So you have Taoists who are like crazy into sex as a way to transform consciousness. You have Taoists who are hardcore celibate. So there's one thing and it's opposite under one cover, and they are cool with it. They let you do it. Okay, that's cool. Right. And that makes sense. They kind of have to be cool with it because they're Taoists. And also, by the way, there was a time when I would look at this kind of ceremonialism and it is a degradation of the thing. But the older I get, and especially having practiced various spell workings from Crowley or playing around with the function of ceremony and enacting your will into the world, there's something really beautiful about it, regardless of whether or not there's some true metaphysical principles, something about having incense and imagery and candles. It really helps focus the focus, if nothing else, helps focus your mind or your consciousness and opens you up to maybe receiving certain transmissions or something. I think it's part of my religion. There would definitely be ceremony. I'm totally cool with that. In my mind, my one yard stick to measure whether I like something or not is you try it, it works for you, then that's great. And maybe the ritual that works for you doesn't work for me. It doesn't mean that it's a bad ritual. It doesn't click with me. So I'm not going to use it, but that's awesome that you do and it's working for you. Because really, at the end of the day, the only thing that means something is whether that idea or that action or whatever, produce a positive result in your life where it improves the quality of your life, makes you a nicer human being, makes you cooler to your neighbors or doesn't. Everything else is just theoretical bullshit. The problem is the priest class, it seems like. It seems like the problem is that in every single one of these fucking things, there is a dick who will tell you that what you're doing is right or what you're doing is wrong. And that dick always happens to be the one with his hand outstretched getting the fucking bits of gold and silver. That's why I dig Walt Whitman and Thomas Payne both said basically the same thing about this idea that kind of a new age is coming in which every person is going to be their own priest. And what they mean by that is like, there's a beautiful line by the priest thing was Whitman. There's a beautiful line by Thomas Payne that argue, he says, my own mind is my own church. And it because that's really the only honest thing can do is it's your life. Nobody else can leave it for you. People can give you advice and it's a good idea to listen to what's out there. But at the end of the day, you got to choose what works and what doesn't. You are the one who has to live with the consequence. So it really is the only thing you can do is figure out for yourself what is that you are about. Otherwise, you're living somebody else's life. Right. Oh, God, that's so easy to do, isn't it? So easy to live someone else's life. And it's a terrible mistake. This is like one of the worst mistakes that you can make. And anytime anyone, this is why like, you know, whenever you hear like some of the great comics like Doug Stanhope, he wrote this amazing essay on like, you can't teach comedy. If I'm giving you comedy advice, I'm not telling you how to be a good comic. I'm telling you how to be me. Yeah, this is all that's such an individual path that you learn. So in the same way, and I think this is this is in Christianity and real Christianity, I think Jesus was saying, you don't need this fucking priest class anymore, you just are already connected. We are this is the kingdom of heaven, we're existing in the kingdom of heaven. And you can be in the kingdom of heaven if you're willing to allow the part of yourself that is someone else's life to die. And then boom, now you're in paradise and the birds are singing again, the fountains are flowing. And that's in fact, that's what I mean is even by people who got hung up is like Christianity, good Christianity, bad. You look at it that message. I dig it. It's beautiful. Is it real Jesus is who the fuck cares doesn't matter. It's a cool idea. And whether it's a myth, a legend or total reality, I'm gonna take it and use it for me. I think it's the real Jesus because that motherfucker got nailed up. Yeah. And usually by the priest class, the priest class put him the cruise in the in the story. The priest class was so frustrated by this fucking hippie wandering around telling people that they could do whatever they want on Sunday or Saturdays on the Sabbath and was healing on the Sabbath. And he was totally disempowering people who deserve to be disempowered, which is these creepy God clowns wearing their funny outfits and driving people out of the temple. That was like what they would do like they would like that was like the worst thing that could happen to you is you get driven out of the temple. Yeah, it would have been cooler for Jesus had been able to hang out by the Sea of Galilee and microphone on and start his podcast and communicate with people that way. They're learning to put his body on the line that way. But hey, that's the game, right? No, that's fucking Jesus Christ superstar. There's that song. What is it? The last song when Judas is singing that awesome song like, why'd you pick such a backwards time and such a strange land? Yeah. No, it goes if you if you live today, you could have saved the whole nation. Israel, something BC had no mass communication. Right. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. But you know, the thing about it is, man, which which I think is I love that Jesus by the way, I fucking love Jesus Christ superstar. We'll definitely play a song from then at the end of this podcast. But the reason Judas is wrong and seeing that is is because the reason Jesus can be so potent and powerful is there wasn't mass communication because the myth could build over generations. Yeah, absolutely. If you'd heard the real Jesus, he put the voice was probably like, you know, we just have to love each other guys. I can I get a hand job. Yeah. How much for a hand job? He probably love paying for hand jobs and was unashamed about it and that stinky feet. Yeah, that would be and that's where one of my Jesus story that's along this version of Jesus and the cooler one that's I find hilarious in the New Testament. Jesus going off and running into this fig tree and he decided he's hungry. He want the fig except that is the wrong season. And so there are no figs at the moment. Jesus got mad course, the fig tree, the fig tree withers and disciples are like clapping like what an amazing miracle. This is great. And Jesus goes off about everything that you can do with faith. You can tell a mountain to jump into the sea and yeah, it's like it's a fig tree. There's it's not personal money you can. So yeah, there are the really high parts, even in the New Testament. I hate you, you old dumb old fig tree. Everybody look what I can do with my magic. She's dead now. Let's go. If you wanted to, you can move a home out. Yeah. Can I get a hand job? By the way, just so you know, I think that is beginning. I'm trying to convince Duncan that is that we need to write a book about Jesus and well, I won't spoil it. But yes, no, it's a comedy book. Definitely. My balls sting today. Guys, you want to go heal some lepers? He just wrote half of the book. That's perfect. Man. It is this pot. You know, we've been talking for an hour. This podcast flew by. I want to thank you for being on the podcast. I forgive me. I am so sorry. I feel a little selfish for having you be my therapist during this podcast. Jesus, man. God damn it. I feel better. And how can people get your book? I can put a link on my website, but is there a place you want them to go in particular? I mean, either link through your website. If they were basically, you know, if you guys are into it, double up either way, either go through Duncan's Amazon link and you got it that way. That would be great. You go on my website, Daniela Boleyli.com. You click on the book cover. It takes you to Amazon. Same thing with me. Either one is good. So it doesn't really matter. And you guys do it. Please. Everyone loves you. I would say you're, I mean, I don't want to create a hierarchy, but of all the guests, you're the one everyone requests and loves and they love your voice. Jesus, you got to be, I didn't realize how ripped you are. I'm flexing my muscles for the microphone, which suddenly we don't have the camera. Steel ball under there. So yeah, you guys support Daniela because the book is awesome. I've started it. It's really fucking cool, man.

233^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Natasha Leggero Transcript and Discussion^2017-08-04^Hey guys, it's me, Duncan Trussell, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Sorry for the delay in getting regular episodes out. I've had an interesting last week. About a week ago, I was visited by the FBI who came to my house and had a little conversation with me regarding some things that I've said on this podcast that apparently go against some rules set up by the Patriot Act. I was a little surprised that they were there, but a part of me I guess has been expecting this kind of thing to happen. And I was even more surprised when they said that they were either going to arrest me and take me to a facility or they said I could have my freedom if I would go to this CIA ranch in Santa Clarita for about four days. So obviously I picked the ranch and I was expecting, I didn't know what to expect, but what ended up happening is I woke up to a lot of what's going on in the world and I realized that much of what I've said on this podcast is okay for a teenager to say all the conspiracy stuff and the pro-drug stuff and all that nonsense is maybe okay for a kid in college to say, but it's not okay for somebody to say who's well into their 30s. It's baby stuff. I mean, we don't live in the jungle. There has to be rules. We're in a situation in the world where the FBI and the CIA need access to our emails and to some of the information that's in there, not your emails, not the people listening to this because I'm sure all of you guys, you're keeping your nose clean, but you know, there's some bad guys out there and they, they're not very happy with the prosperity of our country. So we got to let our government do what they need to do to keep us safe, bottom line. And if we don't, then there's consequences as there should be. This is a wonderful country. It's the best country on earth and I'm proud to live here. And so that's that. Really excited about Memorial Day weekend. It's so fun. There's a lot of great stuff happening this Memorial Day weekend. There's a lot of great sales out there. So ladies, you can have tons of fun shopping and enjoying a lot of great sales. And not only are there a lot of great sales at some wonderful shops in our country, but there's a lot of great coastline out there. And one of my favorite things to do during the summer on Memorial Day weekend is to get into my car, grab my sunscreen, drive down to the beach with my friends. I just love it there. You know what? What? I love the beach and I love my friends. I love the blue skies or how they never end. If you wonder where I'm at, I'll probably be at the beach. I love the way your hands and I love the way that you're at the beach with me. I love the beach with me and I want you to leave with me. Come on down to the beach with me. American family and American friends having fun at the beach. Maybe we'll throw the Frisbee again. Maybe we'll barbecue and have a beer or two. And maybe I'll look at you and say I really love you when we're at the beach. And I like the way the wind blows on the beach. And I like the sun sets and I like the fish. And I like to barbecue with you and my friends down at the beach. Down at the beach. Oh, I love, really love it. Hanging in at the beach. You can't get enough of that sun. Make sure you put sunscreen on or you won't have as much fun at the beach. How I love the beach again. Come in with my friends. Smell that sweet beach energy. Let's play some volleyball. Maybe give me some shopping. Let's go to the beach. Hey guys, this is Brendan Walsh. Just wanted to say it was great to bump into Duncan here at the at this getaway. I just want to clear up a few things. I know that if you follow me on Twitter or have heard me on some podcasts, I have said some things that could be misconstrued as anti-American or anti-authority. I just wanted to make it clear that although I may have believed some of that garbage in the past, I am well in my 30s now and it's time to just grow up. Like all that angsty bullshit just doesn't fly forever. And really when you sit down and think about it, rules are there for a reason. We don't live in the jungle. We can't have people murdering each other. We can't let terrorists go unchecked. Unfortunately, some of you might think that your rights are encroached upon because the FBI is collecting data on your email searches and texts and everything. But you know what? They're also collecting data on people who want to harm America. And if you keep your nose clean, you don't have anything to worry about. And you shouldn't be angry that the people who are there to protect you are keeping an eye on you too. You can't protect people without keeping an eye on them. And if you decide to step out of line, then there will be consequences. But if you're a good person and you just live your life the way you're supposed to, you don't have anything to worry about. And any kind of conspiracy theories and stuff like that, it's all just a bunch of bunk. If you really think about it, if you're an adult, I get it. If you're a teenager, you're angry at the world, but you'll grow up eventually and you'll realize that this is a great place to live. And if you play by the rules, everything is fine. And it's wonderful. It's more than fine. It's wonderful. Life is really a dream if you let it be. And if you're going to focus on negativity and try and poke holes in the system, then you're just robbing yourself of a happy existence. So get out there. It's Memorial Day weekend. And go and have some fun. Go to the beach. Go to a barbecue. Do some shopping. There are some great sales. My advice to you this summer is to stay positive. Don't question things too much because you're just going to go down a rabbit hole of negativity. And like I said, you're just going to rob yourself of happiness. So I'm wishing all of you a happy, fun life. And if you play by the rules, the rewards are unimaginable. So this is Brendan Walsh signing off. God bless America. And God bless all of you, Duncan, Trustworth, and family. Far for the ride home, but wait a minute. You don't have to leave the beach at night. Grab some wood. Grab some friends. Make a bonfire and sing together at the beach. A night time at the beach. Watch those waves lick the shore under the moonlight. Let's sing some more. You are wonderful. Everything is great watching the stars dance in the sky. Look into your friends eyes and see how wonderful life can be. If you just let go, just let go. Sing a song and let yourself go. Hey everybody, we have a great episode for you for this Memorial Day weekend, or whatever weekend happens to be in front of you at whatever time period you happen to be listening to this at. But before we do that, first some business. The Duncan Trustle Family Hour podcast is sponsored by one of the finest, most patriotic t-shirt companies that I know of. They're so patriotic that they decided to leave the United States of America and go do their business in Thailand. Not because they didn't want to be here in the United States, because my sweet friend Bennett didn't feel like he deserved to live in our beautiful country beneath that sweet waving red, white, and blue flag and the fireworks flying in the night. Instead of staying in this country, he decided to go to Thailand where people are incredibly open about sex and there's beautiful beaches to punish himself. And there he created the short design t-shirt t-shirt company, an incredible t-shirt company that where the ink of the shirts is actually made from Bennett's tears. Bennett who runs shirt design t-shirts wakes up every morning and puts an American flag in front of his bed with a picture of Bill O'Reilly on one side and Glenn Beck on the other and he takes a studded leather belt and whips his back for an hour until he's weeping in pain, not pain from the leather straps slapping against his back, not pain from the skin of his back breaking open yet again as he mercilessly punishes himself, but pain from the sorrow of realizing that he will never experience the United States again because he doesn't feel worthy to be in this wonderful country. But every t-shirt at ShortDesignT-Shirts.com is a testament to this man's love of the United States of America. You can go and look at these shirts and see the United States all over them and the Sanskrit writing and the various pictures of Hindu gods, Ganesh, Buddha, and the beautiful floral script and the amazing psychedelic designs all point in the direction of a man who loves nothing more than football and dairy queen shopping malls and everything in between. ShortDesignT-Shirts is a Patriots company and I invite you to go visit them at ShortDesignT-Shirts.com. If you put my name in you will get 10% off of these beautiful American shirts made by an expat in Thailand of material that does not come from America with designs that are of an Eastern Indian origin. ShortDesignT-Shirts.com, go visit the website, put my name in, you get 10% off. We're also sponsored by an amazing little company called Audible.com. Audible.com is a fine purveyor of some of the greatest Patriot books available, read by some of our greatest and most genius political Patriots out there. You want to listen to a book read by Glenn Beck at Audible.com? Well, I invite you to go check out Control, Exposing the Truth About Guns by Glenn Beck or Glenn Beck's Common Sense, the case against an out-of-control government, or Glenn Beck, Agenda 21. I don't even know what that's about, but I guarantee it's good, or Glenn Beck being George Washington, or Glenn Beck cowards what politicians, radicals, and the media refuse to say, or Glenn Beck, the Overton window, or Glenn Beck, Common Nonsense, Glenn Beck and the, no, that's somebody who doesn't like Glenn Beck, that's a commie son of a bitch who wrote that. His name's Alexander Zaitchik, so my friends at the CIA, if you're listening, you might want to investigate that son of a gun. You can listen to Glenn Beck arguing with idiots, or Glenn Beck, an inconvenient book. You can listen to Glenn Beck, the Federalist case for the Constitution adapted for the 21st century, or you can listen to the Seven Wonders That Will Change Your Life by Glenn Beck, or why not check out The Christmas Sweater by Glenn Beck, or even read Broke, the plan to restore our trust, truth, and treasure by Glenn Beck, or you can listen to The Snow Angel by Glenn Beck, or go listen to Idiots Unplugged by Glenn Beck, or if you really want to listen to a great book, go check out The Real America, a message from the Heart and Heartland by Glenn Beck, or a more ominous book, you can check out America's March to Socialism, Why We're One Step Closer to Giant Missile Parades by the Great Glenn Beck, True Patriot. These books are read by Glenn Beck, and I highly recommend you check them out. If you go to audible trial, forward slash family hour, and put my name in, you'll get a free audio book. You got to sign up for a trial membership, but you can cancel it at any time, and you get one of these free audiobooks, which I highly recommend. Go to audible.com. Also, they send us 15 bucks, so it's a way for you to help support the podcast. Another way that you could support the podcast is by going to amazon.com. We have an Amazon portal through our website. I've recently discovered the amazing, awe-inspiring truth that I don't have to leave my house anymore, thanks to amazon.com. You need file folders. You don't have to go to Staples and breathe that weird toxic air that fills up a Staples, that strange mix of cleanser. God knows what anarchists are doing in there. That's one thing I don't like about a lot of office companies is they don't do background checks on many of the people who use the office supplies, and a lot of these people are buying papers so that they can print out anti-government messages and mail them to kids, or drop them, put them in playgrounds, or drop them from trees over kids playing in playgrounds. It's pretty irresponsible of some of these companies to not do background checks to find out who's buying all this paper, but you don't have to go to these. You don't have to support these companies anymore. You can just go straight to amazon.com, straight through the portal located at dunkintrustle.com. We have an Amazon portal. The next time you're going to Amazon, go through our portal. Let yourself slide into our portal and buy whatever you're going to buy on Amazon. They give us a small percentage. The most direct way to support this podcast is by going to dunkintrustle.com. We just got a whole new fresh batch of t-shirts in. We're all stocked up again. We sold out of everything. Get them while you can because when they sell out, because of my, maybe things have changed, but in the past, because of my stoner, stoner irresponsibility, it would take two months to restock the shop. So go to dunkintrustle.com and check out the shop, buy some shirts, go to Amazon, go to Audible. Today's episode of the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour is actually yesterday's episode of the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's actually several weeks ago, I did this podcast with my friend and former lover, Natasha Legerro. Natasha is a famous comedian. She's on Chelsea Lately. She has been on a series on NBC called Free Agents. She has Comedy Central, Half Hour Special floating out there. She's done various hilarious web episodes. She's appeared in numerous movies and is a comedy mogul respected by all and known as the most famous comedian on earth. Please, as you listen to this episode, understand that this happened, I think it was a month ago. So I was significantly depressed. This is before I went to this Rom Doss retreat. Before I got abducted by the CIA, I was in a really bad state. So don't get bummed out if I say some negative, dark, weird, drug-addled things in this episode. But the truth is during that time, I was negative and dark and drug-addled. But now I've seen the light and the only drug I need is the sweet smell of a freshly made flag blowing in the winds of America. Nothing gets you as high as that. Nothing gets you as high as freedom. That's the truth. So everybody, please welcome on this Memorial Day weekend or whatever weekend you happen to be listening to this on brilliant comedian and former co-host of the greatest podcast of all time, The Lavender Hour, Natasha Legerro. What was the worst thought you thought of me being small? You were just like, oh, she seems like a child? No, no, no, not at all. I just haven't seen you and probably. But why would I get mad if you told me I seemed small? As I recall, you didn't, you never liked it with people call you small or recording. Former co-host of the much-loved, now lost in the sands of time, The Lavender Hour, chomping on bread like the old days, Natasha Legerro. Hi. Hi. I'm just trying to annoy my enemies. Do you think your enemies are listening? I bet. That's a dedicated enemy. No, you know, you're fans, people who don't like me. You think my fans don't like you? Probably some of them. Well, I think that's pretty dumb, not from you, but I don't know why my fans, my fans. But when we turn on the mic, you were telling me that I seemed really small. Well, when you say it like that, it seems like I was being a dick. And I don't think I was. Because I know when I'm being a dick, like when I'm being an asshole, I can feel the anger. You can feel it, can't you? Yeah. Like, you can say whatever you want, but people, you know, you can just tell. Yeah, it's what, well, exactly. It doesn't matter what the sentence is. If they, if you have anger behind it, the whole thing gets fouled. And I know when I said that, I didn't feel any kind of anger at all. Just it was sort of, it was weird that it even came out of my mouth. Because then I thought, oh, you sound like an asshole. I don't mean to sound like an asshole. You're beautiful. You're a beautiful girl. You know that. No, I didn't mean, I just think it's the small thing. It's funny. Oh, because that reminded me, because you were saying that were you being an asshole? But this guy told me the other night, he said, last night I was talking to this kind of bro. And as soon as I started talking to him, he goes, you're at a nine right now and I need you at a six. Wow. That is stunning. He said it to me twice. And like, I was at the Soho house at this like MTV movie awards after party, but it was very small. Like there was only like 30 people at the party. And so I knew this guy from something before. But like, I just had never been talked to like that. And I think it's because I don't hang out with bros. Have you? You're at a nine right now and I need you to six. I could see like, you know how I just laughed right now? Yes. It was, I was not doing that. I was like, I mean, that's obnoxious. But I was make, I said something, you know, I laughed really loud just now. I know that's like, I could see if I was at a small party, like a cocktail party. And I did that huge cackle. Someone would say, you're at a nine right now and I need you to six. No, but no, no one says that. That's a control freak. Like you, that's beyond even telling someone I wish you would calm down a little bit because it's like, you've turned them into. I was just like talking to him about nothing. I mean, but I'm just a little more animated maybe than like an average person. How did you respond? I was just kind of shocked. I was like, are you serious? And I'm like, I just, I barely said anything. I mean, I think I was kind of honest because I know it. Oh, is that neg-wrapping? Yeah. Right. I know that people say that. But what does neg stand for? Because that neg-wrapping doesn't really make sense to me. It's just like, you, the idea is you throw off, like you throw out a quick passive aggressive insult to knock broken people off kilter in the, in the hopes that. But I'm not broken. No, I know, but you just do it in as a general rule. You mean to women? Yeah. No, to, I mean, no, it's. Neg-wrapping is for broken people. Neg-wrapping is the idea that by throwing a monkey wrench into the gears of an insecure person's machine, you will cause them to stutter to the point where they don't understand what's happening and you've brought. But who's to judge who's insecure? These, there are people who try to fuck their way out of a hole. So if they feel like they've been placed into some kind of hole by you, like if you've like knocked them down or like hurt them in some weird way, like if you've thrown a piece of ontological gravel at the windshield of their life, those cracks, they think the way they can fix it, the way they can gain control again is by fucking you. You're not one of those people, but there are people out there who they wield power through solely through their sexuality. I don't know. I think they're just being dicks. The bros? Yeah. Oh, no. I don't think it's that. And I don't think it's that in depth. I think it's just a misogynistic culture. I wouldn't, no woman could ever talk to a man like that. That is like a very misogynistic. But there's theory behind it. It's not like the theory dominance. Right. Well, I mean, that's that's the problem with a bro is he's trying to dominate. He does not understand. He did not go to what the kind of college you went to. He didn't go to Warren Wilson College where they didn't shave their legs. Right. But what is that called? It's called a liberal arts liberal arts school. Right. Yeah, they don't do that. They go to state schools and do sports stuff. And so they're just kind of like monsters. I think there's also a testosterone thing happening too, where they're just like totally jacked up on like deep, deep levels of testosterone. And that all, but that whole aspect of the spectrum, assuming the guy is not just like some idiot who says that to people and assuming he's using some kind of seduction trick, that level of seduction is so beyond anything, any woman of any substance would ever respond to. Yeah, I think that it's I think that the fish, if you have a brain, you do not respond to that. Right. So but that means that you're reeling in these like plastic kind of like fucked up people. And then you end up fucking them. Oh, right. And that's like that's like a whole subculture. Right. That's not really a subculture. Hookup culture. Yeah. So you end up. Yeah. So you're weird hookup culture hookup culture. So it's just like people just tan people fucking each other in the underbelly of LA. Yeah. I mean, I don't like that. I think it is. And I would say that it's like a am I approved because that doesn't seem I don't think I could ever live in that world because people live there. Right. It just depends on how it just depends on like how you want to get your kicks. You've got to like, right, because some people can compartmentalize and I think men in particular can compartmentalize and they can just, you know, think of sex as this thing they have to go do. So they'll go into that underworld and get it done and then go back to like life and like, you know, create and do whatever they do. But I think for a woman, she kind of has to live in it all. Does that make sense at all? Well, yeah, I mean, that's I know what you're saying. Oh, but I think some women probably can live there. But I don't think I could. You're not what you're not like that. You wouldn't, I guess you wouldn't go to like, just fuck a bunch of people just to see what it was like. No, and I'm sure some woman would. Oh, I think there's something to be said for. I mean, I think it's an important thing to do. I mean, I think that people would kind of people who I respect would look down on me because I don't think I could do that. The more you the thing that I've realized is the more that you go and do things that you think are disgusting or you think are like whatever it is, sex being like one very small aspect of it, then you what happens is you sort of pop the bubble of wonder because then you know. And then when you know, you get wisdom. When you know what? Well, you know what what it's like, you know what it is. Anything. So many people. You're right. You're right. There's so many people who have this just general this part of themselves that they're terrified of. And then so that thing grows in the dark. And then what ends up happening is the thing like it's too big. And then it comes out at the wrong time. And then they like end up getting confused. Whatever it is, it does not just sex. It's so many different things. But it's like every you should just try everything. I'm not telling you to go out and get in a hookup culture. You'll get aids. I like that way of looking at things, though, to just try everything. Not everything. Try the stuff that you're terrified of. It's like the stuff that you feel dirty about or the stuff that you feel like, oh, what's wrong with me that I would want. I don't know if I have many things like that. You might not. But some people do. What's wrong with me that I want to spend two weeks decorating? Do it. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. That's what I want to do. I don't want to let go fuck some teenagers who still live at home. No, exactly. They're assholes at the same time or whatever you guys want to do in hookup culture. My point. What was the scenario? I don't know. Two licking teenagers assholes. Like at the same time in their parents' bedrooms. I'm just trying to think of what a man. That's what bubbled up out of your subconscious. Honestly, no, I was trying to think of what a man is into. Sure. I was trying to think of the most ridiculous scenario. Yeah. Look, maybe you should decorate while you have some teenagers teenage asshole around the lick. I love decorating. I really do. When I think of a dark side of me, that's like the darkest side that I want to like quit what I feel like is my life and career and just decorate. But I don't want to stop at my house. I feel like it's like an instinct. I would love to. I need help. I like to decorate. Yeah. Well, all that stuff is like, I say do it. Just do it. But then it's like, then what about all the things I'm trying to write right now? And this, you know, like trying to like, you know, finish projects. No, I know, I know. I mean, so for me, that would be dropping out of society. But the, what I've noticed is that every time that I do something that's like or scares me, if I can find something that terrifies me and just do it, the result is the creativity comes exploding after that. It's just like, I used to say that to me. You would always say like, follow the energy. Like, because I was taking tap dancing classes and you were like, you know, however, and I would feel guilty. I always feel guilty when I'm doing something. That's not exactly what I'm supposed to be doing. But you were like, you know, you have to follow the creative energy because it just is running through you. So if it's running through you to do certain things, and it's very hard to like split up your time. Yeah, you know, especially when you're traveling, you know, like you've got like two days in LA. Well, you know, the thing is that you end up locked into this. Yeah, you just have to look at what you're in and just make sure you're not locked in. Like you're not the man in the iron mask and you've locked yourself into this. What's the story of the man in the iron mask? It's a punishment where they lock you, they lock this giant iron thing onto your face and throw away the key. So you end up with, you know, what do they say? Fame is a mask that melts the face. You have to like, you have to make sure that you're not locked into something that you don't want to be doing. And then you have to be really honest about that with yourself. And maybe the only way you can find that is by like following that creative energy, no matter where it takes you, if it takes you to like a teenager's asshole, or if it takes you to like redecorating your ex-boyfriend's apartment. House. I'm just saying. But yeah, I think that, um, yeah, I think that the, the tab you're saying you don't want to get stuck in a way of being that isn't you. I'm saying you've got to find something that scares you. Why? Well, because that's when you know you've sailed into the deep waters. But don't those things just find you? How do you find something that scares you? Like your mom just died. That probably scares you. That helped. So it's like, it's happening from the world. You know, I mean, like the bombings today, that kind of scared me a little. I don't mean that kind of fear. It's like, here's a really dumb version of it. Parachuting. Jump out of an airplane. Go do that. It's terrifying. I wouldn't do that. That would scare the shit out of me, but I know that if I did it, the end result would be this like thing I learned. And, and I think that- What do you think you'd learn? Well, I would have conquered a very, uh, I would have conquered fear and I'd know what it would be like to plummet towards the earth from very high up. Now, that's an easy trick. People do that all the time, but it's that idea. Like if you consider like, oh fuck, man, being up in a plane, having to jump out of the thing, the possibility, however small, that the parachute's not going to open. Well, that would terrify you. That would put you in such an intense place that you would, you would be way outside of your comfort zone. Yeah. Remember you told me to, you, you, when, when, um, maybe it was like two years ago, you like had me go to the hospice and you were on the same jag about like watching people die. And so like I had, I like went to like, and I wanted to just go volunteer at the hospice because you talked about it, but then I had to like go to like six week course once a week. And then I finally got to the end of the course and then you had to like go get your blood taken and I never did it. So I never even got to experience it, but you would always talk about like going to like see dead people or people who were like right on the verge of dying and how it affected you. And I think like those kinds of extreme experiences, you're right. If you can, if you, the more those you can seek out, I think the better. Definitely. Definitely. And then especially if there's like things that you feel, but how do you do it? How do you get there? That's what I mean. I tried to do it. I went to that six week course and then I could never go downtown and get the blood test. So I never even got to experience the thing you're talking about. It's kind of hard. That's why it's like when it happens to you, maybe it's good. Is that bad to say? You mean like when death happens to you or when tragedy or catastrophe strikes? I don't know. I definitely don't want tragedy in my life. So you're saying through skydiving, you can like recreate that kind of feet, those intense feelings. I'm using that as a very lame example, but I'm saying that there's got, there's got it in the majority of people. There's a string of aspects of themselves that they're terrified of. And all those are, whatever it is, as simple as just ducking out of your job for a day, calling in sick for no reason, just whatever it is. I found that those experiences tend to be so juicy and really like so. Have you called in sick for no reason lately? Yes. You have? I haven't done the podcast in weeks. No, this is the first one? No, I recorded one with Emo on that I'm going to release tomorrow, but this is the second one I've done since my mom died, but I went into a- Your mom died like three days ago. Yeah, but she was sick for, it was like, I went over, I was there for two weeks. I was there for two weeks, and then I went on tour for a week, and then she died when I got back. So it was like a month total that I was out of LA. And during that time out, the only podcast I did was with her. Those were great. Thanks. I really liked those. Yeah, well, they were, they were, I mean, I can't listen to them. Well, because your mother's so smart. I mean, she was a therapist and, you know, she's very wise, and she's very wise about emotional things. And, you know, I think it was great. And then to have, to be in the midst of these, this experience you're talking about, the two of you together, and to have that recorded, it was very cool to listen to. It was cool. She did that. It was very graceful the way she died too. Yes. And it doesn't seem like something, I mean, in her worst moods, she would not have agreed to that. Yeah. Like your mom's not easygoing. We can, we can agree that your mom's not an easygoing person. When she started to die, that, a lot of that changed, though some of it was still there, but it's as you, as you, when you die, you, all these little, just layers start falling away from you, that all the bullshit layers start falling away. And you get into this place where you just, or truth, you're just in this place of just pure truth, for better or for worse, your truth, you know, your own subjective truth. And there's something so powerful in that. It was really amazing watching her become that, what that is. But you don't have to die to do that. But it, yeah, you don't have to die to get to that place. It is strange how like parents change, because I feel like my mother has changed a lot. She's gotten very like, am I getting too somber? No, somber. Look at my podcast. My podcast turned somber. I don't even know. We can't even call this a comedy podcast anymore. I'm kind of goddamn soap opera. I got cancer. My mom died. You can't even, it doesn't even qualify on iTunes anymore. iTunes anymore. No. This is no longer, I wanted it. Do you go into, do you go into like, you're in like, like, like a philosophical section of iTunes? They don't have a section for it. What section are you on in iTunes now? I don't know. It's some sort of the Job section. But I, again, I don't really feel that being said, I'm joking. I don't feel like I've been through catastrophe at all. I don't, none of it really strikes me as catastrophe. It just is a radical change, which is something that I knew and I've studied for a long time. And I know that the transmutation of matter can happen unexpectedly and generally does. And then suddenly you're in an uncompletely different dimension. Coming into the presence of it, though, it's been pretty, pretty, pretty, it's been beautiful. Getting that close to having such like intense things happen in such a short period of time is a great teaching. It's a beautiful thing. It seems so weird when you say that, but it really does. Underneath it all, it seems quite beautiful. I mean, you know how old the earth is? 16 billion six. No, that's older than the universe. The universe is only 13.4 billion years old. The earth is 6.3 or something million billion billion billion, maybe four, four to six. It's been around for a very long time. But if you consider that the earth is four billion years old, and our tiny little minuscule lifespans are 60 years, then you understand quickly that the whole thing is a catastrophe. I mean, we are the rate of speed with which we're plunging into oblivion is compared to the amount of time the earth has been here. It's almost light speed. We're here. We really are fireflies. We're here for this one little flicker. So it doesn't feel like a flicker. It's a flicker. It does, though. Sometimes like, if you think of something you did, think of the last vacation you went on. Sometimes when you're at the vacation, you're like, there's so much going through your mind. But then as soon as the vacation's over, you're like, oh, look at those moments that I wasn't experiencing. Yeah, right. And it just becomes this quick little movie show of nothingness and blips. So your life is going to be like that. Yes, that's it. That kind of fake vacation. Exactly. That's exactly it. So it's like, the more that you can find out, OK, well, where am I really faking it? Like, what parts of me are really faking it? And then when you know that, then you can just do a reversal and think, well, what's the opposite of that? What would the opposite of that look like? Then you do that. And it fills you with the greatest fear. I mean, that feeling is so fucking awesome when you really get that fear. The fear? What, you think fear helps you live in the moment? Take the morphine. Why does it have to be about morphine? I'm just saying, like, when that was one thing, I was scared. I was, my mom had a bottle of liquid morphine, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I should try this. She did not seem fucked up. And then I was scared. Well, she wasn't then. Then after you. Did you take some? Yes. Morphine? Liquid morphine. You take it in a drop or what happened? It's kind of a kind of like Vicodin. It just makes you really tired and heavy and gives you really close. Let's try to think of ways of entering that space with that isn't like drugs. No, that's limiting. Well, I mean, no, because if you don't get there from your will, like, if you don't figure out how to like live in the moment in a vacation in without drugs, you know, like if you want to get to that place where you can like understand life or you don't really know it, because then you always need the drugs. No, I'm just saying as an example, that that was terrifying. I'm not saying go out and be a drug addict, but I am saying that there's like, go past where the lifeguards tell you to go. No. That's the advice. I think that's great advice. But it'll kill you. Oh, really? Exactly. But what if you just try it? Exactly the same way. Try morphine once is not going to kill you if you did or twice. But if you did it like, I just am getting a vibe that maybe you did it twice. No, I did. I did the morphine. Oh, I did it twice. But then I moved from the morphine to Dilaudid, which is like pharmaceutical grade heroin. So then like, because she had like an infinite amount of Dilaudid. How much of that did you take? I took a lot of that. I took it. Really? Did you throw up? Is it a is it a narcotic in the sense that you throw up like an opiate? I didn't throw up, but I got you get this like, you get this kind of itchiness, but it's like the most beautiful itchiness. On Dilaudid? Yeah. So you go into like junky mode where you start itching yourself and then were you alone? Like it must not be very social. I wasn't alone. I was with my brother. But like he on it to as a tool to kind of deal with the fact that mama died and we are both just I mean, no, I understand. We're just blasted from it from the experience. So like my I have all these like escape hatches that I use to try to avoid reality. And one of those is is narcotics. And the experience is is divine. It's a I mean, this is like, but you can't get there without doing it. That's the problem is not that you know, you can. The problem is the dopamine hangover, which is that when you after you stop taking them the next couple of days, you feel bleary and depressed and tired and then it's just not worth it. I mean, I don't think I could get addicted because of the come downs to it's brutal. But that's I mean, that's the problem is the it's the exchange is very expensive neurologically because you get this explosion of bliss like crazy bliss like you really do. I could see like why jazz musicians get into into narcotics because you get this like crazy moment of everything is suddenly perfect followed by two days of like grumpiness. So fuck that. But it's good to try it. Try it once. God, I'm a horrible role model. The problem is I've the more this thing has become popular, the more I know that there are teenagers who listen to this and you guys should not do this. Don't listen to me when I'm honestly, I didn't do I didn't even get stoned till I was like 27. But see, everyone's got so much information right now. But I think it's bad to get to get, you know, on drugs too early. I think they should be used like intelligently as like an adult. Well, I'm to get you to these places that you're talking about. And then you try to get there in life maybe or like when you said like last night I was at my friend's house and we were watching um what's it called um hip hop wives of Atlanta. Yes. And the commercials like I hadn't watched commercials in so long because I don't really have TV. The commercials are just like I felt like I got someone on lsd who would like just like who could not understand what was happening. Like commercials are so crazy. They're so clearly pandering to people and they just pretend like they're doing this thing that is like not true. Yeah. It's so obvious. Right. Like the fact that that's how people are getting like creating empires like from tricking dumb people. It just seems so intense. Yeah. That yeah. So I felt like that thing like when people take lsd and they're able to see the world for what it really is. That's why people don't want people on lsd because then they won't be able to work jobs and live in these like terrible breeding pods. Breeding grids. The grids that's what I meant. The grids you know and work nine to five. Oh man. But that's how I so I think that if drugs can take you to that place where you can understand it and then like take it with you in your life that's good because it expands your mind. It's a confusing thing. Well it's not just drugs. I mean it's the main thing is like you find the boundary that you are keeping your find the prison that you've locked yourself in. Drugs is drugs is like skydiving. It's kind of a cliche way to go into like the because sobriety is cool in the day. Like when you're working really hard on something and you haven't had a drink and you're not smoking pot like. Yeah. I think sobriety is pretty cool. I guess. I mean I don't know. It's like sobriety. What is sobriety. You know you look and you see like all the different ways people are getting off you know coffee cigarettes antidepressants. It's like yeah I don't know. I mean you're right. It's just a form of something. I mean sobriety is a is you know you. Yeah like just to say you're sober because you don't. It's like the V. It's like the very similar to and this is a joke that a few comics I know do various jokes about Rogan does a joke about like you like there's no such thing as a vegan who doesn't tell you they're a vegan like you know right away in the same way you know with sober people it's like it's not just like they tell you they're like they're sober. It's like a thing. It's like no that's not true. I don't think that's true. I think there's lots of different types of sober people. I think there's people who've never had a drink or sober people. Oh yeah there's that but I'm saying like the inevitable ex addict who's like got a fucking right but that's not that's not every sober person in any way. No it's not every sober person. I'm just saying that people have like an axe to grind. My hope my only comment is that you don't it doesn't have to just come from drugs that's all I want to say. No no no I mean I that's just one route one way in. There's a lot of different ways. I just think the smarter you can get yourself the better. I think you have the ideas and to get smart you expand. That's what you do you expand. That's something my mom told me that on her deathbed expand and I've been thinking about that a lot like what does that mean expand. That's what your mom told you on her deathbed. Did she have like last words? Wait were you there for her when she died? No. So when did she tell you that and during the podcast? She told me that when I was I honestly I don't I can't listen to the podcast. I won't be able to listen to it for years but so I don't remember everything that was said but is because she told me you know do this tour. You should go do the tour don't cancel it. So oh I know. She told me I think it's good because it could have lasted for three months. Well she just wanted me to do it and she told me during the tour she was like you know expand go beyond what you are comfortable with and then I thought about that a lot and then I started to think like oh if I want to expand on stage then I have to start expanding in my life and expanding doesn't mean like good things a lot of the times or it doesn't mean doing what you the being the best version of you. That's not expanding. It isn't? No that's being like you know that's mommy issues or that's being what like what your daddy wanted you to be. That's not expanding at all that's just being more of a robot. So you think expanding is getting pushed to the dark pull to the dark side. I know it can be the light side too there is no dark side but the light side would mean that you're trying to get better. Well no this is like for me I'm trying to run in the morning so like for me waking up at like 8 a.m. when I like went to bed at 3 and jogging my dogs for like two miles. Virtuous. I'm saying though that's expanding myself absolutely not coming from like succumbing to a dark side. No that's succumbing to like the light. Yeah no discipline is you could do both. I think you should do both. I mean I think when you get the imbalance between one or the other is when you start getting really annoying like if you become too dark and you're suddenly like this kind of untalented Elliot Smith or what's the opposite of goth like a cheerleader. The opposite of goth would be you know yeah or Hooters waitress. Yeah it's a it's it's definitely a balance. I mean I really don't know yet I just like from my mom dying I got thrown into such I got I went crazy and so then because I was crazy I stopped caring what anybody thought and then because I didn't care what anybody thought then I like I started like letting myself go to really strange places and then that is like like what kind of place re-envigorated me a lot of weird places. I can't I can't even talk about some of them yet. I'm still trying to think of ways to articulate it but the effect has been incredible. The effect is always like the reward is like hilarious I mean for stand-up it's incredible the experience. I mean when you can like throw yourself into places that you don't feel comfortable telling anyone that you did that. Like what? There's a million but there's a lot of hilarious things that you can do on this planet that are like taboo or weird and the more that you do that the more you learn and the more you learn the more intelligent I think you become or at least the more angles that you have. Well that's what I love about travel that expands you. Yes yes travel and that's a positive expansion. Yes you can travel that's it. But I mean like going to countries and seeing how people live that you had no idea. Oh yeah. Seeing how people in Ohio live. I mean that's frightening. You just you know remember that thing like when we were going when we were performing with you when you came up to San Francisco you didn't perform it was you, me, Neil and Turkington. I came a day late. Tim Heidecker. I don't remember. I didn't see the show. You didn't see the show but remember how Greg took us to this off the route to go home. He took us to some dilapidated shit city and we went to get ice cream in that strange place where it was like it was like these two weird man just like an ice cream parlor in the middle of this dilapidated town that he had like weird like kids music playing. Yes and then we went to some ice cream was terrible and then he took us to this like stinky other town where you could smell like a slaughter house or something like the air was almost unbreathable and that was not the where we should have gone. He took us out off the path and he brought us to these two things on purpose. Do you think? Yeah because it's so out there. It's such a flying off into the swimming off into the deep water. That's what I love about him. Yeah because he's a well I mean yeah he's a brilliant artist and and that's his impulse is to do things like that. Now that ice cream shop was straight out of David Lynch. That was hilarious. That thing was like waiting for. And we had to wait for ice cream for like 40 minutes and then he was wasn't he playing like Oprah like so there was something like really banal on the TV. I think it was like Looney Tunes. Looney Tunes was playing but then there was like court TV I don't know it was pretty intense. So. And there was like an abandoned shopping center from the 50s like across the street. It was great. You'll never forget that. You'll never forget that. I'll never forget the feeling of being in that town. Right. That is the thing. That is the thing. Like those experiences you remember they stick out whether they're like positive like oh you're drinking a kale shake or something. The truth of the matter is is like most of these positive things they're generally like they're the potency is diminished. It's it's at least for me. Everything's diminished. No it's diminished because it's positive. Well no. It's healthy. I don't know. I mean like I go jogging and I do like. I'm just saying doing what's outside your comfort zone. That's all. It is not it's my it's in my comfort zone to sleep until 9 30. That's like how that's like really easy for me and that and and maybe I would love life more if I did that. No no no I know what you're saying. Getting up and like making yourself get up out of bed that's hard. No no no that's good. That's a beautiful thing to do. That is a that's a great way to throw yourself off is to set your alarm for you know you're going to feel great in like an hour and 20. Yeah you set your alarm for 5am. No not 5am. Sometimes you set your alarm for 5am. 7am. 5. That's too extreme. But these are for I'm talking about for people a lot of people earn a rut. Right. You set it for 5am. Right. And then what you do is your alarm goes off and you will not you'll just think that what you did was a whim. And you're like what did I I'm not really taking this seriously. So that and then you go into a state of mindfulness and you look at that part of your being that's saying oh I'm this isn't real I'm not taking this seriously and then you'll see one part of your being that's not your whole being that's just the entropic part. And so then what you do is you push yourself out of bed and you stand up and you have this vertigo because it's 5am and you only slept a few hours and your head feels heavy and you force yourself away from the bed. I am just now feeling good though and I woke up this morning at 8am. It's like it's like you also need to get your sleep. You torment but it's good to torment the the beast. It's good to stick pokers into the hide of the beast and send it squealing out of its little nest for a little bit to show it show it who's boss. It is good to do that. I mean that's operation. That's the whole point because the beast by the way the beast doesn't want to do weird dark shit either. The beast wants to watch TV. The beast wants to be inside. The beast wants to do the most mediocre lame lazy median thing. It doesn't want to do some crazy shit. The beast is lazy. The beast is not some slavering fucking thing that's going off into gutters seeking out the dark moments or flying into the heights to experience the beauty of discipline and raising your opening your third eye through diet and yoga. The beast wants to enjoy cable air conditioning. But you're saying you can tame the beast. I'm saying you can torment the beast. By tormenting it though I feel like there's great returns. Definitely. I mean the beast doesn't create. Then you're like wait I did that. It's like almost like you're not your comfort. Yeah freedom is greater than comfort. Is that a saying. That is a saying. But in freedom is not being enslaved by the thing. Again you know this is just one version of reality by the way if you want to like slip into some entropic pig version of yourself go ahead and do it. Just do it. If that's what you're desiring I say go for it. Fucking do it. I mean that's the dive into the goddamn tar pit. Why not swim around in the fucking thing. I mean because that's the other side of it is you can fight it all you want but you will get sucked back into the whirlpool inevitably. It's let's cut to a collar and see what they think. I'm hungry. I was do you think people would want to have this. You should take collars. I know but then I would have one. Because you're like talking about it's like the opposite of when they're taking collars like okay we got two free tickets to see Duncan Trussell in Philadelphia. Yeah I would like to take collars once I get the. How big do you think Duncan's dick is. Call in if you got the right number. Two free tick. Can we give away two free ticks. What show is that. I don't know I feel like morning radio has that kind of vibe. Morning radio does not say how big is their dick. They don't. You know that. Well like serious radio you know because there's like a new well there's a new kind of radio you do now that's not quite morning radio it's like morning radio that doesn't have restrictions. So they get perverted sometimes. How big is your dick. I'm just saying perverted as opposed to. I mean we should probably cut to a break or something. We're back. I mean just making us pause for no reason after like a joke about the size of my cock only makes it seem so suspicious and exciting. I don't remember what my point was but I do think going outside of your comfort zone is cool. I started doing this thing on a Sunday from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday you use no technology. What is it. It's like a technology Shabbat. So from like sundown Friday to sundown Saturday you're not supposed to use any technology and they call it a Shabbat because like have you ever met someone like who's Jewish who like I remember one time I was working a job and we needed a Jewish person person to sign something and they're like I can't sign anything today. Yeah like from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown you can't do any commerce. Did you see that picture of the rabbi. Yeah in the in the bag on the airplane. Why was he like that. Um he was like that from what I read he was like that because you can't cross over cemeteries. So his idea was by he routed the plane that he was going on. Is this his first time traveling. I mean well no the comment someone made on Reddit was or why don't you put yourself in thick steel and plastic like what a plane's made out of. You know like the plane's already made of material a million times stronger than a garbage bag. So by putting the garbage bag around you to try to avoid. Who took that picture. That was probably one of 17 pictures that were because he kind of. That was like last week like I straight up just got on the internet. He looked like a. God I wish it was on that flight gift pack. I thought it was like something that you would write like you would get from like a holiday party like a rabbi wrapped in a floral like wrapping. It was hilariously stupid. I mean this is the problem. I mean that's a problem. There is a problem. What's the problem. The problem is that these fundamentalists are ruining the planet. That's the problem. Right. Well so that is actually a good segue into my point which is you know it used to be you'd hear about people doing this 10 years ago to do a technology you know because obviously if you can't even sign a signature during that 24 hour period how would you how would you go on the internet. You know you're not supposed to do any technology any commerce. So so now I think more than it was 10 years ago now that we all have the internet we're all addicted straight up addicted to our phones. We're all addicted like everyone's addicted to the internet. Today those horrible things happened in in D.C. was it D.C. Boston Boston the the marathons you know and people are tweeting things and it was the marathon that was horrible was the explosions. Right. Right. But you know the fact that there's terrorism starting and even though three people died like they're going to start scaring people and small acts of terrorism are going to start happening and creeping up this is not a prediction this is just what I'm assuming from this news of today. Right. Although you're going to put this podcast up in two weeks why don't you put this one up before emails. I can. Well I'm just saying okay well then it won't be relevant anymore but it'll totally be they're going to be talking about the Boston bombings for the next five years. It's going to be relevant I mean there's going to be but I do think like a lot of comedians are tweeting all these positive things and all this like spiritual things and everyone's saying my thoughts are with you but at the same time like when a famous person tweets that they get like 6,000 retweets you know and I think that there's still this thing of like people like checking their phones checking their phones like you can't just even say anything positive and helpful to try to help people without like also having this vanity aspect. You know what I will say I think it's very important to take 24 hours a day 24 hours a week off of the internet and that's why it's different than how it was Judaism like the Shabbat 10 years ago. The one thing that was a bit of a surprise when I got cancer when my mom died was how good it made me feel when I got messages from people. I didn't expect like I would care. That's a very good way to look at it. But the something about and when you get into like a really fucked up place just the tiniest little flicker of light is so mean so much. That's what's so funny about comedians we're here to blow out the light. You think? I mean in some ways like when something like this happens I feel like in the 60s when something bad happened people try to figure out how can we help but now there's this feeling of like how can I make a joke about it like that's how I know about most of my new exorcism. It's from trying to make jokes about shows that I have to do that are about like these political things that are actually very serious and very dark and you're like trying to think of jokes about it. It was you know what? Very hard to think about jokes about like terrible things. When you look at the master exorcist of our time right now is Louis C. K. and he does this profound sort of confessional slash observation style comedy where he's sort of fessing up to being exactly himself not that great a guy but yet somehow through the honesty the thing it shifted into like something beautiful and then and then in it Carl and Esk in a Carl and Esk way kind of deconstructs popular ideas and but somehow through that it lightens everything up somehow through it. I mean that was something when like I could I would talk to some of my close friends and they would say some of the most awful things to me about my cancer about my mom dying as jokes as jokes and awful closest friends the most offensive things that you've ever heard friends with Ari and Brendan Walsh so they would they would say like they would say these they would say these like someone tell me Brendan Walsh comes up to the Game of Thrones soundtrack or to the theme song that's his opening he is so funny he's such a he's such a funny sweet guy and he he uh I'm not gonna say but I would never say say it what he said because then people wouldn't people unless you're a comedian you it's fun to be friends with people that dark though is it nice to have people around you that are that dark but every time he every time one of these people would say some awful thing it didn't offend me it made the whole thing brighten up because it's like oh thank god they're not taking this seriously and then I don't have to take it as seriously and and it is absurd no matter what so that so that's what I'm saying like I know yeah sure a comedian says some sweet thing on on Twitter in relation to people in Boston whose mother's legs just got blown off by a bomb but I'm telling you if for whatever reason those people are on Twitter it's made them feel better in a small through the shock through the horror it's just a blanket it's just a psychic blanket is vapid the reason behind it may be you're right just do it I'm telling you do it for the fucking vanity still better than not doing it do it because you're some dirty pig and you want to get as many fucking twitter followers as you can do it right but if if your brother died or your mother or whoever and then Lindsay Lohan like sent a shout out you'd probably feel like you know a little bit just for a second it would make you feel better maybe it made me feel better maybe not Lindsay Lohan no I'm just going to get someone who I saw today who had like 6000 retweets Lohan would make me feel great any of them what any of them like what is that that that that darkness it's it's very interesting what darkness the comedian's darkness to like instinctively think of like the worst possible it's not dark that's my whole point of all this all the stuff I was saying earlier is there's no darkness when you go into these places that's when you start seeing like oh shit this is this is fine and then you realize all if this is fine what else is fine and then you start realizing everything's fine and then when you realize everything's fine then you finally get to the place you're like oh I'm okay I'm not a demon I'm not some fucked up loser I'm not a terrible person everything that I thought was shameful about me was just me and then from that that kind of that that'll propel you into like jogging or that'll propel you into like suddenly getting out of the pit it's like the most vile people are the ones who have their backs turned to what they really are I hear you so if being a vain son of a bitch means you know tweeting some vapid thing okay I hear you but what I wanted to say about the Shabbat yes which reminded me of what we were talking about getting out of your comfort zone is that this girl was telling me who I was doing with my friend Sophia she said that her rabbi told her because I'm like you know during this 24 hours when I don't go on the internet like sometimes if I'm going to be spending 24 hours at home like not like connecting with nature not talking about not checking my out replies not uh you know returning emails and driving and like freaking out and like doing all this stuff if I'm going to be doing this but I might also want to like watch movies yeah or like do something that's like inspiring but she said her rabbi said in those 24 hours just do what you don't normally do right so if you could spend 24 hours a day doing what you don't normally do disconnected from the internet and disconnected from architecture what do you mean architecture I don't normally do architecture what's that mean I could like make architectural plans yeah you could do that but I'm just saying like if you if you feel like no if you feel like the internet's like getting to you a little bit like I I cannot stop checking my email while I'm driving yeah no no no that's bad no you're right the internet is a terrible it's like in I'm like always checking it like I'm I'm checked out of most conversations like like podcasts are the like the longest conversations I have where I'm not on my email yes it's a problem I don't know why you're trying to tell me it's not what the internet yeah no the internet's a problem I it's it's also amazing you know it's magic but at the same time it's like it's a bit of an issue right now there's this uh have you ever read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse I've never called his name that but yes that's how you pronounce it if you if you revisit it spoiler he's like the first Buddha well Siddhartha was the name of the Buddha but it's the the if you haven't read it you should read it it's great I mean it's a that's a true classic true classic here's a spoiler you'd love it but one of the things you know this is sort of the spiritual journey of this son of a Brahmin who's probably represents the rich kid in this story he was the son of more like the son of a priest so he goes off to live in the in the in the beginning he goes off to live in the woods with the ascetics as Buddha did and he has this friend Govinda in the story and uh oh that's Govinda yeah yeah and so he's been um he's you know hasn't eaten he's disciplined himself to the most you know Hesse is just trying to make an example of someone who has taken jogging two miles to the furthest place you possibly can so he's gotten to the point where he hasn't eaten he's become a skeleton he can throw him like one of the passages is he throws his consciousness into a dead uh I don't know a dead lion a dead hyena side he throws his consciousness into a dead creature and experience the decomposition and the carrion pulling the flesh away from it he experiences the full like full the full nature of pure ascetic discipline and so then he's walking with Govinda and he says I could have found this out in a bar I could have found this out um hanging out in the shitty parts of town because the asceticism the holding yourself away from the thing is just seeking after a different high entirely so that's where you get into the great pinch when you begin to realize that the discipline itself the jogging the refraining is no different from the addiction to the thing it's just different versions of trying to like get induce a sense of well-being or this kind of neurological high I don't want you to take this the wrong way but you're at a nine right now and I need you to the sixth I'm so sorry what if you just started crying I'm always at a nine I know I've been trying that's very intense what you just said well no it's that was definitely like I need you to tone it down a bit so sorry that is the root of the problem though and that's that's kind of where you start losing your escape hatches but what exactly are you saying well what the the I think what Hessa was saying is that in what in Buddhism what they were saying is like there's the answer isn't in refraining and probably the answer isn't in jogging or in taking delotted yeah right it's not in any of that is it in delotted is it in jogging no those are two different ways to do it no that's where it gets really weird is there there could be no answer it just depends you know it's like it just depends on on who you talk to but what is what is Herman Hessa saying I think in that moment he's trying to express the kind of tontric notion that when you that there's no the full throttle pursuit of pleasure is identical to the full throttle disciplining of the self both are attempts to negate the ego one through intense levels of pleasure the other through intense levels of denial what if your life is just to come like a mixture that's fine I don't think we've that's the I mean I don't think there's any kind of one pathway through it at all there there's just super smart people who do great analysis of the predicament right it's it's just an analysis that's what Herman Hessa is yeah he was just trying to like illustrate the the predicament so what does he say when you when you ended is it better to take delotted or wake up at seven and go jogging I think it's pretty open ended I mean what if you could do like every like alternate every other day joggings better by the way guys if you're thinking of like if you're trying to decide between delotted and jogging pick jogging I'm just saying if you can get there you could live for a really long time if you pick jogging well if it's the same route is that good living for a long time yeah if you're healthy probably it's fun yeah I don't know I don't know I that's a confusing that's a confusing idea I don't know I guess if you're healthy I don't know whenever I like if you feel good that's great I don't know I think it's good to live for a long time I'm I don't I'm probably depressed I it's like six months six months according to the my therapist before I'm normal again so I don't know if I'm depressed I don't you seem very very much the same that's good to hear yeah I don't know it's a real pinch wherein it's a terrible predicament but I think you're getting some benefits from feeling these intense feelings that might be hard it's like when you're on a vacation you know like it all you know like you're gonna be you know you go on a vacation like I said and then you like remember the moments of it and then you weren't living in it like I think like when something tragic happens to you it's like the op like it's like a vacation but like in reverse or something and then you're feeling these intense things and like in six months just how you're thinking your your vacation from six months ago it's just gonna be like this dream state and you're gonna like imagine like the most intense parts of it and it's just gonna be like a little blip it makes you feel human that's for sure yeah it makes you feel like you're part of something like it makes you feel real that feels good feeling real feels good and then it makes you feel like everything you said before it was stupid just like oh what was I even talking about you don't even know that's where and then you feel judgmental but it's like oh now you're saying anyone whose parents haven't died they don't know but in a way you don't it's kind of the same thing people say about having a baby they're like you just don't know love I would just like to know that feeling for like two seconds is it really that great having a baby yeah like you know when everyone's saying you just don't know it's like well I'd like to feel what you feel because I probably already feel that from like you know doing my thing you're happy I'm just saying like you know everyone you're right though everyone always says that you don't know you're a happy person I am you're think I don't know I'm also like no if you wonder if you're happy you're happy you're happy you seem happy you're not I don't think you're in the doldrums I went to this Jewish mystic yes and he said don't ask God for too much he hated great shut up but I thought that was interesting because I feel like that is like a problem like you always ask for more but what if you just try to be happy with it hey I have an idea how about you don't say what the creator of infinity wants oh really when did you talk to God maybe he's hooked in yeah right I like the idea of God like what is it like an upset stomach for God when you ask for too much does God like how does it what does he get mad well just for you are you that important that when you ask for too much the creator of the entire universe gets mad well maybe he's mad because because you're not appreciating these blips like you're like your vacation I'm just sick of you know I'm like what if you're gonna can't live in the moment sorry I'm just I'm just done with fundamentalists they're just idiots you're right the fundamentalists of every all shapes and colors why well because they're retarded they're liars they're tricking people and they're goddamn fucking clowns it's like you are not telling me right now that I have to be careful about asking the creator of stars for too much is there a scale yes but by saying things like that you're just sort of doing what Herman Hess was doing how is Herman Hess any different than you know telling you through a story no no no that's a silly thing it's like my I've said this in the last podcast sorry I might tell this story three more times though because it's so amazing one of my uncles gave a eulogy for my mom I don't know why they let him do it he's a fundamentalist christian worships loon loon the great homophobic god and he came out and he's like danine used to try to psychoanalyze me if you know me you know you shouldn't do that I wonder if she's up there in heaven trying to psychoanalyze god that's probably not a good idea either he said that yeah in a funeral but this is a fun anytime anyone starts telling you what god wants or doesn't want I will I say a hundred percent they're idiots a hundred percent dumb 100 dumb all dumb all dumb that's what you should call this because imagine sitting down with someone and saying to them and meaning it this is what god wants I know but you hope that people can like are connected or something no isn't that what the bible is trying to tell you the most connected people are the least connected the most connected people are the ones who would never in a million years tell you what god wanted and a million would even use the word this is why there was like in the beginning you weren't supposed to say the name of god there's a reason for that you're supposed to be cool the meaning was don't say god just don't even it's like talking about enlightenment just don't even talk about enlightened shut up about enlightenment about either being enlightened or wanting to be enlightened I have this book called the enlightened mind that I've been reading it's all these passages from people that the author considered enlightened but the moment the person themselves claims to be enlightened well I hear you I got a pee oh hold on let me let me pause it then we'll wrap it up we're back um what a what a pleasure to see you again oh thanks been too long thanks for doing the podcasts no problem do you have um any shows coming up not this weekend I'm doing uh Bridgetown this weekend I think you should put this podcast before emails no why well you don't need to promote Bridgetown it's a festival you're in well your cares what do you have coming up after that I think I'm just gonna decorate I hope so decorate this fucking house I need help do you have a wallpaper budget yes you do I do indeed not gonna be good yeah I've got a wallpaper budget I've got a anything you know Dorothy Draper says you should never discount the ceilings as part of the room you should always paint them great great so you're gonna help me decorate

know but you're talking about like all this intensity of like you know death no you turned into this person who's like you were like twirling your hair and you had this slant to your head black keys flaming lips it was just a different different person came out but I was being I was trying to be funny okay that's all I was I was funny I thought I was funny you're funny so you're at the bottle rock I'm saying it's funny to transition from talking about all this intense like death and life and the meaning of life and not wanting to live long and these fucking bombings and massacres and then to like be like what are you promoting I got you so then all of a sudden I was like okay I guess I'm promoting you went into promotion mode yeah and I'm not I don't even need to promote what I was

see her live if she's around you anything else you want to say um I mean Jen I wish we could take a caller right now I think you should take callers next time okay I'm just telling you once we get this on video because you're talking about such deep subjects that like that would be a funny thing to be like okay let's cut to a caller I did I I didn't just the idea of like the kinds of things you're talking about like what people like what do people think about what you're saying I think that would be very interesting I did Tom Green's podcast and he takes callers but he doesn't broadcast the podcast live so people call he'll tweet we're taking callers we took callers once and didn't broadcast it live we had Tom Lennon yeah it was what he does though is because people just say well I'm not listening to the podcast because you can't listen to it but I just want to say oh there's no way to have it be going and then take callers that's what's interesting to me so they can get in on the conversation and the podcast I did his gag was he would take the call they would say hi Tom I I just wanted to call and then he just hangs up on them it's so funny he took like three it was funny to me no that is funny the lavender hour why why do you have those offline those should be online they'll they'll be back up I can pay 20 a year to keep that can you help I mean why would you get rid of that it's like 20 a year to keep that on the internet and it's off the internet that makes no sense and like someone already snatched up the the site you can't even get lavender hour dot com anymore well we'll have access to it if people want to revisit the the old days do you miss doing the lavender hour no but I do think it's like a nice you didn't like doing it no I like doing it but I don't miss it I like the proof huh you hated doing it I well that's a very weighted question you didn't like it well I liked it when I was like one of those vacations you go on like looking back I want them to exist like when that dog Blanche had all those puppies like when it was happening it felt like a goddamn nightmare but then like now that I think about all those puppies I wish I would have been like you know enjoying those moments don't live in the temple of regret okay somebody with lung cancer told me that people with the smoking issues are the worst I know the worst like I can smoke like one cigarette a day you shouldn't I know but it's only one a day have you ever seen the Australian cigarette packages oh but I was in Buenos Aires and they're god awful oh the worst Natasha what a wonderful human and an incredible being thank you for doing the podcast I missed the lavender I like doing the duck or trestle family hour but I think we got a lot of great laughs in the lavender I was a very funny podcast oh yeah yeah that's true no I of course I mean I I wouldn't maybe if I could listen to it online somewhere if it was on Bing I would be able to you would go back and listen to the old episode yeah a lot of people would where are they they're online no they're not yes they are no they're not yeah if you go on iTunes they're all there they're on iTunes if you go to the iTunes link for this podcast they're all there oh really yeah does it say the lavender hour yeah just scroll down oh that's cool I think they're all there I haven't checked I don't think that's true they're all there wow whatever this was one laugh this was practically a lavender hour okay a little different how you're not making me do it like in between an audition and like you know and we didn't have time to do it that I had to twist your arm to do those things yeah we were like living together and it was just like really hard this is like now the podcast just got really good I don't want to end it it was hard oh god I think it's really hard to live with somebody that was terrible that was terrible how long was that terrible for for a year was it over a year that was rough that was at least six months of bad it was more like a year right Natasha was it a year that it was bad I'm just saying it's hard to like work and live with somebody that's all it was not only is it hard it's like a tragic mistake I don't think it's a tragic mistake I think it depends on the people oh no I don't know I mean I don't think you can like work and live with somebody at the same time or you can but like someone told me that um uh what's his name who did midnight oh Tim Burton and his wife that they have like uh adjoining like when you go to their house there's like a there's one big house and then you go into the backyard and it's two like little paths and they each have their own little places yeah you need that wouldn't that be amazing well yeah like Helena Bonham Carter has her own little castle situation where she can like do her art and work on shit and the other person has theirs and then you can like come and conjoin together you know like you need space that's the problem if you're creative you need space definitely you can't live with anyone that's why no that's not true but I'm just saying no it just depends on the people because maybe it helps you in some ways just depends it really depends truly I mean I guess it depends on the situation I believe it I mean I I believe in because maybe you have someone taking care of the things that you can't take I believe in UFOs well and the same way that I believe that people should live together it truly depends Duncan well because if something comes so naturally to someone and it's the exact thing that you lack and it's so easy for them if you live together then life just gets easier because you're just doing your natural thing and it's helping the other person and they're doing the same thing to you and then it can be really great give it a shot I'm just saying it needs to work it needs to be the right working try it out that just one of those try out things like when you take liquid morphine you like you don't have to it liquid morphine's furniture isn't in your house what when you move in with somebody it's like you don't it's a deep pit because you can't get out of it right away like there's no escape I can remember like moving in with you is different but I can remember of the people I've lived with that moment of realizing because I hadn't even thought about it but suddenly I realized like oh shit that we are living together now like there is no way out of this like the the key we have the same key how many people have you lived with five you have no I've just made that up I've only lived with you many girlfriends back I lived with someone but the girlfriend before me you lived with oh yeah that's right I live with Mary Lynn too never again I'm just saying things I'll never live I don't think I'll ever live with anyone again I think you're depressed so no no no I've thought that before I was depressed I don't think I think I'm gonna like I like I like I alone I everyone dies alone I I like the idea of what you're saying with but with more blocks in between the houses I think that's a great I think that's a good idea and and I think that's very healthy yeah you need your own space if you can have it but but if you don't have it and you find yourself with someone then you can make that work but you have to make sure that you you direct your consciousness towards your personal evolution and although I will say that people like me and you did not grow up in like super happy families and it can happen and I think some people maybe create are able to create that I think it's a challenge and I think that you hit a roadblock no matter what of course and I think that that roadblock hit a roadblock if you're fucking Whitney Houston or whoever you know if you're like I don't know why I said Whitney Houston I was just thinking of like I know the most cheesy superstar I could think of I know many people who Katy Perry I know a lot of people who are married I like Katy Perry though do you like Katy Katy Perry I think she's funny you know what I I've it's part of my nervous breakdown people who are like trying I like Katy Perry it's part of my nervous breakdown I have started liking things that I never liked before and and like I just watched We Bought a Zoo and yeah and and I the Cameron Crow movie no it's what's his name from Matt Damon from Born Identity how was that cheesy but it's oh Scarlett Johansson yeah but you you like I can make like you anything that's just even remotely attempting to be touching or that's attempting to like send a good message to the world immediately will make me start crying it's part of my nervous breakdown and it's like you I've stopped hating those things even though like I think that some of them are poorly executed it's like yeah so Katy Perry you know that firework song I like that song it's sweet it's like tweeting to the people in Boston it's like so what so you're so you didn't execute it in a way that's gonna make fucking moracy like it but you still sort of in this kind of very it's hard to be sincere that's the problem I know but it was no it's hard to love that's the hardest thing you just don't even want it no one even wants love people just want to fuck nobody wants to feel love love is a love crushes you it's just like getting run over nobody wants to get run over these days it's too much it society isn't built for people feeling those that the depth of emotion it's built for vapid shallow plasticky have you ever seen Tom Hanks Oscar speeches no you should watch them are they comedy no it's just like he likes thanks his lover which is his wife and like he's like really sincere about it and you can feel his sincerity and it's like pretty intense yeah no Stephen King when he writes about Tabitha King right when he writes about his wife it's possible yeah god I'm sorry I didn't mean the whole don't live with someone for me personally that's my own thing but for many other people I think it's a very viable if you can feel that feeling that they're that like is like taking you to a whole other level do it but yeah definitely do it and if you're in it just and it's dark and dry and and horrible and the person that you're with is not who you thought and they don't think you're the person they were with and you're lost in this living hell we'll get out of it

I'm just going to put out the opening rants when there's opening rants to be ranted, but as an experiment, I just want to see what happens if I just put podcasts out minus some long rambly thing. I'm not going to do that anymore. I might do it again at some point. I always will reserve the right to go on a preachy, didactic, 15-minute ramble through nothingness if I feel like it, but I really am enjoying this. It frees me up because I'm super busy right now. Holy shit, the tour starts tomorrow. I'm packing right now. I have stuff scattered all over my house. I went to Target, bought a steamer, piles of socks, a variety of brand new shirts, underwears, haircuts have been had. I'm ready to go. I'm sure there's a million things I'm going to forget. Inevitably, I'm still kind of procrastinating packing. Packing for a month on a bus, how do you do it? But then again, it's not like I'm going into the Amazon base and I'm just getting on a bus and driving through the country. I don't know why I'm treating this like I'm about to go into some underground bunker in the Arctic. Regardless, I'm feeling more excited about this than I've ever been excited about anything in my life. The You Are God comedy tour starts tomorrow. Actually, it starts on Wednesday. Of course, who knows when you're listening to this? You could be sitting in the ruins of some post-apocalyptic America right now and have just stumbled on some hard drive that happened to have this podcast in it. You could have a festering, rotting foot and you were just looking through some dumpster, hoping desperately to find some antibiotics. Instead, you just found this goddamn podcast, yet another podcast. Maybe that's what the apocalypse looks like, just the entire country covered in a five foot thick swath of hard drives filled with podcasts. Maybe that's what happens. So many podcasts begin to be created that we're all just consumed by them. But if that's the case, I wish you well. I hope you find your antibiotic. The tour starts March 30th in Asheville and I'm going to do this again until the tour is over, friends. So forgive me. It's March 30th in Asheville. We'll just do it really quick. Starts March 30th in Asheville, Charleston, Durham, Richmond, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Hampton, Boston, New York. First show sold out. We added a second show. Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cleveland, Ferndale, Toronto. First show sold out. We added a second show. Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Nashville, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland. I think we added a second show. San Francisco, we definitely added a second show. Los Angeles. And then I'm going to be a Maui for doing podcasts at the Ron Bous retreat. I'm excited about all of this stuff. I don't think excitement is the right word. I feel like every atom inside of me is pregnant with a tiny little joy baby that's about to go shooting out of its pussy into my bloodstream and hopefully through my mouth on stage when I do these shows. I can't wait and I hope to see you there. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by my sweet and glorious patrons at Squarespace.com who, and God forgive me for this, sponsored the tour I just mentioned, which by the way is officially titled the Squarespace Presents You Are God comedy tour. God bless you Squarespace for being my true glorious noble patrons. My father, my mother, my guardian angels out there on the internet. It's an honor for what a wonderful company you are in an internet filled with trashy, crappy, diarrhea style, lazy, puke websites created by charlatan web designers. Squarespace has emerged like a triumphant night exploding from a bloody wound in the side of an oceanic kraken that he just slayed by allowing it to devour him and then slicing its entrails from the inside and burrowing out like some glory mole. That's Squarespace only they didn't burrow out of a kraken. They've emerged like a beautiful digital rose from the festering skin of the internet that's composed of so many shitty websites. If you've got a crappy website or are thinking about creating a website, if you've got a brand new business and don't feel like getting the infected fangs of some pseudo web designer stuck into your juggler vein, then you can go to Squarespace.com today. Use offer code Duncan and you will get 10% off a brand new beautiful website. You don't need to know how to code. You don't have to have any previous web design experience. That's what's cool about Squarespace. You can make a professional, beautiful, simple website. All their websites have shopping carts, which means you can immediately start selling whatever the thing is that you want to sell. And God forgive me for saying this over and over again, but it always crosses my mind that I know someone who sells their socks online. Think about that. They sell their socks. Just the things that they wear on their feet every single day. They package these in some way and then they just sell them to people who enjoy smelling socks and they make money doing this. If someone can make money selling their socks online, then you should be able to make money selling whatever the thing is that you're creating, your art, the service you offer, whatever it may be. We live in the glory days friends because in the old days, if you wanted to sell stuff, you had to build a brick and mortar store and risk being stabbed to death in the night by some kind of rampaging mob of young tufts and a gang whose initiation involves going into your smelly sock store and decapitating you and drinking your blood, but no more. For now, you can create a storefront on the internet and you can use squarespace.com to do it. Go to squarespace.com. Use offer code Duncan. You will get 10% off your first order and you can start building a beautiful website today. They've got great support, which I've tested out. If you have any questions about the process, you can always contact them through the internet and they will get back to you right away. I've tested it offer code Duncan 10% off. If you sign up for a year, you will get your own domain name for free. It's pretty cool. These truly are my longest sponsors. And so I hope if you were even teetering on the idea of creating a website, you'll go try them out. You don't even need a credit card. You can go to squarespace.com. And just do a trial membership to make sure that the service works for you. Squarespace.com. Thank you, Squarespace. Oh, how I love thee. We're also brought to you by amazon.com. For those of you who have been living in some kind of frozen iceberg, for those of you who've been frozen and maybe the people who are listening to podcasts after having been cryogenically frozen, you might not be aware of the fact that there is a service on the internet called amazon.com. And what this company has done is made it so that if you're going out into the world, it could either be to do whatever your job is or to go to some park, go to some national landmark or to drive to some swinger orgy and get covered in the explosions of jizz and love fluid erupting from the nipples and cocks and vaginas of all those attending rather than going to a chain store and being sprayed and exploded with a foul coughs and diarrhea particles that are stretched from one end to the other of all chain stores. I'll never forget the time I went into a toys rs. Maybe it was a best buy. Now I can't remember which. And I saw some infected toddler, a kid who looks like he was in the binding of Isaac, the video game. If you haven't played it, you should. It's very addictive. Just an infected child, a maggot child, a thing that looks like a well organized hive of maggots was wearing the skin of a doughy pasty faced child. And I saw the child take a PlayStation controller and one of those demo PlayStation controllers and just cough all over, just hold it to its mouth and cough. There might have been little chunks of vomit and cheek flesh that had fallen off because of whatever pestulence that infected this monster's body. But it was as though the, the, it's not just that the kid was choking and puking on this controller. It was that there seemed to be some intentionality behind it. Like whatever disease was inside of it was controlling it as though the toxoplasmosis virus that infected the child's brain from eating cat turds out of the cat litter box a few days before, it actually controlled the child and it was using it to spread itself through wherever the child went. And this is everywhere friends, everywhere you go. That's not a baby that you're looking at at the, at the grocery store. That is a, a combination of viruses and confusion swirling together in a harmonized cloud of pollution that is just covering the world with awfulness. And that is why Amazon is probably responsible for at least forestalling the inevitable point when a new form of flu emerges into the world and kills all of us, because they've kept us, at least many of us from co-mingling at stores when we don't need to be there. P.S. the horror, the horror of the capitalist system is, it is given the illusion of community when in actuality all it is is a group of people gathered together to buy shit. You don't have to take part in that evil system anymore, oh comrades. You can go to amazon.com through our portal located at DuncanTrustle.com. It's in the comments section of every single one of our episodes. And you can buy the toilet paper that you are going to go to the store to buy. You can buy the paper towels. You can buy the windex. You can buy the cock rings, the butt plugs. They have a huge selection of sex toys, wonderful books. I see what you guys order. Any book that I mention on this podcast, I'm currently listening to the Archaic Revival by Terrence McKenna, can be obtained through Amazon in the form of a Kendall E. book, in the form of a Flop book, an Archaic caveman style made of dead trees book, or even an audio book, which I prefer through Audible. You could even, if you want to really double up on this insanity, you could go to audible.com forward slash family hour, sign up for a trial membership, get a free audio book through Amazon. I don't even know what would happen if you did that, but the point is it's a great way to support the podcast. We get a small percentage of whatever it is you buy and it costs you nothing. We also have t-shirts. We also have posters. We also have mugs and a variety of other things. All the ticket links to the Squarespace presents. You are God comedy tour are located at Duncan trussell.com. Wow. This is nuts. We did it. The thing that normally takes me days to do. I think I just did it in 10 or 11 minutes. A true miracle. And today's guest is a true superstar. Laura Kytlinger has been on her own IFC series, which she created and starred in called the minor accomplishments of Jackie Woodman. She's had a multitude of comedy specials, including a comedy central special and an HBO comedy special. She's written a book called quick shots of false hope. You've probably seen her on tenacious D and if you want to go see her live, then you should go check her out at the Arlington draft house at Washington in Washington DC on April 21st through April 23rd. You can follow her on Twitter at King Kytlinger or visit her website at Laura Kytlinger.com or you could even do both. Either way, everyone out there, please rip open your chests and allow the sweet spring of infinite transcendent metaphysical love to go exploding out of your heart chakra like a rainbow blasted from the unenipple of some supreme being existing in a dimension where there is no sorrow and let that stuff spray into the astral plane and entwine Laura Kytlinger so that for the next many months, she feels completely embraced by a hundred thousand strangers in the various realms of the internet. Everyone now please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast my dear friend, comedian, author, and all around genius, Laura Kytlinger. It's the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. Laura. Yes, dear. Welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. Thank you so much for coming on the show. I'm thrilled to be here and I'm impressed as hell with you because you have your there's a Dunkin Trussell Family Hour cup right in front of you that's been here for God knows how long. There's a long time. A long time. And it's okay. I got mugs. That's where that's where I'm at. This is that's making it. That is you know, that is something I want you to know that you can make. I don't have mugs. You can make them. They're not that hard. I've got a place you just send the mug design and they'll send you a fresh mug. Well, I'm impressed. I was just I was telling this friend of mine about oh, I just okay, skip. And now I've got nowhere to go. I was I was thinking about like what I think is making it and I realized I was about to do a bit. I don't want to that's great because I was gonna ask you what is your ultimate definition? That's so funny. I was about to say in your mind because we have this idea of making it right. It's an everyone has it in their head. Some version of ultimate success. What is your version of ultimate success? Well, the bar has gotten so low for me. It's underground. So my my my version of success would be to be able to give a store clerk a $100 bill, not have them look at it, hold it up to the light, look at it, call the manager over, and then have the manager, you know, ask me to leave for soliciting a minor. There's my bit. No. Let me see. What is what would be the ultimate ultimate success? I think just, you know, now like having I just having friends that are really famous and rich, I would just like to not feel embarrassed around them, I guess. No, that's not how how do you feel embarrassed around them? No, I feel embarrassed like and the god my friend Nancy Shane said something that I will never forget. I mean, it is the best advice ever that no one is thinking about you as much as you are. That's for sure. Because I think, oh, I bet they feel sorry for me. I, you know, I had a show. I don't now I don't have a show had this, you know, now, you know, and nothing's really going on. But the truth is, especially in the green room, everyone's thinking about themselves and their set and, you know, who gives a damn, but I is not funny, though, when you realize that there is this funny thing when you're doing comedy, and sometimes I'll catch my mind doing it, where like, I will want comedians to like my set and I will want them to say something kind to me about my show. And it's all ridiculous because when I consider how much am I paying attention to other comedians, especially in the climate of a comedy club when I'm about to go on stage, my adrenal glands are pumping and like, all I'm thinking about is this thing I got to do. It's zero. I'm just thinking about this thing I got to do, you know. So that is a funny thing that we want. Yeah. Or a specific thing you want. I mean, the ultimate version of let's imagine the ultimate Twilight Zone. But you know, I was just going to say, just to comment on that, what I think is funny is like, I have, and you've probably done this too, when someone comes off stage and they walk by you, it's a comic or it's a friend or somebody you don't even know that well and you think they don't feel that good about what they did on stage, you say, oh, that was a good set, right? To make them feel better. Yeah. Even though maybe it wasn't, and you're just kind of just saying something because they're, you feel like you should. It's a nice thing to do. Yeah. But then I feel like if somebody says that to me, I believe it. You know, like I don't think that they're just saying it because they kind of think it wasn't that great and wanted to make a change. But they didn't even watch. Yeah. They're just saying it as a form of high. Yeah. So it's kind of like, but the funny thing is we can't use that metric, you know, the metric of the, even if the audience liking you, the comics liking you, none of it matters. Right. It's the only thing that matters is, did you like it? And if you didn't like it, it sucked. Period. That's got to be the only metric. Right. Like I've been shooting. I'm like shooting archery right now. And it's fun. And it's like, it's a great metaphor. It teaches you all this stuff. But, you know, I was reading about how some people like how to train for it and get better at it. And one person was like, you know, I don't care sometimes whether or not I even hit the target. But if my form is correct, that's all that matters to me. If I'm keeping a consistent form, that's more important than hitting the target. And I think on stage, it's kind of the same thing. It's when you, when you're up there, are you working on new jokes? Yeah. Are you expanding jokes that you have been doing for a while? Or are you just up there doing the exact same fucking thing? And if you that's, if you're doing the third thing, which I'm guilty of a bunch, then what's the point? Oh, I can't. Oh, I agree. I can't even, I was trying to prepare, you know, for an hour to do an hour and just going, just doing what I've been collecting, just doing the same kind of material that to build that hour of what I think it is. And, you know, inviting people out to see it. I feel it was so tedious. Now I've done it so many fucking times. I'm like, oh my God, I can't, you know, so I always, I always try to have a few new things just for myself because I can't stand it. You have to. Yeah. When I go, if you go to the club, you need at least wear a show. You got to have one thing just for yourself. Even it's going to suck. How do you write? How do you, what's your writing process look like when you're in the midst of preparing an hour? What do you, how much time do you have like a specific time that you sit down and work on jokes? How does it work for you? I do everything at the absolute last minute. So usually hours before, or sometimes if I, I try to do a few sets and then, you know, tape and then write to, you know, just write that, you know, try to remember what worked, you know, but I find it also hard to listen to myself. So I'll just ask my boyfriend if he taped it and what did he think was good. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. But I, you know, what we were talking about earlier, I wanted to bring up is one of the most humiliating things I think in all of life is, or writing a bio or writing, you know, a resume. Like just having that, I mean, I've spent a lot of time on that just recently because just for doing that, I'm good about to do this, the Halifax Comedy Festival. Right. And just writing down, you know, like a list of bullshit and you're trying to make it sound, you know, sound like it's, you know, I sound like what sound funny or sound interesting. Yeah. Sound interesting. Yeah. And I was laughing, it's just, you know, like reading over some of my old bio, like a true original, you know, and a triple threat, you know, all that shit. A triple threat. Yeah. And that's, I had my friend Jeremy Kramer help me write my last one and he, and I said, let's have it really cheesy, like a triple threat. And he said, but, you know, Laura's proved herself to be an Amber alert in the bullshit, because it's all just bullshit. You know, you're just like trying to, it's bullshit. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you've done. It doesn't matter if you went to Galilee, raise the dead. It doesn't matter if at some point in your life you levitated, if you've time traveled, if you've gone to the moon, if you're a comedian, none of that shit matters. And all that matters is when you're on stage and are you, are you, what's happening while you're up there. I think that's one of the glorious things about it. Because when a comedian's performing, no one's looking at their bio being like, oh, oh, wow. I mean, God, look at this amazing biography. God, they're amazing. They're so funny. No one cares. And you know, sometimes if I read the bio of a younger comic, I remember thinking, oh, I remember, I know, like trying to stuff it with, you know, every little thing, you know, to stand up at this club and that, you know, New York, all these clubs and just how much it meant then. And then you realize, oh, but everybody does this crap. And it's, no one cares. No, I don't think, I could be completely wrong here, but when a person's going to see a comedy show, they're not spending any time on the bios of the performers. I know, that's just, it's such an antiquated, it's almost like a play bill for, you know, for a play nobody gives a shit about. And I've always wanted to just say, oh, I, you know, I recently, the past few years, I've been just throwing shit against the wall, hoping to sell something. Can I just use that as a bio? That's it. Yeah, that should be your bio. Just that. Because no one gives a fuck about triple threat, multi hyphenate. No one gives a shit. No one out there cares about any of that. I mean, God, think of like, does anyone, what's the, no one looks at like the bio of Led Zeppelin. When, like no one's looking at the bio of any other, like, when you're going to look at like Andy Warhol or you're going to look at Picasso or some famous artist or not. Like, can I see their bio? I just want to take a real look at what they've done before this painting. Yeah, you're just looking at the thing itself. And it's just, and it's also, I mean, it comes from having a resume, right? Is anybody going to actually look and said, oh, I see you were at the punchline in San Francisco. Interesting. Did you? Yeah. What was your opener at the punchline? What did you open with then? Oh, I'm really interested. This is the corruption of the entertainment industry mixing in with art, I think, because this is what happens with, because it's like some manager or some agent at some point was like, we've got to have a good bio and we've got to appeal to business people. Because when you're doing like this style of entertainment or if you're doing anything that involves trying to sell a show or there is this group of people who have to like sell you like some kind of stock or some form of, some form of capital that there is some trade. It's really weird, isn't it? So they're the ones who come up with the language like triple threat, all of that shit. But that's a whole culture, isn't it? There's a whole culture of that out there. You know, I was drinking with his friend of mine, and I don't want to, I can't actually, I'm not even sure who it was, but I don't know who I drink with, but he had said something that I thought was pretty funny. It's kind of a kind of letting yourself off the hook. He said, well, you know, I know I'm going to be like Van Gogh, I won't be appreciated until I'm dead. And I thought, wow, that must make it a little bit easier for you. But, you know, I can't actually even picture that going down. It's like, oh, yeah, like you're, you'll, there'll be this exhibit and your set list will be on the wall and somebody will be listening to you go, Oh God, yeah, the Passover joke about his girlfriend's dog biting his balls under the Passover table and you know, like that don't, how could you even put yourself on that level? That is ridiculous. Yeah, that is the most. I'll tell you later who said it. Oh my God, I'll be appreciated after I'm dead. Yeah, like Van Gogh. Get down. Like that even matters. I know. I mean, there's a whole, what is the, God damn it. I keep forgetting this guy's name is Stoicism. It's a form, it's a philosophy called Stoicism. And there's a great book called it's Marcus Aurelius who wrote a book called Meditations, which is a book he wrote for upcoming emperors for people are going to be an emperor. And so it's all this like, amazing philosophy and his in all of it is, it's really cool. But a lot of it is like this whole thing of like leaving a mark after you're gone. Don't do, don't think about that. For what? For what? For whom? What does it matter? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's nothing that happens after you're gone. Who the fuck cares? Yeah, nobody cares. It doesn't matter at all to me. I wish we could talk more, just you and me as friends, because I think you're so interesting and whatever. This is why I love podcasts. I know. Just to wrap up the Marcus Aurelius thing. Not only does it not matter what happens after you die, really like thinking about what's going to happen outside of this present moment. You know, that's what causes so much, so many problems. You know, it's like planning, thinking what you're going to do. It's like, when if you're, God Jesus, you're worried about thinking about what's going to happen after you die. The odds are you're like, completely not here at all. You're not in the moment. You're already dead. You're just focusing on something after the, after your body stops working. You know, one of the, and I can't remember which one, which book it was, but in one of the, I think maybe it's just called Hollywood, one of the Bukowski books about how he said, why do I have to do anything? Why does everybody say, let's go do something? I just don't, you know, I mean, in a very simple way of that's like, that's what ruin can ruin a day about saying, okay, I've got to do these things. I have to do this. People expect you to do this. And he said, why can't I just enjoy being in my hot tub with my cats? That's what I'm going to do today. Yes. Oh God, he's the best. That guy had the best, like it's on YouTube. And he had this, like he's like, sometimes you just need to go lay in bed for three days straight. And I find that to be such fantastic advice. Isn't he great? Oh, amazing. And there was, you know, there was one, just one of his books that was illustrated by Arkham. I remember laughing like mad. And it was just this illustration. And it was of a Bukowski, like, you know, putting one shoe on. And then, and, and the, he just said, okay, now what? It's just like, I don't know, it's just, it's the best. I know. He's like our, he's some kind of like Zen master or something. And, and so it's so nice to have somebody who relieves you of those stupid burdens you put on yourself, somebody who like spiritualizes. I don't even want to say what he did was like slacking because he was a hard fucking worker. He wrote a lot. He would drink and write and he was like a kind of a workaholic in a lot of ways. But anytime someone gives you a break at the level he does, which is like, it's just these fucking assholes, man, the doers, the people who are like, you've got the goals and the thing and they're doing, they're always up to something and they're, God, it's so gross. Do you ever, you don't ever get on yourself like, oh, I didn't write today or, oh, I sure do. But then the best writing happens spontaneously. The best podcasts come spontaneously. It's not from planning. It's not from like, Oh, shit, I've got to schedule these podcasts. It's like, someone will call or like, you know, someone will email or someone, it just will come out of the blue and suddenly you're recording the podcast and it happened organically. I just prefer that. The other side of life is fine too. I've just, it's never been, I've never been able to, man, be that kind of do or you get around those fucking organized sons of bitches though. Wow. I know when a person, I write every day from, you know, 10 to four and then, and then I, as soon as they say that, I think to myself, do I like their writing? Are they funny? Are there, do I, have I ever read anything? I mean, I don't know. I instinctively think, Oh, so they're, they have a real kind of a technical way of writing. And so, you know, or maybe they're kind of a type A personality and that's why, you know, they're able to do that. But then I think, Oh, that isn't something I would probably want to read. Right. Yeah. I mean, exactly here or whatever. You know, Stephen King, I guess is the ultimate example of successfully doing that. I don't know if you like his writing. I do. I think he's probably the greatest writer of our century, the last century. God, he's great, but he's got a serious work ethic. Like he sits down and hammers out pages, like at least four hours a day. It's some beautiful big desk that he has, but I didn't know that. Yeah. Oh man. He's like, you know, the, did you ever read the dark tower series? No. Oh, please do. It's so good. The shining is one of my favorite movies. I was surprised that he had an interview that he didn't, he didn't like how it turned out. Yeah. I didn't read the book though, but I love the movie. You're going to love the book. I should just read the book. He didn't like it because it wasn't supernatural. And oh, really? Yeah, it wasn't supernatural at the level that his book is without spoiling it. And like, there's some famous phone conversation where Kubrick calls Stephen King and says to him, what's scarier, uh, going crazy or a ghost? What do you think scarier that because at the moment we've got ghosts, it implies there's life after death. The moment there's life after death, there's some relief to the gnawing anxiety of being a human being. Isn't it scarier the idea that you can just lose your fucking mind? Brilliant. Brilliant. My God. That's fucking it. Wow. I didn't know that. That's amazing. Yeah. Cause anytime there's like ghosts, like anytime you're watching a horror movie where people are getting killed by ghosts, it's always like, well, there's life after death. So the ghosts are kind of doing them a favor. If you look at it that way, one of my pet peeves is the paranormal shows. Like, Oh, did you hear that? Oh my God. Did you see that? Who just got cold? You know, it's like all the same shit all the time. I met this guy, Aaron, from there's, he's on this show called ghost encounters. And he was at the comedy store and I got in a conversation with him and I hadn't seen his show until after I met him, which is cool. Cause I didn't have to be nervous or feel weird or whatever, because I wasn't aware that shows a big hit. Is it really? Yeah. Lots of people love it. Ghost encounters? I think it's called ghost encounters. And he was a, he's a sweetheart, man. But I'm talking to him out there and I'm like, how much of it's fake, man? Come on. A lot of it's fake. You guys aren't encountering ghosts, right? There's no way. And you know, I'm, I don't think I'm the worst judge of when people are bullshitting me. He's like, it's real. He's like, there's shit out there, man. We've seen crazy shit. It really happens. Some of these places are actually fucking haunted. He's like, this stuff's, there's stuff that happens. It's real. The meter and all that thing. Like, I mean, that whatever that equipment is, I was just thinking like that. Can you buy it? Can I buy a ghost meter? Yes. I mean, that is such bullshit. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I, I, you ever seen a ghost? No, but I do. I mean, I would love to. I would just love to see a ghost. I would really love that. I think I honest to God would. I would love to. Did I tell you, I love horror films. I love all that. I would, you know, did I tell you my ghost dream? No, my ghost encounter. No, no, no. Sorry guys. I'm going to repeat it really quickly though. I was in New Orleans, which is the best fucking place for something like that. Haunted fucking city. Yeah. And I was, I had a dream. And in the dream, I'm in the Arctic. A body falls out of the sky in a body bag. I unzip the body bag. There's a suicide note in the body bag that this person has like put in the body bag. And the suicide note is written about my girlfriend. And the guy's like, now you'll know, I really love you. And, and the corpse in the body bag after I'm reading the suicide note and getting really pissed because it's like, don't hit him, my girlfriend with a fucking suicide note. You asshole. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm getting jealous. He comes to life, wakes up, seems like kind of like out of it. And I like, escort him out of an Arctic. You know, it's a dream. Like there's like a, you know, the Arctic apparently like meets a city street or something that you can kick him out of. And then later in the dream, I go to his, he works at a record store and I go there and I use the, I use like a, what do you call it? This thing on a beat on a can, like the top of a can tab, a tab to cut his face up in our records or so. There's a crazy dream. It was crazy enough that when I woke up, I wrote it down, which I rarely do. So that too, like we're talking to a bartender at the top of our hotel, the Omni in New Orleans, a great hotel. And the bartender's like, um, or like, it's like, you want to hear the ghost story that, uh, well, they don't want us to talk about. Yeah. I'm like, yeah. And she's like, well, yeah, a guy in Katrina, um, hacked up his girlfriend down the street and then came here and committed suicide, jumped off the building with a suicide note. Whoa. I remember seeing that. I remember watching that on something about that. Yeah, man. I didn't know that I was not aware. There's nothing in my brain. I had that fucking dream. So to me, that was, that's my ghost encounter. That's, yeah, that is really incredible. I now, do you ever, I mean, do you, um, I had an amazing psychiatrist who, you know, had a degree in everything and, and would ask me, you know, because she studied union theory and asked me to tell her to write down my dreams. And I had this dream that I thought was so obvious. I mean, this isn't about ghost, but I was at a party standing next to a refrigerator in a kitchen, you know, in a kitchen, just standing next to her and talking. And I reached down and pull a dead twig out of my belly button and I keep pulling it out. And I said, that has to be, oh, uh, you know, you will never reproduce. And I said, what does it mean? I mean, which is, which is fine. I would never want to. And she said, no, it, it actually, it can mean a new beginning. And I thought, oh, okay, you know, that's really crazy. And have you ever, you know, this one with my, this I'm crazy about my psychiatrist. I think she's amazing. But sometimes because you're a comedian, if you've been in a situation where someone will laugh and you're, you know, not being fun, you know, when you're trying to tell them something. And she, I wanted to talk about this instance where I thought was funny because I don't try to, I'm not so desperate that I need to make my psychiatrist laugh. You know, I actually am trying to learn some things, you know. And so I, I told her about this dream I had, which is really vulgar and horrible. I was running, like trying to escape this place. And there was another person who was a few feet away from me also running. And then I got to this kind of this clearing in this field. And the other person who of course has no face says, wait a minute, you know, watch out, watch out, watch out. And so I said, okay, and then I kind of duck down in the woods. And I see like on this huge platform, like this, it's almost like a metal truck bed that's gigantic. All of these kind of naked people squatting down. And someone is going through with hook and ripping off their backs. And there's another thing like a, like a half animal, half person ripping, taking out their guts. Jesus. And then, and she said, so then my psychiatrist said, does that bother you? And I said, no. And then she started laughing. And I was like, why is that funny? And she said, well, you know, it might bother some people. And I was like, Oh, well, no, it's not a reoccurring thing. I just, I just am just saying, you know, well, what does that mean? Yeah, you know, and she's, you know, that didn't bother me because I just think God, you know, it's a lot of times I like, I'll wake up and think, God, that would be a great scene in a horror film or something. But I don't think, I don't think anything would bother me in my dreams unless they kept unless I can't be the same. Yeah, it's not real. It's not like you're like, God, what is what is what happened in my brain? Yeah, does your when you do when you tell your psychiatrist these dreams, she instantly analyzes them like that, she can just tell you, here's what it generally means. Like in Jungian psychology, is it is it already broken down what these symbols tend to mean? Yes. Huh, I think she's brilliant. I love that sort of thing. I mean, and, and then, and then I think also, what sort of what were her parents like, that she gets paid to listen to other people's dreams, right, that she would actually do put herself through that. It's, I mean, it is an intense thing. Jung was fascinating. He believed in synchronicity and he had some kind of belief. And I don't know, I don't want to say like the paranormal, but I kind of think it, he, his experience with being around so many people and studying it was, it seemed to point in the direction of something greater. Right. Have you ever seen his red book before? No. It's like this, he says he had a kind of nervous breakdown or something. It's a, it's an alchemical text with, it's like a grimoire that he created with all this amazing art in it that he drew, which I don't even know what a grimoire is. A grimoire is like a magic book, you could say. It's like a, it's like a, yeah, like the, I think it's called the lesser key of Solomon as an example of one, but these are all these texts that have within them the magic formula that you could use to whatever it is that you want to do. A lot of times like summoning various entities, demons, spirits, Satan himself and some of them like directions to actually summon Lucifer and they're really cool. They're really fucking cool. They, they have in it this very. So is that sort of like spells? It's not like a, a witch thing or it could, you know, it could be. I always think, you know, when they, they're actually, you know, a lot of, um, and especially in New Orleans that, you know, you can see, you know, a voodoo priestess and all this. And, and I think when there's such a thing of, there's voodoo and who, you know, well, you don't just, you know, people don't cast spells, you know, you know, just for evil. And I think, yes, they do. I mean, I mean, if they do and if they have that power, I've never heard somebody say, okay, let's put a good spell on this person. Oh, wow, man. It happens. Yeah, they, yeah, it happens. You think people would say, okay, I'm going to, I want to put a good spell on. For sure. Oh, really? You don't think it's, okay. We call it a blessing. Right. Oh, that's interesting. Blessing is a spell. I mean, any, any, any Catholic, any religious mass, prayers, a spell, you're invoking an entity. It's all the same. It's all just magic. Every single aspect. For some reason, like religion somehow doesn't fall under the category of magic, even though it obviously is magic. It's a magic ritual. Anytime you go to church on a Sunday, you're engaged in a long form magical ritual. Right. It's no different. But just for some reason, because it's the accepted, you know, because enough people practice it, then it stops being magic and turns into religion. And then why, you know, and two, you can't, for whatever reason, I mean, I think it's a, you know, a cult, but you can't call it a cult religion. Religions, you can't call them cults. Really? Even though that, if you look at the etymology of cult, it, it's the, that it's a, it means like spirit. It's the devotion to a spirit. So cult, religion, magic, all the same thing, which is people like to do these rituals to try to create change in the universe. And it's awesome. You got to try. Have you ever tried, have you ever cast a spell before you ever tried a magical spell? No, no. Oh, it's a blast. You got to do it. You've never gotten really stoned and tried to do magic before? No. Oh, it's fun. Oh, it's so fun. It's so theatrical. Like that's one of the great things about magic is it's theatrical. You're acting out this. Do you actually get ingredients and things or, I mean, do depends on what the thing is you want to do, you know, like there's God, I did it once, man. You can, so you can get the, so there's like they believe in these angels, right? Now, listen, what's really cool, I think what people, people miss out on a lot of stuff. Can I tell people, by the way, that you have a swastika on your forehead as we're talking about this and you look so much like Manson that I'm sort of, I mean, I've always believed in you, but even more so now. Thank God. Okay. That's good. Yeah. You have nothing to fear. No one has anything to fear. Okay. The problem with like skepticism when it comes to religion and magic is you, it's like you end up missing out on a lots of fun because obviously. Oh, well, I think it's fear. I mean, I don't feel skeptical about, I mean, that's, I would love to see a ghost. I would love to cast a spell. I'm, and I, I'm not even afraid of like Ouija board things. I've never done that. I mean, I think I did it once a long time ago with my cousin, but, but yeah, I, I, I think it's more fear than skepticism on some people. Or are you saying that about me? No, I don't know. That I'm skeptical about. Oh, no, no, no. Some fear, people are afraid too. Yeah. Well, that's even more fun. God, you're lucky if you're afraid because then you'll really make contact. But if you're, but you know, you basically, there's all these symbols that represent varying entities, depending on what the thing is, you're trying to summon up. Usually you need to know the directions because there's different entities assigned to various to like North, South, East and West, and then facing each of the directions. You can kind of intone, you know, there's all kinds of things. I can grab it. I have the one of Crowley's Lieber four is what it's called, which is fantastic. Have you ever seen any like real magic before? No, hold on. I'll go grab it. We'll read a little bit of it. You'll love it. See, we need fun things to do when we're stoned, right? When you're stoned, what are you going to do? And one great thing to do when you're super stoned is to practice magic. And it's all over the internet, all the different things. But we'll just I'm open up to a random page here in Lieber four. Here is what is this? What do we got here? What does Lieber mean? Book. It just means book in German. It's a fancy way to say book. It's in German. I guess that's German. Yeah, Lieber four. I didn't even get it. Okay. So let's find something good here. There's so this has got some pretty good. Some some pretty good. Oh, here's a good one here. So look, these various rituals. Here's a really simple one. This is one that a lot of people do prior to doing other rituals. And this is called the lesser ritual of the pentagram. So in this ritual, you go it says touching the forehead, say octay, octay, and you can see on the internet people doing this and the way they the way they do it is they get really serious when I say they go. How do you spell that? A T E H I'm probably mispronouncing it by the way. I don't I'm not a this is if you're a Thelomite, this is the religion of Theloma touching the breast say touching the right shoulder say touching the oh that's the wrong shoulder touching the left shoulder say yes clasping the hands upon the breast say say turning to the east make a pentagram that of earth with a proper weapon usually the wand you can use your your just your finger say I think it's it's I H V H turning to the south but the same say I need turning to the west say I he turning the north say agla extending the arms in the form of a cross say before me Raphael behind me Gabriel like this yeah to straight out is the form of a cross that's it on my right hand Michael on my left hand ariel for about me flames the pentagram and in the column stands the sixth raid star and so that's the lesser ritual of pinningham now look is this real hell no or is it not real hell no it's just theatrics and it's lots of fun to do highly recommended it's such a blast and much more fun than sitting in church for you know however long you might on a sunday oh yeah I mean exactly yeah way more fun you just get hot like whenever I was doing I don't do anymore but when I was doing it one thing I would always do is get super stoned you get really high really high and if you do it right you won't remember doing it like okay and did you actually cast a spell after that well I never that one the lesser banishing ritual the pentagram I never did that but there have been times when I've dabbled in like actual sort of like manifestation rituals and things like that and it with some success with some surprising success the how so like what did you the thing is you can go into so you go to the magical state so what's the magical state the magical state is with how every kid is constantly living every single day which is that you allow yourself to start drawing connections where there are none so the the skeptic says remember we remember the hits is what they say so whenever there's a coincidence that happens like God I was just thinking about Jack and Jack called how could that fucking possible be possible a skeptic says your mind is constantly processing and you're thinking about shit all the time that you don't remember thinking about so it just so happens sometimes the thing that you're thinking about coincides with something in the in the world and you act like there's a connection there isn't one that's what a skeptic says we remember the hits so getting into a magical state of consciousness is intentionally allowing yourself to fall into the fantasy that there are all these synchronicities happening around you at all times and in fact the entire universe is alive and trying to teach you in every single moment and so when we go into the magical state how do you see that like in your mind's eye how do you see what do you what do you imagine when well like I just see purple I see like purple lights there you go that's it is that what you I mean whatever no oh really that's it well no that would be it so it's not like there's a right way to do it right so right away your mind you're seeing purple light everywhere so now in that state of consciousness inundated with a great purple light of truth allow the purple light to move through my body to inundate you could start doing your own rituals you know I take the purple light into my heart I move the purple light through my body down to the atomic to the subatomic to the deepest core of myself so that the purple light is purifying tuning focusing and bringing me closer to a state of pure and true realization and then so you start like do you know and you do it in a kind of like you change your if you're if you want to see you can like change you can dignify what you're saying make it like you know wizardy you know like and now in this moment I call upon the great light that comes from the beginning of time 13.7 billion years ago I have come to the altar of the light whatever it is right right you make it up and then through that creative exercise you might be surprised what happens because really all that matters is are there results let's see if there's a result from this this is empiricism so you're like I'm going to do this completely ridiculous thing I'm going to like put on a special outfit in in vibe some psychedelic throw myself into a magical state in tone and invocation to the potential greater truth of the universe and this thing that I want will come to me whatever it is I'm going to say I'm going to ask for something and then I'm going to see if anything comes and so then you make note of it and if something comes you got to admit it right oh agreed I will yeah that totally makes that out so like people so that's the that's right that's my version of magic everyone has different versions of it's totally free it's a freewheeling creative super state that you put yourself into where you allow yourself to succumb to every single possible delusion that you feel like having with the intention of creating a change in your external universe using means outside of what you normally use to make changes even though that's considered magic too Crowley said anything that you do to cause a change in your universe is a ritual and it's magic whether it's putting money in the bank or cooking a fucking grilled cheese sandwich it's all magic when you're cooking your grilled cheese sandwich it's alchemy you're creating chemical conversions and you're transmuting the cheese you're shifting the vibrational frequency of the bread you know it really is magic well I think I think the real I mean it to to you know indulge yourself and and have that you know kind of meditative feeling and that good feeling um or just to let your imagination go wild I I think that what I would think would be the seeing it happen would be have somebody else think that way or to be able to with your thoughts make someone else uh either think of you the way you're thinking of yourself or or bring something to you that you're thinking of yeah or but that might be more of like of an evil spell or something or like do you know what I mean well the intention mind is like are you trying to hurt someone which you you you know that's that's where it's and why is it evil well it's evil because the the the according to many people and I do believe it this is why like I have friends who like shoplift or or like not really shoplift like if a grocery clerk forgets to like charge them for something they'll just keep it like well their mistake it's mine and there's a theory which is like anything you put out in the universe magnified by some amount you can pick seven ten six whatever but there's a magnification echo chamber effect in this universe so what it means is if you walk out of a store and you didn't pay three dollars for the toothbrush that some someone forgot to charge you for you will end up paying twenty one dollars down the line for some other fucking thing that's going to be a very like instant karma as they say whatever it is not so Winston it's going to be expensive fucking toothbrush so it's better to go back in and pay the money for the toothbrush then then the universe to charge you twenty one bucks or whatever because we the way it's working here is shits getting magnified for some reason it's not reducing it's magnifying so that means that if you do a curse and I remember man I've had like yeah like Satanists not Lucian Greaves or I just interviewed but like real state real magic practicing satanic witches tell me don't ever curse never do it not worth it it's just the worst thing that you don't put a curse on anyone never curse never oh they call it curse this they call it just don't curse like that's wearing but don't curse yeah it comes back times seven so I would imagine whatever you do to somebody like that you're gonna get it way way way way way way way way worse oh of course don't fuck with it it's way but on the other hand if you blast someone if you start putting good energy out whether it's in the form of giving them money giving them praise giving them your attention it'll come back to you in the exact using the same system well I believe that in on a very simple level of like even like you know you have friends that really love to gossip love to you know you know stir the shit whatever and even and I realized like hearing things you know like even if even if you go wow well that's really you know that's juicy news saying it saying something or repeating it is a shitty feeling that's right people don't even realize it I don't think yeah because that's what we do out here all the time like somebody did this and they got this show or did that and then when you repeat that negative thing it kind of sits with you too whether you even think you know it is or not and I this friend of mine I said you know what I want to do we have to like try and see if we can go you know a day two days without talking you know shit about anybody just being not being negative about anyone else just try and do it yeah and that was fun because my friend said he didn't want to even try well yeah it's boring he said he can't he didn't even want to try it was fun it's fucking boring but that is that's considered cursing too shit talking is considered cursing I didn't know that yeah that's the one form of cursing so like if you want to like it's just when people are shit talking they don't understand what they're doing usually it's a some kind of fucking habit that they're there if they're doing it or yeah a way to get attention kind of like the hey I've got that you know yeah scoop on something yeah whenever I'm doing it it's like I always if I'm if I practice mindfulness practice mindfulness the next time you're shit talking don't stop shit talking just let yourself watch the way your body language is and the way your body changes the way you feel and look at the body language of the person next to you who you're you know forcing to endure your shit talking right and then you'll you'll see right away oh yeah this is magic I'm practicing magic right now what I'm doing is here are here's a person who knows the person I'm shit talking and I'm poisoning the well is what I'm doing so I'm poisoning the well so the next time this person goes around that person in some way they're going to feel kind of bad about that person and you're doing it unintentionally but the moment you draw your attention to it it becomes intentional and then you're asking yourself to I really want to poison the well of this person right I man I shit talked recently and it really flew I'm not going to go into details but it flew back in my face instantly and almost within like eight hours it flew back in my face oh yeah and it was like and then it's like I realized like man that was not worth it what a hefty price to pay for what for me was like just a low blood sugar moment where I just you know it well I you know I find myself I am really close to my mom but I find myself not willing to call because I know there's going to be just all this negativity yeah you know just first of all she watches TMZ and she gets really upset that she thinks everyone's getting ass implants out here and you know she hangs on to crap like that I mean no they're not they're not getting I don't know but don't worry about and then and what made me laugh really hard is I realized like even the things she says I mean she's so kind of wired for negativity just from her upbringing and everything she was asked she said you know there are all these wild fires how close are you to the wild fires and I realized like I was kind of disappointing her that she couldn't see my house on fire on the right you know that's it I was like and I said mom if it doesn't happen my house isn't on fire by next year like what I used to say about being on tv or something if my house isn't on fire by next year I will take my house to the fire and then jump in after it to try and give her some hope sure she wants it it's a negative hope yeah she loves it yeah this is like carlin's got a great joke about how he loves it when disasters happen you know he's just honestly talking about oh I love it there's such so great when thousands of people die and so if you analyze yourself when you're watching the news yeah you're getting off on the person who's like on the awfulness that's happening oh I know what I you know it's in such a it's an awful way to channel hope when they say that there are three you know so far they found you know in an accident or a plan that they say so far they've found or they've recovered three bodies yeah you know like oh is that all where are the rest come on I'm gonna have to keep watching until there are more which is so awful but that's I mean that human nature like I want it to be oh yeah yeah it's a window you pick this is the thing these got these artists I've had on a podcast a couple of times Alex and Allison Gray they're these amazing they're visionary artists is what it's called and they're oh god they're incredible but they uh I don't they they they're really good at taking sort of the things that you might witness in the psychedelic state oh and painting it you know they're really good at what at that so some people are very good at that and are they in any sort of state when they do it like are they on mushrooms running I would assume so like I think they're there I don't think they're con I don't know like when they're painting if they're tripping but it would seem I mean I don't know I it's I can't answer it because I'm not sure but what an amazing thing to do though to paint hallucinations it's it's because it's so hard to bring that back but they they uh so they're Allison Gray has this great idea where she says it's like these two there's two windows you can look through you get to pick and one of the windows is the window into hell and that window is Syrian it's like Fox News it's Syrian refugees it's your it's your you know your own personal problems and the limitations that you might be facing and all the horror of your life and you know by the way what could be worse just than being in a raft with your family being in a raft with exactly shift from the picture imagine like that's a yeah the worst just floating in the after a cruise in your trapped in a raft with your family or or or um so that's that's a fucking window right so you get to pick to look through and then the other window that you get can pick to look through if you want to is this beautiful window where we exist in this incredible world this beautiful world I mean just like if you spend 10 seconds just looking at a flower I agree it's like what the fuck is this how does this even how is this real this beautiful perfect thing oh my god and it's a life form and I think it might be aware of me a little bit it seems like it might be more alive than we like and that's what yeah I was gonna say I I love looking whenever they find a new species of something like there's this a peacock spider do you know they're like 11 new peacock spiders wow and they have this little it's almost like this that kind of like little light display like this little screen this round screen and they have and it pulses and it's incredible and it's beautiful that this little spider you know does this and I guess it's to attract a mate or whatever but if you look a peacock spider wow I mean that it would just to go along with what you're saying like I that to me makes me feel like oh you know there's there's there's so much to just you know wonder about and be happy about because there's just so many beautiful things but yeah so that's true it's just what you choose you're choosing yeah that's the point you're picking which one you want and every single second you're deciding am I gonna look at like the hell realm or am I gonna look at the realm of the gods and you're you're choosing and even if you're in a shitty situation you can always find something about it that's that's really quite poignant and beautiful and sweet it just you just you pick this is the infuriating thing man but you know I was gonna ask you to like have you ever had an um an acid trip where I mean I mean that seems like what they're doing is such a brilliant you know manifestation or just such a um to actually be able to because you can't really even explain it to anyone but if you could paint it yourself of what you're seeing that would tell you so much too about your subconscious I think oh yeah like have you what was what what's an example of like the most insane visual you've had on acid yeah the most insane visual was staring at my friend the roof of my friend's car which was seething with skulls whoa and then um and then and then that transformed into an above ground view of my coffin being lowered into the ground while my family stood around weeping incredible that was a lot of acid but yeah I saw that and it was like it was just just you know classic death trip classic death trip oh if only I knew god damn it back then I didn't know what to do I didn't know so I didn't get to take advantage of it so I just freaked out and resisted if only I had died you know in that moment you die like whenever the the the hallucinogen is giving you a chance to die uh-huh just die oh it's true because you I remember I had one acid trip it was my only one it was so horrible I was with my friend and we were in New York uh and and I did the classic thing this other what was three of us and this friend gave us just a small tab and we did the classic thing and I wound up just my friend Linda and I were left we did the classic thing after half hour saying this doesn't seem like it's doing anything so we took more and then five second like and all the times in life when you say this doesn't seem like it's doing anything if you could go oh no no no no wait wait wait and then just wait and so then we took another and then the um sidewalk started rippling up underneath us and it started to rain and my friend and you have to be so careful obviously of who you trip with my friend it was kind of always been a hypochondriac and she's saying oh my god I've got she started doing this thing with the first I've got bronchitis I got bronchitis I need to go to the hospital and I said you do not need to go to the hospital and but and she's now and I said really should we go should I just say hey my friend and I are tripping on acid yeah and she also has bronchitis can you help us out and she's okay no no I know we can't but the worst worst worst thing was we went I mean this happened so long ago there were pay phones we went to a pay phone and she said wait I need to call my mother classic yeah and her mother had died a year before ooh la la and so that I'm sitting there geez I don't know if I have enough change for death for you to talk to your mother from wherever she is how much would that cost but I couldn't tell her that I didn't tell her at all but really the best thing was it lasted so god damn long did she call her mom no I just said I didn't have any change so we kept walking we tried to sober up and I remember being at Joe Jr's this place this little diner on 6th Avenue and we had grilled cheese and coffee as we ordered we couldn't lift our coffee cups because the acid was cut with strict night so we had to put our heads down to drink the coffee what do you mean your muscles were spasming or something yeah we just had yeah we had no strength like we can I dispel something very quickly sure so they did a study so this is an urban so a lot of people say acid gets cut with strict night right so they did a study because this is one of the urban myths about acids is cut with strict night they just study where they sent all these tabs of acid to test them for strict night they found no strict night god so what was it so it's just it's part of a something from the acid that makes that you can't so you're some it paralyzes you it was explained to me that lsd gets there's a filtration process that happens or some kind of I don't understand the chemistry and it's very difficult to synthesize lsd but apparently there's just like any like alcohol or whatever it goes through a filtration process where impurities are removed from the whatever the substance is and if the acid hasn't gone through enough of this then there is going to be impure it's not going to be clean as it's called or also lsd is very photosensitive apparently it's so tiny that photons degrade the chemical bonds in it which means that if you have lsd that has been exposed to sunlight if you have lsd that hasn't been kept in good conditions then all of these things can lead to the kind of like what a lot of people are like man this shit's got a lot of strict night in it man i'll have fun you know i mean maybe having it in my friend's jeans next to his you know sweaty sack wasn't the best way to then put it on your time that's what it is these people are like shit man look at this acid i got open it up in broad daylight oh man i have of course had no idea about that yeah but the great way i mean the best i think one of the best parts of of of that whole trip was i said linda are you feeling any better because we're eating uh drinking coffee and just trying so hard to just get back to reality and do as you said is not like slip into we just want it it was so stupid because we were afraid that we were really losing ourselves so much we were afraid of what we it would happen or whatever and she said i'd feel a lot better if the grilled cheese wasn't wrapping around my neck yeah yeah you guys were like just this is what we all do man you take you take this incredible medicine and then you try like hell to stop it from happening from what's from the effects you put your heels down you resist all the way even though this thing is just it's like you know it's like it's like something is trying to carry you into paradise and you are digging your claws and and and just but to get into paradise you got to die and this is just the way it works you know and every single story spiritual story of everything is like you must first die to this world to come to know me and when a drug is making and this is the bad trip i've had these trips man i'm dying i'm dying i know i'm dying do you ever forget what you were doing or what i mean what you your name or or any like did you let it go full merging yeah yeah once once on this like god it's the best trip i ever had oh man way way back in the days very young and like we um we got just this the lsd was liquid it had just been made apparently this is lsd that had just been created so it's fresh acid then like this little places by the side of the street like the taffy that you get along the side of the road yeah like i stopped if i saw fresh ass fresh acid right and on sugar cubes and um because a lot of times when people have taken lsd they haven't even taken lsd they've taken some something that is similar to lsd but isn't lsd so this was lsd and uh i think i've had like lsd this pure only a few times in my life and and i've had a lot of acid trips but this was like my god it was just we went to some party they were playing kirtan which at the time i even know what it was but it was like people singing harry christina and it was just like oh it was just so beautiful everything was beautiful and perfect and sweet and just wonderful and like went back to my girlfriend's house at the time and like we had sex and like was she on it yeah she was on it we were both on it and like i was like it's like the the sex was like a psychedelic sex where like we're having sex but i was not having sex i was in a primeval village carrying going down to the river and getting water and some kind of clay pot and bringing it bringing it back to this like hut and i wasn't the person carrying the water i will but i was i was the water and i was the container and i was the person and i was the hut so it was like your penis was on automatic yeah well it was like yeah like the sex was not it was something else and then after that we're sitting and she like puts on like some kind of i can't remember the Beethoven or Bach or i can't remember which i just i can't remember god i wish i could remember what it was it's classical music and i'm listening and i'm like following the notes and the notes just seem so perfect and then it's and thinking like who's who's following the notes who's following this music who's what is the one doing the thinking here who is thinking this and then it was like i was gone the merging happened that you hear about on psychedelics it was like i became everything at once a perfect moment of just the most tranquil sweet piece and it was beautiful that's the best trip i ever had it was very good lsd this is why you have to be careful about the type of acid that you're getting you know you have i know i remember i mean on that the one i did i really panicked and i asked my friend i said what what am i here and what am i in new york to do what was i what am i here and she said you're a stand-up comic and i remember thinking oh fuck why would i do that that's so impossible what a fucking thankless thing yeah look and it's great because it's liberating you at that time because it's showing you like you're not this thing you've decided to say you're this thing and you're saying that this is what i am no one's any one thing right no one's anything at all and the psychedelic will really help you just witness the game that you're playing and that you've the make believe that you you know it's like when we go out if you're a kid you go into the playground you start pretending to be a cop it's beautiful because you know you're not until you get shot by a cop on the playground which probably happens but you know everyone's so committed to these fucking roles and the psychedelic man it's so good at freeing you from that but if you're if you're very attached to your role whatever it may be then that's the bad trip and most people are very attached to staying alive you know most people don't want to die it all is terrible terrifying worst thing that can happen to you in a movie is to die right it's the worst so the trip the psychedelic generally if it's offering you a death take it of course wow because you're not really gonna die your physical body isn't gonna no one's as far as i'm aware no one's odied no one's died on lsd there's cases of people who if you look on arowid there is a an example where apparently somebody thought that they were doing cocaine but it was some kind of powdered acid so they snorted just an insane amount of lsd because there's no we have very few cases of an actual overdose overdose and they started hemorrhaging so but that's the amount they took was right a million times more than a dose so there's those see the my point is if you're on a psychedelic and you think you're dying more than likely you're not dying you're fit you're not you're physically not dying but your ego is dying and so just if you can just like just let it kill you i don't man i once i was on mushrooms watching the simpsons like laying in bed and a cramp had started in my foot and was moving up my leg and i knew when the cramp got to my heart that i would die for sure i'm like as soon as this cramp gets to my heart i'm over man but it's the simpsons are on and it's really funny so i'm like in the midst of this dying i'm laughing my ass off it was very funny because i'd go from like i'm dying this is over to like oh this is so it's really cool really cool so yeah die if you can on on the psychedelic but please don't really die but you won't really die you won't if you do die you're gonna make the history books so congrats for that you will be remembered after you die because you'll be the one person who succumbed to mushrooms it's funny how just how afraid we are to give up control even when even when that's the point of doing it in the first place you still when you're in it you don't want to most people yeah yeah you don't want to you don't want to give up control you don't want to you don't want to you're just so into like this illusion of being in charge that you don't want to like deal with the fact that you're not really in charge and you're not really anything you know you're not you're definitely not really anything you're just this mist of atomic particles saying it sounds it's really funny though it's really funny that were these mists of atomic particles that are going around there's so into like this thing called being a human i mean we're really committed to this shit man like you can't we can't back out you you got it unless you want to kill yourself you really are in some way have to be but you can't it's so funny my dog it's like when i put a bandana on my dog i'm pretty sure like when we take the dogs the groomers they put these bandanas on and maybe i'm projecting but i think they're proud like they know they have the bandana on and they're kind of i know i like to think that too i always make i try to make a big deal out of it you know i have i actually when my dog gets out i have a song like i probably i don't know if like here he is mr mix breed america because you know they are possibly having a mix you know like i guess like some of the dog shows they were saying they're about to have mixed breeds oh wow that's cool maybe they i don't know if they ever did yeah and so but he will walk up and down like he's yes parading like and it's adorable right yeah it's adorable but when a human parades themselves it's somehow noxious or something and when we do it work but it's ultimately just hilarious like you know when someone gets an award and cries or when someone is like just inflated themselves or when someone's wearing really expensive clothes from because we're forced to be a human there's something in it that we're supposed to take seriously but when you just pull away just a little bit it's so fucking adorable no that's such a that's such a sweet way to actually think of it i mean that's such a nice way to like i i was watching an ad that i thought was a parody and i think it was for you know the new you know the spring givan g and it had these like little just little snippets just little pops of people in uh of models like these black and white photos of models and it said life and fun and poetry and i thought this is gotta be this is like i feel like i'm watching a joke i'm watching this thing but it was uh it was real and um it's hilarious we're the most it's like it's like if you've seen the new videos coming like they there's a new video where they think chimpanzees may have started developing uh ritual that they might be doing ritual have you seen that no oh wow it's cool man it's like they i guess they started finding all these rocks around trees and uh base for some reason chimpanzees have started running up to trees throwing rocks into against the trees and doing it in a kind of ritualistic way where a chimp will come to a tree climb up on it go throw the rock and then run but they're all doing it so it's like they they think whoa is this the beginning of like is this how like ancient religion starts is just some kind of like we don't know why they're doing it or what's in their heads but they're definitely doing it ritualistically and it's hilarious because it's a chimp and like it's just cute and meaningless and like but when a person god like i was watching the catholic channel fun fun but you know like they're carrying the bible they're wearing a funny hat and they're holding the bible above their head and like walking around with the book open it's like how did that ever happen how did that become this yeah it's fucking crazy he's adorable like if i came home and my poodle had figured out a way to stand on his legs and was like carrying one of his toys around ritualistically adorable that would be not scary okay that's not horrifying that would be horrifying i think about it i fucking haven't put this leaf immediately my dog's got a demon like if you're done you're right that would be terrifying if your dog started wearing robes and like a funny golden hat with like jewels on it oh Jesus parading around like in the oh my god like if you came home and your dog was wearing robes and that your other animals were sitting around the dog listening to it like it knew what it was saying and then they all looked at you when you walked in the door and you feel like oh no and stopped like when you walked in they stopped they looked at you and just stopped whatever it was there you're the problem fuck you're our fucking problem that would be scary keeping us down keeping us down shit you're right there there is something less adorable about it when you think about it that way there's something really just kind of dark and i guess you got to pick what window you want to like i know allow me to bring in the hell window whenever i can oh god though no you're right like in that way it's like really there's actually my friend just sent me somebody uh went to a trump rally on acid and they were writing about what it was like the mistake that they made like how they all realized they just made a big mistake yeah did his face do things or yeah they're saying there's the breathing effect that was happening there's just this underlying sense of anger everywhere i mean oh no i've met like trump's face they didn't turn morphine to anything i think they were saying it was like that like his hair piece with his hair he could see his hair piece was like breathing or so yeah shit laura thank you so much for coming on the show it's so great chatting with you you got we got to come you got to start doing this more often i would love to great and where can people find you and what are you up to you're an angel i'm going to thank you for

they're twins right so it's like a version of that or no no no it's not bad i'm not saying they're ripping off the sclar they copy the sclar brothers they made themselves twins you know i used to have i used to have this i'll not go into but i used to have this bit about how men like twins some you know like that's sort of a perversion and that yeah it's not okay to like twins because they're actually twins that's you know incest and um and i said you know i really felt uh creeped out about it until the sclars invited me home one night and they took off their clothes in front of me and licked each other's nipples anyway i went on to this one anyway i had i used to do this the first time i did that bit though i was at the small remember the small lark i mean the lark over the one

And if you're like me, you have but one question you want to ask, and that question is, What the fuck is happening to me? What the fuck is happening to me? We live in an age of rapidly accelerating strangers, my friends. This is an age of weird firsts. The first insult Tweetin president, the first Super Bowl to go into overtime, the first New York snowstorm following a 65 degree day, the first time that I've gone for more than a week without eating marijuana in over a decade. What will happen? None of us know. We are lost in a sea of abstraction and confusion. We are like pawns trapped in a warring game of symbols between invisible wizards vying for the control of the paradigm. And here to help us get our footing, our grounding, and to understand just what this insane shitstorm that has kicked up around us truly is, is one of my favorite people, award-winning journalist Abby Martin. We're going to jump right into this episode, but first, some quick business. If you can cook, we'll die alone, and your dog will eat your face, and I'll be the only meal that you serve to friend, and that's why you need Blue Apron, Blue Apron. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the glorious food messiahs over at BlueApron.com. Blue Apron is the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country. They will send you a box of fresh ingredients, these laminated cards that make it nearly impossible to screw up when it comes to cooking. When you're not cooking, you're missing out. You know that there are many people who think that when you go to eat at a restaurant, you're actually getting the psychic poisons of your chef mixed in with whatever meal it is that you happen to have ordered. If your chef, for example, has just strangled to death his grandmother in the basement of his leaky, moldy apartment because the voice has told him to, then that energy, the last terrified energy of his grandmother mixed in with the schizophrenia, is going to get into your Denver omelet, which is why when you eat it, you will have a horrible bowel movement because your guts have been possessed by demons. This is where Blue Apron comes in. They've established partnerships with over 150 local farms, fisheries, and ranchers across the United States. Their seafood is sourced sustainably, under standards developed in partnership with a Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. They can be delivered to 99% of the continental US and 99.5% of food deserts. That's places where the only kind of food you can get is old, moldy, desiccated cucumbers from some side crack house that's selling corn and heroin at the same time. You don't have to go through that anymore. You can sign up for blueapron.com and immediately you will have delivered to your house affordable, delicious, easy to cook meals. All the ingredients are perfectly measured out for you. You don't have to go down to the store and figure out how much nutmeg you're supposed to get or what the hell an Asian purple cucumber is. You don't have to go through that horror of realizing that you have someone coming over that you said you were going to cook for and that you have no idea what you're doing. You don't have to serve up some poorly prepared slop to someone that could potentially be the mother or father of your children anymore. You can give them a delicious, healthy meal. Give it a shot. Now if you go to blueapron.com, that's blueapron.com, you will get your first three meals free with free shipping. That's right, three free meals. These are great. It's less than $10 per person, per meal, and I've tried it. I have a friend who has a tradition where when he gets his blue apron box, he invites his friends over, cooks them incredible meals, and looks like a god come to earth. Some kind of Gordon Ramsay Titan giving people delicious, healthy food. Also, it allows you to plug into that primordial part of the human spirit that sat on the planes and savannahs of Africa, cooking and frying up freshly killed gazelles and chomping mushrooms and communing with the ancestors. Blueapron.com, it's fantastic. You can't mess it up and you will love it. I've tried it. I don't promote anything on this podcast that I don't use myself. Blueapron.com, forward slash trustle.

It's a great way for you to support this podcast while gathering up the configurations of matter that make your life so much better. They've got everything. I don't know if you noticed this or not, but I've been using a new vocal transformer, a Roland VT3. It's just fun. I love it. It's what Johnny Pemberton uses on his amazing podcast and I gotta say there is something quite liberating about having the ability to transform your voice anytime you want into anything that you want. It makes you feel free. It makes you feel alive. It makes you feel less terrified. For someone who has a raspy lesbian voice like mine, there is something that is so incredibly liberating about finally being able to be whoever I want, whenever I want, just a switch of the dial and I go from being a beautiful, glamorous lady to being a beautiful lady. It's powerful, man. It's a powerful thing and you can get it on Amazon.com. Just go through our link. Won't you when you decide to do that, please? I also have a live show coming up at the Bell House in Brooklyn. That's on the 21st of this month with Hamilton Morris. If you're not familiar with Hamilton Morris, check out his show on VICE, Hamilton's Pharmacopia. He is an amazing human being who has a deep understanding of psychoactive chemicals and I can't wait to have a conversation with him about the state of psychedelics today. It's going to be a really fun podcast. That's at the Bell House in Brooklyn. Links are at DuncanTrussell.com. We also have a shop with t-shirts and posters. You can get to that shop by going to DuncanTrussell.com and finally, if you really feel like going for it, I'm going to be at the Ram Dass Spring Retreat in Maui. All you got to do is go to ramdass.org. There's all the information you need about that retreat. Sharon Salzburg is going to be teaching there. Krishna Dass is going to be singing Kirtan there. It's one of my favorite things in life to do and I hope you will join us there. All right, that's it. Enough yapping. Today's guest is the former host of Breaking the Set on RT. She is the host of The Empire Files. She is a journalist, the founder of Media Roots and on all around amazing human being. This conversation with her was exactly the mental palette cleanser that I needed. It helped me realign my compass and I think it will do the same for you. Now everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell. Our podcast, the amazing and courageous Abbey Martin. Welcome back to the podcast. I have just one question for you. What the fuck is happening? Game show host, reality star billionaire, running the CEO of The Empire. What's what's happening? So, but what I've been listening to the rise and fall of the Third Reich, I've been trying to tune in to, I'm trying to find some something in the past that lines up with what's happening right now just to give a sense of, I don't know, stability or an idea to prognosticate what awaits us in the future. Is there anything, is there any, what do they call a historic precedent for this? Has this ever happened before or something like this? Well, not in the sense of Trump. I think Trump is a unique manifestation of horrible elements of American society that has culminated into this monster. But you can look at similar types of personalities, whether it's Benito Mussolini, similar fashion artistic uprisings in Eastern Europe. When you look at Hitler specifically, I always thought it was really hyperbolic and fear-mongering to call Trump, like, you know, this could potentially go down that route. But Chris Hedges, someone who studied the Christian right a lot and has embedded himself in the Christian right for years and years, said something scary to me. He first said, you know, Hitler was the master conspiracy theorist. So if you're looking at, let's say, Soros controls everything, right? Sure. You see this kind of dog whistling anti-Semitism today where Soros is behind every protester, every mass movement, everything around the world. This is this one man. It's kind of like Jews control everything except now it's just one Jew. But so Hitler was not only completely manipulative in his scapegoating, right? Only the white, Aryan Germans were, you know, the right race and stuff. But one thing that is really interesting is that he called himself a socialist and he was a member of the National Socialist Party. But so people will use that today and be like, no, like, Hitler wasn't a right winger. Like, Hitler was a socialist. But these are just misnomers that have been used throughout time. Just like neoliberal doesn't mean really mean these people are liberal. It just means that they utilize these terms in order to boost their agenda. Hitler did employ full employment. And so Chris Hedges was saying, it's scary when you look at what Trump could do in order to hone in and galvanize his base and create the kind of brown shirt army that would act as a de facto like state forces on behalf of the state. And yet we what we're seeing right now is not Trump supporters who are being violent, but it's the left right now that are punching the Antifa, as they're called. We're seeing a lot of I'm not aware yet yet it will happen. But I'm not aware yet of Trump supporter, any Trump person who is like punching people or we're seeing violence coming from the extremists on the left, more than the extremists on the right. Well, sure, you can you can point to the Berkeley thing as an example or punching Richard Spencer in the face. The Antifa and Black Bloc have been an autonomous force that has surfaced throughout many different protest movements. I think during the WTO is when we saw them in Seattle and all over Oakland, every time Occupy Wall Street would have a protest, the Black Bloc would come on smash windows and shit. It would be very frustrating to say the least. I do think that we're in a new era where kind of neo-Nazi ideology is being normalized and I kind of do understand why someone would want to punch Richard Spencer in the face because he's going out there ranting about genocidal shit. Yeah, I think that this is a strategy and a tactic. I wanted to say really quickly about the full employment is that Hitler was able to hone in and utilize certain ideals in order to keep a base loyal enough that they would act and be violent on behalf of him. We're not seeing that yet, but we're seeing the capabilities because Steve Bannon is a very scary figure, Duncan. He, and you can't talk about Trump without talking about Steve Bannon because he's really the ideologue behind Trump. He's the Karl Rove of Trump and he is a white nationalist. Yeah. He essentially is a neo-Nazi. He hates even Asians. He says there shouldn't be Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. So his strategy, his whole thing is to demonize the left. If you've seen Breitbart or Info Wars the last five years, they literally, it's like every fucking day, it's just shit about immigrants, women, trans people, Latinos, like those are the criminals, right? And it's the leftists is really the enemy to these people. And Steve Bannon has said time and again, he wants civil war in the streets. He wants blood and guts and left as the enemy. Right. And that's scary as fuck. So if you're, if you're seeing, I've seen plenty of violence from Trump people 100%. I see people going on the street just shouting Trump as now, as now like, fuck you, Trump, Trump. I've heard people in the fuck, and I'm in Manhattan. I hear Haitian women behind me in the post office saying, white women are smashing them with their shopping carts and saying, get the fuck out of this country. Trump is our president now. There is a huge emboldening of neo-Nazi ideology and fascistic rhetoric because Trump has won. I'm not even saying Trump himself is. I'm just saying the people on the ground are heavily emboldened. One of my friends here just got his knee crushed and he got jumped leaving a leftist event. He thinks by undercover cops, part of Gavin McGuinness's proud boys group. So, well, no, this is why I say yet from the, from the right, but it's, it seems like what we're seeing is extreme, like we're seeing extremism on both sides and to even be anywhere in the middle is incriminating for, for, to yourself, to even, which is where I'm trying to land. At least trying to find the place where it's like, okay, what is actually happening here when that's where my needle, my compass keeps spinning. Because when I see Berkeley or when I see Milo, Milo, how do you say his name? Milo Yiannopoulos. I think Milo Yiannopoulos going to speak at this rally, I can't find anything that that guy is doing that strikes me as particularly worthy of the level of demonstration that those people are doing. Like I can understand demonstrating like that. Maybe if what's the other dude's name? Spencer. You know, I've read some of his writing and it's like he does not, he's not like hiding like he's tweeting. He tweeted about the Superbowl something about his excitement that there's three white people on the team or whatever. So he's like a white, he's a white supremacist, I guess you would say. And, and I've seen the, how do you say Antifa? I've seen their argument is like, listen, if you want to normalize is your idea, let's sit down and have a logical conversation with somebody who, if you gave them full power over the planet, they more than likely would want to at the very least relocate a great number of ethnicities to some other place so that you could get what in my mind is a living hell, a pure white city. Can you fucking imagine? It's peaceful ethnic transition, Richard Spencer says. Peaceful. He just wants to turn everything into like fucking Florida to like white Florida, but it's like, and by the way, for anyone losing that feeling, yeah, now you're being racist. No, I will say this. I like white people. I love being white. I enjoy white people. I, but I'll tell you, I also love black people, brown people, China. I like them all mixed together because that creates the most interesting moments ever. And the merging of cultures and all of that shit that the white nationalists are so weirdly terrified of is just insanity to me. Obviously, you don't even need to say that. So I get the concept, okay, if this is a person who really believes these things, the conversation you need to be having with them, historically, we've learned about what happens if you have conversations with these people, it doesn't work. So punch them or whatever. So I kind of, I hear you're saying, but even then like Noam Chomsky, you know, is saying like, no, if we do this, it's a slippery fucking slope. Because the thing is this, start punching these assholes and they, they are going to punch back and they're going to punch back harder and in a more organized way. And with a feeling of justice behind them, which is like, Hey, man, I got sucker punched. I was just walking down the street and I got sucker punched by a coward and a fucking bandana who ran from me who didn't even talk to me. You didn't give me the chance to swing back. I got sucker punched. And so if you're sucker punching, it's like, what does Jean-Paul Sartre say? He said, if you, anything you do, you give permission for the entire planet to do. If you punch me, if you sucker punch me, I've got permission to sucker punch you. And now we've got a fucking problem. Now we have an escalating, which by the way, I don't know what the solution is. So tell me, Abby, what are we to do that doesn't involve punching or macing or these like sucker punches? What are we to do right now? If a lot of us, as we are, as this thing escalates and every single day, there's another fucking nut, nut, nutty, nutty tweet. He's losing his fucking mark. This is mutiny on the goddamn bounty. What do we do? Okay. So I want to do say, I want to say one thing about Milo. I'm not sitting here advocating violence against these people. I'm not going to apologize and be sad about Richard Spencer getting punched in the face. I think it's fucking hilarious. But yeah, I mean, I'm not, I'm not advocating going out there and punching Nazis, especially since they will fucking destroy you if they have like, they're much more well organized and not, not Nazis, but I mean, like the right and also look who's in fucking power. They have the state behind them, the police, DHS, all these like fascistic Gestapo entities. But I will say that Milo is not an innocent person. He, he used to sport open neo-Nazis symbology. He had an iron iron cross that he would sport on his Instagram. He now likens himself more as like a performance artist where he kind of hides under the guise of like, oh, I'm just pushing the envelope as far as I can. I think going back to the Steve Bannon thing, I think this is a strategy in order to make the left seem like the violent and people are saying, oh, it's the left to our fascist, not knowing what the fuck fascism means. But Milo has singled out trans students at schools before on college campuses. One person had to quit school because he put her face up on the projector in, in a mob of angry xenophobes and started calling her out and said, look at this dude, it looks like a dude in a wig. I want to fuck him and just said all this crazy shit. He also puts up the ICE number and says purge your local undocumented students and people. So that kind of free speech, quote unquote, I think posits also as like incitement to violence and incitement to hatred. And I, and I don't blame people for coming out in mass to try to shut down, especially when you're speaking at like a public university, you know, taxpayer funded space. Like he's free to go to alt-right meetup groups and KKK shit and go speak. But I can see why in one of the most radical institutions in the country that people would go out and mass to try to shut them down. I don't think that you should be, you know, burning shit and breaking windows. And also I don't like this snide term for people who are like, hey, don't break windows. And they're like, oh, you're a window protector or whatever they call it. It's like, no, this is like you're smashing one. Like, oh, it's just a Starbucks or whatever the fuck. It's like, well, clearly you don't understand how franchises work. You know, this is just a person who franchised a place who like is like any of us and you don't know their political leanings or whatever. I disagree right now. And I know I get it. A lot of you are thinking, yeah, but this is the only time to do it. This is the time if you're going to do it now, do it now. If you're going to break windows, break them now. Better to break windows now than when the fucking tanks are rolling through the streets and they're gathering us up to put us into fucking camps. My instinct, though, right now is this is not what we're supposed to be doing right now. It's histrionic. I think that the universities are places where insane ideas, even noxious ideas, even noxious personalities, even the worst of worst ideas should be allowed without being shut down in the most obvious way. Should they be invited? Should Al-Qaeda and should be in London if you were alive, be invited to university? I tell you, I've been wanting to interview. I would love to interview someone from ISIS. I'd love to talk to somebody about that insanity, just to hear it and understand it so that we can really, really do something about it. Because you saw what happened with Milo. His book sales went off the fucking charts. Here's what's going to happen is no other university is going to invite him on because if they do, they know the risk. Like, Berkeley, what, lost like tens of thousands of dollars. I mean, it's risky as fuck. Like, they might invite him to speak, but I don't think Berkeley is going to have him. I think that, to me, that is problematic because when, OK, here's the problem. If someone is a fascist, I mean a real, like a Hitler level fascist with his 24 points that they originally came up with and involved, like a terrible, it's horror what they were doing in the very beginning when they're just seven people meeting in some dirty fucking bar. And I don't know where they were in Germany, but like from that, from from that, like God, when you're on this rise and fall of the Third Reich is so good. But when you're here, when you just think there are all these moments, right? There are all these potential moments where that could have been stopped. You know, and in that case, you know, fuck, yeah, all of them punch them. What were those moments like? What give me one of them? Oh, God, well, you see moments, for example, where you just where he was like rejected from art school or then he was couldn't become an art. He could maybe someone at art school said we should go to architectural school. He couldn't go to architectural school because he was he didn't have good grades in high school. And then his mother dying of breast cancer, you know, you think, oh, fuck, really, the Holocaust was kind of caused by breast cancer. Because after his mother died, he went nuts. You know, that's when you just there's all these little moments, right? Where where something could have stopped him. So from that logic, I get the idea of like shit, maybe when Spencer got punched in the fucking face, that knocked him off track from becoming the next Hitler or something like that. Even though I don't think it did, I think it just made him into a martyr and boldened him. I think it made him like it made it excites a lot of people who want the excuse to use violence. So I think that the the the idea of calling someone a fascist, right? This is a fascist. OK, fine. But let's really make sure this is a fucking fascist, right? Because I was looking at this actually is because everyone's throwing the term fascist around and on Wikipedia, they have the definition of fascism. And I was thinking, my God, this doesn't just apply to the right. This applies to the far left, too. How does it apply to the far left? Well, because the swarm, let's check this out. This is hold on one second here. Umberto Ecos, Umberto Ecos, 14 general properties of fast fascist ideology. And might I just say, I see the look you're giving me. Listen, I do not believe this fucking immigration shit. The all the stuff that he's doing right now. And I'm not what I call I'm not a trumpet or whatever they call it. But simultaneously, I'm when we start punching people, shutting down people's ability to speak, when we start swarming on people, when we start attacking people in this way, we unfortunately fall into this. It's easy to become the monster you're trying to kill. Who said that Churchill? I can't remember, but read me what you're saying, because I think that you're misrepresenting what the extreme left is left. Leftist ideology is not fascistic in its nature. So we're really misrepresenting the terms. Okay, then I'm saying it wrong. Okay. So, so look, tell me what you think is fascist about the far left. Let's go through the points. Um, the cult of tradition characterized by cultural syncretism, even the risk of when all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur. Okay, we don't have that. That's not there. The rejection of modernism, uh, which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Definitely not there. The cult of action for action's sake, which dictates the action as of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. I kind of believe that. I like that. That's like from the Bhagavad Gita, you have a right to your action. So shit, I'm a little bit of a fascist. Here's where we get into what bothers me. And again, I think when you re list these, you could almost make a chart of who lands on, on these points. Disagreement is treason. Fascism devalues intellectual dis fascism, devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning is barriers to action. What does that sound like? As well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in syncretistic faith. Right there. Disagreement is treason. This asshole is a fucking Nazi, secret Nazi, hidden Nazi. We can't let him speak. We can't let him fucking speak. I don't think anyone's saying we can't let Milo speak. I just think they were saying, don't fucking speak on Berkeley's campus. And to me, you're actually falling prey to the Trumpettes. You are now just blindly parroting their bullshit, being like, the leftist fascist. When you resort to violence, dude, we're living in a fucking fascist police state right now. Trump is at the power and you're talking about fucking leftists right now. This is bullshit, dude. I don't, I just, I disagree with you. Again, this is, I think this is what Steve Bannon wants, dude. Well, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to be what Steve Bannon wants or what anybody wants. I just want to be able to use logic to go to like, think about like, OK, if we're going to start shutting people down, let's like, be really certain what we're doing and why we're doing it. Okay, well, when the president of the United States takes to Twitter and threatens universities on behalf of Milo, I don't really think that's shutting anyone down. I think that's the president of the fucking United States being like, I'm going to send out police to protect your ass. That's horrible. That's fucking crazy. No one's shutting Milo down. He has the right to be an asshole anywhere he wants to be, other than where people fucking don't want him, students that are trans and undocumented and don't want fucking people out there inciting violence against them. I get it. So you're saying Milo gets to speak, except he doesn't get to speak at university. I'm saying I understand why people at universities are threatened by him and want to prevent him from speaking there. He has the right. He no one's preventing him from going out and speaking where he wants to, other than that. No. So but you're you're saying not it. You're saying people, if someone comes to a university like him to speak, then the action that of like rioting, I never said that I just said, I understand why students want to shut him down because he is a threat to students. That's what I just said that the trans woman that he publicly mocked and made her quit school and he urges people to purge their undocumented students at school. That's disgusting. No, that is that is fucked up. No, I totally super fucked up. But God damn it. Is it is the right way to do it to like set trash cans on fire, break windows, mace that woman who got maced? Well, that's fucked up. It's fucked up. Masing women. But I think when you look at the Masing anybody. Traditional explanation of fascism is the marriage of corporations in the state. And that has been happening for a long time. And Trump is just the demagogue who's taken it to a new level and boldening fascist rhetoric of people who are xenophobic, crazy motherfuckers who now think the left is their outliers and their anti-establishment. The left is the target. And it's really dangerous. Let's keep going through these. Okay, go for it. Appeal to a frustrated middle class. I'd say if we've got a whiteboard here, that's we're going to chalk up that to Trump or for sure. Obsession with a plot and hyping up an enemy threat here on one side of the spectrum, it's fucking Russia, man. It's Russia. They hacked us. They got us. Russia got us on the other side of the spectrum. It's like what you were saying in the beginning. It's fucking the goddamn Muslims or no, it's fucking Soros, Soros. So both sides get a mark right there. Both sides obsession with a plot. Then we have fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies at the same time, too strong and too weak. On the one hand, fascist play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will. I don't know. It's hard for me to figure that one out, which side that lands on. I don't know. Check this one out, though. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy because life is permanent warfare. There must always be an enemy to fight, both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini work first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended and did use. That one right there, pacifism is trafficking with the enemy right there to say from my perspective, you know what? I don't want to fucking punch Milo. I don't want to fucking throw shit through windows. People like, no, you do that and you're one of them. That lands on that fucking side. By the way, I went through this and I was like, oh my God, it's both, this is extremism that we're seeing. Now, I might have misinterpreted the left or something. I'm totally willing to admit that because I didn't, I should have looked up leftism before I looked up this, but regardless, whoever's punching and swarming and doing this stuff, they fall into some of these slots, not all of them, contempt for the weak, which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism. I'm going to say that we're going to land on that. We're going to give a mark for the Trumpeters right there because there are a lot of like, what's the term they use? Oh, you poor, precious snowflake, contempt for the weak, Trumpeters, get a point on the board. All right, everybody is educated to become a hero, which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. The, your fascist hero is impatient to die. And as impatient, he more frequently sends other people to death. I can't remember who just said that, but somebody did just say they would die for Trump. Oh, it's Jones. Oh, yeah. There you go. Bob, point for Jones on the fascist side of the board. Machismo, which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere, definitely the left, right? No, there's no Machismo on the Trump side. And then selective populism, the people conceived monolithically, have a common will distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual as no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous. The leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will, though truly dictates it. Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions. They accuse of no longer representing the voice of the people like the fucking judicial branch of the government. That fucking, what did he say about the judge? So-called judge is like, these so-called judges, how dare you? It's like, dude, these are judges. Bush appointed the judge. Like you just decide you're a judge. You're like, no, I'm a judge. Like, no, I am. Trump's like, no, you are. No, you're not. It's an alternative fact. And then news, news speak. Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning. So definitely if we're going to talk about an impoverished vocabulary, just fucking scroll through Trump's tweets, man. But still, you do see how we're like, yeah, these characteristics, not everyone's meeting all of them yet. Thank God. But there are many some people on one side are meeting one. Some people are meeting the other. This is why I think it's important to be really aware of what's happening, because I get it. Why are we punching? Why are we calling people snowflakes? Why are we deporting people? Why are we we're afraid? That's on both sides, I would say. There's a lot of fear, right, Abby? Yeah, but there's only one side that has the full force of the U.S. Empire behind them, and they are actually enacting rapid legislation that is demonizing all of these groups of marginalized people. And that is very scary. So there is a very rapid rate that one side is unfolding their power right now. So I understand a lot of the heightened tensions. I get the emotions are really, really extreme right now. But yeah, we need to take a step back and figure out what the long term strategy is here. That's right. We have to figure that out. And that and that long term strategy is hard to figure out right now, because it seems like it's such a fluid battlefield. Things are changing so quickly. I have it hasn't happened yet, but I have a fear that they're going to take the internet away. They're going to figure out a way to that seems like that would be on the list of things they don't want. But simultaneously, don't you have a little bit of hope that the system that's in place is going to, in some way or another, the system of checks and balances is going to prevent him? Is that naive of me to have that? I did think that, Duncan. I never actually finished my point about Hitler, that the full employment thing, Trump is actually looking to maybe do that. And if Bannon is smart enough, they will create some sort of jobs program for like the blue collar Rust Belt, this infrastructure program that he's talking about. And that's what I was saying kind of is similar to Hitler, like really investing in his base, making him happy and loyal. But I think that with the presidency, we've seen more power than I ever thought the executive branch had. Like, what in the fuck was Obama doing for eight years? Jesus Christ. What a fucking loser. He's not in his goddamn hands. Two years, Congress had total fucking control and just didn't do a goddamn thing. And so now Trump gets in and fucking unravels the whole country in five days. I mean, I think what we're seeing is, wow, the executive branch has way, way too much power. And I honestly don't know, Duncan, if we have institutions that can prevent this. I think, ah, contrary, I think that Obama allowing kind of this free-for-all, not ending the wars, continuing the mass surveillance state, police state expansion. We all were warning him for this last eight years. Like, dude, we don't want someone like Trump to get in and take the helm for very good fucking reason. This is another, and I think it's an important point to go deeper into. This is another interesting thing that's happening is the indictment of the Democratic Party that's happening through the Trump presidency. And if you, God, I can remember tweeting some shit about Hillary Clinton. I can't remember what it was because I feel a little bit of anger towards her. I feel a little anger towards the DNC. I feel like, so I tweeted something like that. And then you get the, so you know, you get in the same way that you get propaganda terms that pop up, right? So one of the propaganda terms when it comes to punching people like Richard Spencer is, do you want to let, and I've heard that you know that like it's something that someone invented when like a bunch of different people are saying the exact same thing. And that what they say is, oh, so you want to let a fascist speak. So you hear that different versions of that popping up because that's a pre-programmed response. In the same way, if you talk shit about Hillary Clinton, the pre-programmed response is now is not the time to blame. And it's like, no, no, no, if we are to like strategize and come up with like an intelligent and effective way to get somebody in there who isn't going to potentially start World War III, we need to place blame so we can understand what happened. And Motherfucker, just like you're saying, Obama, oh, oh, you couldn't shut down Guantanamo Bay, huh? You motherfucker. Oh, really? It was that hard to shut it fucking down? Because in one fucking week, Trump's like, yeah, national parks, let's sell those motherfuckers. There's sunsets everywhere. We don't need to see a fucking sunset in a national fucking park. Let's just get rid of it. We don't need that. In one week, going away, all these things. So, yeah, to me, there is definitely an indictment happening. What were they doing? Oh, I blame them. I actually do blame them more than I do alt-right neo-fascists for Trump. I blame Hillary, I blame the Clinton dynasty, and I blame the entire neoliberal establishment for fucking this world up, for giving us this bullshit that people, you know, and then you have the audacity to blame fucking us. Oh, the people who voted third party. Well, actually, people just didn't want to come out and vote for you, Hillary, because you're a fucking corporate shell, Clay candidate, who you have 30 years of scandal and corruption trailing your ass. Yes, that's right. And then you have fucking Trump come in and talk a whole bunch of shit about you, that's all true, you know? And so, yeah, I mean, it was very obvious, in retrospect, I did not think that he was going to win. I didn't either. But in retrospect, I completely see it now. Oh, yeah. Now, in hindsight, you can totally see it. But still, so that being said, now what we have is, I mean, I could be completely wrong about this. I don't even know what to think anymore. I'm so deeply confused by the whole situation. But what are your predictions for the next American war? Oh, God. Well, when Trump got in, I think there were a lot of people who were libertarian, who liked that Trump was kind of signaling that he was gonna have normalized relations with Russia. That's certainly why I actually did like aspects of Trump. Like, look, he wants to stop NATO expansion on Russia's border. He wants normalized relations with Putin. That's a good thing, because Hillary, of course, like you were saying, all the Democrats were fucking ready to go Neo-McCarthy on us. Start rounding up Russians in the U.S. It sure were, weren't there? It was nuts. They were posturing, like during the debates when, you know, like you could see Hillary Clinton like, let's fucking do this, man. Who cares? Putin's puppet. Yeah, oh yeah. Putin's puppet. Yeah, yeah. And fucking a lot of liberals think that, you know, Putin had something to do with the election. 52% of Democratic voters actually think that Russia altered the vote. That's how deep the propaganda was. That's the, that is the plot, right? That's the fascist plot. Oh, it's fucking Russia. Yeah, listen, here's, this is, when I think of that, I think, all right, so if I flew balloons into North Korea and attached to those balloons are everything that's fucked up about North Korea. And the North Koreans were like, oh, this is Duncan fucking Trussell flew these balloons in. It's like, you know, it's not the information that was written on the balloons. It's the thing that sent the balloons. So yeah, that was really fucked up to me, whether, you know, and everyone's like, oh, Russia is so scary. And then I saw some, and Putin's a fucking thug. When I saw the, you see Putin give a speech. I don't know if you saw the speech that he gave where he's talking about during the elections. He's like, oh, it's, you know, they're saying these things because of the elections and it's political. But how much longer are we supposed to just sit back while they'd say these things about us? And this is a country. Exactly. How, and that's fucking scary because it's like, why are we prodding? Why are we prodding Russia right now in the way that we're prodding them? I think of everything going on really still in the Russia shit. Yeah. Like, and if you, the most absurd thing about it all is that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. literally fucking shaped and manipulated Russia's entire political economy, helped to steal two elections for Boris Yeltsin. He was the most hated motherfucker in the whole country. And now they have the audacity to be like, we, Putin's a thug, Putin's a killer. You only stopped liking Putin when he dissented against the Iraq war, motherfuckers. Yeah. So let's actually talk about what this is really about. And also before, before those of you out there who are listening, this are like, well, she worked for RT. She must be a Russian provocateur. You, you on RT came out against Putin. You, you, that, which is a scary, scary thing to do because people who come out against him, they, they come down. They come down with some pretty bad food poisoning. Either polonium or, yeah, I mean, I, I denounced RT's coverage of Crimea and talked about Putin. And then I continued to talk about him. And I think that really debunks the whole like totalitarian cartoonish depiction of like, RT is this Kremlin mouthpiece. They're no different than Al Jazeera and every other state-funded media outlet. It's just right now in the climate of Russia phobia, people think that it's like this crazy propaganda. When you, when you came out against him, were you scared? Did you feel a little nervous that something was going to happen to you? No, because everyone was, the spotlight was on me so that at that point I was being utilized as like a tool by all sides. So I wasn't really scared. I didn't want to go to Ukraine. They wanted to send me to Ukraine to report on the ground. I was like, I'm cool on that right now in the middle of a crazy civil war with no war training at all. Can you explain what is happening over there? I think a lot of people are confused by it. And if not a lot of people, this person is, I'm so confused. What is that? I mean, Ukraine, there's a civil war going on. You want to talk about Nazism. I think that people see what's going on in the rest of the world. It might be hyperbolic and kind of extreme to think that like Nazism is on the rise here, but really in places like Greece and Ukraine, there are open neo-Nazi parties that hold power. Yes. And they hold vast amounts of power and they, and if you want to talk about the extreme left, they have banned the Communist parties. They are really militant and fucking scary. And the media whitewashes them just like they do arming Al-Qaeda and Iraq. We like to call them rebels, I'm sorry, Syria and Iraq. We like to call these people rebels, but really they're fucking Al-Qaeda. All of a sudden we're friends with Al-Qaeda in order to out a sod. So there's a lot of whitewashing going on with these terms, but you know, when you look into Ukraine, it's very scary what's going on. We basically helped this armed insurgency and helped the coup happen. And Russia's at fault also for what they did, but yeah, I mean the U.S. is definitely at fault very heavily in the situation. So it's just kind of pointing the fingers at Russia and being like, you guys invaded this territory and da-da-da. But really the U.S. was heavily involved in fomenting this dissent, just like we do all around the world. Right. That's our pattern. That's our pattern. And isn't that interesting because that pattern of destabilizing regions and then keeping this like perpetual war going, which people blame on sorrows. That's one of the big things people blame on sorrows is they wanted, and the theory is they want to like, this is, so for the pro-Trump people, the idea is that somehow Trump snuck through. He got through this incredible web, snuck through, and what was about to happen was a complete, an economic collapse was going to happen in the United States, destabilization to allow for some kind of globalist regime to tighten down on the entire planet. Now whether that's true or not, who the fuck knows, but definitely when you see what's going on in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, somebody likes to knock over the blocks to kick over the sandcastles and then people are making a shit ton of money from it. Yeah. And let's talk about sorrows because I don't want to, you know, I don't want to come out there and be like, sorrows is nothing, you know. Look, sorrows is a hugely influential billionaire that was heavily invested in the Ukrainian uprising. He's heavily invested in a lot of this shit. He hates Russia. That was, you know, when people say he's heavily involved in the Clinton campaign, he absolutely was. That's 100% true. Yeah. And I will say that there are many more powerful billionaires than he. Koch brothers are just sure, you know, two of them. But I think that just focusing on sorrows is wrong. Yes, he should be focused on, especially since the Democrats are going to try to co-opt any sort of movement or resistance that happens and then try to utilize it to sell another fucking shill like Obama. Oh my God, Abby. Well, this is crazy to me because it's, you know, you. So what in a dream scenario, if you're running the show, what do you, what would you, what is the, because this is what I think. Here's my cheesy hippie idea. God, this is so cheesy to say. I love the people. I like being around people. I think people are so amazing. Humans are amazing. What is the, what do we do for humanity? Like what's the, what, if you could create some political movement, find some preexisting political movement, bring them into power. What would it be instead of Trump, instead of Hillary Clinton, instead of the, what is it? Well, I had disagreements with Bernie Sanders because he didn't attack imperialism. He never linked capitalism to imperialism like I did. But I think I agree with the democratic socialism thing. I think if you're looking at how do we actually have a functional democracy? Because we clearly live in an oligarchy becoming actually more totalitarian by the day. But Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist ideals are just having democrat democracy, real democracy where you have democratic participation. You have localism. All of these things are encouraged and participatory elections are encouraged and you have to abolish the electoral college first and foremost. You have to abolish, or I mean, you have to in state term limits. Like all of these things need to happen at a federal level in order for really us to engage locally and act change locally. Yeah, there's certain aberrations like city council seats can, you can put people in that are really genuine. But at the federal level, Congress is totally fucking bought. They are, can sit in there for like indefinitely. It's completely insane. They basically are telemarketers. They spend half of their time lobbying donations. So, and look at all the so-called democrats all voted for every single Trump cabinet appointee. Chuck Schumer to Dianne Feinstein. So, I mean, it's just insane. I think that we need to take a step back and look at the system. Trump and Steve Bannon have hijacked these terms globalism, you know, cultural Marxism. Really, that's just xenophobic. It's basically the fear of the other. It's a fear of multiculturalism. It's a fear of immigration. And I totally lost my train of thought, but that, but those terms need to be analyzed and debunked because, you know, it doesn't really make sense. And it really is just fucking racist. And Steve Bannon has said over and over again that he wants to not only temporarily ban Muslims, he wants to ban all Muslims, all immigrants. He is a white nationalist and he's in Trump's ear. And I wanted to really quickly go back to what you were saying about Trump's anti-war stuff. So, I think that I was really excited about the de-escalation of stuff with Russia. I was excited that he was willing to work maybe with Assad. And unfortunately, we've seen just complete hostilities. Right off the bat, his ambassador, Nikki Halen, told the UN or something. She was at some board and she was like, we are not going to lift the sanctions on Russia unless you give back Crimea after the referendum and shit. It's like, OK, sanctions are an act of war. So that's crazy. So right there, that was off the table. And then Iran. You have his other top guy next to Bannon, General Flynn, who's a fucking psychopath who says Islam is cancer. He's talking about 1.7 billion people on earth are cancerists who need to fucking die. That's what General Flynn thinks. And he came out and said, not only is Islam a cancer. I'm sorry. General Flynn said, not Islamic terrorism. Islam. Islam is cancer. Islam is cancer. Wow. And he also said, we're putting Iran on notice, like their fucking 15-year-old child in the corner of your room. Or like an employee. Yeah. It's like what you do if an employee isn't functioning. You put them on notice. Yeah, put them on notice. Give them a pink slip. Holy shit. So already within the first three weeks of Trump's presidency, we have Iran already retaliating with this crazy Muslim man to be like, fuck you guys, you're not allowed in our country. Already they're unraveling the Iran nuclear deal, saying we're going to fucking put you on notice like a child. Russia's sanctions are on. Already Rex Tillerson is fear mongering against Venezuela, oddly enough. So you see a lot of movement already on top of the extreme measures against women, undocumented people, and of course Muslims. Now, this is the new, this is at least popping up everywhere, is Bannon's fourth turning idea. Right? The sinister idea that, yeah, we need these wars. The purge. Like we need the chaos of these wars to fulfill this insane, like, well, not really that insane, actually. I think the prophecy of the fourth turning or the idea that this is a cycle or that, or just any almost any dunce can look around the world and think, oh fuck, something's going to happen here. Like, I don't know what it is, but something maybe not so great is going to happen. I think Bannon knows about that, or understands that, but the idea would be, hey, I think we need to like maybe try to forestall the apocalypse, not like accelerate towards it. See, that's the scariest thing. The Bush administration was one beast looking back, and Obama was a whole other beast. It was kind of like hypnotically putting everyone to sleep with his rhetoric and stuff like that. Right. The Bush administration, neo-conservativism, they never like wanted a civil war. I mean, they just wanted to kind of try to brainwash liberals into supporting their wars abroad and all their military excursions. But now we have people in power who are extreme evangelical Christians for the first time in a long time. I mean, Mike Pence has been trying to vie for power for decades. Eric Prince, the psychopathic genocidal founder of Blackwater, the mercenary army, has been advising Trump behind the scenes. He is the biggest donor of Mike Pence. His sister Betsy DeVos is now running our education. Oh, wait, fuck. Oh, God. Jesus, you just exploded my brain. Hold on. Yeah. DeVos, I had no idea. She is the sister of the guy who started Blackwater. And people can say, oh, well, don't blame me. Luke Skywalker was not Darth Vader. And you're like, well, okay, this is a family of evangelicals whose philosophy is very intertwined. One of them runs a private army and the other one runs our fucking schools now. Oh, holy God. Good little Christian warriors being bred for the war on Islam, Duncan. That is so sinister. I had no idea. I mean, I knew that she, I knew her family. Like you could see who donated the most or like all the people, all the Republicans who have gotten money from her. But I did not know that she was in any way associated with Blackwater. I just thought she was like, I thought the concept behind her was she's just kind of like a dope person. Yeah, she looks like Dana Carby's character on SNL, like the dopey glasses woman. But no, she's, yeah, they're fucking nuts. And Chris Hedges gives a lot of insight on the evangelical wing who have been vying for power. They've been putting institutions in place for this long and Trump was their dude, like their Trojan horse to get in. So you have kind of two movements, the Christian right that is now has more of a stronghold than pretty much ever. And then you have the alt right, which is kind of not really a political movement. It's more of just a reactionary ideology on like PC culture and shit. Let's talk, let's talk about globalism a little bit because I can understand why people are afraid of the current definition of globalism, don't necessarily want the European Union or some group, some cobble of like quote globalists making decisions about the taking away the autonomy of the United States, something like that. I get that. I wouldn't want that to happen. I also understand the idea of like, well, as a country, we should definitely tighten up our borders. I mean, we have, we did, we did bomb Iraq. I mean, this is one of the funny things about being an American is our idea of war is very one sided. Our idea of war is we bomb people and they don't bomb back. Our idea of war is we attack people. They don't attack back. We swing. You stay still. We punch Nazis and they just stand. Yeah, that's that. That's our idea and that is not how war works. War works and with unfortunately generally in most wars, if you study wars, if you look at the bombings of London or any war works both ways, man. And so knowing that we have, in my opinion, quite idiotically got like attacked a country destabilized. It allowed the rise to power of an extremist group of religious fanatics who understand the idea of wanting to allow refugees in and would weaponize refugee, any refugee that they could, they would love to do that and they would intentionally do it. So knowing that I get the idea of like, all right, we got to come up with a way to make sure those people don't come in while making sure the people who are fleeing those people are allowed to come into this country because they deserve to be here. How you answer that, how you figure that out, who the fuck knows. So I understand that too. Strong borders to keep people in the United States safe. I also understand the idea of like, let's bring jobs back to the United States. Let's make it so that it's profitable for businesses to work here. Sure, why not? That sounds fucking great. I understand all that. So how is globalism different? In other words, what is the right kind of globalism? How can you have a globalism while still maintaining the integrity and the autonomy of a country? So this is where Hitler was not a socialist in the true sense of the word, among many other things, but he was very into nationalism. And he thought that only one race and class could have all the power. So as a true socialist, I believe in internationalism. I do believe in open borders. I think that everyone deserves rights, especially those who were trying to box into countries that we bomb and obliterated. I think that people are confusing globalism with capitalism. I mean, if you're looking at, capitalism already is globalism. If you want to talk shit about globalism, then maybe you should point to the system that has employed globalism, which is the global capitalist system, that already you have what eight American men control half the world's wealth. That is the structure. That's the inevitability of unfettered, unchecked, unbridled capitalism that Trump is literally embodying more than anyone has. Because we've kind of learned to demonize the state, demonize politicians and not demonize business executives and CEOs who are fucking obliterating the planet and working off slave wages. Trump's whole mantra about business, bringing businesses back here, it doesn't make any sense because capitalism doesn't work that way. You can't just like say like, oh, we're going to start a factory here and businesses are going to move back from Singapore where they're paying people five cents a fucking hour to pay people minimum wage. No one does that. That's unfortunately the inevitability of the global capitalist system where people move where the wages are low. So even if they get, and they already pay no taxes abroad, so like this whole bullshit doesn't make any sense to me, but I understand. I'm sorry, just to clarify, you're saying capital, if you want to talk about fucking capitalism, capitalism is a corporation is like, I don't give a fuck about your country. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. You think I care about your country, so I care about profits. So I'm going to go wherever I need to go and if it involves exploiting fucking people to the point where they commit suicide by diving out of windows because they haven't seen the light of day because they're assembling fucking iPhones in some subterranean fucking basement, I'm going to fucking do it. And when they start committing suicide, oh God, I didn't know. Oh, whoops. That's what Apple did. What? Oh goodness, I didn't realize they were being mistreated there. You know, they act like they were just kind of oblivious to the fact that's your fucking factory. You didn't know. So that's true capitalism. That's a great point. So that's a great point. That's globalism. That's what happens. There is no globalism that is not a capitalist tyrannical corporatocracy right now. Like we are looking at CEOs who control everything about the government. And if you want to point to any aspect of our government that's not completely bought and sold by corporations, like that is the corporatocracy and the US is the empire and they are managing the world stage. So it's just weird that people have separated that and somehow glorified capitalism as this is our God and it can do no wrong and we need actually more capitalism and we need to remove all of the state. Well, to me, it's the other way around. I don't think that we, you know, I don't believe in like abolishing capitalism. I just think that this is a huge misnomer where people are like pointing to like globalist entities like the UN and NATO and being like these are the ultimate right. Like these are so the idea is like when you're saying globalism, like right now when I think of the propaganda, the anti globalist propaganda, then what I would think that I definitely don't think of capitalism. I think of some kind of murky contingent of, uh, yeah, it's so weird. I never thought of this. It's just literally CEOs. I mean, that's who's running the whole world, you know, like that. I mean, I can see where people would buy into the whole dog whistling of globalism because Alex Jones and other people have been, they used to point it to like the international banking cartel and like, I always thought of kind of that criminal cabal of like the most powerful people, the Rothschilds. Yeah. But now, like, I kind of just understand more that there really is just like a handful of fucking rich assholes who control everything. Well, actually, the truth of the matter is if you are upset about the Rothschilds or the families or whatever, then you are upset at capitalism. Exactly. You're upset at functioning capitalism because that would happen eventually is that what the more capital a person has, the more capital they'll accrue. And the more capital they'll accrue, theoretically, the less capital from other people. That's just a pair. And capitalism loves open borders. They want capital to flow freely through borders. That's what, so it's capital for, for them, but not for people. Okay. But I'm going to Fox News you here and I want you to shut me down just so that I can be clear because like, I haven't thought of this yet as globalism is capitalism. And I will admit, I have fallen prey to the idea of like, yeah, globalism seems fucking horrible. I don't want a bunch of goddamn psychotic Muslims over here groping ladies in the fucking park. Because that's what's going to happen if we start letting them in. That's what's going to happen. We're going to have fucking, I am not going to be able to go down the street with my girlfriend without some fucking fanatical Muslim terrorist groping her in the park. That's the idea we see. And we have seen that happening. So help me. So I'm going to, so you shut me down. Okay. So let me Fox News you keep going. Okay. So you're, let me ask you this. So your idea is, what are we supposed to take the money away from these families? That's your idea. If you're we supposed to, if it is 10 or 20 or five men with all the money, what's your plan? You want to take the money from them? How much do you want to take away from them? How much do you want to tax them? When do we, where does the taxation stop? You want to put the state, I'm asking too many questions. You want to put the state in charge of taxing these people? You trust the state that much? How do we do this? Do you want to overthrow the state and replace it with somebody? You can fairly tax these people. What are you talking about? Abby, we're going to take the fucking money away from them and give it to who? Absolutely. I think we should fucking tax the shit out of corporations who pay no fucking taxes. These corporations don't fucking pay taxes, dude. So what the fuck? Yeah, let's start with fucking making him pay some taxes. Motherfuckers. They start paying for fucking healthcare. So yes, first of all, if Trump really wanted to do something to penalize corporations that went overseas and employed slave labor, fucking, why don't you find them? Find them. If you employ slaves across the world, find your asses. Yes. Unless you fucking come back here. That's the only way they only speak in terms of profit. Wow. So find their asses and then threaten them and be like, okay, if you don't, like we're going to fucking cut everything off. And then import anything from you. So I think that, yes, I do believe in wealth redistribution to an extent. I do believe that as we're seeing unbridled capitalists getting wealth redistributed, I'm not talking about us. I'm talking about people who have half the world's fucking wealth and people who have that much wealth. This is the whole erroneous nature of trickle down economics. It doesn't fucking work. People hoard wealth. Yeah. They don't fucking redistribute it themselves. So if you just keep giving the top 1.1% more fucking money, they will hoard it forever. So your idea is we take the top 1.1%. So it's the idea is like we take the billionaires or the bill billion bill. But you look at like, let's say Richard Branson. Richard Branson, you want to take his stuff? The creator of Virgin Airlines, which by the way, has a fantastic airline. And I would tell you. Have you ever flown on Virgin? Well, Alaska just bought it out. It can't be that. What the fuck happened there? Well, I like the idea that Branson's got some fucking money because it worked. Or Elon Musk, for example. Sure. So the idea is if we redistribute wealth, now I've always thought like, come on, man. Do you need $10 billion really? Like you need $10 billion. Couldn't you have one? Like one would do you pretty good for a while. Like you're going to have a lot of fun, great weekend, at least for a billion dollars. Like do we need 10? And I've also, I've often thought, well, if I'm a, if I have $10 billion, then there's something in instantaneously unethical about that. Like if like you have that. You're hoarding your psycho. You're hoarding all this energy that could be put into the hands of the people. But that isn't the idea that like Bill, the Gates Foundation are philanthropic. Like if you, the billionaires and millionaires should not be forced to redistribute the wealth because it's up to a human being. It's up to a person. Well, clearly isn't working. So whatever system that we have in place is not working. It's getting worse by the day. I think that there's. How is it of things that we can do for redistributing? How is it not working? Because the inequality has just hit an all time high where eight American men own half the world's wealth. When two years ago it was 62. That's how rapidly. That's what I call working. It's shrinking. Yeah. It's working for them, right? Right. I think that we, there's certain things that we could do before we talk about like a fucking socialist revolution. You can make tax havens criminal. Right. All these people hoard wealth and keep them overseas and like the Bahamas and shit, make that fucking illegal. If you have tax havens, you can't be a sitting member of Congress. There are certain things that you can do to actually legitimately remove corruption from the political process. That sounds like a great stuff. And also fine corporations, you're talking about Virgin. Well, let's talk about BP and fucking ExxonMobil. Right. If you are proven to be lying to the public and doing all this shit and polluting the ocean, you're fined a fucking year's worth of profits. Right. Like there's no more permit for plunder where BP knows that they can poison the fucking golf and then come and just pay a small fine and then just continue doing business as usual. If you want true capitalism, let the banks fail. You know, all of this is like, it's like socialism for the 0.1% where there's like a, you know, redistribution of wealth and resources only for the corporate CEOs. Whoa. It's really disgusting. So you're saying that the top weirdly, the top 1% are actually enjoying a strange form of socialism. They get tons of subsidies from the government. Heat corporations get hugely subsidized. If you cut all government subsidies and let these motherfuckers collapse and stop bailing their asses out and actually find them, this is why I actually liked what Ron Paul had to say. Because Ron Paul's idea was simple rules that apply to everyone. Yes. Very simple. I'm down with that. Very simple. I like that. Yeah. If you pollute, you go to jail. If you extort, you go to jail. Like there's certain things that apply. It doesn't matter if you're a billionaire. I think I know somebody who should run for the next to be president next. It's you. This is, see everything that you're saying, I like a lot. I don't, I mean, I've been listening to the Google log archipelago and what, what happens, what, what happened at least with their attempt at Marxism. And it's terrifying. I don't want that to happen. I don't want, I don't want that. But what you, everything that you're saying makes a lot of sense to me. It's like, yeah, okay. How do you do when the government isn't holding you up? How does it work for you then? Let's see what happens when the people aren't subsidizing you. And then, and then how does it work? If it works great, fantastic. You deserve to have what you have. But if you have what you have, because the people are bailing you out, which is what just happened, then yeah, fuck you. You don't deserve that. That's great. Wow. You know what? Holy shit. I'm so glad that I talked to you. This is why I knew, this is why I knew it'd be good for you to come on the show. Because right now we're all confused. I'm confused. It's so easy to get confused. And there's a lot of heightened emotions. Like we're, sorry that I yelled at you earlier about that. Oh, I don't, I don't mind. It was scary, but I didn't mind. But, but, but I just think it's super important to like what you just said, just some very basic precepts that are actionable, that don't involve chaos, that don't involve adding to the chaos, but are a really very simple thing for people to digest, which is so simple. If you pollute, if you have an oil spill, if you're fucking oil that you're making billions of dollars off of, permanently destroys ancestral lands, if these things. So, you know, for example, like this pipeline that they're all talking about, if, if, if let them have like the thing is if the people with the pipeline knew, okay, you do the pipeline, but if that thing leaks one drop of fucking oil, you're going to jail for 20 years, one drop, you're going to do the pipeline, but if it leaks, you're going to jail. Totally. That's going to make them think really hard about that pipeline. I think things like that are supremely smart, because you know what that'll do? It might not get rid of the pipeline, but it's going to make a really, really leak-proof pipeline. Exactly. They're not going to cut corners anymore with building these fucking oil rigs, huh? And we all win in that case, you know, because we have fucking the economy will grow, people will make money, and some of that money maybe will trickle down, but simultaneously we're not going to fucking get poisoned in some sacred lands. And if there is a drop of oil, then we all get to enjoy a show trial where some pig gets to go in front of it. And the CEO, no lackey employee. And also you don't go to some nice fucking prison. We're putting you in the locked up raw style prison. Rikers. Yeah, you're going to go to fucking Rikers, you pig. So I like that. So let's very quickly just go through what you just said. So very strict punishment for sons of bitches who pollute. Jail time. Jail time if you pollute. Jail time if you, like everyone says, all these bankers that clearly broke the law. Jail time for these people. So in other words, we're not saying stop being a capitalist. We're saying just adhere to the laws that the people have to adhere to. If we start there, wow. And unfortunately, people have looked at what we're talking about and saying the state bails you out. We don't have true capitalism. So let's try true capitalism. Let's remove the state and have like total unchecked capitalism. Obviously, that's not the answer. Look at what Trump is doing. This is like really scary that now we're just removing the veneer of whatever the fuck system we had and putting in like the ex on mobile CEO. That's not good. This isn't something that we should try. Like we already know where this is going to go. So I do. It's not good when the Ayatollah Khomeini says something that is kind of true. We're just like, well, I'm glad that Trump at least is saying exactly the truth about what's going on there. We don't want the Ayatollah Khomeini to sound logic. We don't want radicals to sound logical. By the way, I'm sorry. I don't know too much about the Ayatollah Khomeini. He might be a great guy. I like his beard. He seems actually kind of sweet. You guys have a similar facial hair. We have similar facial hair. I don't know what his deal is actually. I don't really understand that. But what I mean is, so yeah, maybe what's good about this right now is that we are seeing the truth. Like the truth isn't hiding itself anymore. And maybe from that in the next four years or so, people like you need to be talking about this stuff more because a lot of us are falling prey to some pretty weird ideas because what I've been absorbing about globalism is it's the most rotten thing ever. And I always think about the different types of classes of civilizations that they talk about. I can't remember if it's, it's like type A, type B, type C, have you heard of that? So the idea is like there's a scale to measure civilizations. And a type, the first, we're not even considered a civilization yet. Like a true civilization is where the entire planet has figured out a way to use all the resources on the planet in a way that doesn't destroy the planet together to make it so that there's no more, basically there's no more people who are starving. Everyone has, we figured out how to harness the power of the sun. We figured out a way to like spread the race. We have unlimited energy basically. That's what we figured out, which is a theoretical possibility or at least not unlimited because of the laws of physics, but as much as up there in the sun, we should be able to use. And once that happens, once the entire planet is joined together in this way of like, all right, let's figure out how to harvest all the energy of the sun and get that energy to everybody. Now we have a civilization. So globalism from the perspective of a futurologist or from the perspective of like an ideal perspective is what you would want. Yeah. I'm an internationalist, socialist, democratic socialist, so I feel like the international community is facing a multi-front dangers, you know, climate change to ISIS to a lot of things that we need to be working together. I don't necessarily think it's bad to work with other countries. No. I reject this notion of like, I'm a nationalist and I'm all about the sovereignty of the US. I get it. And especially when you're looking at things like the TPP, like Corporation China, undermine our sovereignty, but you have to understand that globalism really means, what are we really talking about here? Are we talking about, you know, who are these people that you're discussing and what are these entities and what danger do they really pose? So but yeah, I forgot what your question was. Globalism means, oh, I'm just trying to, I'm trying, your definition of globalism is different from the definition of globalism. My naive idea of globalism is the people should come first, the people deserve food, the people deserve shelter, the people deserve health care. I'm a socialist. No! Those are the concepts of socialism. I'm going to kill myself. That's what it is. No, no, no, but also basic needs for humans. But simultaneous. Overcapital. Fuck. Well, God damn it, you've done it again, Abby, like now I've got to like sit and wonder if I'm a socialist. I have to like, I don't, I love the people and I don't want the people to be sick or hungry and I don't think people deserve to be out in the streets and I don't, if that makes me a fucking socialist thing. This is, this is the basic tenets of socialism, housing, food, and I'm not talking about bread lines, I'm just talking about an economy that works for everyone. And right now we've seen the opposite. So unfettered capitalism is not working and I think that we need a real fucking reality check about where this country is going and giving Trump all the power in the world to make it worse is, is not good. All right. Well, you know what? I'm going to go read the Communist Manifesto and fucking travel to, I don't know. You know, Abby, thank you so much. You are such a voice of reason and I'm so grateful for you for trekking in the snow out here to do the show. You've given me a lot to think about and how can people find you? Yeah. And I, and I, I'm sorry if I, any Trump supporters are out there. I think it's, you know, reach out to me and we can have a conversation. I totally understand where you're coming from for the good things that people voted for Trump for. Yes, absolutely. I totally get it. Me too. I hated Hillary. Me too. Against Hillary than almost any journalist. So I think that I, you know, reach out. It's time to build upon what we really are trying to seek. I think everyone cares about people. We all want the same things generally. We want healthcare, right? So it's also important not to absolve the Democrats. We don't want them to co-opt whatever is going to happen. Look, there's a good thing happening. Trump and Bernie, I think, represented a change. Yes. We need to now be a part of that change and guide it the right way.

236^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Aubrey Marcus LIVE from the Brooklyn Bell House Transcript and Discussion^2017-07-21^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, my delicious, beautiful, shimmering, translucent balls of effervescent, aqueous, fleshy energy currently trapped in a gravity well and floating through the time space continuum. I welcome thee to the DTFH and I thank you for pressing your ear against the sonic hole of this podcast and allowing my seemingly lesbian, raspy voice to go swirling in a helix pattern into your brain and hopefully transforming any kind of energy blockages, demon infestations, meme nests or troll burrows into something no longer holding you down to some icy, brutalized version of yourself. Walking down the street in Brooklyn, you realize how rich New York must be because every two blocks there's a pile of cool shit that somebody's like, yeah, I just don't want this anymore. Bookcases, really nice furniture, computers and books. You see piles of books everywhere. Picked up a copy of this book, Psycho Cybernetics, a classic self-help book written by a plastic surgeon who believes that there's a kind of internal self that lives inside of you. You notice that you fix somebody's ears and suddenly they start acting differently and how some people, they don't need any kind of adjustment and yet the inner self, the inner physical self that they picture themselves to be is somehow malformed. Surely you've run into this situation before. You'll be around a spectacularly beautiful person, symmetrical in every way, glowing with the radiant light of the energy of life and yet they see themselves as the hunchback of Notre Dame because inside of them is this assembled mass of insecurity, conglomerate of bad memories woven together with tears and this creates this body that lives inside all of us where this, you know, you get punched in the face when you're in the fourth grade or your dad throws a beer bottle at your mom and turns to you and says, this is your fucking fault, you shit bag and this all kind of like starts to grow this inner self and then when you're on acid and you stare at the mirror, you'll see just how wavery the sense of self is because your face will change, it will become a death mask or maybe an Alaskan or a Buddhist or like an old lady or a woman or a man or like a drug-addled freak or a deadly murderer or a demon's face as you're staring at your face and it's crazy and then you realize, whoa, okay, I get it. Whatever I think I am is this influx kind of permeable membrane that's always kind of shifting and changing based on the circumstances around me and the effect of my gut biome and my epigenetic structures and whatever weird race memories are embedded in the unexplored quantum levels of my DNA and then you realize, oh shit, whatever I am is not really what I am, I don't even know what I am. So this book is super cool, at least the premises because the idea is you can sort of use your will to go into the inner self and reassemble it, wipe away all the crusty dried up shit bombs that some demon threw at you when you were too young to be able to discriminate and you accepted whatever anyone said to you as the truth and you just sort of, you scrub it off and then you begin to ask yourself, what would the perfect version of me be? And the power of the mind and the conduit that you are to the universe will pour through you and the answer, you don't even have to worry about coming up with the answer, you just have to ask the question. And there's lots of ways to think about it. I like the multiverse theory particularly because you sort of imagine like, oh, well, if we're in a multiverse or a simulator that has a bunch of multiverses in it, a simulated multiverse, a simulator simulating infinite multiverses and we're in one little node of the multiverse, then this creates this potential of the spectrum of self, the version of you that you are now, the worst version of you and potentially the ultimate version of you, level 99 plus flip in the pinball machine and that ultimate version of you exists somewhere in the multiverse and the ultimate version of you is sending out prayers throughout the multiverse to call all the other versions of you towards the supreme version of you. I know this sounds a little complicated to imagine. There's some super self on a transcendental, ethereal fishing boat, throwing out shimmering lines of data hoping various versions of itself will connect to those lines of data but that's kind of the idea of Buddhism, the Dharma. Buddha is the ultimate version of all of us, so to speak because we're all the same thing and anytime somebody pops into this particular node of the time space continuum with some kind of essential truth, some kind of transformative data that creates religions accidentally as a by-product usually, then that is you. That's you further back in time, sending out these sonic or written bits of information to the you that is now in the hopes that you'll pick it up, digest it, assimilate it and then transform that inner self into something perfect so that it creates the effect of a sort of mutation throughout time so that people kind of, you know, there's probably like some, at some point, you know, when the monkeys started coming out of the trees, you know, that was as astounding as Jesus, I'm sure, when you were a monkey completely ruled by your instincts and you never were gonna step foot on the forest floor because that's where the fucking snakes and tigers hung out and then you saw some crazy monkey do the forbidden act, scale down the tree and skitter out into the forest floor and grab a fruit that had landed there and climb back up the tree with a fruit, that must have seemed astounding. Now it seems, you know, whatever, that's what monkeys do. Same thing with humans, right? Some of us skitter down the fear tree onto the forest floor of the unexplored realms of the psyche and gather up transcendental fruit composed of whatever the next phase of human evolution is going to be, maybe the fruit is the mushroom, if you believe Terence McKenna, but I digress. This book's really cool. It's the idea that you can go within the you, that you think you are, which certainly isn't you, it's just a body and actually sort of do some surgery on the whatever the core instructional data is that runs your habitual patterns, your patterning data from like transforming that or replacing it or amending it with a more positive, beautiful, happy, healthy, focused self, you can actually experience these crazy changes in your life. I believe it, it's a pretty smart book. And I'll tell you, these live podcasts, man, when I get to have conversations with folks like Aubrey Marcus, it seems to prove the point of this book because you talk to these guys and they've got really, really good info and it's inspiring. And also, after these live podcasts, my favorite thing is talking to you guys who come to the shows. We all hang out after the shows and it's a fucking blast. And I get all kinds of great information, how CRISPR actually works. It cleaves, friends. CRISPR cleaves, it does not replace, it cleaves. That's another podcast. Or how about this one? Data about a Crayton bar in Brooklyn, which I pedaled to yesterday on my bike and I ordered a big ice cold glass of Crayton tea. Well, I had him put it in my bike canteen and I really fucked up on that one. I fucked up, man, because I drank this giant, I got the biggest glass. I inevitably do this, man. Anything legal, I just think, God, that can't be that strong, seriously. There's no way this stuff can be really that strong. And I drank this whole giant canteen of Crayton tea as I was riding my bike home. And by the time I got to the place I was gonna eat breakfast at, I started saying thank you, God, thank you, God, for this beautiful universe that we live in. It's just such an incredible gift to be alive. And I thought, my God, this Crayton's really fantastic. Like, whoa, this is some heavy duty shit. But I think really what had happened there is I was just getting endorphins from riding my bicycle in the sun. I don't think the Crayton had actually kicked in just yet, like maybe a little bit, but then I get home and I get hit with waves of pure nausea. Just classic shit when you take like an opiate and then I was bedridden for the whole day with just waves of opiated nausea rolling through my body. So watch out for the Crayton, guys, or maybe do a Google search before you dose yourself with this stuff. Don't do what your dumb uncle Duncan did yesterday because you can really get sick from that shit. But I mean, I don't mean to call it shit. I know a lot of you guys out there love it, swear by it. It's helped a lot of people with their opiate addiction, their anxiety problems, their social anxiety. Don't mean to diss the Crayton, dissing myself. But this is a byproduct of what happens when groups of people get together and exchange ideas, which is why I love these live podcasts and why I'm so very grateful to all of you who show up to them and for all of you who stick around afterwards. Because I love talking to you and I also love it when you guys talk to each other and make connections and friendships and that makes, that makes us a little community, which I think is pretty cool. And I hope we keep doing it. The next one is the 15th of August. And I don't know who the guest is yet working on it. Got some lines out, but I can't say it's gonna be yet because I haven't heard back. It's gonna be a great show though. And the last few live podcasts that I've released, I've kind of edited the beginning part of it, but I'm just gonna leave this one in its entirety because it really turned out great. The only thing I'm cutting out is a video that I showed of this fantastic rap called Cartoon Ball, which is about how we live on a flat earth because it helps sort of set up what I wanted to talk about in the beginning.

What the fuck are you saying? That doesn't even mean anything Are you okay? Maybe you're not okay, maybe you're really not okay And then I'll go back and do it again and again and again and again And then somewhere in there something will happen And that's what the opening monologue is So in this case I only get one shot So we're going to go for it And what I've been doing, what I really like doing is I just kind of get you guys to tell me some stuff Maybe I could mix into it Even though tonight I have something very special I want to talk about Do you guys want to like throw in some ideas for how we can do this opening monologue? Anybody out there? Egyptian gods, not bad, what else? Blockchain Fuck that man, I don't know anything about blockchain Like I can only just say I don't understand it Are you a blockchain man?

Awesome! Awesome! Come to every show! You'll be our house owner! That was beautiful! Cool, okay man! Alright, so here's the thing I prepared for you. I want to show you this video. If you follow me on Twitter, you might have seen me tweet this thing, but I'm obsessed with this video. This video, it's a video that is, you know what, I don't even need to explain it. I'm just going to play it for you, and then we're going to talk about it. It's about three minutes, so hang in there. Really, really observe, watch, and be amazed. Wow, so, I really, did that hurt you? It's a little painful, but first of all, here's one thing. I think it's funny about it. I'm pretty sure for the amount of money that he spent on the stock footage that he bought, he could have paid for a weather balloon and put a GoPro on it and like put it in the space to prove that the earth was fucking flat. Like instead of spending the money on the video, he could have done a science experiment, right? Like, that's one thing. The other thing, by the way, if there's anyone here who is a flat earth or believes that the earth is flat, I'm sorry if it seems like I'm being kind of sending. No, because here's what it is. This is why I love flat earth theory and why my mind keeps going to it. In that video, I think it's so hilarious, is because I think flat earth people have actually stumbled upon something real. I think they've stumbled upon something real, and for them, it's that we're being tricked by NASA, which is fucking, if you work at NASA and you see shit like that, you just must be like, are you fucking kidding me, man? Like my whole life's been doing this, and there's a group of people who like doesn't believe, but aside from that, what they've stumbled upon is what in Hinduism is called Maya, which is this idea that the reality that we're in right now is an illusion. It's fundamentally, it's what Alan Watts calls a wiggly world. Everything's kind of wiggly. Everything's a little confusing. Everything's a little off, and so in a weird way, we are being deceived, and this is what's interesting about the term Maya is Maya is personal. It's alive. It's not some impersonal force like gravity. It's more like a magician or a sorcerer. It's something that's actually trying to trick you in every single moment. So this reality that we're in right now, it's very sticky. So one of the things that can happen when you're alive is you start getting incredibly distracted by all kinds of things, things of the world. This is when I was very young and first finding out about the Hare Krishna's, they have great literature, and one of their books had this incredible picture drawn on it of this family, a mother and a traditional family, like a fifties family. So the mother's like in the kitchen, the father's wearing a tie. I guess he's just gotten home from work. Everyone looks tired. Children are climbing on the father and written underneath it is the caption, the bonds of Maya is what it says. It's really stuck with me because it's this idea that the longer that you stay in this dimension, the more you're going to start getting stuff that orbits around you, much like planet or the sun has things orbiting around it. A person will begin to get these things orbiting around it, inevitably from living on the planet. Like I have orbiting around me of a cat, a fucking poodle, and a little rescue dog, and all my stuff, and it kind of like orbits around you. It's very sticky. We live in a very sticky world. So it feels like the Flat Earthers have stumbled upon something real, which is, yeah, there's a big deception happening, but the deception is happening at a much higher level than being deceived about the earth being flat. The deception is happening in the very nature of reality itself when you become embodied and enter into a dimension where the topic of death is never brought up. Like they don't fucking talk about that. You'll never see a car commercial that starts off with like, everyone's going to die, but check out this incredible Mercedes. This thing's going to be on the planet a lot longer than you. Like when you die, this thing, oh, someone's going to still be driving this thing around for sure. No, that never gets pointed out that, you know, you go into a thrift store, or you go into like any kind of like thrift store and you look and you know, there's fucking cool mugs and plates and clothes and books. And like, I don't know if it ever crosses your mind, but I often think like, how many people are dead who used to own this fucking mug set? Like how many people, like maybe the person who owned this amazing cutlery was like fucking massacred by it or something. You wouldn't know, but you ever think that? You're like, shit, like I'm basically when you go to a thrift store, you know, you're like standing in a kind of like cyclone of matter that has become disentangled from what it was originally orbiting and is now being re-assimilated into like other orbits. And so like, you come and you're like, oh, that shirt's fucking cool. I'll take that. I'll wear that shirt. But one day some guy named Jeff, that was his favorite fucking shirt. Like he wore it when he was holding his like, when he was holding his wife probably, you know, like he probably wore it as he's holding his wife and saying, they're kind of love you so much. Like you're so important to me. He might have been wearing it when the doctor's like, yeah, you know, you got two months to live. Jeff, you're going to better get rid of that shirt, man. It's pretty fucking cool. So that aspect of reality, this is the deception. And it's, I don't know how intentional it is, but certainly we are deceiving ourselves. You know, we're deceiving ourselves because we don't want to think about that. We don't want to think about the impermanent nature of reality. And it, you know, when I watch that video, I think, okay, okay, let's imagine that somehow I take that guy up into the sky. Because I was thinking like, how do I prove to that guy the earth is round? Like I keep thinking like, how much would it cost? How much would it cost? Like if I was Elon Musk, I was thinking, you know what? Fuck it. I would take that guy and I would take, I would be like, listen, man, I'm going to take you into space. And we're going to see that the earth is not flat. Like you're going to see it's a ball and like it will cost you nothing. The only condition is that for the entire journey, you have to listen to your song. Like you have to just keep listening to it over and over and over again. As you gaze upon the beautiful blue marble that we live on and realize how wrong you were. But I think that, so, but I just, I fantasize like let's imagine because even Elon Musk could do that. That guy would be like, sure, I'll do it. But in the ship, he'd be like, I know I'm not in space. I know I'm in a basement somewhere and you're projecting this shit. He's not going to believe it no matter what. Like you would have to take him out of the ship and like rip his space suit off of him and be like, look. And then like as he was imploding, he'd be like, I was wrong. But in the fantasy, I take that guy up into space and I don't know. I have to, I guess I have to be an angel for him to believe me. Like, so I'm like an angel and I'm like, behold, I want to show you the flat earth. And I take him up into space and I'm like, look, you're right. It's flat as shit, man. It's so fucking flat. It just goes on and on. It's flat. And then I take him back to earth. He's still going to be an asshole. Like nothing's going to change. He's still going to face the same exact problems. It doesn't matter what shape the earth is. Is the earth is a rectangle? If the earth is a triangle, if the earth is a snake, whatever it is, we're still proceeding that problem is a much deeper problem. And that is the problem of existence itself and the problem of the impermanent nature of reality and the fact that every single one of us is in a position where we are absolutely certain to die and lose everything that we have. This is the problem. This is the problem. And it is a bigger problem than the shape of the planet, which brings me to... I'm trying to think of a way to work fucking Egyptian gods. And then, baby, I can't do it. I had too much of a plan already. So this leads me to something I want to read to you. My friend, Raghus, sent me this. And it's a pretty incredible passage written by a Tibetan monk. Always a llama, rather. Always stay alert, therefore, and watch what your mind is doing. Think about it. Over countless lifetimes, have you not been deluded, fallen under the power of your negative emotions, and as a result, had to undergo time and time again the sufferings of birth, sickness, old age, and death? Yet still, you cling to Samsara as if it were a happy place. You take things that are impermanent to be permanent. You work frantically to amass possessions you will never be able to keep without ever being satisfied. Surely, now it is high time to start observing your mind. Be aware of everything that arises in your mind immediately, as though watching your face in a mirror. Identify your emotions as the enemies that have spoiled your past lives and will spoil your future lives, too. If you fail to cut them at the root as soon as they appear, there is no emotion that you cannot be rid of, because their emotions are simply thoughts, and thoughts are just like the wind moving through the empty sky. There is nothing to them. I think that's so beautiful. Is that cool? Okay, that's it, man. Let's bring up our guests tonight, everybody. With us here tonight is truly a brilliant human being. He is the CEO of this incredible company on it, a company I'm quite fond of. I slurp back one of his things he makes called Alpha Brain all the time. It's like fucking Adderall. I really like it. I don't think he likes it when I say that, but it really reminds me of Adderall, which I love. I haven't tried snorting it yet. Maybe I'll ask him if I can, but not only is he like an incredibly talented business person, but he is, I guess, I don't know, he might argue with this, but I think I might even call him a shaman. He's someone who travels to South America quite frequently and studies plant medicines, not just ayahuasca, but many others. We'll talk about that tonight. So, everybody, please give a gigantic round of applause to Aubrey Marcus, everybody. Let him hear it. Aubrey Marcus. What's up, everyone? What do you think, Aubrey? Is the earth flat? Man, I love this fucking cartoon ball. It's the best. I do, too. Yeah, I love it, too. Have you ever gotten in a real argument with a flat earther before? Almost. We have a 10th planet Jiu-Jitsu at our headquarters, and so it's like the epicenter of all flat earther. You're talking about Eddie Bravo's place. Right. Well, it's not his headquarters, but all of his Jiu-Jitsu instructors get a heavy dose of flat earthing. Because he firmly believes the earth is flat, and he's passionate about it. He plants it in when they're tired and about to get choked, and he whispers it in their ear. It's like, the earth is flat. Go to sleep, bitch. And then they're out, and then they wake up, and they have weird ideas. Well, you know, man, something happened to me once. I was getting a massage, and the masseuse was a flat earther. And so that's weird. Fuck. That's one of their tricks, is to be relaxed and tired, and then they're like... You want to come, Duncan? You want to come? You want to fucking come? You better tell me it's a flat earther. Is that what happened? Was that the story? You know this lady. She's the best. Yeah, pretty good, man. Well, what I realized is she's giving me the massage, and she's saying the earth is flat. And I had that thing that many people get initially, where you're like, you want to be like, shut the fuck. Yeah, like anger. You really believe this shit. The earth is flat. Are you serious? But then as I'm getting ready to be like, just ruin the massage by being like, come on, this is around. Then I realized, I don't understand cosmology enough to present a good enough argument to her that the earth isn't flat. Like, if I try to like, argue it, I don't think I'm going to be able to do it, man. Like, you know, you need to know some pretty, if you, unless you're an astronaut and have firsthand evidence of having been up there, you need to have some pretty compelling mathematical evidence based on seasons and the movement of the planets and where the sun is and how eclipses happen to be able to get that across. Do you understand things at that level? Could you, if you had to debate the man who made this video, do you think you could argue against him? Yeah, I was thinking about that. I think the best move is they have that live feed from NASA of the earth, like, as it's changing and you just line up, like, weather in places and where that camera is pointing to and be like, look, man, I mean, how are they going to virtual reality, put all this together in real time with the weather? Easy. And then I just leave. I just go away. Easy. Fuckin' they're reptile aliens, baby. They can do that shit. They're satanic demons, man. Did you not watch my video? They're demons. Like, so you couldn't, but let's just say it was using an argument, the classic argument, which is, no, no, no, no, that is a, that's like some kind of like CGI plant. Does that look real to you? That's what they'll say. They'll show you pictures of earth that NASA has taken and they'll say, does that look real to you? And you'll look at it and you'll be like, no. That does not look real because how could anything so beautiful exist in space? How could we be on something so incredibly beautiful as that? No, that doesn't look real because the thing we're in right now is so inconceivably beautiful that it doesn't feel real at all. And that's when they're like, that's when they start choking you out, I guess, or whatever. No. So, but I don't think I have the, I don't think I have the necessary information to like, to defeat the argument, which maybe we all need to do. Like maybe you need to ask yourself, can someone in the audience, can you like, present compelling evidence that this thing we're on is not flat? Shut up! Get him out of here! I don't know where that came from. Who said that? Oh, you've got the evidence? You have the evidence? Sounds like a witch is in the grass. Okay, yeah, so there's tricks, you know, there's stuff you could do theoretically. I mean, gravity itself is dependent upon the Earth's spinning, right? I don't know, no, no, it's the mass. Gravity comes from, so gravity is the mass of the planet pushing into the time space continuum, bro. It's like, it's like, no, it's like, it's like when you're sitting in this couch, it bends it a little bit. And so the mass is like creating a bend. We're in what's called a gravity well. So we're stuck in a gravity well right now because the compression of the pressure of the Earth's ass is pushing into space. I don't think they're this flat, but I will tell you this, it has an ass that NASA doesn't want you to see. It's got like this incredible ass. So, yeah, I don't know, man, but I guess the reason that I'm bringing that up is just because when you begin to really contemplate, what do I fucking know? Like, what do I really know? What can I really, really know? I think you find that you really don't know as much as you think you do. It's tough, you know, it's like, what do we really know? You know, like, for example, do we know that this thing called the United States of America is like an actual thing? Like, how much is like, I don't know, man, like, or even more, like, how much, I guess what I'm getting at and what I want to talk with you about, Aubrey, because you have such great experience with psychedelics is how much of what a person thinks they are has been put there intentionally by outside agencies? And how much of it is authentically what we are? That's an interesting question. I think that a lot of times people imagine and hypothesize these conscious forces that are aligning themselves and trying to plant things in our own heads. But I think a lot of times it's guided by our own fears and our own egos and the own forces of resistance that are inside ourself. Because, you know, as I have experienced it and understand it, there needs to be an opposing force to that force of truth and that force of recognition of who we really are. And that force is going to thwart us in every single way so that we have a game to play, so that this thing, you know, if we didn't have that force of resistance, the moment we wanted to be enlightened, boom, we'd be enlightened. The game would suck. It would be a video game with no monsters. There would be no hero's journey. The prodigal son would already be home and would be staying home, would never wander off, and so would never have to come back. So the whole game relies on the fact that there is a force of resistance and I think that doesn't need to be externalized. That's internalized. You know, that's the force of our mind, the force of the ego, the one that says, I am not, you know, one with everything. I am not love. I am not truth. I am separate from everything else and maybe says, oh wait, but I am God or I am the only God. And that force that comes and thwarts us in all these ways and I think that gets projected out in mass and it may seem conspiratorial, but it's really something that we all have inside us. So I spend a lot more time focused on those own forces inside myself that are thwarting me rather than worried about what these outside pressures are because it all starts here. When you talk about it, it seems like you're implying that we've chosen this reality, that we've chosen this birth. Do you believe that? The thing we're in right now has been something that we've decided or that someone has decided for us? Yeah, so check this out. This is, it's a hard question to answer, but and I go from my experience generally, you know, and that's why I love talking to you because you have references grander than experience. And I have some as well, but recently I smoked five MEO DMT. Anybody else experienced that before? Couple. Couple. So I experienced it. This was from the Sonoran Desert Toad, Colorado River Toad. And it was a really interesting experience because I've had a lot of DMT experiences, ayahuasca dozens of times and DMT even, you know, NN DMT. The molecular comes from plants even more often. And this one blasted me straight past what I call polarity, that division where there's resistance and assistance, angels and demons, light and dark, you know, the duality of the world blasted straight past that into what I could only describe as the unicity. That point when the universe is infinitely expanding outward and runs out of steam and collapses back to that single point where all is one, all matter is one, all of God's mind and thoughts and everything, love, truth, all of it is all one. The devil and the angels and everything together as one in unicity. And that thing is the thing that in my terminology I call God. It's very impersonal. It's the same force. There's no differentiation to say that God thinks is an absurd statement, in my understanding, because it's one single unified unicity, one force only. When you were in this state, where were you? Yeah, I was in Tennessee. So anyways, so I blasted, so I blasted that. And it's like, it is the fucking best feeling I've ever felt in my life. Like, combine like the moment of orgasm with that time that puppy licked you and you got that surprise hug and like, same time for me. And like, every fucking thing, all the things at once, and it was just lighting up every cell of my body. Like, it seems completely impossible that my brain could produce a feeling that good. Because you imagine like, the strongest reward that we can produce is the moment of orgasm, because that's necessary for life. So the body pushes out as much sensation as it can into the body. And then to feel this at like a million fold that, I was like, this isn't my brain. This is something else. I'm into something else. And it could only be described as that. No visions. You know, I'm used to seeing visions and, you know, I talk to the mosquito God and all kinds of crazy shit. And I'm asking, I just get used to that. What did you say to the mosquito God? The mosquito God? Well, I was in Peru and I was kind of getting annoyed by mosquitoes. I have a message if you see him again. Yeah, yeah. I was probably planning. I say, so he comes to me and I go, Hey, man, like, what the fuck? And he goes, he goes, Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's like, I'm just, I'm just nature's taxes, man. I'm just nature's taxes. You got, you got all this blood. I just take a little bit and then the frogs eat me and they get a little bit and I spread it around. And I was like, Oh, okay, I guess it's okay. But then I was like, I was like, but what about malaria? That's terrible. And it's like, fuck, fine. Oh, he asked malaria. That's a parasite to us too. And then in the corner of my eyes, so this chaotic mass that was malaria God. And I was like, no, fuck that. I just, I just bounced out. This is like, okay. Okay. Boy, it's hilarious about that. I think you actually met the fucking mosquito guy. Cause that sounds like what he would say. He was smart. I mean, that's a better answer than I ever could have come up with. Well, no, it's just kind of like if you sleep with somebody and they give you gonorrhea. And you're like, Hey, what about the fact you gave me gonorrhea? And they're like, talk to the gonorrhea. Fuck you, man. But it, but, but no, it's like, no, that does sound like exact. Like, yeah, that's what I'd say if I was a mosquito. It's like, I don't know, man. Yeah. You've got blood. Yeah. Yeah. That's fascinating. Wow. So you have seen, you've spoken with them with like different entities. Yeah. What felt like it. And yet this experience. It was all the entities. It was everything at once. And so in that moment, you know, I was in that space and it lasted about 20 minutes. And I was, and for those of you who are interested in hearing like the longer version of the story with some recordings, I'm releasing a podcast with Corey Allen coming right up too. So check that out. But anyway, so I'm in there and my sitter asked me if I wanted another, another hit, another go. And despite it being the very best feeling that I've ever felt, it was the same feeling the whole time. And already just with 20 minutes of that, I was like, you know what, I'm ready to get back to thinking and struggling and trying and the good, the bad, the game, you know, things I got to accomplish, things I want to do. I want to talk about this thing. I didn't want to stay there. And so for me, it was an understanding of like, yeah, it could be all great if we just decided not to, you know, play this game and have this world the way it was. It would feel amazing, but we wouldn't have the game and the game is where the magic is like the infinite differentiation where we all get to be little perceivers and little gods exploring different universes ourselves, feeling all of the different emotions that are now suddenly available. When you divide that one ball that's incredibly dense and intense and divide that into the tiny little pieces, you get so much more surface area of perception. And I think that's the ultimate choice of like, why, like why, why all this? Because now we really get to break down and get granular to all the little things that are possible. Wow, but so for this monad or whatever, this, what did you, unicity? Yeah. We're like a drug. Like, yeah. So we're what happens when this unicity gets super high and differentiates and becomes us. Yeah. So that thing, our experience of this is that thing probably terrified some interdimensional toad and was like, oh, let me try this for a second. Fuck, I'm something now. Wow. Yeah. That's really interesting, man. I always, I go back and forth on that a lot when I think about it. It reminds me of, are there any Kabbalah experts here? Nope. Yep. Someone, what's the name of the very top part of the tree of life? Kether. Kether. Kether? Crown. Crown. That's what he's talking about, right? Crown chakra is the same thing. Crown chakra. And it's like, so like in the Kabbalistic tree of life, stop me if I'm wrong, just yell it out. But the Kabbalistic tree of life is evil. I'm just kidding. The Kabbalistic tree of life, it starts, I think it's supposed to represent the unfolding of God's mind in the world. Right? Or? Yeah, pretty much. It's, you have Adam, Katmom, the first man as it's called, who got shattered into all these individual pieces. So now it's up to us to put Adam back together again into the one whole. Wow, cool. So that's what, that reminds me of that. It's like when you had this experience, you went back into this totality or something. But what, and yet here you are, a thing again, and you like being a thing. I like being a thing. I mean, it sucks sometimes. I mean, shit sucks occasionally, you know, and sometimes a lot of the time. You know, there was periods in my life where I was pretty down, pretty depressed, pretty hard on myself, pretty anxious, still go through bouts of stress. Like it's not all, I mean, I have a very blessed life and I have a lot of fun, but there's struggle and there's difficulty, but it's all part of it. Like that's the fucking hero's journey. That's us finding our way home and getting lost and having the Silla and Sharibdis for those of you who know the Odyssey and the Lotus Eaters and the Cyclops and the, you know, Cersei and all of the different, Calypso, all of the different influences and things that happened till eventually we find our way back to truth, which is that we are part of that unicity, part of that one source. Okay. I want you to heal me here because I'm going to tell you one of my greatest fears. And it's really dark. So I'm literally at this point going to play devil's advocate. This is fucked up, but I can't really get around it. So maybe you can fix it. Okay. So this is like a psychedelic experience. This came from psychedelics. And it was, forgive me if I told you this already, but it'll be cool with our friends here if we can like, you can like make an adjustment here because this one bugs me a little bit. I mean, I'm trying to think about it, but okay. So when we contemplate the fact that there was a big bang or a singularity that exploded in everything, when I think about that on psychedelics, I have had this vision of a moment where that thing became aware that it was a thing. Like it went from being just a thing that wasn't aware, like it knew it was something, but it was like everything that knew it was something. And so it didn't have anybody to be like, what the fuck? I'm a thing. It was just this field of awareness with nothing to like reflect to, to express what it was experiencing, which was in this vision I had. The most, the deepest horror you could imagine. It was like the infinite loneliness, infinite disconnection, infinite like, it was just horror, incomprehensible. The horror of the thing that was literally as alone as you could be because it's the only thing. It's just a thing. And that this gave it a nervous breakdown and it shattered into an infinite number of little pieces that became the planets and ultimately the people. And the thing that you call the opportunity to do the hero's journey is in fact a desperate attempt from a thing that never should have been to escape from the reality of its never ending ultimate absurd loneliness. And so human existence in itself is nothing more than the desperate attempt of an accidental God to evade the never ending, unrelenting loneliness of its situation of having come into existence. Can you fix that man, please? You know, from everything that I've experienced and felt that we carry a piece of that always in our heart. And I felt that, I felt that thing you're talking about where it's hopelessness, loneliness, feels like there's no way out, feels like we're stuck, the world is turning into chaos. In fact, we all go through that experience at a certain point in our birth, right? We're sitting in the womb, everything feels like infinite space, even though we're confined, all our needs are met, we're not eating, drinking, we're listening to the heartbeat of our mother. And it's just serene and then all of a sudden the fucking water breaks and it's like chaos and we don't know what the fuck is going on. You know, like we've all had that deeply archetypically planted in our head. And that's one thing that Stan Groff talks about is that's part of the process, you know, of what we are all indoctrinated into. But there's some other shit too. There's also the part where we realize, oh fuck, there's an opening, there's a way out of this chaos, there's a way out of this hell, right? And that's through the birth canal, so we start to fight. We just start to, all right, I got this, I fucking got this, I'm going to make my way out. And we get very, you know, attuned to that warrior archetype, like I'm going to find a way out of this, I'm going to make it. And we make it out and then we gasp that ecstatic gasp of air and realize, holy shit, we're birthed into a whole new world and then we get placed on the chest of our mother, reunited again with love, right? We feel all of those things in our life and in our heart we can find all of those things. And we can find the darkness but we can also find the other side and when we find the other side, we know that shit's real too. And to me, that's how I know it's not the, you know, dystopian world that you're talking about because I can find that world but I can always find the other world too. Sometimes it's not easy but it's there and it's so pure and so real and so beautiful and so forgiving. You know, like you can come to that space and show your very worst, the thing you're most ashamed of, the thing you would never tell anybody and it doesn't even flinch. It just holds no record or wrong and absorbs you back in love, the ultimate symbol being that Christ consciousness figure. And I felt that too and so I know that's real and that feels infinitely more real than the other. The other feels to me like delusion. You know, when I'm spiraling through that thing, I feel caught up in delusion and when I find the love, that thing in my heart that's the opposite of that, it feels like truth. And I guess that just has a different harmony like a guitar that's in tune versus a guitar that's out of tune. So the idea here that you were saying in the beginning is we need these two things for there to be the light that must be the dark. So therefore that thing really, it isn't delusion, is it? It's actually a fundamental quality of existence. It depends on what dimension you're looking at because at the one delusion, at the unicity level, you know, that's the ultimate truth. As soon as you go to polarity, there's some delusion. The delusion is that both sides aren't God, right? That's the first very delusion. As soon as it differentiates the first and resistance, light and dark is created, the delusion is that it's not one thing, that they're not the same thing. Like differentiation itself is the very first delusion. So the moment we get into that realm, we're blinded. So the truth is that when you can feel back to the very, very core, that is what I feel like is truth and that feels like love. So this experience we're having right now, as long as I'm playing the game where you're an Aubrey and I'm a Duncan, am I delusional? Yeah, we all are. We're all blind, but that's how we play the game. That's the ante. That's the ante for this poker game, right? We don't get to get in without being blind when we start, otherwise it wouldn't be a game, right? Because we wouldn't be able to play it the same way. Anybody ever tried to play poker with no money or no clothes attached? It's like the worst fucking game ever. Horrible. Everybody stays into the end. You can't bluff anybody out. They're like, I call you with nothing, of course. You can't play poker with no stakes. You can't play life without some stakes on the line. But the thing is we just keep compounding the stakes that are already there. The stakes are there. Our body's going to die. We're going to get sick. We're going to lose all the things that we love at some point. There's plenty of resistance baked in, but we just add a whole heaping shitload of more on top of it, and that's what's unnecessary. Because sometimes I'll brush up against love, and it's like, you know, I don't think I'm going to do that. It's so unbearable. Just today, I was holding the poodle. And the thing I've gotten into is he stinks, but I don't know if there's any dog lovers here, but I've really gotten into smelling his hair. And I'm just like, and Cora's like that with a cat. She's like, doesn't the cat smell good? I'm like, I don't know, maybe, but the fucking poodle. Yeah, the poodle smells good, man. I'm like, I'll hold him. He doesn't know what to do. It's just some fucking, the monkey is like, here we go. The monkey's picking me up again, making those sounds while he smells me. This is terrible. But I'm like, holding him. I'm like, man, I fucking love you, man. Like, I love you. Like, I love you so much. And then that feeling will open up in my heart. And it's like, God damn it, I love this dog so much. And then I'll think, you got like, what, nine years left to live, maybe? It's true. And then it's like, oh, fuck, I can't deal with it, man. I don't want to lose you, Gatsby. I love you so much. And like, and, and you know what I'm talking about? And that's an experience, experience of the auntie you're talking about. Yeah, these are real fucking stakes here, man. Yeah, this is not close. This is like, I'm gonna, like, we will have to say goodbye to the thing we love the most. And that is so on one level, reprehensible, that in the sense where you're like, what kind of fucking game is this, man? Who invented this game? Who was like, hey, let's play this game? You're gonna watch an innocent little dog die. Oh, he's got any other games? Hey, Unicity, is there like, maybe one where the dogs don't die game? Because I'd like to play that. So let me ask you this, though. You could sit around and sniff your poodle for how long? No, what's like the maximum length of time before the pleasure diminishes? You don't want to know the answer to that? I do, I do. I mean, it can't be more than an hour or two. No, no, no. No, fuck no. We're talking like, you know, 10 seconds sniffs, like, I'm not fucking, I don't wear them like a SARS mask. So ultimately, with all these things that are, that are pleasurable, they just, they dissipate over time. You know, it's the temporariness that's the beauty. It's that classic symbol of the samurai of the cherry blossom tree, infinitely more beautiful because it blooms quickly and then the flowers fall. You know, that evergreen perennial, no one romanticizes and writes poetry about the flower that blooms all the time and it's always the same, right? It's, it makes it infinitely more special in a certain way. And, but I think what's really interesting is not necessarily that, but it's interesting our response to it. Because our response to it is almost to give up the good just so it won't feel so bad when we lose it. It's like forfeiting the game before we even play. It's like getting your cards, not even looking at them, pushing them back in saying, I fold just in case these cards suck. You know, like, it's a really weird thing that we do. Because we do that in relationships, you know, if we're scared about a girl or a guy leaving us, we'll break up or push them away just so that we won't break up. But then we miss all the love in between, which is the whole fucking point. The only point is what we get to experience. So, you know, the symbol is just let that pleasure flow through you like you put your hand in a fast flowing stream. And it's just, okay, here's poodle sniffing, you know, here's, here's sex, here's coffee, here's cheeseburgers, here's all these things until I die. And then we'll get another round where you put our water, put our hand through the water and experience it all. And just don't grasp, because the moment you grasp, time is a motherfucker and it'll rip that thing right out of your hand. And you'll lose fingernails and you'll have bloody stumps on your fingers trying to hold onto this thing. Whereas if you just let it go, you can experience all the pleasure. That's beautiful. And is that part of what you consider being a warrior to be? Is that the idea of being a warrior? Or is this some other, is this part of another philosophy that you have? Because when I think of like the warrior ethic, it makes me think like, yeah, if I'm shutting down, which I certainly do, when it comes to like things that I love, poodles or whatever, then that's a form of cowardice. And I think, oh Jesus, you're a fucking coward. You're like, well, you're chicken shit, man. Like you can't fucking deal with loving a poodle. Like how can you do anything? But I think that this is a state of consciousness that many of us enter into. The big numb, that's what it is. You go numb, numb, dumb, and full of fucking cunt. I don't know why I said that. But you go numb, right? You go numb. It's like instead of your foot falling asleep, the part of yourself that's even capable of experiencing that love, it'll only open up for a flickering second and then it shuts down. So are you, how often does your, do you shut down? Yeah, every day. And then every day I try to open it back up again. It's like a constant practice, releasing attachments, anchoring back to changing the point of identity from the ego mind, which is always worried about what it's losing to the consciousness, which feels infinite and knows that it will have infinite pleasures, infinite experiences, infinite pains, infinite everything. So it removes that kind of delusion of scarcity and says, alright, this may go, but it'll just be different. And then I'll experience different things and different things until eventually, from my own experience, I'm confident that there will be a point where we make it all the way back to that feeling I felt when I smoked that toad juice. And that's ultimately, and then from there back to another journey, where another whole differentiation, where this collection of light or whatever you want to call it, this thing that is me and my consciousness, will get ultimately transmuted and I will completely disappear, but I'll still be always connected to that one thing. So it's a constant battle between living this world and then changing my identification point back to the consciousness, observing me in this world. And that's where I find like the real joy and love and happiness. And I think I'm getting a little bit better at spending more time as that self versus more time as the scared shitless self that's just trying to close down so it doesn't feel more pain. But it's not a straight line. I mean, this thing is like the worst stock jarred ever. But ultimately, it's heading towards longer periods of peace, longer periods of joy, longer periods of bliss, but it's a motherfucker to get there. I mean, I've had to burn in the fires of ayahuasca and all these plants and all my own suffering in order to learn the lessons to get the skills to make that transition. So for you, it's ayahuasca. But I mean, do you think this is a necessary component for us? Like there might be people here tonight who are like, yeah, well, I'm not going to fucking drink your smoked toad powder. I'm not going to drink ayahuasca. I don't want to do it. So how do we achieve that kind of what I've been taught is called mindfulness? Yeah. Are there other tactics that we can use? Yeah. I mean, I think and I don't recommend psychedelics for everyone. That's certainly like a super personal calling and don't rush it. I've tried to rush people into it. It's never a good idea. So like always just go, you know, only if you're truly called to that. But I think there's a lot of other ways. So recently experienced the maps MDMA psychotherapy protocol, which is fucking incredible. I mean, and a lot of us have probably done Molly or done MDMA out in like a club setting or outside where it really opens up our perception of the world in an amazing way. Touch feels amazing sound. It sounds amazing. Everything seems awesome in a way that you're outwardly perceiving, but with blindfold headphones, you know, as little sensation as possible. You try to get an almost like a sensory deprived state. Then all of that just focuses inward and really flowers open your heart. And when that happens, it feels, you know, really infinitely more connected than probably any other plant medicine I've done. So I think that wait, what is the protocol? Can you? Yeah. So you take, you know, you take depending on your size, like there's a weight to size ratio and you take, you know, somewhere between 200 and 200. And 350 milligrams of MDMA. What's the standard dose for, like, what if most of us probably take? See, the thing is, most of us have just taken shit, like cut with a bunch of stuff. Like the reference point is fucked. Like, I don't even know. I'm sure there's probably like two. Brooklyn, people here have taken good in the MA, man. I'm sure there's people here like have taken it. So assuming that we've taken it, do you know the milligram? Probably around 200 is like a normal, like good, good healthy dose. So is this map still above that? It was for me a little bit because I'm, you know, I'm like over 200 pound guy. So it was a little bit heavier than that. But it really feels like a lot of the, and I love all the plants and, you know, they'll have a very special place for me. But this just cut, you know, pun intended to the heart of the matter. This like took me to the core truths about myself and about my relationships with other people, about how much I loved life and humanity itself. I mean, since that experience, I'll just find myself sitting in a coffee shop and just looking at all the people. And yeah, they're going through their shit and they're struggling and they're working. And I just love people more, you know, and that's a bigger gift than a lot of the medicines have ever given me. It's just a sense of love and forgiveness for myself and love for fellow people. So I think the world has gotten fucked up enough that we need bigger allies. And I think MDMA assisted psychotherapy in that protocol, you know, where you're really sensory deprived and focused inward. And you have someone, in my case, there was a recording going and someone, you know, there to ask, you know, ask questions. And if I mentioned anything, bring it up. Very skilled practitioner. You were like laying on a couch? Yeah, like basically a bunch of pillows. Like I was flat earth and I was pushed down into the, but yeah. And so I think that's one really great tool, but there's so many others. I mean, meditation, floating, yoga, ecstatic dance, you know, holotropic breathing or shamanic breathing. Like all of these different practices all have a super valuable place in just getting us out of our head and our identity space and into the more consciousness space. I want to ask you because you run a business, pretty big business. How do you fire somebody when you're in this love space? Like how do you, this is something, you know, or break up with somebody you love or break up with someone or two. But like from a pure business perspective, like this is something I'm always interested in, you know, like I do a podcast, you know, so like my job is not, I don't have employees. I don't have to deal with a lot of the stuff you probably have to deal with. But one of the things that we must deal with no matter who we are is the world. Got to pay those bills, got to pay those taxes, got to deal with this stuff. So how do you balance this out? How do you balance out running a business with expanding your consciousness and entering into these heightened states? And do you ever think there'll be a point where you're going to have to make a decision between one or the other? Fortunately for me, like the business is a key part of this whole movement. You know, I don't look at it as separate like this is how I make money and then this is what I'm doing. You know, the business is giving people the tools and the motivation to get their body in the proper state and get their mind in the proper state so they can actually have the space and availability to explore consciousness and to feel love. Like if a tiger is sick and wounded, you know, try to pet that thing, you know, fucking bite your face. Try to pet a healthy tiger. Well, a healthy, well-fed tiger, I'll take that chance any day over the sick, you know, malnourished. And most of us are sick and malnourished in a pretty significant way just based upon the nature of the life that we're living and how different it is from our ancestral roots. And so it's really hard to connect and feel conscious when everything is focused on how sick and how shitty we feel. So, you know, the real message and power of on it is to get that base of the pyramid, you know, this physical vessel that we're going to, you know, moving around and get this thing solid. So then we can start stacking on top of it. Then you stack the mindset practices, which are still with on it. But then you start stacking the love and relationship and spirituality and all these things that transcend and go beyond on it into more of my personal message. But it all is necessary. So for me, when I'm going to fire somebody, first of all, it's a horror of horrors, like I fucking hate it. But I make sure that I've given that person every chance to contribute to that movement because that's something that's greater than me. And I truly believe that I would fire myself if I was no longer helpful for the organism, right? You have to put the good of the organism first. So I know it's coming. I've done everything I can and it just doesn't fit. Then that's where that kind of warrior archetype actually comes up, where you just have to step up and say the good of the whole is greater than the cost of this one. And ultimately that one won't be significantly happy if they're not contributing to the good of the whole. They'll feel it. And so they'll feel worse about themselves. So in most of the cases where I've had to separate people from the company, it's been a blessing. And we've stayed in touch and their lives have improved since then in a lot of cases just because they weren't able to contribute. And that was eating them up. But man, yeah, it sucks. And I remember season one of Game of Thrones, which I know just started up. I haven't seen that. But when Ned Stark was explaining, like I think to Rob, the one who reads the sentence must wield the sword. And so I make sure I put myself in all of those firing meetings so that I'm the one that's looking them in the eye and I'm the one that can transmit and do that with as much love as possible. Because if you do that out of anger, if you do that out of any emotion other than love, you fucked it up and you shouldn't do it. And so if I'm ever angry, I'll never call that meeting. It has to be from a real place of resolute peace. You know, it's like, I'll tell a quick parable real quick. There was a parable of a samurai who was dispatched by his shogun to kill a thief. And, you know, samurai is bound to follow the shogun's orders, so the shogun. The samurai goes to the thief's house, sees him, unsheaths his sword. And as he's about to cut the thief's head off, this thief spits in his face. Samurai, for an instant, flushes with anger, sheaths his sword, leaves. Thief starts shouting in, so, aha, fuck you, samurai, I got you, blah, blah, blah. Samurai comes back next week. Same thing goes into the house, unsheaths his sword. Thief spits in the samurai's face. Samurai doesn't flush with anger. One stroke cuts his head off, right? And the idea being that the first time it would have been an incorrect deed, it would have been a wrong deed because he did it out of anger. The second time he did it because it was his duty. And so it's not just the action that has to be right. The motivation and the feeling behind it has to be right as well. Also, we learn from this parable. The samurai comes to your house spitting his fucking face. And then moves. Get the fuck out of there, man. Gate locks on your door. That's cool. I like that. That's cool, and that sounds incredibly difficult. This is maybe the most serious question. And maybe if you can, take some time with it. Imagine this. Here's the game. God has come to you and put in front of you somebody who just never seems to be able to get in good shape. And says to you, listen, you need to convince this person. Now, obviously the person ultimately has to make the decision. But if you don't convince this person to teach this person or give this person what they need to overcome that thing where when they wake up and they're like, I think I'll sleep for another hour. I think I'll work out tomorrow. I'm going to destroy the whole fucking planet already. So it's serious. What would you say to that person? I guess the real question is, give me to the gen, man. Man, I think there's some forces inside us all that seek to punish ourselves. Some things that we haven't forgiven ourselves for. Some things that we think we're not worthy of. Some pleasure, some love, some joy, some bliss that we feel we just aren't worthy of. Or maybe we're scared that if we feel that we're going to lose it, that same thing we talked about. But a lot of it, I think, is that we judge ourselves to the standard of perfection, which is bullshit. And then we hold these grudges against ourselves and punish ourselves. So I think a lot of the things we do, you know, driving ourselves to ill health and not taking care of our body is an act of punishment against ourselves. For some sin that we've committed in our own mind that we're judging ourselves harshly for. So, you know, my first tactic would be to try to get them to forgive themselves, get them to love themselves, identify, you know, the fact that we're all imperfect, we all fuck up, we all do these things. But we're still worthy of love, you know, we're worthy of infinite forgiveness. And from that standpoint, I think the problem corrects itself. Because as you start to build that love and forgiveness, you'll start to nourish yourself in better ways. And you'll start to be drawn to these things that are, you know, better and healthier. And you'll start to reward yourself, you know, with these things instead of it seeming like a punishment. Because so many times, even the act of going to the gym is like, I'm a fat, lazy piece of shit, I got to get in the gym. So it's still an act of punishment for the sin of being lazy, rather than an act of love and an act of worship for the fucking amazing being that we are. And so I think making that switch is going to be the most powerful thing you can do. I'll remark this everybody. Wow, dude, you're the best. I'm still not going on a journey. No, I will. No, I just was picturing, as you were saying that, like I was picturing how embarrassing it's going to be when I'm at the gym and like the tear is rolling around. Because I think about the beautiful thing you just said. Man, so here we have this wonderful human being with us tonight. Ask him some questions, you guys. There's a microphone right there. Anybody who has any questions for Aubrey or me, please don't be shy, step up to the mic, and let's have a conversation. Go for it. Yeah, please. First I got to say thank you guys so much. I'm grateful I came today. Thank you for coming. A lot of revelations today. But my first question is, I eventually want to get to like a, to make a studio podcast room in my place. And I'm trying to think of the things to surround myself with. So my question for both of you guys is what do you guys surround yourself in your office space, your podcast room? What are your reminders, the core, whatever you guys can throw at me to brainstorm? Yeah, I think the more important thing is to stop worrying about the space and just record that fucking podcast. You know what I mean? Like the very first thing is make that thing real and don't try to get everything perfect before you start. Because that get everything perfect before you start is bullshit because it'll never be perfect. That's an ongoing journey. You know, your guests will come in, they'll give you things, you'll attract things and things will naturally evolve around that. But plant your fucking flag in the ground and record that first episode. Put it up on iTunes and then figure it out from there. Awesome. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's great. LED lights don't hurt. Cool LED lights, man. Some like, you know, like, I have stuff in my pocket. He's right. Just don't, whatever your brain is, you know, if your brain will, by the time you will have assembled some kind of like a cathedral before you record the first podcast, if you let your mind trick you. But so you can sort of build the studio around the podcast. And the more you podcast, the more you'll find stuff that you're learning and you'll put it on the wall to remind yourself. Like, my theory of podcasting is that I try to get out of the way. And I think that's definitely Aubrey's theory of it. And so I have things that remind me of that around. So like, I have a Ouija board on the wall because, you know, the Ouija board transmits information from somewhere, but it's really coming from you. I have, like, something from Alex and Allison Gray that they made, which represents, like, the tree of life. And just stuff, so when I go in there, and I feel like I'm entering into, like, an alchemical chamber, and I feel like I'm giving the podcast the space to come through me instead of me to have to force it. And so I have stuff like that around, you know? So listen to him first, start the podcast, but don't be afraid of, like, making it witchy and cool and, like, or whatever matches your idea of how to channel the energy into the world. Awesome. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Good question. Thanks, guys. I love you both, just so you know. We love you too. That was the greatest ohm ever. I know, man. It's so cool. Thank you for coming. Permanent seat there for you if you want to. My question's more about discipline. So, like, over the last three years, four years or so, I've learned a lot about health fitness and, like, what I need to do to be productive. And I think I've done better at it, but I still struggle on, like, a weekly or daily basis, like, making productive decisions. So I guess the question's more for no offense. I guess it is, brother. But I guess, like, what are the tips you're getting? Perfect jab, by the way. I like you waiting to throw that hook until halfway through the question. Well done. But yeah, my question's just, like, any tips you could give out to, like, just being more productive on a daily basis, doing something productive instead of maybe putting up a video game or whatever it is? Yeah, you know, I think one of the ideas that I've been playing with a lot is this idea of mental override. And I started to learn this from my homie, Bodie Miller, who's one of the top skiers in the world, also one of the top partiers in the world. And, you know, what I learned from him one day is I was, you know, complaining to him that I had a song stuck in my head, and he goes, we'll get it out. I go, man, I just fucking told you it was stuck, like, stuck in my head. That's the point. He's like, no, it's not. Like, who's in control of your mind? Are you in control of your mind, or is there some other mind that's in control of your mind? I was like, well, I guess I'm in control of my mind. It's like, we'll get the fucking song out of your head. And at that point, I was like, oh, I can do that. And then I tried it, and like, yeah, I could. It was hard, but I could. And that was that first moment where, you know, he started to explain to me and unravel this idea of how much more choice that we actually have, that we pretend that we don't have. You know, so you're saying, like, what can I do to get myself to do this thing? Well, who are you if you need, if you want to do something and you can't do it? So you're identifying as something that doesn't have the power. You're surrendering to some form of powerlessness to pretend like, oh, I don't have the power to make that choice. So really, you have to own the fact that you can make that fucking choice, and you just got to do it, you know? And that's the idea of mental override, this idea of like, I'm scared of that thing, I'm fucking pushing forward. And I practice that. Like, I've told this story many times, but I'm like, I really hate crickets, especially the Texas crickets and cockroaches. They're like the skeleton and the legs and like, oh, don't like it. But I'll see one, and I don't like killing these things either, you know, don't think that's cool. They're just cruising around in a tree outside and they wound up in my house. They don't deserve to die for that. So I could use a cup, which is kind of the cowardly way to do it, which is what every cell in my body is screaming for me to do. Or I could mental override, know that that thing's not going to hurt me, and I could grab that thing with my hand and gently let it outside. And so I'll take that moment, not every time, I'm going to be honest. But I'll take that moment to practice mental override and say, I'm going to, you know, show that I am more powerful than these thoughts in my mind. Like, and recognize my own, you know, sort of omnipotence over my own universe, my own godhood that I've surrendered and practice that. Because then when it comes time to make another decision, like, you know, I have two hours and I really don't want to write my book, but fuck, it'd be nice to get two hours of work done in and that resistance comes up. I can apply that same force, you know, to that. And I don't mean to really beat this point to death, but I think it's super important. One more story. I was at the maps dinner function and I was talking to someone who had kicked a habit of being addicted to painkillers. And he had a horrible painkiller addiction and he goes, you know how to kick your habit to painkillers? You put the bottle on the fucking counter and you don't take another fucking pill. Mic drop, right? Like the recognition of how powerful we are, like who is really in charge. And, you know, so that's the roundabout way, but it's also the most direct way. You know, take control of who you are and just fucking do it. Thank you. Yeah, Aubrey and Duncan, it's so cool to be talking to you guys right now. Like, Aubrey, you have been like one of the most impactful people in my life. Like I just got back from South America for three months. I did like six weeks in the Amazon, 15 ceremonies of ayahuasca and five with Wachuma. And it like... Where'd you go? And it was like three and a half hours outside of Ikea. It was like deep in this tribal village and it was wild. But like you go down and you do something like that and you kind of come back and you're like, how do I even like relate to people anymore? Like it's kind of like really crazy. Like what was the integration process like for you? And like how did you like explain that to your loved ones? Like it's so hard because you're like, they're like, oh, how was the ayahuasca, Matt? And I'm like, well, like I was like at the center of the universe. Like you said, like just like one thing. And like it's like, I literally feel like I'm just like talking to myself right now. Like just like, because you guys are just wearing different masks. Like it's crazy. So it's like, how's that integration process work for you? It's wild. Well, there's two parts of that question. One is how do you express it? And ultimately when you showed up to the shamans, how much did they tell you about everything you're going to feel? Well, he spoke Spanish and like I did it. Like I had to teach myself Spanish while I was down there. So I was like pretty much experiencing it on my own. And then like like relaying what I felt in Spanish to him. And then he was like, like I pick up like 70% of what he was saying. But ultimately, whether he spoke Spanish or English, he wasn't going to tell you shit because it's a show, it's a show, not tell. Exactly. And that's so, so ultimately you can't, you know, you can talk about it and have fun with it, but don't take it seriously. Don't take it seriously. Don't think you're actually going to convey the truth of this experience to anybody. It's not even possible. So the wisest ones, the masters, they don't even try. They just show who they are. And if that's intriguing to somebody and they'll tell the stories or whatever, that's fine. But don't expect somebody to understand it without experiencing it because it's ultimately an experiential game. And that's really, that's really the art. Take the pressure off, you know, ever thinking that you're going to explain this the right way and someone's going to get it. And be like, oh man, I feel like I just took ayahuasca. Like no fucking chance. You can do the best job in the world. It's not going to happen. They have to feel it and they'll feel it when they're ready. But you just got to be you ultimately to the, to the, to the maximum. And I think that's, that's also the part of the integration. It's looking at everybody not like, oh, you guys are all asleep. And if only you knew the truth, but loving them for where they're at, you know. And so removing that judgment piece, because as you go further, that idea of judgment, which we all do, we're all judging people all the time. But it becomes nonsensical and delusional. And you understand like just love people for where they're at and just really connect with them on that level. And instead of identifying as this thing that's of a higher level, which can get really egoic, just love all the levels. You know, appreciate all the levels of consciousness. And that seems to take a lot of the sting out of it and a lot of the pressure out. But definitely connect also with people who, you know, are on, you know, can experience you on those higher levels of consciousness. So you don't feel lonely. You know what I mean? And like, does Whitney like has, is like Whitney's like psychedelic usage, like on par with yours because like, like my girlfriend, like. Let me judge Whitney real quick. Hold on. Well, we just like, like, I've done like. Whitney's is Isabel's girlfriend. Yeah. I've just like done like so much more and it's kind of like hard in our relationship to be like, like, this is like, like, I like teach cannabis meditations. And if there's any police here, I only teach regular meditations. But like, there's like, like, it's hard. You think there's cops here? No. No. No. It could be wild. It was just like, like, I tried to teach her like the importance of like meditation, but it's so hard in that kind of like, in a relationship when there's that skew. Can I chime in here? Sure. So there's something wrong that talks about a bunch. It's just like, when you get these heightened states, there's this missionary impulse that can come in. Yeah. And so what he says is, fuck that. He doesn't say that. But like the idea is all we can do is work on ourselves. That's it. We work on ourselves. That's the job. So whatever that means to you, whatever the ayahuasca showed you, work on that. But then if everyone is myself, like, aren't I supposed to be working with everyone? Start with the one that holds your penis when you use the bathroom. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I think that's good advice though. Yeah. I appreciate it. Once you, that one, you'll notice that the more you start working on that one, the ones around, other than other people will hold your penis when you say, I know, you'll notice the tears. But you will notice that things begin to shift, that things naturally begin to shift and that the articulation of these states of consciousness, someone just told me, it's not fair to expect another person. Did you tell me this? Someone just told me it's not fair to expect another person to understand your heightened state. They can love you and respect you, but to expect them to know and then to try to get them to know by telling them through words can end up being an accidental form of aggression. This is why Ram Dass says sometimes people just need you to give them a blanket. Sometimes somebody just needs a cup of tea. That's it. Bring one blanket, cup of tea, sit down with them, maybe somebody needs you to help them move. Yeah. You know? Yeah. And just do that. Like what you're saying. Connect to them on that level and then all the other stuff takes care of itself. Yeah. Yeah. That's 100%, right? And I think there's also an expectation that the person we're with is going to be our everything. You're my everything. Bullshit. Never. It'll never happen. Everything is the everything. All the people are the everything, right? Like love them for their something, not hold them to the standard of being your everything because that's bullshit and they'll always fall short of that. So love them, you know, infinitely for their something. And maybe your girl, you know, I'm sure she has that something that you love and just love the shit out of that. And don't expect her to follow you on this thing. But if you want, you know, if somebody else with a different something is the right person, that's a different choice. But regardless, you're still going to have to love that person for their something and all that you're just going to have to love who you're with for their something and not expect them to be everything. All right. Great advice. Thank you. Thank you. That's a dope shirt, by the way. So Duncan, what's up, Aubrey? What's up? Thank you for putting the show together today. It was awesome. Thanks for coming. My question is, I'm going to borrow it from Tim Ferriss is what message would you put on a billboard for millions of people to see? You go first, Duncan. Oh, wow. Oh, boy. Did you say millions? Yes. Billions, whatever. I mean, it's, that's a tough one to ask because like, I don't have, you know what? If I had that kind of thing floating around in my head, like a billboard slogan or something, I'd be so maybe, maybe so much happier or so much crazier or something. Like, because if someone said, oh, yeah, do you want to like put, you throw something up in this fucking billboard, man, like millions of people are going to see it. It's going to be something about my friend, Brendan Walsh, who I fucked with on Twitter. It's just going to be some weird thing. Like, you know what's going to be? You're going to troll them? Yeah, I'm going to troll Brendan Walsh. I'm going to like, probably put a picture of him up there and like say that he's like one of those like... Child pedophile. Insurance people, like when you're in a car wreck or like if you ever had Miss Aethelioma call Brendan Walsh and it's going to be his phone number. It's going to, you know, it's going to be man, something chaotic, not something pithy. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not going to put up there like, love everyone, man, because it's cool to love. Because that, you know what I mean? I think that that's a tough thing to sum it all up in that way. But what, do you like a billboard dude? Do you make billboards or something? Copy, bro. What do you got, Aubrey? You know, I've been asked this question before and like every time someone asks it, it changes, which is interesting. But I think ultimately the message is just fucking have fun. You know, so Duncan's billboard may be the actual best billboard because every time someone saw it and got in on the joke, they would start to laugh. Like somebody had the opportunity to broadcast to seven billion people and they trolled their homie. Like that's hilarious. Right? That might be the best billboard actually because that's what we're fucking here for, man. We're here to have fun. So, you know, I think that's as good a billboard as any. I back his. I doubled down on Duncan's trolling. Can I tell you a quick billboard story? Sure. And I'm not saying Brendan Walsh did this. Okay. But there was a person who lived in near Brendan Walsh. You may have, there was a billboard that just showed a woman looking at her phone and like it was just a normal text on there. And somebody who wasn't Brendan Walsh might have gone up on that billboard because he printed something sticky that he put over what she was looking at on the phone that says, your mom's, your mom is dead. People drive by and it's like a fucking woman looking at her phone. Like what? Oh my God. But so that's another funny thing to put on a billboard. Thanks for the question, man. Your mom is dead. All right. Thank you and I love you guys. Hey, Duncan. Hey, how you doing? Good. Hey, Aubrey. Thank you guys so much for an amazing show. And my question is this, even though it's not the most important thing, I'm curious about the pattern generators in the DMT world. What I mean by that is like, if we look at a computer screen, if we zoom in enough, we see the pixels. So if we look at the DMT world, the Astro world, whatever it is you want to call it, other than pure light, how can you describe all of those particles of light being generated? And what do you see in like the periphery versus the center as far as how they're able to be generated? Like what's the best way to describe that whole process if it's possible to? Man, you must think, you must think I'm really fucking got some information on that. I don't know. Just like what you see. So to say, all right, so as far as I understand the Sega Geometry, the closest I got was that belief is the most important thing. That's the intent. And the intent to differentiate, like that starts the momentum, that starts the movement, you know, from that single unicity, belief then starts the infinite differentiation. And then the Sega Geometry is how it gets done. It's how it gets done right. And that's just what the code is that builds all the things. So belief and intent lead, and then the Sega Geometry figures out how to get it done. Thank you. Thanks. The question. Hey, guys. That was super great. Thank you. This is a question for Duncan. You mentioned a while ago, I don't remember when a project where you would try to induce the overview effect by combining VR with float tanks. Yes. I've tried to find more information about that. I was hoping you could talk about that project. Did you pull it off? It failed miserably. Oh man. God damn. What happened was, well, it might, so here's, there's just a few different problems. The main problem is just steam. Like, so when you're in a float tank and you put VR goggles on, they steam up. And so the water is like, it's incredibly salty. So there's no way to like, in the float tank, in the dark, like, you'd have to take the goggles off and like, clean them off. So things fog up. The other thing about it is the, very quickly when you're in the float tank, you realize that the float tank seems to have its own mind. And it's kind of like, take that thing off your fucking head, man. What are you doing? Just lay still, monkey. You don't need to see the earth from space, man. And then ultimately, the other thing I realized is that the earth's flat, baby. I don't like, there's like, you know, I'm not going to fucking look at some ball in there, man, because that's a lie. But the, so essentially that was technical difficulties. It was too heavy, right? Now I think if you used an HTC Vive and you ran, you could run the cords, they didn't touch the water. I think there's a, I mean, it's, it's, it's salinated water. So I think, isn't that the most, that you could, that conducts electricity better than any water? Is that correct? Like salt water? So it's maybe not even, maybe you shouldn't have like HDMI cables running out of your head, floating in water with epsom salt in it. Or you really are going to get the overview effect, because you're going to electrocute yourself. Yeah, it's hilarious. You pry electrocute yourself and literally be floating over earth. Like, whoa, this work, man. Holy shit. Wow. Fuck, I'm dead. But it didn't, it didn't work. Try it. Is it super dead? The whole project is dead? What? Is it, the whole project is over? It's not over. I, it's, anyone here can do it. I would, you do it. You do it. I, I want anyone in the world to figure out how to do it, because I do think there would be something really quite beautiful if someone could manage to create VR goggles that were lightweight, that somehow were resistant to getting, to fogging up, that were safe, and, and also program some kind of perfect depiction of planet earth from space. Ultimately, the dream would be to, to in real time project satellite imagery in there. So you are, you have kind of teleported off of the earth and are, are looking down. That would be amazing. So if you want to do it, do it. I mean, that was never a thing that I, I figured even talking about on the podcast, lots of people would try it, but nobody, as far as I'm aware, no one has done that yet. I don't know. I think some people have tried putting VR goggles in the float tank, but I don't know if anyone's tried the overview effect again. I'm going to figure it out. Let me know, man. Seriously. Let me know. I'd like to, I'd like to join you if you figure out how to do it. Thanks for the question. What's up guys? Hey, what's up? How do you deal with or do you deal with over analyzing decisions? Yeah, I think the, I think the key is to know when, know what that threshold is and try to get back to your, you know, your heart, your instinct, you know, something else that, and realize like ultimately you may be wrong. You may be right. You know, I think it's Carlos Castaneda who said he's, which is kind of a madman. I always have to disclaim that because there's always someone who plays gotcha. And he's like, oh, he's a fucking crazy person. Like I get it, but he had some smart things to say occasionally. And, you know, what he said was, you know, just pick a path with heart, any path, you know, and that's the only real thing that we can do is we're never going to fully illuminate the future of all possibilities. You know, so just pick the path with heart and then don't have any regrets. The worst thing is to do is to decide something and then spend the next infinite amount of time stressing about whether you made the right choice or not. You know, if you made the choice, fucking back it, you know, but try and make it from a place that unifies your thoughts with that kind of deeper instinct. And that's how you do it. Because a lot of times it's a fucking toss up, you know, and I'll actually flip a coin sometimes. I like legit flip coins. And just to remind myself like this is a fucking toss up, you know, let's flip the coin and let's just go with it. And I always go with the coin flip. I don't fuck around and be like, best out of three. No, that's a pussy move. Best out of three. You fucking flip once and nothing. I feel like Joey Diaz would do a bit about that. I flip once and nothing. Cocksucker. But yeah, that's my process. Do you, do you, is this something you ever, you're dealing with? Constantly. Yeah. So like that, you walk me through it. So like you have some decision that you are about to make and you overanalyze it or is it after the fact that you overanalyze it? No, it's beforehand. It's like a paralysis by analysis thing. Right. Like maybe like frozen in some, like in your bed or sitting on a chair somewhere immobilized in bed in the car at work. Yeah. With something to do. Yeah. Just something to, some choice that I can't make. Like what? It could be a career move. It could be about a friend, a woman, anything. A woman? Maybe. Like kissing her or something? Or like, like asking her out or something? No, maybe a bigger move. Oh. Yeah. Just like which direction to go? Like should you report her to the police? Cause she sounds, we, no man. Don't have any, I was hoping he, I don't know man. I find myself quite often in that predicament of like, oh fuck, I got to decide on this thing. And that's usually, that's when I make like the best music and stuff because instead of doing the job of making the decision, I'll be like, you know, man, I'm just going to learn how to like do baselines on Ableton and like, I'll just go and start doing other shit. And then, then inevitably though, it's weird when you think back, it always works out, doesn't it? Like, you know what? It always works out. Like here you are, you're here, you're standing here, you're alive, you made it this far. And it worked, didn't it? And then you start thinking like, oh, who's making the decision? Who's the decision maker, man? Who's the one who makes the decision? How much are you in control of really, you know? All of these things. These are the things I think about as I like, frozen in bed, just trying to decide if I should go to crunch to just work out for the first time in three weeks, much less like asking a girl to marry me or something. I'm like, fuck man, who's making these decisions? Who is the decision maker? Who is the one who chooses? And you know, ultimately, I don't know the answer to your question. The only, the most success I've ever had though does match what Aubrey is saying, which is that eventually you just have to, you have to just tell your, you just have to go do something. That's what I'll do. Like when I'm really frozen, I just get on my bike and ride around and then I, like whatever it is I need to do will come to me. So I'm definitely not the one to answer the question. I think you touched on a really important point though because, and it reminds me of something that this Buddhist teacher, Mujibaba, who I've been following recently, he talks about and it's using hindsight as foresight because in hindsight, we're pretty much grateful for fucking everything. You know what? I'm grateful I made that mistake. I learned a lot from that thing. I'm better because of it. I'm stronger because of it. So in hindsight, we're like, man, I killed it. You know, that was perfect. It's just the way I would have done it, you know, for the most part. With foresight, everything's like, I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to fuck this up. I'm going to fuck this up. And so, but if we can switch that and use hindsight as foresight and realize, yeah, it may not be the best decision, but I'll learn something along the way. It may drive me all the way to my rock bottom, but I'll pick something up from that rock bottom and I'll bring it back and I'll be better and wiser and smarter for it. So it takes the pressure off the decision because you'll realize that either way, no matter what you do, you can't make a wrong choice. There's always going to be some value there. So if both decisions work, what's the pressure? So just go with the fun. Go with what sounds like more fun. You know the poem, the road less traveled, the most misunderstood poem on earth. You know, you guys know this, the most misunderstood poem on earth because it's like two roads diverged into the wood and like everyone use it, like use it to fucking car commercials or something like that. I took the road less traveled. No, you didn't ask. Well, you're in a fucking SUV. You didn't do anything special. You're in an SUV. You didn't do anything special. You're in an SUV driving to Vegas. You took a very traveled road. So that poem, check it out, man, because I always thought it was like the explorer picks the less traveled road, but when you read the poem, both roads are identical. There's no difference. And it's exactly what he's saying in hindsight. He makes the decision. Oh yeah, I took the unique one, you know, but ultimately what's unique? Everything's been done. Everything's been done. What is that? The wisdom of Solomon? What book is that? Anyone know what book that is in the Bible? There's like this great book. It's this sorrowful existential book, man. And it's what? It's a song of Solomon, right, where he's like, I'm a king. I did everything. I did everything. Smelt poodles, smoked toad juice, but I tell you, it's all been done. It's all been thought out. It's already been done. Don't trouble yourself or think of our sweet Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who says, behold the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they, what is it? Neither do they sweat or something, like look at the lilies, they don't worry about what they're going to wear, but look how my father in heaven clothed them. Think of how much greater he will clothe you, sufficient under the day is the evil thereof. Like don't worry too much about what's coming in that state of super consciousness and emerging into the Godhead, realizing that you're completely embraced and taken care of by the universe and surrendering to the very beautiful idea that there is a higher consciousness moving through you and will make the decision for you in the most perfect way at the most perfect time, can often relieve you of the kind of sweatiness that comes from the neurotic contemplation of some monumental decision you think you have to make. As the inevitable bumper sticker says, God is my co-pilot, may God your pilot and you be the co-pilot, why would you have God as your fucking co-pilot? Let the creator of the universe fly the plane, man, it'll work out way better. Thanks for the question. Thank you guys. Oh yeah. I like that. I like that a lot. Hey, I was camped out across the street from you guys at Burning Man and I was wondering, do you have any plans to go back? Which? Aubrey? What's up? You were camped out from the booties? What? Yeah, at Burning Man. Oh, you were camping across from Enchanted Booty for us? Across from where you guys were at Burning Man. I wanted to know if you have any plans to go back and if you do, would you put together your own camper and art project or anything like that? How many people here are going to the burn this year? Are? Yeah, are going. Who's going? One person. Yeah, you know, Aubrey's going. I'm going. Where are you camping? Yeah, where are you camping, Aubrey? The camp's called Playa Alchemist and I think we're right on that first row, what do they call that first row? What kind of camp is Aubrey? It's one of those fancy-ass camps. He's trying to convince me to go. Yeah, Duncan doesn't want to go because he feels like he needs to rough it and to really earn the experience. And I get that. I value that. But I think there's also a certain humility of realizing that we each have our own way to toil and this isn't, for me, a chance to prove how tough I am or prove how humble I am. This is a chance for me to have the most fucking fun possible and if people can't accept that then they're missing the whole fucking point of Burning Man anyways. So yeah, I'm flying the fuck in and I'm going to have a nice ass trailer and I'm going to have a shower and my shit and I'm going to have a fucking blast while I do it. Well, I'm part of a flogging camp and what we do, we wake up at four every morning and we whip ourselves with fucking like a thorn belt and we whip ourselves until we bleed and then we lay in the fucking alkaline sands just like let it burn our backs and then once we're like sufficiently in pain, we go by fucking Aubrey's camp and we throw our blood from our back onto his fucking RV and hiss it in so that's my, that's the camp I'm going to be at. No, I think I'm going to camp with Aubrey this year now. Thanks for the question. Are you going to be there? Yeah. Enchanted Booty Forest is where I usually camp so, but you'll probably find each other, man. I'm going to be spending a lot of time at the Ministry of Disinformation this year for sure. I love that camp. Anyway, no Burning Man talk. That's rude. After the show. See you later. Cool, man. See you, brother. Hey, what's up, Duncan? What's up? It's my first show. My name's Freddie. Thanks for coming, Freddie. Yeah, man. Anytime. My cousin actually brought me the People X. Oh, yeah, yeah. Bringing Freddie. Yeah. So my question is for a lot of people here, a lot of us here, we go ahead and we listen to you, whether we're driving to school or whatever it is that the, you know, whatever the fuck we're doing. So to an extent, you are our information. Now, I'm just curious, what is your information? Do you go like, are you listening to podcasts or music wise? What is it that you're listening to? This is for you and Aubrey. In the past three weeks, can you guys go ahead and like, just tell us, you know, very basic human level, like, what the fuck is it that you're bumping in your car, fucking full volume on your way here? You know what I'm saying? What do you listen to music wise or if you're not really a music person? What podcast or whatever, what is your information? What is it that inspires you? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, man. Well, I am a, so like, I hang out, like my teachers are these Ram Dass people, right? So I'm friends with this guy, Ragu Marcus, who loves the love, who runs the Love Server Number Foundation. This guy is like my teacher and he, so this is where a lot of, it's weird how it works, and I feel very lucky, but he, so what happened, the way it works for me is, I will get on the phone with him, he'll call me randomly, but it's always at the perfect time and we'll just start talking. And he'll be about some bullshit and then all of a sudden, he'll be like, he's really cool because he's like, what's going on and he really means like, what's going on, right? And then I'll tell him what I'm freaked out about, who I'm pissed off at, what I'm worried about, where I'm fucking at, I'll just be completely honest with him and then he'll, really comes out of it, man, and it's the most beautiful thing, and that is what I read to today came from him, that passage, you know? So that's where I get my information from, it's from that satsang and from Aubrey, what I consider to be my family, I've got friends like this and they give me lots of info and I'll read stuff, you know, I'm reading like, it doesn't have to be like lofty, I'm reading this thing called, right now, Rain World, you know, the sci-fi book, Rain World, ooh, it's good, man, it's so good, and like, I'll just get stoned and I'll read and I'll be like, what the fuck, this is incredible, man, and that'll make me so happy or like, I'll go out and look at my fucking, I don't want to sound like a complete hippie asshole, but I'll go out and look at my fucking tomato plant, man, I'll just stare at it. That shit is awesome, my father's a gardener and like, he has a garden literally like, from that wall to this wall, like, out to here and we're Dominican so they come from like, literally the motherland and he plants and shit and he puts so much time into that garden and it's like, he really just does it because he feeds a lot of people, like, we have a really big family so he, you know, he grows all this shit and man, and I learned a lot about plants through that so, I never really cared about plants or anything like that, but I definitely understand what you're saying about going outside and looking at the fucking tomatoes and being like, you know what I'm saying, there's a beauty, yeah, definitely, there's a beauty behind that shit. Dude, you know what I've started doing? Tell me. Playing my flute, I play the flute for the tomatoes, I go down and play the flute to them, and I swear. Wait, wait, wait, you play a flute to the tomatoes? Yes. And I think maybe that's why they're not growing tomatoes, just stop and we'll grow tomatoes so there's one tomato on there, but I swear, man, I know when I look at that thing and I love it and I say to it, I talk to it and I'll be like, I know you're not making tomatoes, I'm cool with that, like, I'm happy to hear this here and I feel like it feels it and they're like, I feel it, there's a rep, how do you say it, God damn it. Reciprocity. Fucking prosody, I'm not an idiot. But there's a reciprocity there and so yeah, man, but anyway, finally, not to like, I just start because I have this mug and I'm trying to learn how to play the pentatonic scale, like riffs on the pentatonic scale on the mug because I've been watching videos of people play the mug and like they're like, when it's really cool. So I've been trying to learn that so I've been listening to you in parliament because they're the masters of like funky riffs. Cool. That's it, there's the answer to your question. I'm sorry you asked it and I'm sorry for giving you guys an example. No, no, that's cool. How about you? Oh, by the way, I like your shoes, but I'm actually more interested in your socks. Yeah, my socks have roses on them. Oh, roses, all right, cool. Yeah, from stance. Yeah, like Duncan said, I got a lot of people who I talked to who really transmit a lot of information. Obviously, Rogan's podcast, I don't listen to all of them, but whenever I see a guest that piques my interest, I'm usually rewarded with something pretty dope. So that'll sometimes lead me to books, like I listened to him interview Sebastian Junger and then started his book tribe and so I'll kind of find things that way. And then actually my podcast is a great way for me to connect with people because I'll do the research on them. Like I was going to have a conversation with Jamie Will who was part of the authors wrote that book, Stealing Fire, incredible book. So then I'll read the book before I meet him and then we'll have a conversation and that will like illuminate a whole piece of the world for me that I'll be able to draw references to. And so that's a dope process, but you know, it's sometimes I like to turn my brain off and for me, that's hip hop. Like when people are rapping about deadly combinations of drugs, like Molly Percocet. Molly Percocet. And I'm like, yes, there's nothing more unconscious than that because that is a deadly combination. Thank you. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. For sure. That's the question. Guys, it's 1017 right now, which means that they're going to want us to, I don't know how much time, how much time do we have? 10 minutes. Okay. So we got 10 minutes. So we'll try to, I think we have enough time for everybody just know we can do 10 more minutes. So go ahead, please. All right. Well, thank you quickly. And I've never done ayahuasca, but I've had two psychotic experiences. And Joseph Campbell says that the psychotic drowns in the same waters that the mystic swims with delight. So my question is, what do you think are the differences between the psychotic experience and the mystic experience that allows the mystic to swim and the psychotic to drown? Great question. All right. Cool question. I mean, with the time limit and everything, this is, I didn't plan it. So I'll take a stab at it. I think, because I've been in a psychedelic experience that felt psychotic. And I saw in that experience that there was two paths. There was the fear path, which I genuinely to this day believe would have driven me into psychosis. The most intense experience I've had. And it was not like the toad thing, which was beyond polarity, and this was like smack and polarity. It felt like all of the good and evil of the universe was trying to find its way into my body. And it was completely overwhelming and terrifying. And especially the dark side of it, realizing that I was also made up of the dark stuff as well as the light, and we're all these beings. I really truly felt that if I would indulge that fear and started questioning if I was ever going to make it out and went with what was happening, I may still be hiding under a table somewhere. The stakes felt that high. And for me, the choice I made was, all right, that's the fear path. What's the love path? What's the faith path? What's that thing that is the other way? And that's the faith that I was going to make it out all right. The faith that no matter what was flashing through my mind, I would be okay. I held that steady thought in my mind, and then I followed love. And it was any type of pedestrian type of love, like poodle sniffing, certainly counts. Like anything that brought love and anything that brought a positive feeling, I just used those like lily pads to find my way out of that experience. And it was a harrowing experience. I actually had to sleep on the floor because I needed to feel grounded for like four days after. It was really, really gnarly, but ultimately a very valuable experience. So for me, I think that the difference is, is one is in some way indulging the fear path and in another way just choosing the love and faith path. But I got to recognize that in certain states, that choice may not be available. So be kind and sensitive and gentle and don't trust that this thing is real, and it has real limitations and real, real issues. But for anybody who finds themselves in that dark place, just love will lead you out. It sounds corny as shit, but it's the truth. It's the thing that felt real. It was the only thing that felt stable enough to guide me out of this fucking mental chaos. That's nice. There's something Saraswati, I always think about, which is the bridge between suffering and grace is surrender. And how often, I mean, when we think about that beautiful idea, the mystic, like swimming or surfing, I like to think surfing. You ever watch people surf? It's nuts. And when you think about what they're doing, it's crazy, they're riding energetic waves that are rolling through time and these things are so big and they can rip you to shreds. If you didn't know what you were doing in there, surely when they're on a wave, if there's even a moment's thought that isn't based on connecting with that massive energy, then they can really fuck themselves up, I'm sure. But they love it. Just like what you're saying, when you talk to surfers, they will just, they love it. They are in love with it. They can't get it out of their minds. This is their in love with this energetic field. So that must be it, right? It's this sense of like, oh, great thing that could destroy me. I love you. Oh, you're destroying me? Oh, I love the way you're destroying me. I think it's like, I love it. And then I think, because if you look at it from that perception of like, oh, I'm going to be here forever, are you going to reconfigure me? Oh, you're reconfiguring me? Okay, reconfigure me. Let me be reconfigured and you let go. Then in there, it goes from being this resistance thing that you're so good at talking about and not doing to being a form of surfing, being part of the energy, experiencing the energy and loving it. Maybe that's what he meant. Yeah, kind of like the hand in the stream that either gets like brushes gently or gets ripped off. Yeah. Surrender is such a key tool. It's a prerequisite for faith, too, because it's just understanding that, you know, allowing what's happening and having faith that you'll come out the other side. Yeah, beautifully said, Duncan, for sure. That's lovely. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi. Hi. I have a real life practical argument against Flat Earth because my brother is a Flat Earther and I thought maybe you share it with me. Who was? My little brother. Okay. How old is he? 23. Okay. I know. That's not a question. But if you fly to Asia or Europe or anywhere lateral from New York, you go up towards the North Pole and not straight across around or anywhere near the equator because it's less mileage, therefore less gas, therefore less money. So it relates back to corporate money and not cosmology. Someone works for NASA. My grandfather actually worked for NASA. Thank you. Thank you. Wait, what? Yeah. Which is super exciting. Here we go, folks. Hey, thanks a lot. I remember that. Thank you. Cool. Hi. Thanks for the good talk. I had a question about feeling, do you still take any drugs just for fun? Because maybe because I'm older now and I've been taking drugs for so long. Can you move closer to the mic? Oh. Because I've been taking drugs for so long and everything and it's, I don't mind smoking weed and watching a sausage party but I'm on MDMA or acid or something and I start feeling kind of guilty that I'm high but I want to just dance and have fun but at the other level I have this consciousness. It's like, oh yeah, well you should just maybe just take a slow meditate, work on yourself and that's what this experience should be and not dancing around and being out of rave. You know, honestly the best handling of that topic and I don't even want to touch it because I want to let you know about it is from that book, Stealing Fire, at the end they call it hedonic calendaring. So it's basically identifying these ecstatic states that you're going to reach and just schedule them out and make sure that they're not deleterious to your life and plan different ways that you want to do that and actually put some forethought into it. So it's not like, yeah, what is that? It's a double stack press of what? Sure. You know, like that's not the best way to do it, rolling the dice but like plan it out, know what you're doing, stack the modalities that make sense and like take ownership of it rather than it being like, oh yeah, fuck it. You know, you can have a little bit of that, a little bit of lax but like, you know, come with a strategy like you would with the serious parts of your life, like take fun that seriously in a way, like plan time for it and schedule it out and make sure that it's going to support your life, not tear it down. Yeah, let me give the other answer. All right, thanks. You know, wait, the thing that comes into your mind, right, when you're in the midst of a wonderful psychedelic experience, the kind of friend, not me, who took some mushrooms for no reason and just got on his bike and he was peddling through Brooklyn and he was having the best day of his life all of a sudden. He told me, he realized, my God, I cannot believe how incredible life is, I'm just out here on my bike and this is the most beautiful thing ever and then a feeling of guilt went into him because he started thinking like, I shouldn't be doing this, what am I doing? You can't just be on your bike on mushrooms, just riding around, you can't do that, there's got to be a reason, there's got to be a purpose. I'm like, I'm Asian, I'm like, I should study, you know, I should study as an Asian. Yes, man! Yes! And I'll tell you, I think that voice that pops into your head, if there's ever proof that there is a satanic force on earth, it's the voice that would come into your head when you're dancing and say to you, you shouldn't be dancing. Totally. The earth is flat. Yeah, thanks for the question. Thank you so much. Cheers. Thank you. First off, I just want to thank both you guys and Joe Rogan for bringing so many people into the float world. I'll be happy for the local float community, the local Brooklyn float centers here, they brought me out. Wait, who did? Your Lyft floats, your local center? Yeah, so anyone here go to Lyft floats if you want to see them. I didn't even know there was a float center in Brooklyn, I was wondering about that. Are you fucking kidding me? What's it called? I'm not kidding you, man! I mean, that's how absolutely lazy I am, because I'm just like, ah, I was probably not one. I never heard of Google, I'm not going to look it up, like I could just look it up, but... It's all lies. Yeah, it's called Lyft. What's it called? Lyft. Oh, cool. Look it up. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Okay, beautiful. Yeah, so, just anyway, thanks for bringing people into the world, you know, it's part of our mission. But I got one quick question and one longer question. One is have either of you guys tried or have the desire to try IvaGain? No. Three times. Three times, okay. And it's gnarly, and I've not met anybody but me that's had a positive experience with it. I watched someone detox from heroin on it, which seemed very effective, but a lot of times people just white out and it's just hellish. There is like a certain reset that happens from the nervous system. I liken it to being like an ant on a tuning fork, but fuck, that's a hard medicine. You know, it's like 24, 36 hours awake, it's physically hellish, like it's super gnarly. And I would, I don't recommend that medicine to people unless they really got some serious shit and they need a serious like hard reboot reset. And I think that's where that, where that medicine's purpose is just because for whatever reason the other people who've, I had a really beautiful spiritual experience, but a lot of people just white out and it's just hell, you know, so it's a tough one. And then my other question was since you guys have all this experience with altered states and you sort of blasting past reality more or less, how, or, or do you ever struggle with the surreal nature of reality in your everyday life? And then how do you push past that if it happens at all? Because for me, I walk around, especially in a city like New York, I'm from California and especially in a city like New York, I just think about, I get overwhelmed. So I'm sometimes about the infinite complexity, essentially. And when you talk about all the other heaping bullshit we throw on top of the world to play the game and even you guys listening to you guys tonight describe it as a game or, or multiple passes through a river and it just seems surreal, you know. And so does that ever hit you in life and then how do you push past that? Wow. Yeah. I, you know, I have this picture of, I, I, I, I always have the hard to say of my guru named Crowley Baba and I will sit there and burn some incense and look at him and he's got this like incredible smile on his face. This is the most incredible smile he has and I'll look at that and I have this picture of Ram Dass. It's a puja table. We call it a puja table. You know what that is? So you get a table and you put on it pictures, right? And it can be whatever you love, doesn't have to be some saint or anything like that. It could be just things you love, teachers you've had, people who've moved you, family members that you love, whatever, you sit there. Man, I'm in, I'm always in a dumb hurry, an idiot's hurry, you know. So like I'm like rushing from one thing to the next for really no reason at all. But what I'll do is I'll go to that puja table even for a second and I'll look at that picture of Neem Crowley Baba and Ram Dass. They're always smiling and I'll remember my contact with them and I'll feel this thing. Well, it's love. And it's a thing that, yeah, no shit man. This is a wild ride. We're on friend. This is a wild ride. When I'm walking down the street and I look around, I'll just think, yeah, I am in a bardo. I have died. This is the end. I'm in some kind of spirit realm. New York's a spirit realm. This could be the realm of hungry ghosts. I really mean that. We might be in a post-death experience, right? It could be. I don't know. There's infinite possibilities. Yeah. So, but in the midst of that, I'll anchor into love and I have a tool that I use which is a symbol of that thing for me at this point in time. It could change. And that's what I have. Just a little thing like that. Just a little window you can peer through is the maelstrom rages behind you with all the terror of the world. Just a little eye hole, a key hole you can look through and there it is. That's what I do. And you just need one anchor? What's that? You just use one anchor and need one anchor point at a time? I play Hearthstone. I'll sit and play Hearthstone to avoid and numb down, but like the, to have some kind of path, whatever it is, to find the path, find your path, figure it out. You can, you know, you probably know what it is. And then just start playing around with it, little bits, little bits, little bits. And then, you know, it's just like they say, it's like when you plan a scene, little creeper tendrils start growing out of it. And it'll grow into something strong and you'll always have that thing to go back to. A reminder. And I'm sorry. I know I said we had a limited amount of time, but your question is so important and there's a, you can look it up. It was on Reddit. Dude got hit in the head. And his friends had assembled like this whiteboard because he lost his short-term memory and he, and he kept asking the same question over and over again, which is, where am I? Oh, I wrecked my bike? Oh, where did it happen? You just kept asking the same question over and over so his friends had answered all the questions he asked on a board and they put it in front of him so that when they weren't there, when they went to use the bathroom or whatever, and he freaked out, he could look at that whiteboard and they're like, here are all the answers to the questions you keep asking us. And he could, and he could like see, this is what Neem Koli Baba is to me. This is what Ramdas says to me. This is what these teachings are to me. They're the writings on the whiteboard that when I enter into an amnesiac state and get coiled up into my ego, I go back and I'm reminded of what everything probably really is, which is love. And you can find something like that and for everyone, it's probably different. And that's one of the tools that I've been taught to use and your community is that too. Yeah. Thank you. And I guess for me, you know, one time I never asked that question is when I'm having sex. Like you never asked that, but sex doesn't have to be with just a lover. You know, you can have sex with your cheeseburger. You can have sex with that cup of tea, with that drink of coffee, with that every single activity you do and like be fully engaged in intercourse with that thing. And whenever you find that thing, whatever it is, like like really being presents, the essence of Zen, right? It's like fully engaging yourself in whatever it is, then that question disappears and you no longer worried about that because you're engaged so intensely with that thing. So whatever it is, go for it. Have sex. Yeah. Fuck you. Thank you. Great question. See you at the Float Conference. What's that? I'll see you at the Float Conference. Oh, cool. Yeah. See you there. Coming right up. Quick question. Appreciate you guys really much. Aubrey, you touched on it before a little bit, but I also run a wellness company coincidentally. I'm wondering like, you know, day-to-day business, you know, dealing with the outside forces, internal forces that may be trying to thwart you, you know, lawyers, problems, whatever it is, employees, like what keeps you personally motivated or inspired to come and be 110% be a leader for your people? You fucking guys, of course, like what else? What else would it be than other people who have, you know, experienced this? When I start focusing on myself, it gets exhausting and I lose all motivation, you know, but when I realized like, oh, there's some people who are fucking digging this and it's making a difference. You know, I love people. So that's what makes it easy. Like, just take all of that thought off of yourself because that's a spiral of exhaustion and just focus it on who you're impacting. And you do that and you'll have, you know, seemingly inexhaustible energy. That's a great answer. Thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Thank you. Aubrey Marcus, everybody. Let me hear it. Aubrey Marcus. Thank you all. Thank you so much. Thank you. You guys, thank you so much. Thank you. You guys, thank you so much for coming to this. It was so wonderful hanging out with you tonight.

William, welcome to the DTFH. It's good to see you, man. Yeah, very nice to see you too. Dude, you look great, man. I gotta tell you. Last time I saw you, you know, I was going kind of bald. Yeah, yeah. And now you have this full edit. I'm a full head of hair now. Yeah, I got accepted into the ambassadorship and program for Bosley Hair Club, so I am a new spokesperson, new ambassador. I know, I'm excited. Now, can you tell me how that, how does that happen? Like, how did, were they at one of your shows or? Yeah, they saw me. They came up to me. They said, you seem like a very good candidate for our hair club. And at first, quite frankly, I was offended. I was thinking, what do you mean? What do you, I'm not really going bald. What are you even talking about? Right, you're still in kind of the, you're still in the phase of like, it's probably going to grow back or like. Yeah, it might grow back. I mean, I've been using it. I know I was using a white rain shampoo. White rain? Do you remember white rain? No, I've never heard of it. That was a kind of shampoo at one point. But yeah, they came up to me. They asked if I wanted to be an ambassador. I said, what is that entail? They said, it's basically like a two year. Two years. Two years, 700,000. Two years? Two years, $700,000. One second. So wait, um, sorry about that. There's fucking rats in here. The, um, Is that what it is? Oh yeah, man. No, yeah, it's like they get into my wires. Okay, so right now, I am using this like special tincture that a midwife has made for me that I'm rubbing into my hair to grow it back. Is it working? No, it hasn't worked yet. And it's very expensive. But she like assures me that like, I guess the problem is like you have, they give you the jar and then you have to, um, bury it. Uh, they make you bury the jar. Well, if you don't bury it, apparently it's not that it doesn't work. Like if they bury it, it would, it would work on their hair. So when you, yeah, it connects to your hair. This is like, you know, a lot of people look down their nose at, uh, alternative medicine for sure. And I, you know, I think, Oh, okay, great. Well, you go and do your pharmacological bullshit. Yeah. Or whatever. I'm going to use an ancient remedy for hair loss, which according to the midwife is actually a sign of spiritual wisdom. Is she sweet? Is she a nice midwife? No. Oh, serious? Very stern, like a classic midwife. They're very stern, very like intense with me and my wife. She, um, uh, you know, that whole spanking thing where they spank you and your wife and stuff. Oh, they spank you and your wife. Well, her husband's, her husband spanks my wife. I saw her in there. Yeah. I think I met her. She seems sweet. She must have a dark side. No. Yeah. She acted. She's act with, when guys come over, but when she's with us, cause we want to have another baby, then her husband comes over and then like they think he does the pretreatments on my wife or whatever that is, which is some midwife pretreatment and you don't know what that is. It's some secret regardless. Yes. I am excited because I'm like, I know that we'll come back with, you know, that being said, white rain. Yeah. White rain. It's a hell of a shampoo. It's, uh, something I used to use. But yeah, Bosley Hair Club, I highly recommend it. It also, it's similar to like a midwife type thing. It's not big pharma at all. How do they do it? Oh man. They, uh, are you familiar with grass seeds? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. They put stuff that is like little grass seeds in your hair. The whole process is two days. It was a long time. You have to stay at the hospital. You're at the hospital for two days? Two days. I was under the knife as they say for one day. One day under the knife. 24 hours. 24 hours under anesthesia. 24 hours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was awful. I woke up at one point and I couldn't move or anything and I could barely move my eye a little bit and then they saw me moving my eye a little bit. So they gassed me again. It was horrible. Was it painful? It was horrible. What are they? It was indescribable. They were working on my chest at that point in time. Your chest? Yeah. You're growing hair on your chest? No. It was like an open heart surgery. They messed up. It turned into like this open. They did some of my hair and then it turned into this open heart surgery thing and then I'm literally, I'm awake, but I can't move. How does this happen at a hair clinic that they're working on your heart? Yeah. I don't know. It's weird. Some doctors were in town for I think Pittsburgh or something. Oh, fuck. Yeah. It's bullshit. Dude. It's like one of the leading causes of death in the United States is medical malpractice. I'm so glad you made it through. Thank you so much. Now I have this horrible scar on my chest and... But you know what? You wear shirts. I know. So people don't really have to see you. But they see it when you're balding and now you've got this like insane, like it's... I know. I know. When you walked in, I was like, what the... Did you even recognize me? I barely recognize you. See? That's how good it is. And I questioned my own like perception because I'm like... Really? Yeah. Well, you know, because I'm positive the last time I saw you, this was not the hair situation. I didn't have the full head of hair. I know. It's all thanks to Bosley. I mean, this is a glowing recommendation. It sounds like from you, Duncan, just what you were describing about how you didn't recognize me at first. I mean, yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. I mean, I gotta say, the folks over at Bosley, they're super professional. They're really wonderful. Super sweet. Super sweet. They understand male pattern baldness and though, yeah, right now I am using a traditional treatment. Are you sure that that's a safe way to do it? I mean, how deep was the hole where you buried the stuff? So you put it right above the coffin. Like you have to get it right above the coffin at a cemetery. So it's like, you know, and when they told me that it was like, I was thinking, fuck, I'm gonna, I don't even want digging. Yeah. I don't know the last time you dug like in five feet down. No, it's been a long time. It is. It's a crazy workout. Then you're in a cemetery and like you're worried someone's gonna show up for sure, you know, all that stuff. But yeah, actually, they don't really hold six feet under bullshit. It's not really like that anymore. How deep do they bury people? Like three, four feet. Really? Just depends on how much you pay. Damn. So the more you pay, the deeper you go. Yeah, the more you pay, the deeper you go. But it makes sense because it's more work before you pay the deeper. Hey, let's cut to a commercial real quick. I knew deep down in my soul, I needed a fucking hair transplant. So I went to Bosley Hair Services and told them I needed hair put in my head immediately. They put a bunch of seeds in my head and I grew hair very easily afterwards. I love Bosley Hair Club. Thank you, Bosley Hair Club. Mr. Bosley, where did you go to? All right, so please go to bosley.com, backslash, William Montgomery. For 30% off your first procedure, there's many procedures you have to go through. I'm going to have to do, I think, nine or 10 more. But yeah, use the code William Montgomery for 30% off your first procedure. Thank you, Athletic Greens, for supporting this episode of the DTFH. I don't know about you, but there's something weird to me about people who carry around big ziplock bags full of vitamins. I don't know if you've ever seen this. I don't know if you've ever smelled fresh vitamin puke when one of your friends erupts with their undigested vitamins because they didn't eat when they took their vitamins. It's not a great smell. It's a bad, bad smell. Also, who has time to organize vitamins? I don't want to organize vitamins like I'm in the last few months of my life trying to keep up with all my medications. I need something simple and that is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, with one delicious scoop of Athletic Greens, you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole foods, sourced superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right. Now listen, what's an adaptogen? I don't really know, but what I do know is that when I drink my Athletic Greens, I feel great right away. Why? It's probably because of the adaptogens, probably because of the whole food, sourced superfoods. I don't know. Again, I just want to feel better. I've got this aging body and I need something simple that I could just throw down the old mouth tube and hopefully not wither because I have some kind of vitamin deficiency. That's Athletic Greens.

I'm sitting here in the brand new DTFH studio with a new and dear friend of mine, William Montgomery. And I got to tell you the inspiration that I am getting from being around somebody who has conquered their male pattern baldness using Bosley is really making me rethink my take on alternative medicine. I'm starting to wonder, did I make a mistake breaking into that cemetery and burying that jar on top of that coffin? And you got me thinking about Bosley. Let's talk more about Bosley. Yeah. I mean, Bosley has been just a big part of my life for the past two weeks since I got the procedure. I do have to give a couple of warnings for it, though. Okay. Don't take it if you're pregnant. Obviously, a lot more women get it that you may think. Yeah, I've heard. There's a lot of female pattern baldness that goes around. Yep, cranberry syndrome. Cranberry syndrome. A lot of people don't devil's plight cranberry syndrome, but that those things make ladies lose their hair. They're actually a big part of what makes Bosley continue to grow is, yeah, people with cranberry syndrome. I mean, that's just a... It's a terrible thing. And it's like I'm so sick of people associating that with a vaccine. It appears that a lot of ladies these days are shaving their pubes. Yep. And so what I've read is that when... Folks don't know, there's neurons in your vagina, the same neurons that are in your brain, the same neurons in your heart, which is making me think. Really? Maybe that's why they went in your heart. But it could have been. There's neurons in your heart and your vagina. And apparently, when you start shaving your vagina, it sends a signal through your whole body. God. And then your head is like, it's the phone call from your vagina that's like, hey, we don't want hair now. And so... Yeah, your hair is going to start falling out. Yeah, cranberry syndrome. Yeah. And you're going to start listening to the cranberries. Exactly. I mean, a lot of these women start listening to the cranberries. It's so weird. For a symptom, like if you've started listening to... If you've randomly... Okay, if you put these two things together. Ladies, if you recently shaved your vagina and you suddenly had this desire to listen to the cranberries. You probably have cranberry syndrome. Yeah. And you could call Bosley. They actually have a hotline to where they'll ask you a lot of questions and then they can identify whether or not you have cranberries. Yeah, call 1-800-GIT-HARE. That's the main hotline. But yeah, we're more than happy to help these ladies with cranberry syndrome. I mean, a lot of times it'll happen early, mid-20s. Yep. Girls will start getting cranberry syndrome. And I don't know if you've ever been around somebody with cranberry syndrome, but my girlfriend got it. No. And quite frankly, the cranberries, listening to them too much, it gets me sad. No, I know. That's the thing. You got like maybe one of the best bands of all time. I know they're pretty. Do you like the cranberries? Love them. One of the best bands all time. And it's so sad because now people are afraid to listen to them. The listenership is dropping. For sure. It's very sad. But the thing is this, you stop listening to the cranberries. It's not going to, your hair is not going to suddenly. Yeah, it's going to keep falling out. No matter what. It keeps falling out. I don't want to dwell on these brand new plagues that are appearing on the earth. It's weird. Let's talk about Devil's Blight. Man, that's actually how the lead singer of the cranberries died, Devil's Blight. Yeah. I actually read the piece he wrote for the New Yorker on Devil's Blight. You read that? Fuck yeah. Seriously? You were such a good writer. I was so excited. It was my first article. Yeah, published in the New Yorker. So you wrote about the experience of being a non-gynecologist, having to work with women's vaginas. Yeah. I guess you had to study a lot of... I had to study a lot of women's vaginas while I had Devil's Blight. It was horrible. How is the connection there? Man, I don't know. I mean, your ears start ringing at the very beginning. Your ears start ringing. Yeah. And when that happened with me, I was like, like, did I really just get Devil's Blight? Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, my ears started ringing. I started coughing a bunch. That's another thing. You just can't stop coughing. Yeah. And yeah, I mean, I'm going through this gynecological training and I'm trying to do that. I'm coughing all the time and my ears are ringing and I had to start wearing these Speedo goggles. It was so weird and they'd fog up and I have to constantly use my pointer fingers to get the fog off of the lenses of the goggles and I'm trying to look at these ladies' parts down there and I don't really know what's going on. It was a nightmare. I mean, Devil's Blight has been hitting hospitals hard recently. Can I read a little passage from your... Please. It was a typical New York fall morning. I was walking my dog Charlie to get an espresso when I felt as though I were standing in front of a powerful speaker at an incredible rave and yet there were no speakers around. I'd been reading about Devil's Blight, but I never thought it could happen to me. And yet, being cautious, I went to the doctor and was immediately diagnosed with the Blight. I left in a haze. I didn't want to believe it. I had been training gynecologically for the last couple of weeks, went to one of my tents where I was to stare at a woman's vagina for 20 minutes, which is a standard part of gynecological training. At that moment, I realized that her formerly bare vagina was covered with little bits of red hair, my hair falling out like the Devil's rain. She looked down in horror and looked at me and said, I think you have the Blight. Wow. Yeah. Powerful writing. That must have been... Thank you. Yeah. I mean, it was terrifying. I mean, I'm down. I have multiple tents in Central Park set up for the ladies to come in. I think that day I had three or four and yeah, I mean, I was walking my dog and I go to one of the tents and yeah, that lady says something about my hair and I look down and sure enough, there's little red hairs all over her vagina and I'm horrified. I mean... Yeah, it's embarrassing. It's super embarrassing. I don't want the Blight. I don't need it. Yeah. I'm a busy guy. Yeah. But the Blight doesn't care. I mean, the Blight strikes anybody down. It really does. I learned that the hard way. I mean, oh my God. So let's talk about what happens when you go into a Bosley clinic with the Devil's Blight because a lot of these places, you get rejected immediately. You can't come in. What I've read is you get treated like a subhuman. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually the great thing about Bosley. They don't care if you have Devil's Blight. They don't care if you have cranberry syndrome. They're going to take you. I mean, it's really the sweetest people who work at Bosley Hair Club. I mean, a lot of people, you're very right. You can't go in McDonald's. You can't go in a Target if you have Devil's Blight. You can't go all these places. Right. But you can go to Bosley Hair Club. Wow. And that's what we're here for. That is so great, man. I mean, I just think these days, we live in this polarized time where it's just like everybody's scared. Everybody's freaking out. It's getting hotter outside. It's getting hotter outside. You know, it's like and I like, I keep thinking like they've got to come up with a fucking name for this because it's like every year, it seems like it is like right around June, late May, this shit's heating up and it lasts until like, you know, sometimes it goes all the way to September. And it's like, sometimes it does. What the fuck is this? Like, why is this happening? People need to look into this. Like, what is happening during these months that's heating the fucking earth up? I get that everyone's freaked out. And yeah, why does that happen? Especially those months? I mean, is anybody really looking into this? I mean, seriously, why is it always those months that it's getting hotter? Right? I don't get that. You know what? This is like while the Kardashians are tooting around and they're fucking private jet, you know, shoot them out of the sky. Yeah, shoot them out of the sky. Shoot them out of the fucking sky because it's just what are you what what is what is happening? Do you really want four or five months out of the year to like heat up? Yeah, nobody wants that. No, nobody needs that. And by the way, they don't use Bosley. They use a competitor. What? Yep. Yep. Not a lot of people know that. But yeah, they fly around in those jets, which I can't say and then they don't use Bosley. Can you so the Kardashians, they're not using Bosley at the moment. But they have a hair. They have hair. They have hair issues. Yeah, they're mainly bald. They wear wigs all the time. Are you seriously? Oh, well, there you go. So I guess the competitor isn't that good. Yeah, literally a wig store is the competitor. Wigs stores all across America. That's the competitor. Wow. That's what we're up against. Holy shit. That sucks, man. I mean, because, you know, honestly, the last thing that I want to be wearing during these mystery months of heat, I think we should come up with like mystery heat, mystery heat, the months of mystery heat. Someone should just come up with a name for this period in time. We'll call it the months of mystery heat. I don't want to be wearing a fucking sweaty ass. Oh my gosh. No, right. That's another thing about that. Right. You get so hot in a wig. I don't know the last time you wore a wig, but it's incredibly hot, especially during the mystery months. I mean, it's it gets hard. It's you're sweating. You can't stop. Yeah. Yeah. I one of my friends podcast recently wore a wig, get home, pull that wig off. And like I've got all around the my bald spot and stuff are just like pustules. Really? Yeah, it gets hot in there there. Really hot under. Yeah. Yeah. No, I heard it that what is the the guy in Bangladesh or whatever, like apparently it heated up so much under his wig that the wax melted into his flesh. Right. You don't need that. You don't need that guy. That guy's still at the hospital. Still at the hospital. He didn't he gets home. When you get home, if you've been wearing a wig, folks out there wear wigs. Yeah, I would think there would have to be some people wearing wigs out there. I would think there has to be. Yeah, you you want to yank that thing off because it's hot as fuck. And then I guess this guy pulled it off and it like ripped the top of his scalp right off. Just bone under there. Tony Chin. Yep. That was the guy's name. God. And still in the hospital. Yep. I know it's like he got scalped by like a Native American. Yeah, you can go to his go fund me. Just look up Tony Chin. It's like he's he's almost raised I think close to a million dollars. It's close to a million. Yes, Tony Chin and then in parentheses scalped because I think there's other Tony Chin's out there right now go fund me. But he's the one. Yeah, that essentially got scalped. People are going to be wondering if like we're saying that because Bosley wants us to like scare people. No, and there's no way. I mean, that naturally just came out. We weren't even thinking about saying that. But that's I mean one of the horror stories that happens with wigs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is a I just think like it's someone again to reiterate who's going through male pattern baldness. Yeah, you know, even just talking to you right now, I'm like, because I did fantasy, like I, you know, I was yeah, when are you going to get the proceeds? Are you going to do it? Do you think you know what? I'm like, I was I was on the fence when you came over. But now I'm thinking I'm going to I'm going to do it, man. I'm going to get those seeds. I'm going to get those seeds. I got you know, I got kids. Yeah. And like they when they see my bald spot, you don't want that. You don't want your kids seeing a bald spot. No way. Yeah. The thing that the older one is just like, what's wrong with daddy? And he started crying. He was like, that's what'll happen. I thought there's no sadder feeling than your kids tears when they start falling on your bald spot. Tell me about it, God. Also, the fucking Cavalier King Charles, my wife's dog, when I'm sitting on the couch watching TV, no joke will sit behind me and lick my bald spot. Ooh, does it feel good? It does it. No, it doesn't. Yeah, dogs have like sandpapery tongues, don't they? It feels terrible. It feels like it's mocking me. It doesn't feel it doesn't feel good at all. It just it just feels like it's humiliating. My wife laughs at me when it's happening. The kids will start laughing at me. It sucks, man. How long will it be going on? Well, it's it stopped because I just started rubbing vinegar into my bald spot. That's a good idea to stop it. Yeah, anybody listening, that's a good way to do it. If your dog is licking your your bald spot. Yes. You know how I thought of that? Huh? Bosley's website. Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

That, the other thing I love about Bosley is it's not high pressure. Not at all. They, you go to their website and it's like if you, if you don't want to get the seeds, there's an entire section like, you know, how to deal with like the issues with like male pattern baldness, you know, the dog thing. For sure. They have the dog thing. They have things for if you're wearing your Bosley hair transplant at the pool. You have to be careful. You have to wear a swim cap. Really? Yeah. People don't know that. If you go swimming, if you're an ocean dweller. Yeah. An aquatic. Yeah. If you're an aquatic type person, yeah, you want to wear a swim cap. Even when you get the seeds? Even when you get the seeds and you have to be really careful taking the swim cap off because that can actually rip out the seeds. The seeds are, they're implanted pretty good in there, but I mean a swim cap, you try to take a swim cap off. It's pulling out any hair. You have to be very careful. You have to put baby powder. What are the seeds? They look literally like little grass seeds. They're purple in color. Yeah. I don't, we'd have to talk to one of the Bosley scientists. All I know is they work. They literally make little holes in your head and put the seeds in there and hairs growing out pretty much immediately. Okay. So only because people listening are already thinking it. There was the Bosley controversy. Yes. So can we address it? Can you talk a little bit about the connection between Bosley and the Central Intelligence Agency? Because I know that Yeah. Yeah. So Mike Bosley, he was actually one of the early investors in Enron. Right. And then when Enron went down, Mike Bosley, I know, nobody knew, but his phone was in the messages everywhere. I mean, it was, he was busted. He spent a lot of time in jail. And when he was in jail, he did start talking to some CIA agents, all kinds of stuff, a lot of stuff about South America. Yeah. Well, you know, and again, you know, we live in different times. There was a time when the CIA apparently made some bad decisions. And I got to tell you, if like, people were raking me over the coals for bad decisions I made when I was younger, it would be a disaster. Yeah. So yeah, did the CIA maybe do some stuff? Yeah, maybe, who knows? I mean, prove it. It was the sixties. Yeah, it was the sixties. You know, and it's like, yeah, did, you know, MK Ultra and all that and were they like, you know, drugging people with psychedelics? Did they like put people into comas to see if they could erase their memories and replace their memories with other memories, they become whatever they call them like Lemurian candidate or Manchurian. I don't know what it's called, Manchurians, but like whatever the fuck it was, they don't do it anymore. Yeah. And, and, and what, where I am inspired by Bosley is while he's in prison and also where I'm inspired by the CIA, while he's in prison, the CIA's prison outreach program, you know, which is beautiful. Every prison needs an outreach program for sure. They're bringing in books. They're working with them. And like, I guess, apparently, during the MK Ultra experiments, when they were like working on people's brains, yeah, that's where they discovered this seeding method. It is. It's so weird. People don't really know that. Yeah. I mean, it came from a lot of the LSD experiments. They just started putting it on people's heads. He started putting it on people's heads. Yeah. And literally they said they were able to make this. Yeah, they were able to make the seeds out of acid crystals, dark acid crystals. What's dark acid? Yeah, a lot of people think it's clear. They made this really good form of acid that was dark in color and you would have the dark acid crystals and you would put it in your head. And that was the first time they realized you could seed people's heads with these dark acid crystals. So even to this day, it's still a very similar recipe. There's still a little bit of acid. Wow. I know, which people don't know about. Sometimes that's a selling point for people. Yeah. Because every now and again, it does. If you start sweating a lot or your hair is underneath that swim cap, there's a chance if you start sweating too much that it will leak out of the crystals and you can start hallucinating every now and again. It doesn't happen that often. Has it happened to you? It has happened to me a couple of times. No. And it was horrible both times. Really? Yeah, it was bad. So it's not a good trip. No, no. It was with my family. We had to put... Oh, man. It was not good. We had to drive to Florida. We had to get rid of everything and our grandparents' house. Something had happened. They were on a cruise ship accident. Oh, my God. I know. It was a horrible time. It was a hard time for everybody, but I was digging around trying to get the dust off of stuff and then some of the stuff drips into my eyes and I start having a full-blown hallucination 10 minutes afterwards and I'm in the grandparents' house. They just died on a cruise ship. Oh, my God. I mean, it was literally nightmarish. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry about your grandparents, man. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, not a lot of people know that. It's been a nightmare. So that's one of the things. I mean, you have to be... There's some warnings to it. That's one of the warnings. Don't sweat too much if you have bozzly hair transplants in your head. I can't imagine grieving. I'm growing my hair back. So that's like if there's some solace in like having to go... Yeah, right, right. You're looking in the mirror. You're seeing like... For sure. You're seeing that hair grow in. You're seeing that hair grow. That's going to feel good. And probably if I was headed down to Florida to like clean out my grandparents' house after that kind of accident, I'd love to talk if you're comfortable talking about it. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's been a couple of weeks. I could... Yeah. It's just... And then all of a sudden, yeah, I don't know. You start tripping. Did you... I mean, I wouldn't have even thought that... I would have just thought I was going crazy or something. Yeah. At first I did, but I remembered reading on the website. There is a list of warnings they do have. Yeah. On the website, I had remembered reading something about that. And then I'm seeing all the bricks up by the fireplace just swirling around. I mean, it was... I got dizzy. It was horrible. My parents are there. They're not doing well. I'm hallucinating. I can't find either one of my brothers. Vance and Selden are both missing. I need them to try to help me. They're not around. Missing? They're missing. They were somewhere in the backyard, I think. Going over what they had in the backyard. And I couldn't find them. And I couldn't talk to my parents about it because they don't like it with... They don't like hallucinogens. It was just a whole big thing. We couldn't go to the beach the next day. They said I messed up dinner that night. They took us all to Chili's. Trying to have fun. I'm still tripping at Chili's. Then the next day, we can't go to the beach because of bad William. Fuck. Yeah, it was awful. Man, that sucks. That classic Chili's family dinner. Yeah, and everybody's mad. And I'm seeing two chips of queso when I'm trying to get it into my mouth. So I keep missing my mouth when I'm trying to eat stuff. Oh man, I fucking hate this. You probably had queso in your beard. It's everywhere. My dad's calling me retarded. It was horrible. He calls you that. He was calling me retarded that night. He calls it sometimes. Was it his parents or your mom's? It was his parents. So he's, you know, it's grief. I know. I know. It's grief. That's what I told myself. Okay, let's cut to a quick commercial. And then when we come back, let's talk about what happened to your grandparents on that shit. Yeah. I love my grandparents. They ended up on the bottom of the ocean. Carnival cruise line is about to get sued. Because my grandparents are at the bottom of the ocean. They were trying to have fun on their 70th wedding anniversary. On the carnival cruise line, princess number two. And then they sunk with the ship when it struck. And iceberg. No, I'm kidding. It just sunk. They're now at the bottom of the Pacific. And I miss them so much. Carnival cruise line. You're gonna get sued. I swear to God. I'm sick of all my letters coming back to me that I've sent to you. Friends, the temperatures are not the only thing that's rising this summer. That's right. This episode is sponsored by Blue Chew.

William, yeah, I think it's important to go into places maybe that are tough to go into sometimes. And I know right now a lot of people are experiencing losing families on cruise ships. It's the fourth leading cause of death right now in the United States. For sure. It's so weird once COVID hit. It's like these ships just started getting holes in their holes or something. I don't know. Yeah, they've been sinking. So were you close with your grandparents? Yeah, I'd see them maybe once a year. They would be down there and we would go down to Florida down to Gainesville. Yeah. So once a year and did you talk to them during the year or anything like that? Yeah, we would talk some. My grandfather was actually weirdly enough Japanese and he didn't speak English. So we were not able to always communicate. Yeah, we did it like a form of sign language when we would be at their house. You never, you never thought about trying to learn Japanese or he never, why did you? Never thought. Yeah, I don't know what happened. It was very sad because we always wanted to talk to grandpa, but nobody learned. Does your dad speak Japanese? He doesn't either. Wow. It's weird. Yeah, I think when he came over on the boat to America, he never learned and I don't think he's been able to talk to anybody in America. I don't think in Gainesville there was anybody that spoke Japanese. It was, yeah, it was kind of a solitary lifestyle. Your grandmother, does she speak Japanese? She didn't either. It was the weirdest thing. Nobody was ever really talking to him. So that's why it was so sad. It was like this very solemn, wise man, but nobody could ever talk to. That's what we always assumed. I mean, not to challenge you, but how do you know he's wise? I don't know. He looked wise. He would always have a kimono on in a headband thing. I mean, he looked like he knew what he was talking about, but nobody, maybe he didn't because nobody could ever talk to him. Are you sure it was, you're sure it was, he was speaking Japanese? Did you ever try to see? I have no idea. I always assumed it was Japanese. I don't know if it was, it could have been anything. It could have been any number. It could have been a Filipina. I don't know. Chinese. Chinese. So, okay. So you see, so they go out on, you know, they go on a cruise. Yep. Yeah. Honestly, up until the stuff, crazy stuff, this would be going on when your grandparents go on a cruise. You're not thinking like I might never see him again. Never. No, that was the last thing any of us were thinking about. That was the last thing. It was all over the news one day. Yeah, it was all over the internet, all over the news. I mean, how do you even, it seems like cruise ships are, they like knowing that people get hammered on there and like, they make it really hard to fall into the sea, don't they? I know, I know. And yeah, I said earlier that the ship sank. It actually didn't, they fell in. I think they were drinking. It was funny. Yeah, it was funny to say. Because I was thinking Titanic or whatever. I know, I know. But so yeah, they, they just were drinking and they fell over or something. Drinking and fell over. We don't know if my grandfather actually pushed my grandmother in and then jumped off because it seemed like they hadn't been doing well. So they're now about to open up this investigation. It's a whole thing. They think maybe he pushed her off. Oh, God. And then he jumped. Oh, God. I know. He was always the strangest man. We never knew what he was saying. He was always talking. But we never could, nobody could ever, he was always talking. He would never shut up. It was the weirdest thing. You could, did you ever think about getting a translator or someone to come over and like? Too expensive. My parents looked into it. It was going to be too expensive. They never got the translator. That's a luxury. That's for sure. Yeah, having to, yeah. With inflation right now and all that. Like a translator is really expensive. You can't even afford milk. What are you going to get a translator to come over? Get out. It's like the same thing as having a chef or something like that. For sure. Yeah. Wow. God. Yeah, no translator. So wow. You're, you are seriously going to sue Carnival Cruise Lines? Yeah, that's what it is looking like. They need to have bigger, in the state's rooms, they need to have a bigger thing on their balcony. They need to have a bigger fence around the thing. I mean, if my... I would block the view. Yeah, but that's just some people are going to have to deal with. They need wooden fences, I think, on the cruise ships, in the state rooms. But then why even go on a cruise ship if you're just looking at a fence? Well, you can look through the little holes. Didn't you ever used to look through the little slats in the thing, like at your neighbors? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah, you can look at the ocean through like little, the natural holes that form in the wood. Yeah, yeah, just a regular old. If anybody's wondering what it looks like, just a regular old wooden fence. Yeah. Like your backyard. You know what I got to say? Like if I have to choose between like losing my loved ones on a cruise ship or them not having a view of the ocean, obviously I'm going to pick not the... Totally, the ladder. I mean, you have to think about it. I mean, I'm looking at that wooden fence right now. I mean, think about it. You could totally see a nice sunset if your face is close enough to the wood. Yeah. You can get a pretty good view of what's on the other side of a fence if your face is close enough. Yeah. You know what? Now, when I heard Biden give that old press conference about how they're going to like regulate cruise ships now so the whole cruise ship is surrounded by fencing wooden fences, honestly, I just thought, give me a fucking break, man. Really, like, yeah, you're going to take away our ocean views on our cruises. For sure. But now that I'm hearing your story, I'm starting to get it. I know. I know. It's interesting. I mean, normally if my grandparents hadn't been thrown, my grandmother thrown off and my grandfather throwing himself off, if that hadn't happened, I would think when Biden made that announcement, but I think they're one of the main reasons he made that announcement. Did he really call you? Yeah, he called me. Yeah, no, I rose a stink. I called the White House. I was able to talk to him. Not then, but I was able to talk to an assistant. He called me. Yeah, we had like a three hour conversation. How long between when you called the White House was it when he called you back? Like 15 minutes. Wow. I know. It was really nice of him, but he knew I was raising a stink. I mean, my grandparents had literally just died. When you get a call from the president, what is that? Is it just him like, hey, what's up? I was so excited. I literally had to take my goggles off and use my pointer fingers to get the fog off of the lenses. But is he like, hi, this is President Biden. Yeah, he's like, hey, how's it going? This is Joe. How can I help you? And I was like, He didn't even say President Biden. No, he said Joe. He referred to himself as Joe. Wow. I know. It was really cool. He's actually really cool. I know because before that, I really didn't like him. He just seems like a real old guy. But yeah, he was actually really coherent. Hey, we had a really nice, it was three hours. We talked about all kinds of stuff. Yeah. What else did, what are you, what else? We didn't even get to talk about my grandparents. Are you kidding? Yeah, we didn't even, we were talking about six flags at the beginning, which is the best six flags. What's the best Disney World Park? Which is his favorite? The one in Japan. He likes the one in Japan a lot. Yeah. Wow. I bet you are. I want to go to that one. I haven't been to that one. I think my grandfather used to work at that one. Wow. Yep. So that's probably why he was saying that because he was trying to get that one. It could have been. I didn't even think about that. I wonder if he knew. Oh my gosh. They didn't even think about that. They know everything. That's weird. It's so weird he mentioned that. Whoa. Wow, man. Yes. Favorite is the one in Japan. He likes the Peter Pan right there, the best. Yeah. I've heard that's super. I know. I want to go on that one. I'm dying. God, I'd love to go on that one. Dude, I love collecting Peter Pan stuff. So just like to go there and get like Japanese Peter Pan. Could you imagine little plushies or whatever. Could you imagine? I couldn't even imagine. Look up there. You see that gap in between the Peter Pan that looks like Robin Williams and then the statue of Peter Pan? For sure. That gap. That's the plushie. I think my dream is that's where the plushie for them. That's where the Japanese one's going to go. That ride is nuts. I know. It goes, I guess it goes like 700 miles per hour. Yeah. It goes really fast. Yeah. Really quick drop right at the beginning. It's like crazy. Nuts. I'd almost be too scared to go on it, but I'd have to. Real alligators too. Yep. I know. I know. It's crazy. I think I'd be scared to go on it, but I think it'd be fun going on it. Well, I gotta tell you, man, I mean, again, it's like this. This is probably going to, I don't want to get in trouble, but you know, honestly, this fucking safety culture in the United States. Yeah. It's, it's, you know, and I, I'm going to make an exception for the fences around the cruise ship. Yeah. I know. I was just thinking, I mean, we really need those fences. Yeah. But the other shit, these like protections, I don't want, when I get out, I hate getting on a roller, I love roller coasters. I hate getting on a roller coaster and they force that fucking bar. Yeah. You got to get the bar on you. And it comes down. There's no choice. For sure. Sometimes it's hard to breathe. Sometimes, I mean, you can't move. It's too tight. You can't fucking move. You're restrained. And I have said, I have said on the, on the thing, I'm like, Hey, I do not consent to you pushing this thing on top of me. They probably still pushed it on top of you. Harder. Harder, this fucking little greasy, 20 year old ass. Greasy. Yeah. Just a shithead. He's like, sorry, and pushes it harder against seriously. Dude, it fucking, it's, it like screwed up. It's pushed my one of my moves down. Really? The worst ride, it was the worst fucking ride. Yeah. And then you can have fun on the roller coaster when you're, when your bosom is hanging down and getting crushed. Crushed. You're trying to have fun at six flags. You're not trying to get, I'm not trying to be like in a straight jacket. Yeah. I want to have a great time. I want to experience what it's like. And by the way, man, if you can't fucking hold on to a roller coaster. Don't get on the roller coaster. Don't get on the coaster. We are weakening our citizenry. For sure. It's like, you look around and you see people like, I was, I was, I was at the mall and I looked in a grown ass man. He's standing at the food court and he, he like, he goes, oh my legs. It just like fell down because he couldn't support himself with his own legs. I guess his legs. Really? What's he doing at the food court at the mall? Exactly. What's he doing there? Get on a fucking treadmill, dude. Yeah, do something else. Yeah, but this is happening everywhere. All these people are just like, oh my legs, they fall over. They're falling over. It's happening everywhere. Yeah. God. I know. I'm trying to have fun at the food court at the mall. I've been walking around the mall. I'm trying to have fun. I've been riding on the escalators. Dude, you can't remember in the 80s, the mall glory hole. It was just like everyone knew about it. You go to the glory hole, whatever you're into, you know, whether you're whatever you're into, whatever you want to give, you receive, whatever the thing is. Dude, it was normal. No one's watching you. No one's stopping you. No one, I got thrown out. Like, yeah, I watched this guy. His legs get fatigued. He falls down. And I'm like, you know, I'm not this isn't going to ruin my day. Yeah, going to the bathroom. There is a glory hole, right? I'm ready to go. I'm ready to receive. And then like, like, and right as I'm like, giving pleasure to someone whose face I will never see an active kindness these difficult times when everything is so hot right now. As I'm doing that, fucking security guard kicks the door open. Slaps, slaps this gentleman's member out of my mouth. I heard the gentleman go, he thought I did it. So he goes, what the fuck? Yeah. And I'm like, no, there's a security guard. Security guard grabs me, opens the door, grabs him, doesn't even let him get his fucking pants up, throws this out. That's insane. When did that happen? Yesterday. Yeah, yesterday. I mean, that's crazy. That's the kind of society we're in now. It's a nightmare. People try to have fun at the mall. People have fun at the mall. I guess you don't want paying customers. Yeah, what? That's what I, you know, that's what I said to him. I'm like, okay, I won't come here. Good for you. I won't fucking shop here again. Good for you. I'll use Amazon. Yeah. You know what? Fine. Have a fucking, have your mall collapse. Yeah. Maybe Urban Explorers will come in there one day. Yeah, they come dead malls for a reason. Yeah. They're everywhere now. Why the fuck do you think the malls are dying? You think they're dying because people don't like going into like a beautiful air conditioned simulation of like a city park and shopping? No, they're shutting down because the glory holes. Yeah, keep the glory holes going. They're not caring about a simulated park inside the thing. They're looking for a nice clean bathroom with air conditioning and a good sized glory hole, which by the way, in the parks of your, that was like when you would go to the city, like town square. Yeah. You know, they, they didn't even have glory holes. You would just like suck and fuck. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's what it used to be like. That's, that's what America used to be. Seriously. And now look at and now look, my grandfather is throwing my grandmother over the cruise ship. I mean, it's, you look, we got a little dark. I don't mean to get dark and I don't mean to get negative. It's just, you know, it's, I guess, you know, times are changing. And we just have to, you know, we have to adapt. We have to adapt, I guess. It's just frustrating. You know, it's just a front. It's sad. It's a frustrating time. I mean, people are getting cranberry disorder. Yeah. Well, let's shift it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shift it up a beat. Get back to Bosley. I gotta ask, it's rude as hell. No. How much are they paying you? It's a two year $70,000 contract. Wow. So pretty good. Yeah. I mean, it pretty much, yeah, two year, no, 35,000 a year. And that pretty much covers the operational cost on my head. So it's pretty much I'm getting a free Bosley, basically. Yeah. For being the spokesperson for two years. I have to travel around. It's taken up a bunch of time. But it's fun. Everybody's really nice. Mike Bosley is a hoot. I heard. Oh my gosh. Yeah, I heard. So when you're touring and stuff, do you get weirded out by the, like I saw videos on the Bosley website, do you get weirded out when they're petting your hair and stuff? For sure. I mean, it's almost like it's not worth it anymore. Because Mike, he's always carrying around a gun. He has this holster. It has these weird diamonds on. It's like this bedazzled holster he has. And he has this gun. And then he'll point the gun at me and say, you let them touch your hair. Sometimes I don't want to, but he literally will take that gun out sometimes. And he's kind of joking around, I think, but he's pointing a gun at me. Well, you know, that's old school. It is old school. I know it's fine. I think it's Mike Bosley. He's one of the early investors in Enron. People forget about that. Exactly. And you know, like my dad, he was an old school style businessman and like, you know, old school Texas businessman. And yeah, I remember like sometimes his boss would hold a gun on him and like. It used to happen. It was normal. Yeah. Just sit the fuck down. Yeah. It's funny. No one ever got shot. Yeah. Sit the fuck down. Sit the fuck down. Do your job. Yeah. No one got shot. No one did anything and like. Right. Right. You know, you would do your job. You would for sure do your job. I mean, you have to. You're going to do your job. Yeah. You do your fucking job, man. You're going to do that job. If somebody is fucking doing that job, you're going to do what they tell you to do when you're looking down the barrel of your boss. Yeah, you're going to do whatever. You're not going to be like, can I go to the bathroom? Yeah, can I go to the bathroom? No, no, no, no. You fucking work. Yeah, you're holding it. I'm not running a pee business. Yeah, right. You can hold your urine. You can hold your urine like a man. Yeah, you can. You can hold your pee up to what, 10 hours or something? A long time. Way longer than that. Yeah, probably longer than 10 hours. Yeah, way longer than that. Like, I'm totally into it. Like, I don't know if you have read Hold the Live. Yeah, about the holding in the pee. How it's good for you. Yeah. Samuel Brown. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, like he's like the, they call him like the Wim Hof of pee. Really? Oh, yeah. It's like, now the average American will urinate every six minutes. That's insane. Every six minutes. That's insane. That's an insane statistic. Think of that. When you're trying to run a factory, everyone's all down on Jeff Bezos. But you know what I mean? Oh, really? You're down on Jeff Bezos, but you're getting these packages brought to your doorstep. You're down on Jeff. Every day. Every day. Oh, he's so awful, whatever. Oh, he's not giving his employees, you know, pee breaks. But it's like every six minutes. An average, you know, piss takes, I don't know, how long does average piss take? A minute or two? Yeah. You know, depending on where you're at with your prostate or whatever. But, you know, minutes, some people a little bit longer, but add that up. So now you're, what is it? Three hours a day, you're paying your employees. Three hours a day, depending on how many employees. But yeah, probably around three hours a day. And you're, you know, you're paying your employees a minimum wage, which if you ask me, it's too high. It's a little too high these days. Yeah. So but still that adds up. So you're paying your employees like $5 an hour. Yeah. And then that adds up to $15 per employee per day. Per day. So that ends up where you are literally losing. I mean, it doesn't make sense. I bet Bezos loses $50 million a day. Probably a bunch just on people peeing in the factories. Exactly. And I want my packages. So it's like, I'm glad that he has that rule set up. I mean, I don't care. People can hold it. People can wear diapers. Yeah. Or maybe, you know, I'm 100% for that whole tubing system that they're putting in. I know. That only makes sense, the tubes. And then you don't, you can just be working there wherever you have to stand in the factory or whatever. You can just, yeah. Pee in the tube. Pee in the tube. It goes, it gets sucked out of the building. Yeah. Or man up, you know, take the courses, you know, like, and learn how to hold it. Like, you know, you know when I peed yesterday at 11 a.m. No. Yeah. You've really gone that. And now it's, I don't even have to. Seriously. So the courses work. Yeah. Cause what happens is your bladder pushes the urine back up into your body. Yeah. And you sweat it out. Oh, interesting. I wondered how that physically happened. Okay. So it's a sweat. Yeah. The bladder is like kind of a, it's like the appendix. You know what I mean? You don't really need it. We don't, like people, it's a relatively like new organ. It's like an evolution, a weird evolution thing. Mutation maybe. It's so weird. Yeah. Mutation or something. Like they just like, you know, people started growing these bladders about 300 years ago. Is that when it was? Yeah. And it was pretty, pretty recent. Yeah. 300 years from evolutionary time. Yeah. So people before that were just sweating. Sweating out. You would just sweat your water out. It's like nothing is even weird about it. For sure. Not at all. I mean, it makes sense. And now we, now we TT out of those things. You TT. Yeah. Yeah. That's not what it's for. Right. That's not what it's for. That's your, that's given to you by God to experience pleasure. Not to. That's a pleasure center. Yeah. Not a TT center. Not a TT factory. Thank you. God. Yeah. I don't want to say they're TT factories now. They're not. They're not. It's not a TT factory. Pleasure center. It's a pleasure center. And really it's like, it's kind of gross when you think about it. It's super gross. Do you really want to, to, to, to, to, to pleasure your lover with the tube? Yeah. Right. That you're, you know, spraying, like imagine this. Imagine if sweat came out of your penis. Yeah. If you spray just sweat out of your penis. And then, sorry, I'm getting choked up. I'm just, yeah. I mean, it's a bit, yeah. You spray sweat out your penis. Now imagine, now imagine right after that, your soulmate, maybe the mother of your children. Yeah. You want to satisfy her. And then she like, you know, catches that underarm waft coming from her. For sure. There's a tube. It's yeah. There's TT everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, I just think it's a, it's just, it's. Have you ever eaten asparagus and then TT? Yeah. Why does it smell like that? Dude, why is that? It's a warning. Do you think you think we're supposed to eat about eating asparagus? Does that look like something you should fucking eat? No, no. It looks like a, I don't know. It looks like something you find in a spaceship crash. For sure. You go to these fucking vegan restaurants and it's like, oh, eat this nasty shit. It looks like Medusa's hair. Yeah, right. And then you eat it. And within like, you know, six minutes, if you're an average American, you're blowing out the stinkiest. The stinkiest piss you've ever smelled. So gross. Hill seals. Also, White Castle does that to me too. Have you ever eaten White Castle burgers? Same thing. Well, it's like, yeah. Yeah, my pee smells like White Castle after that. Yeah, 30% asparagus and White Castle burgers. Yep. One of their people don't know that they use to cut the meat. Mm hmm. But yeah, delicious. I do like that. But yeah, asparagus, I get that out of my face. I don't care. Love. I love meat. I hate vegetables. And part of like, cutting down your urine habit is stop eating vegetables. Yeah, there's a lot of water in there. You Yeah, you don't need vegetables. Destroying the planet. Pretty much. Are you a fucking cow? Yeah, right. Why don't we eat vegetables? Yeah, why don't we fucking eat you if you're gonna go grazing and eating? Yeah, right. Green leafy shit. I want to eat you if you're fucking eating leafy greens. I want to try how you taste. Meanwhile, shit's heating the fuck up. You look out at the desert vacation of huge swaths of the planet, the Sahara desert. I was literally thinking this Sahara right there, for sure. Used to be an asparagus for us. Really? And now look at it. Now it's sand. Yeah, as far as I can see. They ate all that fucking asparagus. They just went through and ate it and ate and ate and ate and ate. And they were like, Oh, it'll grow back. Uh, nope. Sorry. Fast forward 2000 years. And fast, like re, okay, fast forward 2000 years. Let's rewind again back 2000 years. And do you know that in those days, people were going insane because the smell of asparagus piss was just everywhere, everywhere. They didn't have toilets. Animals. Animals were killing themselves. Like animals were running into fires, jumping into like all because of the asparagus, the stink. It like drives you mad. Like the smell of it. Yeah, something else nuts. The fumes of it are the exact same shit they use in the lethal injection chemical. Really? That's so interesting that connection. I'd always heard it had something. It was plant based somehow the chemicals for the lethal injection. I didn't realize it was asparagus. Yeah, man. That's how it is. Oh, yeah. That's what that's the because I always heard plant based in regards to lethal injection. I was like, what? That doesn't make plant based. Yeah, it doesn't make sense because that makes sense. The asparagus, they can so they if you are eating asparagus, you are killing innocent people on death row. Yeah. Because when you the whole sewage system of the United States, it's set up so it can detect like asparagus piss that gets channeled into containers that get sent. I know those are giant containers. Have you ever thought about how big those containers have to be for all the waste? And then what do they do with those containers? Even worse. It's little. It's like plastic bottles. It's millions of plastic bottles. Oh, it is. It's not a big one. No, you would think they could do that, but it's millions of plastic bottles. The asparagus pee gets diverted into the bottles at night. They come and they like put all that shit in a truck, put all the caps on. Yeah, somebody's job is to put all the caps on the asparagus fucking pee. I hate putting caps on water bottles to begin with. I can imagine having to do millions of those things. Well, they're doing either using like they use chimps now to do it. So it's like, oh, it doesn't have to be a person. No, they use like it's and I don't think chimps mind it. And they're pretty good at that. Oh, they fucking hate it. Oh, they do. Dude, it fucks their hands up. Have you ever seen a chimps hand who's been screwing caps on? It's there and also they're I've seen the hands before is that from screwing caps bloody hands every month they euthanized all the chimps and put new chimps in because the really mad from the work and from like the occasional fume from that man. Yeah, man. Well, that's horrible. See, that's something I didn't even really realize. Yeah, a lot of people don't know this stuff. They don't want you to know. Yeah, they want you to think that there aren't that many chimps on the earth, but there's a bunch. So William, do you go to church? I grew up going to church. I haven't I haven't gone in a while. Last time I went was last Easter, maybe. Do you ever think about going in Austin like finding a church? Yeah, I have. I went one time in Easter. Yeah, I grew up going to church, but I haven't haven't been here. What about you? My wife and I, we want to start going to church. So we went to I'm not going to say the name of the church. Yeah. Did you like it? We go to this fucking church. My wife saw like like the sign of the church. Yeah. And like Joe was Joe like, she was like Aaron was joking like, well, it could be a cult. And like, so we go to this church. This is true. We go to this fucking church. I will not say the name of it. Yeah. Within like 20 minutes of like, you know, fairly normal Christian church service. I guess they've been doing a book club. And I'm not even joking, dude. They stick people are talking about this book. And right away, they just start talking about fucking like, you know, really? Yes. So it's like, you go to a church thinking like, you know, I mean, I'm not sex negative or anything like that. But you go to this church, you know, just like we want a normal church, maybe we'll like, there's something truly within 30 minutes being at this church, this like old French dude stands up. And he's like, I'm, you know, very excited about I can't do it for Jackson. He's like, I'm very excited about like talking about talking about intimacy and sex. Yeah. So just during the sermon went out, like we're kids in there and every there's just the other regular church service. Yeah, they're talking about that. It seems kind of strange. That seems like a funny first time to go somewhere. And that's all they're talking about. Yeah. Talking about like it was, but you know, they're trying to do it in like a like, a church way. So they weren't like getting obviously they weren't getting like, so did y'all go back? No. Yeah. Yeah. Are y'all going to go to another one? Well, I don't think so, man. Like, I think Aaron kind of wants to go back, but I don't want to go back. Like I don't want to, I feel like if you go to a church and you get a weird feeling. Yeah, there's probably a reason for a weird feeling. I think churches can add the one I grew up going to there were a bunch of characters in it. What was the denomination of Christianity? Episcopalian. Me too. I know. I think you had told me that before. I think I knew that. But yeah, I got confirmed in the Episcopal church, but yeah, the church we grew up going to, people would raise their hands in the air, people would speak in tongues. That's Episcopal. Yeah, I'm almost positive. I don't think that's Episcopal. That's not Episcopal. I don't know. I think it was Church of the Redeemer. I can't remember. That's kind of costal. Episcopalians, it's like, it's boring. I hate it. My parents would make me wear a button-up suit. I've always been chubby. Yeah, I would have to dress up. My fat would like spill over the pants that didn't fit me, and I would be so uncomfortable, and it was boring. Were you ever the acolyte? Yeah, I was an acolyte. Yeah, I remember acolyting. Having to light the candles and stuff, I was always real scared because I didn't know what to give the preacher when they were doing the communion. I had the, it was one of the weirdest experiences. It was my first, I don't know, Richard Dawkins moment. I am not an atheist, I pray, and I believe in God and I love God, but it was my first real atheist moment. I was friends with the priest, what do they call them, priest or pastors? I can't remember now. Yeah, maybe either one. I think it's good. I was a friends of the pastor's kid, and somehow we're at the church when there isn't a service happening. He takes me into the room where the communion wafers are. He opens the drawer, pulls the communion wafers out, which, you know, I had been taught, this is like once a, the body of Christ, the cup of salvation. He opens them like they're fucking saltines and just starts eating them. He's like, they have little crosses on him. He's like, you want some? I'm like, no, man, are we allowed to do that? That's funny. He would just go in there and eat the fucking wafers. Yeah, he would just go in there and eat the wafers and like they taste, they taste like shit, you know? Yeah, I remember this. Wait, so what were you thinking? Just like, this is a scam that this guy's even doing this. It's supposed to be some holy thing. I think I was too young to identify, I just, the feeling was, yeah, it was kind of the Santa Claus when you find out there's no Santa Claus or something. It was just like, oh, I guess that these are just, it's just bread. And technically, before the blessing of the wafers, it is just, it's just wafers. Right, right. That's the priest has to do the certain prayer over it. And then there's this transubstantiation is what they call it. Then it turns into the flesh of God. Then you eat the flesh of God. But before you say the prayer, it's just crackers. Have you all drank wine? Yeah, back then they were just like, yeah, they would let you drink wine as a kid. And they would, there was like, they just give you the goblet and you sip it and they spin it around, wipe it. I know, I guess with COVID, now you probably can't do that. Everybody would drink out of the same cup. That's right. Well, the sex church we went to, there was like, people were drinking out of the cup, spinning. Oh, really? We didn't, but. Yeah, yeah. I don't think. Especially with the sex stuff. Maybe you don't want to drink out of all that with those people. Drink out of your fuck cup. I don't know what, but have you ever been to, you know, a priest have to like, like, I always thought that priests, I don't know, like when you work at, you know, a company like Starbucks or Best Buy or whatever, they give you your uniform to wear, right? Like, they, you might have to pay for it or whatever, but they still give it to you. So I always thought in churches, they give you the robes, they give you the stuff. No, no. When I was in LA, I went to because I was looking for a Halloween costume and I wanted to dress as a pope. And so I went to this clerical garment store. Oh, that's funny. Thinking they might ask for ID or I don't know, something to show. No, they don't ask for ID, but there's priests trying on their garments, standing in front of mirrors, like doing the angles, like when you're buying a shirt or whatever to see if it looks good on them. That's funny. I've never thought about how they get their garments. They buy them at like a target for priests. Was it expensive? Did you end up getting a pope thing? Super fucking expensive. Oh really? Do you still have it? No, I lost it. It was 150 bucks. I wore it at Burning Man and then like, I just lost it. But yeah, you just, you go in and buy the costume. It's not weird. Interesting. Yeah, yeah. I never really thought about how they, I remember at the end of the communion, if there was more wine or anything left, that people would have to chug it and eat all the bread. They had to finish everything. The priest would gulp that, he would like finish off the cup. Finish off the wine. That's kind of awesome. The blood, the blood of a lover. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, okay, last little thing, man, I got to say, and I know that maybe this is a little confusing for people out there as we are jumping around a lot of topics right now, but I got to say, dude, watching you at the comedy works this last weekend, it was the fucking best. You were so funny, William. Well, thank you. It was a pleasure. It was great. It was a good time. Yeah, it was funny. We ended up going after somebody on the second show, and then it was some people, we randomly ended up talking to after the show, the two characters. Yeah, it was funny. Yeah, I was yelling at some girl, and then it was like, oh, actually, hold on, what do you look like? That's some new thing. I'm sure that's been done before, but it was funny going after the person, but then just saying, wait, actually, hold on, what are you doing after this? I've never seen a classic guy. I've never seen anyone capable of keeping an audience's love while still assaulting. How do you do that, man? It's the best. I don't know. It's just kind of what I've always, what I've done since the beginning of me doing it, getting, trying to get real intense at times and going after people, it's just kind of exciting. It's kind of fun. Do you feel like you're, do you feel like since you got your hair from Bosley, do you think it's helped your comedy? Without a doubt. There's a new found confidence I haven't experienced in years. Yeah, it's actually crazy. I mean, that's my big selling point when I met these conferences, walking around, letting people touch my head. I mean, my biggest, my biggest selling point is just look at my confidence now. I mean, it's through the roof. Yeah. Yeah. Just because, yeah, I mean, I was totally going bald and now I have this full head of hair and yeah, my confidence is through the roof. It's spectacular. Listen, man, obviously, like I'm, and I'm married, we're monogamous right now. And like, so like, I'm, I'm, when I'm out there on the road, I've got low T, you know, I have very, very, very, very low testosterone and when low testosterone, micro penis. So when, you know, but that, but that being said, when I'm watching, there must have been 30 women in line just to talk to you. It's crazy. I mean, it's happening after every show now. And I swear to God, it's because of Bosley. It's because I have this full head of hair. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's after these shows. Yeah. I mean, it takes up a couple of hours after every single one talking to all the ladies. I mean, it's crazy, isn't it? It's whinge of jealousy. You know, I know, I was hoping you didn't care because you're so sweet, letting me open up for you. It's so nice. And then yeah, all the chicks are, it's crazy. I mean, I'm sorry. It's embarrassing for me a little bit. Well, you know, it's, it's fine, man. I mean, I'm again, like, I don't have time. I mean, I, I have my sex drive. It's just not there. Like I have no very, very low testosterone. See, almost none. But man, yeah, like, it is weird. Like I'm like, you know, talking to like dudes who are like into like Bitcoin and having like crypto conversations. I look over, you had the, I don't know who they were. There was like that team of models. Yeah, yeah. There were those five twins or five twins. Yeah, they played pool. We actually all went to play pool afterwards. They were really good at pool. It was so funny. Yeah, it was a quintuplets or I don't know how many five us, but yeah, it was so weird. They all looked the same. They were really into you, man. It's crazy. I mean, I swear it's the new found confidence with this full head of hair I have. I mean, it's, it's really cool. I mean, I really was pretty down when my grandparents went down, but it's been good to be able to sort of rebound a little bit, being able to do those shows with a full head of hair. It's, it's very exciting. What's the offer code again? William Montgomery. Yeah. If you go to www.bosleyhairclub.com backslash William Montgomery. Great. And William, last question.

We're going to jump right into that, but first, a word from our friends. A horrible thing happened to me the other day. I was at the gym pumping iron, 300 pounds on the bench press, also doing calf exercises simultaneously. When I looked over and I saw a man whose headphones had gotten stuck in his treadmill, it was one of the most horrifying things I've ever seen. It looked like somebody had taken a chainsaw to a pile of old pork bits of plop and flesh splashing about. They got him out of there and they say he's recovering now, but to me, it was a reminder of why it's very important to get wireless earbuds. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Raycon.

Okay, I'm going to play a song that I recorded with today's guest, Emil Amos, when we were in college together. At the time, I didn't know what I was doing. I was trying to learn to be a psychologist, I guess, but mostly I was just taking a lot of acid. And I got lucky enough to run into Emil and we hit it off. And he had a four track. He could play guitar. He had this beautiful voice. He was always reading like Heidegger. So it was like getting to be friends with somebody from a Hermann Hesse novel. And during our friendship, he introduced me to some of some things that changed my life permanently, including Daniel Johnston, Sebado, and just a general sort of ethic that I guess you could describe as lo-fi.

What do you think three years three years? Has it been that long? It's just a guess. I heard this like like scary ass shit about And I don't mean to start all heavy But this scary thing about like, you know, how trauma Fucks up your perception of time. Have you ever heard that before? Not this specifically It was pretty scary, but it like somebody was telling me that people who have like really severe trauma From their childhoods or whenever their time and memory get all distorted because like when you're going through some rotten thing You buckle down and you try to like just get through it But you think that when the trauma is done you can unbuckle and suddenly your mind is gonna record Memories and time the same way, but it never does again So you always deal with those kind of dreamy Sense of time and stuff that's happening to you You know and then like you get into like this concept of universal Trauma like I just interviewed this guy Charles Eisenstein and he's like, oh, it's you know, it's like the just existing in society as we know it is a Traumatizing experience and that just freaked me out man. And so yeah, when you say three years, I think God I don't know was it three years. I don't know. It's I can't really I can't figure out when the last time We chatted was that being said I do eat a lot of weed Occam's razor might say it's more likely the fact that I consume marijuana Frequently or something Yeah, well, that's I mean clearly a Freudian idea that from The beginning isn't he the guy that birth is the ultimate original scar or something that from birth that you're already Freud said that I think is that was it was that around and the no Vedic time sounds like some kind of I mean, it does sound a little like original sin or something original trauma or whatever like that The word gets overused quite a bit But it's like, you know, some people when they contact reality They just don't want to they don't want to like eat the eat what's in front of them and so they have to come up with some method some way to like skate through the time space continuum maintaining their sanity But also Trump pretending that they can like kind of not put their entire soul in the light socket of Suffering based on whatever their particular circumstance happens to be you enter into a daydream state You know what I mean? You start living up in your head. Do you're you're lost in your thoughts? they come back down four years has passed and You know what I mean? I'm not saying that happened to me necessarily, but it's just weird, you know When it's you you're one of my you're my oldest friend, you know And so it's just funny that leaps forward in time as we get sucked into oblivion Yeah, it's funny. I feel today. I feel like a hundred percent clear, you know, like Scientology cleared cool but fate and free they have that I mean a lot of the podcasts we've done Since I moved to New York at least I remember we had we did a few that were like Super dark one that was one that you didn't put out because you were kind of embarrassed at how depressed we were Yeah, and which is I totally get and And it's cool to be sitting here right now and know that you know, I'm not in that zone right now But but as we were saying earlier in the car We're driving here I'm always kind of aware that it could you could be coming back at any point, which I think is just a kind of basic Ancient philosophy, you know that like The storm has never gone forever. Yeah, and I and I I do Have a feeling that like the end of my life is gonna be really hard and I don't I don't know exactly what shape it'll take because I Bet I'll be surprised at how good it is too, but I do have this weird sense that like the challenges I Will face Will go to the very end. I don't know. I don't know in what form Well, is that a weird thing to say? Everybody say that I don't I mean well I I don't think people like to think about that sure if they do think about it Usually they summon up a pretty like romantic fantasy Hallmark channel style about it But no, they don't they don't like contemplate the possibility of some kind of rough exit from this dimension but also it's like that You have to fantasize about it because there's no fucking way to tell what it's gonna be like, you know Yeah, I was even in college. I feel like we both would debate each other sometimes in class about the device of using death as a measuring stick or some sort of tool to Analyze the value of life, you know, and I and I feel like in the most non grim way day to day I do think about the death bed realization as a device or like a It's a reflexive tool. I use I think to myself If I'm on it on my death bed and I look back at my life, you know, what am I gonna be happy? I did what am I gonna be proud of what am I gonna be super embarrassed by? I mean, it's it's a I think it's a kind of clarifying tool. I like the death bed fantasy But I do think it's just like a form of like Future nostalgia for a thing that like wrecking balls you you know because it's like you get the death bed Number one, you're assuming you're in a bed You know what I mean? And number two you're assuming you're even gonna be able to think yeah And and like in this fantasy I think produces for me in the past is like created a real ability to procrastinate Because you do get this idea of some future Vacation prior to absorption into infinity and then and then in that during that vacation you contemplate life review Make amends, but really you're just probably gonna have a fever. You're gonna be shitting yourself You're gonna ask where you are a couple of times. You're gonna fall asleep. You're gonna wake up and like what's happening? Someone like you're dying. You're gonna fall back asleep Maybe your eye you'll just get your eye open enough to look at somebody piercing pain in your head followed by Nothingness, you know what I mean? And like this this I think is probably more realistic than It which I to me I Have kind of like given up the death bed for a lot of people. What's the typical death bed fantasy? Like what's the just stereotypical death bed fantasy? How does it look? Well, I think I Totally agree with you. I think that the the hovering Illusion that you're that you're sort of coddling is that the truth will eventually arrive and even if it's that the last second Yeah, it'll at least be the total truth Yeah, which there probably is some element of accuracy to that in the sense that you have the total amount of your life has been lived So but but it's not to say that you can grasp everything fully or anything But but the idea is the seduction that the truth is coming though And so that implies that right now isn't really good enough and right now Isn't really the full picture which is kind of one of the classic lies, right? Yeah, what if everything just stays like this till the moment you die meaning you're never fully sure of anything and and you're kind of Pathetic and sort of just this just this this is all there is and that's a Really tough one for me to grapple with when I'm like super honest with myself because I don't feel a hundred percent here ever I'm just you know, I'm just not totally present most of the time. I'm always distracting myself with something and If that's the way I'm gonna be to the very end Then I see no light of Improvement or truth coming and and so I have to be honest with myself about that because if I was ever to take the bait and believe That some great arrival point was coming. I would be a A halted idiot, right? Yeah, right cuz why yeah, you just like or just I guess like get as close to death as you like do the people who are into like the eschatological messianic fantasy, which is the equivalent of the subjective deathbed fantasy Within it you naturally do accidentally long for your own extinction because you imagine there to be an epiphanous moment some kind of really Horrific like last buzz like a last high where a light bulb appears above your head and it's like the It's you know, it's like you end up milking your future death and drink like that. It's like a vacation and Yeah, but you you you do end up with what you just said. It's like That thing of like oh, oh, no, this is just it and then and then this little Selfness thing that I got going on It's not really gonna get better Any more than it is and it's not really gonna necessarily get worse Any more than it is and I've noticed in my very worst moments. There seems to be relatively similar Sense of what's happening that doesn't quite change that much and then and you know what I mean outside of like, oh, I've got a piercing headache Fuck this sucks. Oh, I got a headache. Ah, this sucks The pain overwhelms you maybe to the point where it's intoxicating and you and you desperately want to get away from it but usually it's just a sort of flickering in and out experience of a kind of non-existent dream state thing With people within the dream telling you with some great certainty that if you go and do this or that read this book Practice this meditation say this mantra There will be a moment Where the scales fall from your eyes and a great light Who rises inside of you and then in that moment? Thou shall awaken from the dream and that's death anyway So it's like, you know what I mean? Like the whole thing is just like it doesn't really matter if that happens whoever you are right now The dreaming state is gone. So you're dead And if you die the dreaming state is gone. So I guess that's enlightenment or something To me I get all fucking Stoic Marcus Aurelius Who like broke it down saying it's a moment in time Death is a moment in time. That's it. It's one single moment a quantum of experience That's it. You aren't gonna die This you that you are right now it stays alive, but one frame of you is Gonna be the last frame and that frame can deal with its own fucking shit, you know right now we got podcasts to do and music to play and Then let the for that frame can die Let that frame conk out. However, the fuck it's gonna conk out. I My feeling these days when it comes to this sort of thing as someone who's been deeply horrified by death For a very long time. Neurodically obsessed with death And is that um It's just means that if you love life so much that your mind gets that my my mind being magnetized to death is The other side of the I love life penny I think it's it's about time For me to like pull up my pants and and acknowledge If I could get a little objectivity that if this is my major life curse Like if this isn't my big challenge my mountain to climb then that's a pretty great Problem to have out of all the various life problems you could have of mountains to climb of psychological Damage that you're trying to repair or something like of all of them You know if I could just take a deep breath and say that this particular grappling this particular intellectual feat that I seem to focus on every day, which is what how well would be the fact that I'm Not necessarily present which is sort of you know This is the ancient definition of consciousness sort of is this divorce inside yourself Between as you know sartre said the in itself and the for itself. So you're hovering above yourself You know, you're not really totally feeling like you are you in consciousness Yes, so if that's my big problem, and if I don't really feel like I'm here and It drives me to levels of frustration of feeling upset or scared or sad or whatever it does Then of all problems at least I got a really classic ancient one You know, I mean it could be struggling with you know some kind of Daddy issues, maybe I have those too, but I don't know that because I feel like this is really my my issue and Maybe I need to step back and say like goddamn. I'm lucky that this is my problem. Well that now this is where this thing man, I'm sorry all for this is something I mentioned before but Trump a Rinpoche wrote about the situation of suffering and specifically the situation of Coming up inventing a way to Trick yourself into thinking that Your son you can hold this at arms length. So this rift the great divorce that you're talking about if you can imagine Number one other problems that you could have Fuck, you know, you could be one of these beekeepers who's like your bees are like coming back and like shitting plastic out you could be somebody who like a butt plug Disaster those people who like actually have to go to the emergency room and by the time they're like it's too late Saddest incarnations you waited a week Now we got to remove your whole colon because the butt plug is jammed in there. It's not coming out And there's nails in there. You could be one of those people you whatever you invent some absurd Potential other you and you're like well at least I'm not that fantasy Meanwhile in that what you do in that moment At least as I understand this thing Trump or Rinpoche was talking about is you now hold your suffering at arms length So now it's like, okay. Well, at least I'm not this other thing This is a problem. I have sure whatever but it's like but still you are in the situation And the situation is not going to change and so this is like the for me has been one of the big moments for me It's just like oh my god. I Don't have to fix it It's not fixable and then in that realization of that just that cuz like fuck it doesn't make it Change the initial problem changeless But all that extra energy Pretending around some corner is a is a fucking blue. Wow. This is oh, I used to be so but now I'm It's like just once you give that shit up sure. Oh my god, and then once you give up on the people around you Similarly, you know what I mean where you're like, they're not gonna get better Right, stop trying to be part of the secret fucking team of people making the people in your life better They're gonna be that way too and then the world is not getting better So forget that too and then like all of a sudden you get to hang up your fucking world betterment Gear and and and in there somewhere you're actually I don't know. It's the same. It's like this thing you're talking about Which is like the problem of I guess you could say I don't know maybe this is too woo-wooly a way to say it Spirit contacting matter. Yeah formlessness contacting form non differentiatedness Contacting differentiatedness literally a crucifixion and then you know, this is a this is the reality and You still end up Having the awareness that you are confused The awareness that you're fading out the awareness that you're not here all the time the awareness that something seems amiss What is that? Yeah, who is that? Who's doing that part of the thing and then this is where Trump or rubbish says confusion is a Condition of enlightenment Because the Confusions loud The Enlightenment is quiet the Confusions held within the Enlightenment the Confusion is literally embraced in the space of awareness It's crying like a fucking baby and it won't stop. It's confusion What's the this is that Ramadan story? Lady calls him on orange sunshine. I'm gone completely insane and he's like who okay? But let me talk to the person who dialed the phone and knew to call me Because that person that person hasn't gone crazy. You're out of your fucking mind You know I'm saying yeah, yeah, yeah, I think the Great logicians or whatever Funny it sounds like a magician, but it's like the like Vittgenstein and High digger. I think although I'm not an expert. I think their idea was that if they arranged words in the correct manner if they actually Positioned the question in the right way then it would answer itself It's a cool idea. So if you're asking the wrong questions over and over again Nothing, you'll always be confused But but if you finally refine the mind and the language to the point where it's perfect Then there almost won't be a question, right? Yeah, so it's like a mathematical thing. So if If if I'm trying to do this and I'm trying to get to the central heart of the matter, you know, I'm in a twilight zone And I'm theorizing the whole episode my life episode 33 It's like I'm theorizing through the whole episode trying to Get the right words on the right order so I can crack the riddle And then at the end of the episode Let's say I get the central problem. I finally decode what it is But the issue or the box I'm stuck in I figure it out And you're saying That at the very last stage when you're right there and you've got your hands on the real thing The next step is to acknowledge that that thing is totally un unsolvable That that at that moment when you get there and you finally recognize you've got your hands on the thing Indiana Jones is about to switch the thing. Yeah, and he's got the holy grail And then the final stage of saged him is that you release it and you realize You got to give up right there, you know, so that's that's where I've got to go to a place where I let myself Be super flawed and let myself be a mess and let myself my brain not be present But obviously as all great thinkers just keep keep trying never never giving up But like accepting that like I don't have to look further for a better equation But that that equation it can't be relinquished and untied that not will just kind of it's just part of Being alive, you know, yeah, I think so I mean, it's definitely a fun thing to just give up the project for a second It's like I think it takes a lot of guts and you know, this is where Lately I keep thinking about the parable of Jesus and the wealthy man and it's like I Want to follow you and he's like, okay But you got to give up everything You have to give all your all your money to the poor and then you can follow me and this I think comes into It's easier for a rich man to get through the eye of a needle and on the surface level. It sounds like it's talking about money with you know, the exteriorized version of fixation on some kind of squirreling away in the Imaginary delusion that it's gonna do anything for you, you know, so money is the easiest thing to give away Really, it's like easy clearly All right, you fucking look at that mug I've got it's easy to give it away. You get a thing in exchange But to even give it it's even easier somehow to give it away You end up giving it away and yet you still have that need any what I'm saying is To me that thing is saying actually Give you have to give up the project like you your project your little project that you you were doing whatever it is You're gonna be this or that What happens if you give up the project and then who are you then I was the other day I threw a piece of trash in the garbage can walking down the street and I thought What happens if I just give up all the spirituality bullshit You know what I mean like how attached to my to this nonsense What if what if you threw that in the trash fuck it all just it was a view was a little thing I don't know what I was doing. I was fucking. Yeah, it's just a fleeting thought did was doing ketamine for a long time I guess it made sense. Maybe I don't know. I don't want to blame it on psychedelics, but nah, you know, probably not maybe not Maybe not and this is why science is so beautiful because in science a scientist will spend their entire life Exploring some hypothesis The hypothesis is not it's proof. Oh, no, you were wrong and they have to abandon it and move on It's a victory Because of their work trying to establish if I asking the question They got to a place where they found out. No, no, no, that's not true and they're that much closer to the truth Because they gave it up. That attitude has always impressed me I think the what people struggle with and it's what we're probably Both and all struggling with all the time is just there's there's a contradiction in there People always want to understand it. The literal mind is is always, you know Dow is a one-on-one when we would take classes on that stuff. It was sort of like What the freshman kids always like, you know asking the teacher is like But how can I you're asking me to give up? And keep trying at the same time and you know and it's like the teacher has to be really subtle to be able to explain it's kind of like probably 90% of what You know teachers are trying to explain most of the time in a in a class on dow ism or something like how can I get this contradiction across, right? Yeah So, I mean, what would you tell? Somewhat a young person that was like saying you're telling me to give up the project Yeah, so what is that? I I'm just supposed to to die and just do nothing now. Just like lie on the couch every day A shot Right because it won't happen. You won't you won't give up Just try I mean if that the thing is like whatever your mind like if you if the response to your mind is like Wait You want me to do the blast for me and then it fills in the blasphemy blank With like I this blasphemy is like whatever the fucking thing is. Yeah, I'm gonna go suck a million dicks then It's like well, if that's but you know, whatever the fucking thing is go do it Should you know what I mean? Whatever now that that's a blasphemy. I mean that could be a very beautiful experience. I'm saying the Ghost story your mind is telling you Should you temporarily take a vacation? From its never-ending Confabulations Is like well go do that and see what happens. Yeah, go see go see go see it really go check it out because ultimately You're going to end up Here right I don't know. It's A joy. I just know from me. There is a That that I remember throwing the trash in the can It was a really joyful moment because I realized how fucking attached I had become To these conceptualizations of the universe Not only that in a weird way how Kind of like stifling It is in the sense. It's like well, blah, blah, blah and sand dance and blah, blah, blah and sand that and blah, blah, blah and sand that I do that all the time, but it's like, what do you have to say? What is your idea? Okay, because blah, blah, blah when they said that They were they were standing on the shoulders of blah, blah, blah I said blah, blah, blah and then it's probably just a bunch of fucking blah, blah And then suddenly I'm just talking about that thing where you cut through the crusty old fucking Gravy in the gravy tray of your philosophical conceptualizations and suddenly when you just break through that little surface level and usually it does involve some blasphemy You hit I think the place the clear The fountain of youth the spring water the good water the non-brackish Stuff and that stuff doesn't really Now you're off the map. Yeah, there you go. I I feel like I I totally agree is like your true character Can't really be forgotten or avoided like the ramda story like when when his boat and his jet start disappearing The thing that most people are really afraid of is that they're gonna totally Mutate and transform and to like lose themselves, you know, especially they're too high or something, but The thing is you're gonna land on your feet. Your character is going to persevere now that starts a whole another conversation, but as though we'll get to I think in a second, but like I think that the idea that your character Being so strong that almost precedes your ego has Lately made me think that maybe like Traditional schooling the kinds me and you went to like public school Is actually like a total fucking farce. I never thought that when I was young I thought all the hippie schooling that kids went to where it was like really fruity when I was a kid Now i'm thinking man I don't have a kid You know you do so you're gonna have to face this decision but now i'm starting to think like some alternate form of schooling would be really cool because its life is more about character strengthening and growing and evolving Like character nourishing more than like You know studying all that shit we did. Yeah, you know. Oh my god. Yeah for sure Well, you know, it's like the problem is we're just in a real like kind of self replicating demonic situation over here right now because we need To produce need to produce money I need you to need my services So I need to fill you with need if I want to you've got to always want some shit And I've got to get figure out a way to make you want my shit And that is uh, that's the game I guess over here and then and so when you're going to school That's being that where the curriculum is being determined by People who are within that system of trying to produce States of healthy need to sell product or teaching you how to Make someone need you What are you gonna learn in that situation except how to be a fucking drug dealer? You know and and what it's not drugs. You're dealing It's some service some thing I'm a jig at this or that and and then I don't know you end up Having a general sense of like I'm being fucking hoodwinked here any healthy kid Upon encountering public school Will have a reaction Of like wait Something is amiss. This is not my family. What about the wait? Where are the hikes? Wait, I have to run to the bathroom. I gotta take a shit. Wait. I have to ask permission to take a shit What is this? Why am I asking you permission to take a shit? Meanwhile these teachers are working three jobs They're driving ubers and shit So they're they're emanating a sense of like I'm getting I came here to fucking help babies and children Make contact with reality and now I'm fucking Basically fucked and I'm supposed to teach these kids shit like this system even works When you know what I mean the best teachers the one who are like you need to get out of school Yeah, totally. I I have this buried memory that came back to me really recently of like this summer day I guess school was out and I like looked out my mom's Window and next door there were all these lawnmowers going off. It's really loud and I Looked over and it was like my fifth grade teacher was mowing someone's lawn. Oh my god And for some reason at whatever maybe I was 16 or something it really was like Hard for me to get my head around that my teacher Had for whatever reason in my mind fallen to this low-level yard worker Like in my mind and so I mean it exposes to what degree I really I really looked up to older people on a level where that was like wildly unrealistic. I thought that teachers were like these really Inevitably wise people, you know, and now I'm finally old enough to look back and think of how much they didn't care and they were so insanely flawed and just you know, they're just like Barely a step away from that like Guy that was screaming nonsense at us on the sidewalk today. You know, it's like It's so it feels so healthy to put them in their their right place in society that like, you know, these people Just were working a fucking job and they didn't give a shit about me a lot of them, you know and I just I it's weird to me that I really looked up to because that's a big theme of my life I really looked up to people So profoundly like and I'm glad I'm like letting them down off their pedestals now. Good god. I was I've been such a fucking idolater Me too. It's disgusting. Yeah, I mean what it's a We were talking about this earlier we were saying like the the condition of When you read in the bible or whatever a movie Are you hear the term idolater? I have summoned up indiana jones style pyramids with fucking dudes in robes offering hearts to golden bulls And it's cool in its own way because there's ceremony and incense. It's fucking not awful but at least on some level the The thing is like ornate But then in the same way that like when you picture the apocalypse you fantasize about volcanoes or meteors or whatever When you think of idolaters, you never we think about the apocalypse. It doesn't occur to you Though actually the world isn't going to really end according to your stupid poem or an iron maiden song You know what I mean? It's going to end in a way that is the ending of endings You know what I mean? So you don't get to your idea of the apocalypse is actually going to that that's going to go through the apocalypse too similarly When you realize the idolatry that we're seeing in the world right now is just what you're saying A fixation on the notion that someone other than you is going to save your ass Oh And then you start realizing like i'm afraid not my friend Nobody's going to save your ass You have to get on the fucking boat You know what I mean? Like you just got to get on the boat And you have to figure out and if you don't have a boat you're gonna have to build a boat And if you you know what I mean and you have to build it Yeah, you have to do it here because honest to god, we don't know what you are You might be an anomaly Literally all the scriptures that were written about oh abandon all variety of religions and surrender unto me Find some grass and sit in the woods or here's the breath work or the thing or whatever That might have been written For everyone except you If you follow that prescription you're taking someone else's medicine This leaves you in a wonderfully lonely position Where you now or have to deal with the fact that you're alone In a world of people who are maybe all actually it's working for them, but it didn't work for you It's not working for you And that loneliness Is such a joy because it means you're free. It's the beginning of liberation if you ask me you've walked out of the prison And you're still in the shadow of the prison and you're thinking about how nice it was because you knew you're gonna get scrambled eggs Even though they sucked and you got a nice job as the dude who got the extra permission to fucking sweep the hallway at night And you're gonna miss it a little bit But still in all it's better That lonely feeling Then the fucking obsessive fixated feeling on fantasizing that if you keep saying this thing over and over If you keep doing this dance this certain way That you're gonna be all right to me That's a real it's a really exciting thing For me to just realize like, oh, yeah, that was a different time. Yeah, this is possible to you that that shit that all the shit Heidegger sart buddhism hinduism Christianity alastor coley That was written at a different point in the dream the universe was having And so that worked for that particular dream state But we're in a new dream now And the old stuff don't work anymore We've gone around the bend. We're in a new part of the river Well, I like to think that those, you know, each person's final take on life As they wrote them uh Well at least like some kind of signpost That reflects a personal Genuine journey towards, you know Ultimate knowledge or something, you know that these people gave their lives and Yeah, there's some some takes that would be um relatively useless like in the early part of the greeks where there's there's always like Philosophers that say no, I'm pretty sure everything's made of Air, yeah, you know, and then the next guy says no, I'm pretty sure everything's made of water and the next guy says no It's actually fire. You know, I mean that that stuff is pretty useless but Go into the people you you're talking about like The buddha story or whatever they they're Depending on how you use them. They have some signpost worth, you know, yeah, but uh I don't know that that story is supposed to supply you with everything you need But the buddha story does A great job, you know, I feel like yeah, I feel like Me and you are sort of In some way, I feel like I've said this before but in some way We're sort of like at the top of the roller coaster or something like we've lived half our lives. Yeah, and we spent Hundreds and hundreds of hours Obsessing over things that were not real. Yes, like we definitely obsessed over and Got very angry about a lot of bullshit. Yeah, and We're kind of at this halfway point where Instead of obsessing over what we don't have We're now we've been given a special opportunity. We're here now and we Can't really complain No, I don't think we can Where we are right now and so now Our job is sort of transforming, you know, we we don't we're not trying to solve the issue From the first half of our life where we felt Pushed away and unloved, you know, yeah, we're not there right now So our job is transforming into something new You know Well, number one that the first thing that you say is a thing that I've My My brother is talking to me about. Oh, you know, we're around, you know, we're in the second part of our life the second half of our life And I always think like wow, that's an optimistic fucking prognosis Implying you've got another 40. You think you have 40 years. Jesus christ Congratulations. I don't know if that's the case So and to me It pads things a little bit to imagine. I have a second half now. I don't want to like I'm not saying Like, oh, no, I've had some sense of this or that. I'm just saying like fuck. I don't know So that's where I'm going to hang out in number one. I don't know about that My I don't know how to check that atm So to speak and there is no way to check that fucking atm to see how much time you have in your account So number two The job I don't think there's a fucking job And then and I don't mean to I'm trying to get to the the like heart of the matter Which is like you how you invent a job You're born into a place of no walls No boundaries no real boundaries, right and you invent A wall you invent a boundary you start inventing these mountains to climb and then you you you're you're now you you start climbing the mountain and now You're on this long trek and now suddenly at some point the daydream ends. You're like, wait, I just invented all the mountains I did get to the top of some mountains But that actually wasn't even a mountain and I actually didn't climb it There was no really what you know what I mean, and now you're like, oh fuck. So then You realize like, all right. Well, I guess I'm gonna like keep playing this video game because there's a subtle transformation at that point Recognizing that Well, yeah, that's despair That's the abyss as they call it. I've heard I've heard it's called crossing the abyss And it's a moment. I I think I've made tiny and maybe if the fact that I say I've made it contact with it means I haven't I don't know Yeah, but I'm not trying to like take credit And like establish some put a flag on something and say like I am now like I'm not letting my ego inflate It's like the opposite. It's what you're saying. It's like I my ego was inflated before And like now I'm just so thankful that I don't have to wake up and go through my own lies You know what I mean? It's like I'm kind of releasing myself from that. But as you also said You know, I'm still gonna keep playing this fucking game Yeah Yeah, you you you Um Both of us, I think are now experiencing something that when we were younger might have seemed Worse than death A fate worse than death, which is just we're starting to really enjoy Or just accept the mundane qualities of life And I hope we are and it's okay There's not that like and I think that is part of getting older man It's like there's not that like I when the old days When I heard shit like just so you know, the whole enlightenment thing isn't real or just don't think about it doesn't matter Or things along the lines of just any of this stuff is really normal Super normal in fact is what terms and or trump o'rampage. They would say things like If you've been standing on your head your whole life and suddenly you're standing your feet There's gonna be a really mo crazy moment where you feel so good But eventually you're just gonna realize. Oh, yeah, I'm just like this is the way I was supposed to be walking around You've oriented yourself to what you were made for And I and I'm not claiming either of us as necessarily done that but at some point It just the You do get to a place where you're like, this is fine Yeah, I'm not I mean it just jeez I don't know how I wandered into some sort of like feeling guilty. We're being pretentious, but like I know But like but I mean when when we know I feel it too It's like the fact that we're even talking about ourselves is embarrassing to me But like but like when we used to go to um, the zen Sort of mountain study retreat with uh tejo. Tejo. Yeah She had these young boys around that would wear the robes and shave their head and wear the belts, right? Yeah, and I mean just like Your first immediate impression because we were sort of just outsiders just wandering through we weren't yeah We weren't that wasn't like our life's calling or anything um, but your first impression is like You're really gonna wear Fucking belt and shit like isn't that like the most the biggest red flag, you know that you are like Quantifying your knowledge, you know, and you're like putting like drawing your height on the on on the edge of the door You know like your mom used to do like I'm Johnny's this tall now Yeah, you know, so you're really gonna announce this as though that's real What I'm saying is like I feel like a awesome Calm that I'm like not drawing my height on the wall anymore. You know what I mean? I'm just not I'm not calculating it anymore You know and I and I'm letting myself just I'm letting myself be alone a little bit What a relief Because we the problem is is just like the goddamn encouragement and maybe this is the school problem It's like we're encouraged to come up with all these fucking markers Exactly points of growth Places of this and things of that and this and that and this and that and then it within the Flurry of activity that that produces. There's this wonderful opportunity to distract yourself from I think a really essential problem for a lot of people which is You're flickering out of existence all day long There are massive holes in the experience of you as a self That you're not paying any attention to because you're not there and yet somehow you are trying to create an outpost of a little encampment within an imaginary Framework and it's driving you up the fucking wall because no matter what you know What what about you lost your fucking keys, man? Where were you? You were asleep All night and you woke up Where were you? You drove four hours and you don't remember driving This is a situation of like complete It's antithetical to a society That is desperately trying to push itself into the world and these these attempts I have become the market pressure for technology. It's like, you know what I mean? It's like finally we can exteriorize ourselves I might have not been here for the last four hours because I went into my head and I was thinking about fucking like, you know Did that when I was like Did something awful happen to me when I was in the third grade? You know what I mean? Like you're you're you know what I mean? You're but at least I know my fucking facebook profile was They're the whole time I might have blinked out my instagram account. It's always there some sense of like that's me. You see that's me Look at that. There I am. I'm doing great This is like the problematic Thing I guess is that we are that thing you were talking about initially We you must eventually come to terms with the fact that if you are something you're not something in a any kind of like steady way You're strobing if anything or at least the you that you think you are that's fucking cool And and exciting to me because it's like oh god. You're afraid of death You're afraid of that last moment You're afraid to die when it's like literally and this is straight stolen from marcus aurelius You died That's the fucking thing your past is gone It's gone This is for some people you say that to them and they get really upset No, it isn't I've got my pictures And I remember my memaw and we had a christmas together and the christmas was it's like yeah, I know but guess what it's gone And now you're not supposed to say that, you know, I've I've been in some way or another somewhat It's like there's a gentle approach to expressing this I guess So now you have to deal with like oh, well, that's gone your past is gone What the fuck even was that it was like a dream You're the dream you had a few nights ago Where you were like getting your dick sucked by a hippo or like whatever it was is more real than your past, you know outside of debt And so then You know some paper trail that there must have been a me You know, I'm talking about yeah, yeah, and then not only do you not have a fucking past But you don't have a present in the sense that like the thing that you think you are keeps flickering in and out And then that's what trumpa talks about is like well what what what it is is we check in with some moment Throughout the day. So now I'm checking in right now. I'm checking in. I'm here with you. I'm I feel here with you I'm checking in And but I'm gonna blink out again. And then but but there's there's a purpose for all of these states, right? It's like It's like kind of a radical realization to realize like each one of these mind states is Totally natural and fine, you know that you like the whole idea is you're trying to like through most of life You're trying to herd yourself into the correct, you know Field to grazen or something. Yeah, and the past couple years maybe three years I saw Two therapists is not to do with this stuff, but um There was a couple points where of course they always say to you when you're like leaving you say like Well, actually I'm going traveling for a bit. So I won't be back. Maybe I'll just get back to you when When it's time to come back in and they always say like, oh, no, you're dealing with a lot of stuff You got to come back in immediately and you're like, oh really? I am. I mean Okay, you know, and you don't know how much to trust them, but Trust them, but there there was a couple points where I was like Wow, I've got a little more going on inside That I didn't know about like some stuff from When I was a kid that I just didn't know about and so I was like, well, that's a big Step just to see that, you know, like not that I had any great urgent dilemma or anything This wasn't life or death or anything, but I thought that was a pretty wild feeling to to have my hands on that and be like holy shit like There's some stuff I didn't know about myself, right? And then now fast forward to this state where I'm bragging today about feeling clear or whatever Even though I'm being sarcastic, but I am I feel good. You know what I mean? And so Which one of those states was more productive? The one where I feel great or the one where I was like, holy shit. I got a lot of shit to work on Well, the most productive or the most, you know Sort of empathetic Would be to stand back and say they're all they're all just good states and and they'll just cycle through them and it's all The where I need to be and it's gonna be fucking fine. That's good, you know, and I know that sounds relatively posy, but like I just it's always kind of fascinated me that It was it was really early on when I got into the Centro loo Barlow home recordings Yeah, I would listen to all the songs and you know, there'd be like 40 tracks on a record and as they went by I think Geez, there's so many points of the day and each one of those moments is Like a world Yeah, and each one of those worlds has realizations that are separate from the other worlds and I remember looking out the Window and I saw my cat sort of like in the sunshine on a rock And just kind of being tired and I thought about like earlier when she was just like running around going crazy And how how that was a totally different universe inside her brain, you know I was like and all of these moments of the day Can be honored, you know That was one thing Lou Barlow showed me is he was like through this kind of radical honesty you can just embrace every little thing about life and and honor them and just Let it flow through you and that that kind of Sort of embrace of this Huge variety of experience was to me extremely radical because everybody else who is trying to Essentially sell you something most of the time, you know, it could be in conversation or it could be an actual product Is trying to again herd themselves or some sort of words into a shape that is you know legitimate or fucking sexually attractive or something like that and then someone comes along and shows you that life Has merit just on its Sort of pure ability to be researched and experienced, you know almost scientifically like you can give yourself to study Yeah, and and that's what's real That's what's redeeming. That was like so huge for me. Wow, man Yeah, that is one of the gifts that Lou Barlow gave us and that style gave gave us it's just that Look, this is this beautiful and this Is the rugged terrain you go into the wilderness and see rocks and doom And mud and like it's still god. It's beautiful And then somehow people are trying to evade the rugged terrain of this That is and even worse they're trying like instead of describing it as it is their interior landscape or whatever Like ah, it's you there's fucking tumbleweeds I think there's like just mostly tumbleweeds and it's a big Desert And there's some fucking garbage old abandoned cars or something Maybe some shitty kids drawings flutter by every once in a while. I don't know Instead of saying that you're like, well, it's fast and It's you know learning from the past That has been a great teacher to me. Whatever it is you revise I don't want to fucking hear you. I don't want to when I'm reading crack hour Talk about ascending some disaster, you know an Everest or whatever I don't want to fuck. I don't want him to fucking sweeten it up That's no adventure story. Can you imagine if he wrote Everest like it was great We were learning how to make the best of the worst situation And then it was you know, I mean, it's not that's not an adventure story Why do we keep trying to do this to ourselves? It's sad and it's a fucking waste of time And it's also bad for everyone around you That's the moment Lou Barlow is fucking singing about jerking off Right three times. What is it three times a day? Yeah, that's how many you do And then here's the other thing man the you there's another thing in the culture right now which is like The moment sometimes I'll say to people. Oh, I'm lazy. You see Well, no, the reason I didn't walk the dog is because I'm lazy And they'll say you're not lazy It's like no, I'm lazy I could have walked the dog. Yeah, I know why I didn't walk the dog It's because I was being lazy. I wanted to fucking do something else. I should have walked the dog There's a pathetic thing I did that I didn't walk the dog. You're being hard on yourself. No, I'm not I don't feel bad that I'm lazy or that I'm pathetic. It just happens to be what I'm working with right now That's that'd be like if a if a preacher was like and then Christ bled out from his wounds and and said Why has thou forsaken me and somebody just yelled out from the crowd like no, he didn't You're not forsaken. Yeah, he's fine. Yeah Yeah, can you imagine Jesus utter is one of the most beautiful existential statements maybe ever said in a scripture The messiah Being itself is basically saying I didn't it didn't work gang and then like yeah His bleeding hand is outstretched like some kid in a leather jacket moon walks up and puts a pepsi in his hand and like The song the commercial ends and he's like stoked. He looks at the camera. He's like He looks at the camera and he goes I am not forsaken anymore pepsi It saved me It saved me the pepsi saved me. Oh, you know, Jesus, I know you think you're forsaken right now I know you're hanging on the cross. I know you're a young dude who like thought you were the fucking thing and all that But it didn't work. But actually you're gonna be fine. We're gonna, you know, we're gonna get you off the thing It's gonna work out To me, it's like, yeah, then you destroy Jesus like that's what exactly what satan would do. I'm sure if there was a satanic impulse Like the executioner's mask falls off and and like jesus rolls his eyes and then mentos Fucking kicks then This cross was sponsored by city bank It's like the the the The repugnant practice Of trying to make things less repugnant is like really Oh, it's a it's a it's a fucking waste of it's a sad waste of energy No one gets cheered up by the way. There's never been a time in my life Where when I'm feeling like abject shit And someone comes up to me. He's like, don't be you're just being hard on yourself. But you're actually okay It never has really quite worked. Well, that but okay You and I might Consume things that make us feel Like we've got our hands on the truth or some some sort of You know this what we're talking about this kind of lube arlo music that's like radical honesty. It makes us feel better But that has not Helped to slow the entire industry That sells what you're talking about this comfort to people Um, and you talk to people all the time, you know, I was just on the plane from Geneva and Everyone around me. I kind of like to look around and see what other movies people have chosen just to see if I like made the best choice and It was just adult men All around me watching like Avengers and superhero movies and they were all fucking on the edge of their seat just like Yeah, you know explosions and and like no matter how much we You're saying it doesn't help people or whatever, you know this industry It's that That industry rages on and will rage on till the end of earth and You know I have a hard time believing it. It's even happening because I live like you, you know, I don't really Go out much. I don't have a huge friend group and I'm On my own most of the time. So when someone says something Crazy idiotic like some crazy western Idolatry shit, you know I'm like shocked like I'm super fucking shocked when like Here's like a little example. It's like My grandma died recently and my mom Was going on about how Insane it is to cremate people How disgusting it is or something and how like the only like sensible option is to put them in the ground Yeah And I'm just I'm just saying like there people say stuff to you And you realize oh my god, like The world is obsessed with arbitrary bullshit. You know, that's like a shocking moment. I'm like What makes putting them in the ground better? I just don't get it. I can't Find a thread a tether Inside my brain that can even see where you're coming from, you know, I just don't know what the fuck you're talking about Is that does that make me an asshole? No But even listen to some people maybe but who cares it's like even you're not an act like the this is the concept of Making friends with yourself And you know, I know when I'm like when I'm like Being a bad friend usually One of the signs is I'm trying to fix my friend And I've fallen into that trap so many times Where I realized I'm like, oh my god, I'm gonna I'm you know, I'm gonna be the one that heals you my friend You say, oh, okay. I hear I hear I hear what's up. I once was like you now. Let me tell you what I did I've done that so many times. It's so fucked up Even and I know that and I've seen the look on my friend's face. Maybe you're for sure I'm sure I've tried to fix you a few times and the look I've seen is one of like Usually like boredom makes Dan with like And then so similarly like the moment I take on that relationship with my own life my own identity or whatever man It's like that's not really friendship to me this new fucking like thing is like, oh my god Right in front of the rugged country Outback whatever you want to call it of my own Interior universe Is it fucking Coachella? filled with booths and tents within which are all of the prescribed methods for Dealing with my Turbulent self And I got stuck in so many of them It in and some and they're awesome of them are awesome But at some point you're like wait, what's on the other side of this fucking stupid ass self-improvement festival? And you look and it's just a bunch of fucking rocks Yeah, and you go into the rocks And you're like see guys. I don't know man. Maybe I'll come back at some point to your festival Now I'm gonna go down in these fucking rocks. There's coyotes We don't know what's out there You're gonna yeah, are you all right? It's like the Logan's run thing Yeah, where they where they break out and they go into the actual biosphere of the earth and it's so Like it's way too much for them. It's actually hot. It's actually rough There's actual sand in your shoes and they're just like not prepared for it anymore. Yeah What a great feeling To finally touch the ground and like to finally be like, oh my god I don't have to put a fucking mask on my suffering And also my suffering doesn't mean I'm malfunctioning and also I don't have to like do an explanation to you about how no I'm not actually going to commit suicide You know, I'm not I was telling this from friends the other day talking about suicidal ideations because my theory is if you exist on the planet and at some point or another You haven't contemplated suicide. I would say you're probably anomalous now. I could be wrong about that I just might be a depressed motherfucker But right away. It was a triggering thing and people were like, are you all right? and I'm like I'm fine because I'm not hiding the fact that sometimes I have suicidal ideations And and and and and that like those thought patterns when they emerge in me They don't fucking terrify me anymore. I I don't feel and a lot of people I think are having to step that shit down And I don't think it's good. It's like it's okay, man The bats are gonna fly up out of you now Anyway, I don't mean to be irresponsible by the way It's like you must certainly you're in charge of your own life and you have to get help if that shit's happening curse, you know if you but what I'm saying is We the more you broaden the scope to allow The secret spaces of yourself to take up your attention, you know what I mean What a joy What a joy to not compartmentalize yourself down into this fucking coca-cola land I don't even know what I'm talking about. It seems like you you're just saying to them That fire over there is hot and they're like Oh, no, don't say that. You're like, I'm no I'm just saying the fire's gonna burn you dude. Yeah, you know Yeah, you weren't you weren't even complaining. You're just being descriptive, you know in a way Yeah, these thoughts flow through my brain. Whatever. Yeah Any thought flows through and also the thoughts that flow through your fucking brain. You're not the You're not the architect of the thoughts, right? It's not like that time the thought, you know, I don't know if you ever had any like crazy OCD thoughts like I remember like I'm gonna throw this fucking water in that baby's face You know what I mean? Like you're out to eat. You're like Amazing moment. You see your ice water right there in front of you. You see the baby Or you think am I gonna throw this water? Yeah. Am I going to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah Who's what is what are what are the boundaries in between? My hand right exactly green for but see that's kind of sane That's kind of sane to ask that, you know It sounds insane, but it's kind of sane to just wonder, you know Am I in control? What will happen next? I don't know what will happen next. Yeah You know what a joy. Yeah that and that to me is like So the that's where you land sometimes and I don't land there all the fucking time But that place where you don't know what's happening next I've had it a few times man. It's like once I was sitting out meditating And it that happened Where somehow just for a brief second My simulator mind wasn't prognosticating what was going to happen in the next moment So that for one weird moment Everything was completely New It was wow It was like holy shit. This is new now This is like it wasn't even that because it was just like there wasn't this extra Well, then that's gonna happen and that's gonna happen and then that's gonna happen In this space or whatever you want to call it that place that you can land in where you're not planning anymore You're not planning. You're not You're not nostradomacing. Sure. You're not prognosticating. You're not like You're not you're not writing the script and trying to make it real or whatever, you know, yeah trying to push the world into some Shape Deserting Squeezing manifesting destiny or something. Yeah, that whole fucking thing. Yeah, the release from that Give up No, I love it. You know, whenever I when I finally sort of came upon the hopelessness principle Which has caused a lot of controversy In my own life when I mention it and I I don't want to like I feel bad talking about it because I could see why it seems Really depressed What does it come from? Trumpa that phrase Just like it's hopeless There's other versions of it. It's already broken One of the best think pieces I just read Was somebody wrote I care. I wish I knew their name apologize If any if you the author of this fucking think piece list is this podcast, which I doubt but Some something on the lines of like, oh, actually, there's some possibility. We're just information stuck in a black hole That's eternally echoing that we really aren't real We haven't been real for billions of trillions and trillions of years in that sense of like unreality is an actual like Cognitive we're rocking Are that we're just essentially shadows And that we're just on loop Uh All these things When you hear them if you really are attached to your project They sound So depressing Sure So fucked up Bhagavad Gita, were you in that spirituality class when we were doing the Bhagavad Gita? Someone who in it got so mad. It was Jeannie Matthews. I remember she's like I want to be attached That's amazing. I don't want to be withdrawn. I don't want I want to be I want to I want to like what's happening. That's fucking amazing Because I think it was the line a wise person is not distressed by the impermanent appearance of happiness and distress for these things come and go Like the seasons or something like that And someone was like, no, I'm gonna be disturbed Well, yeah, whether you want to or not you're probably gonna be so good luck with that one No, shit Don't worry You're gonna be disturbed You don't have anything to worry about Yeah, it's like when you go to the gym and you're like, oh boy, I hope I don't get too muscular You know what I mean like I used to do that go to the gym be like fuck man. I mean, I hope I don't get too ripped Don't worry. You're in no danger But you know to me, there's also the thing Ram Dass says which I do like which is like we do have to honor our incarnation We are here as the you with the social security number And the family and the job and the talents and the connections and the community and the whole shebang And you need to honor that Even if you are some fucking shadow a flickering shadowy Fucking static bit of data getting spaghettified in a goddamn black hole. You know what you could do You could honor The thing that you're the shadow of You know, you could honor whatever this little little sweet You could actually do the same thing not to condescend all of reality But you know a kid gives you a fucking beautiful drawing And you go this is nice. Thank you You know, even though it's like I wouldn't you ain't no fucking van go but In the same way like god comes and presents you with an entire universe Within what you have an identity Even though you get to the point you're like on you know I'm pretty sure this is just a drawing You could still be like good job It's nice. Thank you I was I was just telling you this in the car But so I was just in portugal and I went up into the mountains of centra And it's like where they've shot certain kinds of movies. Like it's one of the most Crazy-looking places in the world with as you spiral up the mountain. It's more and more fortresses. Wow. It's it's really Really unique and really amazing. I I I really want to recommend That some some at some point you go to centra of portugal and you go you go up there and and on the way I guess it's where you know just for some sort of point of reference even though this is stupid It's like where johnny dup shut that ninth gate movie or something Fuck, okay, cool. So it's a way up there and it just has this intrinsic kind of occult power radiating as you spiral up just because the the fortresses and the Sort of royal castles are all built with just kind of bizarre beautiful architecture that seems to communicate some sort of Sort of lost mystical knowledge or something. It's just the way it looks, you know, I'm not advertising for it It just feels pretty amazing and so I'm in this rickshaw that we had hired and we're like Pause for commercial pause on rickshaw. Hold on Ouch. Um, sorry man. You deserved it. So wait, you're going up this hp. Lovecraft style You're into the mountains. Totally seeing these incredible structures. You're an actual rickshaw. Yeah, this the point is is I'm not Exaggerating and trying to sell you on some fantastic story. It's really This fucking cool and this is a huge part of my point, right? So I'm in this place that you'd normally just read about in a book, right? In your suburb of cleveland or something and you dream about it, right? But I'm really there so You know, I have to interpret How magical is this, you know? And so I go in to This masonic castle. She the the girl in the rickshaw driver the girl in the rickshaw Is like spinning us around a corner and she's like She's like this castle here is one of the coolest places you can go see it's built by mason's and She clearly didn't know that much about it, but she sold us on the esoteric A call aspect. So do you remember the name of the castle? I've seen it. I've looked at pictures of it I saw your instagram of it. Yeah. Yeah It's called kinted day regalia. Okay. Okay. So that was we should probably just delete all that Because because of my pronunciation Um, maybe but so So, okay. So then we we decide, okay. Yeah, this is we should give our day to seeing this place because this is clearly like one of the best things up on the spout and we could see and we go in and and pay the Pay the fee and and basically start walking through all the underground tunnel ways that all connect throughout the entire property And each one connects to different initiation wells and each Um, what's an initiation? Well, well, that's a great question What the fuck is an initiation? Well, and there's a certain amount of steps that lead down with a certain amount of floors That all have to do with Rosicrucian mathematics and it all relates to you know High-level masonry and I'm not saying to you listen how fantastic this is. I'm just merely describing. Yeah, this place is Probably the best picture of what a super super wealthy Genius would build as a place to live and he chose the perfect spot, right? And he he builds it out with total care and synthesizes all of the greatest points of every religion and philosophy into statues and gardens and waterfalls and builds Truly a planet for himself to exist in And as I'm walking around at first I'm thinking wow, what kind of stuff went on here because The the movie aspect of of your mind wants to picture Something secretive, you know, you've been told there's this is this occult getaway. Yeah, so I was trying to place the history and the timeline drawn the turn of the century It's right right around Alistair Carly's visit to Portugal. It's it's which was I think 1930 and so it's right in this particular time where the People like you and I would would have really like flourished as a community Like people would have really been coming together all over the world and celebrating occult knowledge. Yeah, that's what they were doing and so Um, this would have been a gathering point, you know, this this house this manner with I don't know how many acres it is but let's say it's like 30 and It's built into this ultimate Uh garden a celebration of occult knowledge so at first I'm walking through it and just sort of reveling in the ideas of semi insidious things, you know what I mean like Why do you have initiation wells? Why do you have underground tunnels? You know And then by the end of the trip, you know after reading enough About who the guy was this millionaire that was like one of this world class entomologists and botanists all these things watchmaker and inventor by the end of the trip I really Grasp that this was just a guy you know and he didn't have anything better to do and It that was an important realization for me but one I grapple with and is it symbolizes a lot for me because Throughout our lives we're always looking for The next ornamentation, you know the next level of sense gratification Yeah, or the next better lover or anything better car bigger house whatever Super cliche ideas, but we are always Searching to trade out what we had before because the pendulum just swings. That's just what happens. Yeah, we want to try the other thing and It was so cool to walk on that property and say No, this is a final resting place someone designed Out of a positive place in themselves There's no nefarious things really going on here. There's nothing particularly central or Insidious about like this as a as a as a meeting point for like international Diamond thieves or any any story that your mind wants to cook a mollock worshipers. Yeah, child sacrifice Yeah, see that stuff that whole child sacrifice island idea is Is symptomatic of A modern community that has gone so far into thinking they live inside a batman movie or something and Clearly they need that kind of entertainment But i'm talking about getting to a place where you don't need That excitement, but you see things plainly, you know and and this guy Built this synthesis of these religions and philosophies just merely because it was his His common interest. It was just a very Basic interest. There was no great ambition He just had a lot of fucking money But i love the idea that it's just what he did with it You could stare at it and just say This is what he did with his life when he could have done anything And that's a really cool idea and it's part of the buddha story is that You begin in the castle You see what i'm saying? Oh, yeah, you don't work your way up to the castle But i like this story because you begin in the castle. So you have everything first Right and so then you can do Anything you want and that's a totally different kind of challenge than the basic challenge We talk about trying to climb them out You know and part of the way the brain works is that There's always going to be an inherent massive challenge No matter who you are no matter what you are you'll never avoid pain You know all this idea in capitalism is if you could you could avoid pain And it's worth being jealous of the people who can avoid it and it's better, you know to be a wealthy White man or whatever. Well, it doesn't look that great to me, but so It's fascinating to look at someone who just Put everything In the universe that they could This this guy is supposed to be a genius So I guess there's part of this idea that you're you're walking into a dimension That was truly created With everything at someone's fingertips and so you say What is this thing that he has? well What he has It's really no different than anything else It's just a fucking garden. Yeah, you know and that is so beautiful. It's like this philosophy that I Have kind of stumbled onto that I call four walls It just means no matter where you go in your life in this universe. You will always just be Sitting in four walls. You'll never transcend it You'll never fuck more than one person at a time really you'll never drive one car more than one car at a time You'll never really achieve Anything beyond what you have right now. You know what I mean? So it was so cool to see someone who sort of I feel like he knew that and he built this place To basically Celebrate that there's nothing of course. It's over the top of course. There's like weird paintings of like a howling boar like symbolically like you know like clenching onto a heart on the floor and then like hunting dogs Built into gargoyles. You know, it probably all means something but it's nothing that is That obscure Or unattainable. It's just you know, you're gonna have to have A gargoyle maybe like that's what people did at the time So you so you design it in this respect or that you know, whatever and you're supposed to look up at these things generally and you're supposed to uh Hold them in some sort of unattainable regard the pyramids, right? Yeah, you're supposed to think cathedrals I'll never I'll never make anything like that. I remember when I was a kid Actually, maybe like 20 years ago when I started playing live saying something about Hendrix or something and and one of my bandmates saying like, you know Don't compare anything to that Don't don't try to understand the greatest thing of all time And I just it's just like well Why I mean, he's just like us, you know, it's totally accessible. It's there all the time. Yeah, you can become it It's not a pyramid in the distance, you know I just there was something Multi-tiered about walking around that property and just saying this is it. This is as good as you can have and it's still the same thing I love the idea that buddhism starts off in a castle And another important point is that you Actually, don't just walk out of the castle buddha escaped from the castle He had to like sneak out. He had to get out And I love in this case. I think if I'm understanding what you're saying The castle is built of all the things you think are better than you unattainable All the constructions of the dream It's made of illusion the castle is made of all the ideas you had of some perfected fucking state And you got to figure out a way to sneak out of there How to like get out And then and then and then weirdly the moment you do that and you hit your first bush You hit your first wild spot. It's a million times better than that fucking Throne you were sitting in or whatever it was or is that what you're saying? Am I understanding you right? Yeah, I mean I think I walked into it thinking This is the opulent um Sculpture built to represent this and that but by the end of the sort of tour of walking around it Which took, you know a couple hours But like it was so complex so complex And you know I love prospect park and and all these kind of huge things where you can Wander around and sort of contemplate like this and they're larger than life and you you can easily recommend you know you need to go there, you know, but Something about the at the end of that tour at the end of seeing all of it. I just felt like This guy did actually kind of get it right like like as much as material You could see the cycle of like like material wealth and everything being something that you spent so much time to acquire I didn't feel that I felt like he was just needed the place to exist You know and why not have underground tunnels? Why not? They're just inherently beautiful I mean look at what people do in fucking Minecraft. It's like the ornate quality and i'm not trying to reduce I'm just saying if you have infinite resources and the ability to burrow You make crazy shit. You take that into a digital world. You could see what people do. They do the most insane things It's like it sounds like this person used the opportunity to take the what would you call it? They'll like This the part of the dream he was living in And carved within that part of the dream his journey of awakening or whatever exactly? Yeah, it sits there So other people during their dreams come into it and maybe there is some benefit to it I mean it sounds like the distillation of his lifetime of studying these Secrets has appeared in your head like it that place acted like a seed that grew In in a grew inside of you to produce this four walls the concept this idea of like um This is it right right. It's like he accepted the four walls. I felt that See what I'm saying? Yeah, it's like he wasn't trying to transcend the four walls and yeah, I see what you're saying. I was just in Zurich and I was subtly A little bummed that I couldn't go see carly young's house because it's privately owned and they don't let you go see anymore If they ever did I can't remember but he has the famous tower that he built and then expanded on and it's right by the lake Where he would kind of play in the sand and and he has the tower where the inside is painted With all the levels of the unconscious that he you know determined. Yeah, and It was the most a massive amount I was looking at pictures of it the the most massive amount of like firewood. I've ever seen And there's all these great pictures of him just contemplating life like looking out into the water if you look it up online and sitting in these stone towers with you know, kind of tending the fireplace and It's a very simple reality, right and I was I was talking to some swiss people while I was up there and Asking them about their culture and they were saying it's it's kind of a basic tenant. It's a basic hallmark that Simplicity Can't really be escaped right that once you get out up into those alps And you get inside a little shack things are really simply laid out, you know, you just get some firewood. Yeah, and your sauna and your bed and You know not much else. Maybe they you know make some Mountain homemade cheese up there and beer. Yeah, but you know, whatever, you know You're just it's just you and the motherfucking mountains And god, you know, that's it. Yeah, and there's something about That I just feel this connection with the alps or I feel a connection with with Probably young is like what informs it but like just the idea of this Returning to the simplicity But having like beautiful things around you that the dichotomy of that. That's what I saw in in this guy's mansion, and and I thought that he honored You know all the money that he had he just spin it just you know kind of recreational way But it made a beautiful reality. I'm I mean, I'm not trying to like say some like Whatever Gwyneth Paltrow magazine reality really is the answer But I'm just saying that I think that in the end That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a way to make those four walls Have a bit of like Make them make myself feel like They're beautiful enough that I can just actually let myself relax. I don't need to keep looking You know what I mean? Yeah, man. I just want to kick back in my fucking rocking chair Which I've never let myself do you know Yeah That this is the end of the day Relaxation thing that people will try to it's like This is my the podcast I do with my mom. She's passing. She was talking about how it's all contraction and release building up energy releasing the energy right and like The release of the energy people have begun to imagine is the relaxation So it's like to produce the state of you have to keep get all this tension going Definitely, that's the mountain you get to the top of the mountain finally you give yourself permission to go but the That's you that actually is your soul. That's called fundamental goodness That's the reality of everything you've produced a when you basically the four you build around that place a structure That produces a window that looks out at it that every day once a day you let yourself go look out there and go Instead of walking the fuck out Into it itself, but people don't want to deal with that man because oh my god What are we gonna fucking do if we suddenly have everything if this is it if this is all we got if this is the whole This is it The whole game's fucked now. It's the cheat code of cheat codes You've ruined the video game What am I gonna do man Now that there's no more levels And people that's very unappealing to some people that simplicity People don't want a little sauna up in the mountains or a fucking massive masonic lodge Right, they want trouble They want struggle without the struggle. They can't have their release Well, maybe you know like ken wilber says like Maybe that that's just what they're embroiled with at this time. And that's just what seems true right now You know if someone's listening to this podcast the whole time we've been doing it. I just keep thinking You know, maybe there's somebody just covered in Friar grease that's like having the worst day of their life, you know In the back of a wendy's and they've got headphones on they're listening to this and they're like these two privileged idiots Yeah, like talking about like finally making it to the top of the mountain or some shit Which is not what we're saying, but um I just think maybe maybe it's just that that's that's the moment of the day Like we said before that they are in that moment of the day and that's okay And then it'll it'll pass but maybe it maybe I'm not sure if what we're talking about is something that we are hyper Obsessed with or if this is like is this a common theme that other people care about, you know Because I don't see this reflected like you like you're saying like like the world spins around on films based on Struggle a different kind of eight mile a different kind of hollywood story, you know Yeah, it's you're saying there wouldn't be a movie made about just Not having to do anything and just staying in the four walls. Well, you never hear this commercial Hey, what's up? Ford That you know here's don't try if you look at this truck You might notice that this truck is basically the same as all the other trucks you've seen We added some pain or something. What do we do? It's got better bluetooth kind of right, but it's pretty much It also just so you know, you're gonna get in this truck And you're gonna have about a week of excitement and then it's just gonna be another truck That's like if a guy hit on you at a bar and said like Really, I've got nothing special here. You're just seeing like the eternal Version of a common human being and like I've got nothing that you should really bookmark Any more than anyone else. Yeah, and then and then also the other thing is like You you're never gonna hear like Uh, yeah owning property or whatever when you own your own home or whatever like that You're it's nothing changes. You're just gonna have this sense of like responsibility That's gonna be I guess it's a good investment or something but also just so you know, here's something really fucked up Here's something really fucked up Drink tea like if you pour water in a cup and it's hot And you like add a good tea bag in there. Sometimes that will be the best moment of your day And it costs two cents. Right. Right. Also another problem is that like I have been covered in fucking grease Washing dishes at a chili's and have had transcendent moments there And then also now with my baby. I've I'm thwarted every single day With facing the fact that sitting in the fucking bathtub with him watching him stick his hand in water is more transcendentally Holy Than any place I've ever been in my fucking life And then I'm thwarted with that because it's like, oh my god. I've just got to admit it all that other shit wasn't much All the mushrooms all the acid all the fucking psychedelic missionary work They were great But how the fuck are we gonna do better than what this is? And it's like to me that is a very very revolutionary and counter Culture idea in the sense that the whole goddamn machine that we're in right now depends on the illusion of an end of the day A spot of rest a place where you go shush the grand accumulation of all the thing and the finally you get the fucking final Voltron thing or whatever it is and and and then When you get to that when if everyone suddenly there was a grand realization Where people are like, I don't really want it Really minute though. I don't want the truck I don't really want to be in a mansion. I don't want the thing. I'm a jig. I don't really want it Really a grand but not bullshit fake thing because right now I do fucking want it I want to expand my urac. I want to get in shape I will grow my if there was if I could grow my if I could I would take pills to make my dick bigger And I would take pills to grow my hair back on the top of my head And I you know what I mean like I want it But if suddenly there was a thing where we're all just like no No And people people just started walking out of their estates You can have it It would fuck it all up There would be like a few assholes like bankers. There'd be some bankers like wait No You need wait No, don't give this away. But they but what if they were enlightened too though? Well, you didn't how are we gonna enjoy it? I need a couple of bankers standing on top of Bank of America screaming at all of us as we walk into our mystical nonsense mountain I get struck to being like no, you need good credit It's true That is a kind of nightmare like waking up and if the world was totally wildly intelligent You didn't feel like you had any Sort of ego edge on it. Yeah, that's like a kind of nightmare nightmare. Yeah, that's what I'm talking But that's what we are clinging to that's what we're clinging to the hedge We all want to have our special flair. Yeah, nobody wants to you watch A bird do a mating dance and it's the funniest shit you've ever seen Raises the feather it puts the stone It does three spins if you look at the thing you're like you fucking ass. It's hilarious. It's cute. You're like, oh my god The bowerbird. It's adorable Meanwhile, you're me. You're fucking mating dance It's some serious shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you not understand my legacy? You're just flopping around with your feathers and your beak. Yeah, it is a nightmare. I want my ass And that's the last thing you have to give up if you want to hang out with Jesus You have to give up your edge You have to give it up You're not special and that's great Anyway, I think we're late for our fucking orgy like we're about to go to some Anyway, man, let's get out of here. We've got it. We've got dinner reservations. Um We're gonna be late for I'm trying to think of something fancy They're going to bad bad ending to the podcast I guess that's you think that's where they got coming to America is like they stole Eddie Murphy stole the Buddha story Remember it begins and he tells his dad stop carrying rose petals in front of me Yes, people are like so shocked and then he like wants to go to queens and he wants to slum it and he finds like an enlightenment there Yeah, well, I mean there there's a I'm gonna end on this story and I don't mean to end on my own goddamn story. I'm sorry I like it. This is a story Bob Thurman told at one of these Ram Dass retreats. It's really stuck with me about the Buddha And and I think it applies to what we're talking about So apparently in the mythology of the Buddha pre-realization The Buddha manages to actually project To Indra's castle I believe it's Indra And Indra's hanging out with all the gods And they're in a meeting or some shit, but basically the way Thurman tells the story is Buddha shows up Because he wants to talk to Indra about easing the suffering of the world And Indra's like basically he's like, hey, you don't have an appointment. You know, what are you doing here? You're in the middle of something we'll talk And so then Buddha's back under the bodhi tree meditating and all of a sudden Indra appears And he's like god, sorry about that. Here's the thing You want to know how to end the suffering of the world, but I need to tell you something about me first Because people think I'm the king of the gods or that I created the gods or whatever Maybe it's Brahman. I don't know which god it is Progen- the original god. He's like Just so you know, I was just here first I don't know what any of this shit is And these other gods they came later. So they think I'm their daddy and I'm letting them believe that But I was hoping you could figure out How to ease the suffering of the world because I don't know This is the ultimate disillusionment You run into god and god's like, I didn't make it. Yeah, I don't know I don't know. Can you figure it out because I don't know That's the great moment. I think is finally Coming to that place personally There's no help for you No one's coming to your rescue But really seeing that like really being out on the castaway island and really knowing no helicopter is coming like really understanding that Instead of like kind of holding your breath You're not gonna you know the fantasy you're when you die. You're gonna see your mom again No Yeah, that's shit. You know what? I mean, you're you're not going to get better than this That place that is a place where you can build A new castle That's a foundation. I think that you can actually start building a thing upon instead of trying to make Build one of these fucking masonic god damn castles on your fucking bathtub fart bubble It just isn't gonna work and that's the most profound thing. I can think right now. Yeah, you can decorate your four walls You know with fake imagery of this ever extending like wheat field, you know It doesn't change the fact that they're just still sitting there right there in front of you the containing you, you know So I was kind of picturing a way you could Decorate the four walls that admits Them but but celebrates them, you know like that somehow turns the four walls into a state of freedom, you know That's going to be the next podcast. We do determining how to like Find freedom within the four walls of whatever the particular Imaginary limitations are I mean, maybe there's something more horrifying than the four walls, which is they're not even there But I don't know it's a longer conversation And if any of you heard my baby screaming I got to go relieve my wife of baby duty because she just drove from Santa Monica with a screaming child And that's the what's on my wall right now I love you, man. These conversations we have I hope we do make it another 40 or 50 years so we can keep having them, you know And and uh, and I don't know what's gonna happen during that time wait you're You're banned. You're great. The grails are oh, yeah. Yeah, we play was it What'd I say monday night in LA? Yeah. Yeah, you can look on zebulon. Yeah, you can look on grails facebook to get the dates You're gonna be at zebulon. Mm-hmm, and I'm gonna be there. Okay. Let's party if I can make it I might be late to the show, but I'm coming.

239^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 565: Rainn Wilson Transcript and Discussion^2023-05-13^Greetings, pals. We have an incredible episode for you today. Rainn Wilson is here with us to talk about his new book, and this has got to be one of my top three favorite DDFH episodes of all time, so I'm sure you will enjoy it. Strap in. What a brilliant, funny guy. Before we get going, though, I have to tell you a story, and it's really a gross story, and it's not very exciting, but I think a lot of you might have registered for a fun live stream I was going to do with David Nickturn, David from the Midnight Gospel, and we were going to talk about artificial intelligence and Buddhism, and it was going to be great, but here's what happened. And I'm not placing blame anywhere. Ultimately, you know, to quote the Lozong aphorism, drive all blames into oneself, and so I have been trying to get back into exercising, and I got myself to the gym. Now, the way I do this is really lame. It's so lame. David Goggins could write, like, mini paragraphs insulting me for having to do this, but I trick myself. I tell my body, we're going to get a milkshake. We're going to get a protein shake before the workout, and somehow that just works. So I get this protein shake, and I drink it, and within six minutes, I just have to puke. Now, I don't know if it was a protein shake. Could have been an allergy. Usually, food poisoning doesn't come on that fast, so I don't know if that's what it was, but I just, I drove home and just purged, as they say. Just blew demons out. Just protein, fucking milkshake sprays. My stomach was just rolling. I looked instantly horrific. I mean, I'm not saying like I'm a vision of perfect health or anything like that, but it looked like I had been smashed in the head with an unholy, cursed mace, just gray, drained, like, Lord of the Rings. I look like I'd been wearing the ring too long, but I still got to the studio. I set my computer up, and then my wonderful wife just pointed out, like, you've been puking, Duncan, you can't do it. You're going to have to cancel. So I had to cancel, in the most lame way possible, 30 minutes before the event, so I apologize to you for that if you had registered, but we are doing it again next week. So that's going to be on Tuesday, just as exact same time as it's going to be this week, and all the links you need to find that will be at DuncanTrustle.com. It's going to be a fun conversation. I mean, are we really going to get anywhere? Is there anywhere to get? I don't know, but David is so brilliant when it comes to talking about Buddhism, meditation, consciousness, and I'm infatuated and obsessed in an unhealthy way with AI. So I think it's going to make a wonderful conversation, and I hope you'll sign up. It's free, and you can find the links at DuncanTrustle.com. Also, I'm going to be at Copper Blues Live in Phoenix, Arizona, June 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. And I hope you will come see me. There's tickets available. You can find them at DuncanTrustle.com, then June 15th, Dania Improv, Dania Beach, Florida, June 15th, 16th, 17th, all those tickets are at DuncanTrustle.com. Finally, you can get commercial-free episodes of this podcast by going to patreon.com slash DTFH and signing up. And if you want to spend a little bit of extra time with me and your family, subscribe to a higher tier, and you can join us every week for a meditation and a family gathering. All those links at DuncanTrustle.com. Okay, friends, here we go. Today's guest, Rainn Wilson, also known as my new best friend, has a book out. It's called Soul Boom and Why We Need a Spiritual Revolution. You can get this anywhere. Try to get it. This is according to Rainn's wishes at a small bookstore first. But if you can't find that, go to amazon.com and you will find it there. This guy is awesome. I know you all know this. I know he's got a rabid fandom, but getting a chance to just hang out with him for an hour was so fun. I was crying with laughter. He's the best. So here we go. Everybody, strap in. Get ready to welcome to the DTFH, the brilliant Rainn Wilson. You are with us, shake hands, going to the moon. Welcome to you. Right above my head is Trump the Game. I see it. And I haven't played it. Do you ever come to Los Angeles? Do you want to play Trump the Game with me? I would love to play Trump the Game. Do you get to play Trump? Or are you all over here? Let's find out. What are you? This is not an ironic game. This game from just the flash of the box. Oh yeah, this is serious. It's not whether you win or lose. It's whether you win. It's got his fascinating signature, which definitely has more. Have you ever studied his signature? Look at the letters in his name, and then look at that signature, and there you will find the Da Vinci code. I feel like he worked with a calligrapher. I say, I need a more powerful signature. I don't want this little scribble pigeon scribble. Help me come up with the perfect signature. You know what it looks like? It actually looks like an EKG of someone on a shit ton of air crawl. It does. It is. It is absolutely. It's someone about to flatline. It's when they use the paddles, and it's in a, I forget what it's called, and then they're about to hit a flatline. Here's a quick guide. I don't have time to read this, Duncan. Okay. Yeah, we, yeah, forget that. And people are listening. People, I feel bad for the podcasters listening on the, just on the audio. Here's a nice close-up of the signature in purple. Wow. Look at that. Incredible. You've got an X in there. It looks like Sanskrit. It's a combo Sanskrit, but you will notice it's got the Star Trek symbol at the very end. It does kind of. Well, there's, here's the board. Yeah, it looks like Monopoly. It's Monopoly. It's Monopoly. Is this Monopoly? He just stole Monopoly. He was just like, somebody was like, we should make a game. He stole Monopoly and called it his own. Do Monopoly. I don't have time for this shit. Just replace the squares. Yeah. Well, what a great lead-in to talking about your book and everything else. I mean, obviously your book is more you about you than anything, but I sure love this idea of the spiritual revolution. And it's something I have contemplated. Anyone who has, you know, gained, I don't know. There's no non-cheesy way to talk about this. And in other interviews that you did about your book, I really appreciate your honesty about how talking about God is so uncool. You know, doing it on stage as a stand-up comic, figuring out how to do that is so fun. But you really are going to offend the audience. I mean, if like, you know, if I talk about Satan, which I sometimes do, that's far more accepted than talking about Jesus, you know, and this is in the zeitgeist. So for you, a revered comic, a revered actor, to write a book about a spiritual revolution, that takes guts. That's, thank you. Were you contemplating other books before you decided on this one? You know, I did my ubiquitous comedic memoir about six or seven years ago called The Bassoon King, My Life in Art, Faith and Idiosy. And that's mostly like funny stories from my life and what it was like growing up nerdy and playing the bassoon and moving to New York City and becoming an actor and getting on the office. And throughout that book, I kind of wove my spiritual journey. So because I thought, well, I'll hide the broccoli, you know, in the s'mores of my life. So there was some broccoli hidden in there. And it was mostly funny. And it was about 10 or 15% about a spiritual journey. And then I guess Duncan, for me, and maybe this kind of goes with like, maybe it just goes with the wealth. Like, oh, I'm a rich sitcom actor. I already had my like hit show. I still get to do some acting here and there. But part of me was just like, fuck it, man. Like, this stuff is really important to me. It's really important to my heart. Personally, it drives my daily life. And also, I really think it's fucking important for humanity and the earth. And so people are going to judge me. And Judd Apatow is going to think I'm an idiot. And Sarah Silverman is going to roll her eyes. And Hollywood is going to collectively be like, oh, that weird guy who played Dwight, the beat farmers talking about God, what a loony. And at the same time, like, okay, that's fine. God bless you. I love you all. I'm moving on. I want to make the world a better place. And it's super, super uncool. But I'm in it to win it, Duncan. That's it. At some point, you get there. I mean, is that enlightenment? It might be age. You know, I'm 57. You know, you're right. Okay, I got to stop trying to attach my age to enlightenment. It's the laziest way to claim enlightenment. But it's true. But it's true that, you know, you gain a certain wisdom and you just stop caring as much because Duncan, I cared what people thought about me for so many decades of my life. I wanted people to like me and approve of me and think I was cool and think I was funny and give me jobs and just and get a higher social status. And that has really been fading over the last five to 10 years in great regard. And it has given me a tremendous freedom. And I love it because I lived as a slave to people pleasing and what people thought of me and to as weird as it sounds as nerdy as I was in high school. And there was none nerdier than me. At one point in time, I was on Model United Nations. I played xylophone in the marching band. I played Dungeons and Dragons on the weekend. I was on the chess club, chess team, and the computer club all at the same time. Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah. And so obviously, I didn't really care about popularity too much when I was 16. But then I spent my adult, you know, years just really, really caring. And now I care much littler. Maybe it's just age. I hope there's a little bit of enlightenment. Maybe it's just the fact that I have money in the bank. And if I didn't have money in the bank, I'd be like, oh, shit, I really need another TV show. I better not talk about God. I don't know, man. Thank you for admitting that. When you have money in the bank, it's really any sweeping statement you make. You have to at least know everyone's thinking, yeah, you've got shit tons of money in the bank. Like if, you know, if, if I'm trying to think, yeah, if Jesus Christ, who I guess you could say was something of a trust fund kid, had tons of, I don't know what kind of money they were using back then, in the bank, would the sermon of the Mount hit as hard? Yeah. If he was, if he was from a wealthy family and said, oh, sure, it's easy for you. And it's interesting too, like in his book about Jesus, called Zellet, Reza Aslan says that book. Yeah, brilliant book. And but he talks about how Jesus wasn't a carpenter. There's no carpenter. The word that is used in the ancient Greek and the Bible for him work being a worker is essentially day laborer. It's just like hauling bricks, build just kind of a low level builder. And, and of course, it was translated to carpenter because a carpenter is such a, it's a, it's a fancy lovely term for shaping things out of wood. Yes. Yes. And as opposed to day laborer, but yeah, he was a day laborer. He was, so he was saying, hey, love everyone, give up your wealth, wander around, teach the gospel, serve the poor, you know, hug people different from you, accept everyone, you know, God loves everyone. It's, it's easier to accept when he's poor. So here I am a rich, semi retired sitcom actor telling people to start a spiritual revolution. There's a collective eye roll of, yeah, oh, sure, rain. Sit back in your elitist Hollywood mansion. No way. Listen, the only way that that comes across is if your book sucked, if your book wasn't down to earth, if your book wasn't, it's when, I think it's when those two things like one side of the coin, the spiritual, whatever the message is coming from them, doesn't have a grounded quality where it's a proclamation for lots of people to follow some ridiculous idea that will never work. That's not really grounded. Your, your book is grounded, your attitude towards spirituality is grounded. So I don't know. I think if people aren't capable of seeing past someone's job into their philosophy, that's more on them than the person they're reading. It's such an easy way. Hell yeah. Thanks for being on the show. Well, look, I want to, okay, so I want to dive into something that's been on my mind lately, and maybe I'm completely wrong in it, but in your awesome NPR interview, they asked a question to see sacredness in the everyday means purging yourself of cynicism, doesn't, doesn't it, which is sort of the social, social curate, currency of the moment, it seems. And I wondered, I guess I'm literally stealing from NPR right now, but would you mind re-answering that question because I want to talk to you about cynicism. Yeah. So, and so the book is about a lot of things. Oh, look, I just happened to have a copy right here. I talk about death. I talk about the soul. I talk about consciousness. I talk about, I have a chapter on God called the notorious God. And at the end of the book, I have seven pillars for a spiritual revolution, because I had ended the book and I realized like, oh, I need to, it's too depressing. And it's all about how things are not working and failing and falling apart. You know, what, what, what's the takeaway here? What can, what can I give people that will uplift them and are some handholds to creating a spiritual revolution? And I have a section there which is foster joy and squash cynicism. So the story I told an NPR that I'm going to retell here and I'm going to tell it better. How's that Duncan? Love it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. So I had an amazing acting teacher named Andre Gregory. And if you have you seen my dinner with Andre? Yes. Yes. A long time ago. I will admit I didn't finish it. Okay. You got to finish it. It's so good and rewatch it. It's really worth diving into. So for those who don't know, it was from 1979. And this is like when Star Wars came out, right? And it was a movie of two people having dinner and having a conversation, the entire movie, 90 some minutes of just two people talking. It's brilliant. So that guy Andre Gregory also did acting teaching. And I was in a workshop of his for about a month. And he would meet with his acting students. And so I went to his beautiful West Village apartment in New York City to meet with him. And he was like, wow, rain. How are you doing? Like, what's on your mind? And I said, Andre, like, I'm just really down. I'm really, I feel really pessimistic. I feel cynical. I feel a little depressed. Like I just the world is kind of going to shit. And I'm overwhelmed. And you know, I just don't know. I just don't know anymore. And there was a look in his eyes, I will never forget. All of a sudden a glint came from behind his eyes like little laser beams. And he reached out and grabbed my arm like an anaconda. He was a frail little guy. He grabbed my forearm. I can still feel it. He grabbed it hard. And he looked in my eyes and he said, don't, don't do it. Don't be cynical. You can't be pessimistic. If you are if you are negative, they win. If you are pessimistic, they win because you'll just sit there and you won't do anything. You have to keep hope alive. You have to stay positive. Otherwise, they win. Do you want them to win? You've got to keep hope alive. And this was the last thing he said. And he was kind of, it was kind of like, now get out of there. He was almost like a coach, you know, from the Crimson Tide or something like, now let's go in this game, boys. And I walked, I stumbled out into the cobblestone streets of the West Village and it, it literally transformed my entire life. It's one of those moments and it only was a minute and a half long. And it literally changed how I saw the world because he's 100% right. If we stay cynical and pessimistic, nothing changes. I'll probably never start a business, but if I did, it would be one based on service and it would be a national hotline for folks over 50 in this country who live in states that have just legalized marijuana to call to figure out dosages when it comes to edibles. They need people like us to save them. There are so many people on the golf courses right now curling up in the fetal position, flinging their champagne crafts into the trees thinking they're striking a chupacabra. And that is because they don't understand that just because the thing looks like a gummy bear and is sweet does not necessarily mean it did not emerge from hell.

If we stay cynical and pessimistic, nothing changes. The forces of evil, the forces of toxicity, of grotesque conservatism, of racism, of materialism, the Voldemort energy of the world wants us to say, stay cynical and pessimistic. Hey, let's keep all those smarty pants, urban liberals, all eye rolling and pessimistic all the time and nothing will fucking change. That really changed my life and I struggle with that. I still do. My heart goes, my fallback position is cynicism, but I truly believe in love and I believe in hope and I believe in creating joy. That joy is something that you can not only feel in your heart, you can give joy to others, which you have been doing for a decade with your podcast. You can give joy to others and make the world a better place and that's something anyone can do. You don't have to be an actor or a podcaster to do it. I have been, and this is maybe a dangerous exploration and maybe it's totally wrong, but I've been thinking because I struggle with cynicism too. I mean, my God, that is my go-to. It's such an easy place to land. It's so easy to be cynical. Delightful to be cynical sometimes. It gives you a feeling of sophistication, which is total bullshit too. You've seen through the nonsense of whatever it is that you're throwing out there to cope with your inevitable doom. You feel fake smart, but the thing that I keep thinking about is the Buddhist monk practice of sitting at the edge of a grave. I'm sure you've heard of this and watching a body decompose while meditating. I don't know that they still do that, but that was like an ancient Buddhist practice if you were going to be a monk. They wanted you to not just be aware that you're going to die. They wanted you to see how the body melts back into the earth, how it stinks, to really get it across this vehicle that you're in doesn't last. How about seeing holy cynicism, seeing God in the nihilistic, materialist view of things? In other words, for this revolution to happen, how can we do it if we still are tribalizing? How can we do it? Anytime I try to go centrist or anything and say, well, this person's not all that bad, and this person's not all that bad, they're all kind of beautiful, all of them. If I put anyone in front of you, you could find the beauty in them. I know you could, and someone who has a practice can. I've been trying to look, dark shit, man, on the just countless Ukrainians being blown up by drones or Russians being blown up by really trying to do the sitting at the edge of the pit meditation, looking into the world as it is. And I think I can see some beauty in all of it. Do you know what I mean? In other words, I could have my cynicism and not feel as though I'm opposed to some greater reality. Yeah, I wouldn't call that cynicism. I mean, I think first of all, there's a difference between skepticism and cynicism, and I think that being skeptical is healthy, you know, like, oh, here's how things are. I don't know if that's how things are. Let me really look at that. What's your definition of cynical? I don't know. I should know that. I should know that. I don't know. I think it's like poisonous, hopeless. Everything is shit. Yeah, everything is bullshit. It's Holden Caulfield, you know? Okay. Yeah, okay. Because that's what's happened is the Holden Caulfieldization of America. Oh, they're all phonies. They're all phonies. And there is phoniness. So how do you say skeptical about the phoniness? Yes, they are all phonies, Holden. But guess what? I have hope in my heart and a song in my heart and strengthen my loins to go forward and fight phoniness. Okay, that's cool. Here's a good story. My friend, Ragu, who is friends with Ramdas, he said Ramdas would tell this or Krishnadas, who is like this wonderful, he seems like mantras, kirtans. Krishnadas, they all went to India together, hung out with Neem Krali Bhava, this great Indian saint. So Krishnadas is meeting Ramdas on the beach. He says Ramdas is just like in a rotten mood, really like unhappy, really like just something's off. And he's like, what's wrong? Ramdas says, we're phonies. That's it. We're just phonies. We're just phonies. That's all. And Krishnadas says to him, yes, but we're authentic phonies. I love it. And that, to me, embracing the phony, yes, of course, we're phonies. My God, I mean, you're a professional phony. Your job is to dial in an alternate version of you that is limited and temporary. So I'm sure as hell a phony, all of us are phony. How part of reacting to reality is to become a phony. It's so terrifying. And you want to pretend you're something you're not. Not only that, I'm a Hollywood elite, liberal, Tesla driving, tennis playing guy in my nice house on a hill. And I have pet pigs and macadamia nut trees. And who am I to be talking to people about social transformation through religious and spiritual tools? So that sounded like Samuel Taylor Courage. That sounded like a new version of in Xanadu to Kubla Khan, a stately pleasure dome decree with macadamia nuts and pigs. Xanadu. Xanadu. Rosebud. Rosebud. Rosebud. Think of it. This is a weight to you. My God, it's crazy. What about the idea that God gave you that? Do you ever play around with that? Like, do you ever play around with the idea that this was a gift from the universe to you from the divine that here, here you go, take this, it's actually you deserve it. Everything is a gift from the divine. And I entirely buy that. And I feel zero guilt for what I have, for what I've worked for. Great. And I understand my white privilege that gave me a leg up on this journey. And I recognize that. And that's also a blessing. I have, you know, I have many blood hashtag blessed. But I do think that the great spiritual avatars live in a state of perpetual gratitude where every breath is tinged with awe and wonder. And I get to have a breath. I had a friend die two weeks ago, and he died in the most cliche way. He had a heart attack while on a peloton, which was literally a point from from sex in the city. I apparently I didn't watch it. But and God bless him. He's such a beautiful soul. And every breath that I get to take is is a fucking miracle. I mean, think about that oxygen coming into my little capillaries and then go streaming in my bloodstream being pumped up to my brain and allowing me to have consciousness. And I'm in, you know, I try and be in perpetual gratitude. And I think that's a contrary to cynicism is gratitude. It's really hard to be cynical when you're grateful for everything. And I'm grateful for my career. I'm grateful for Dwight Schrute. I'm grateful for us having this conversation. I really wish that you would quit vaping. I really think you need to examine the role the nicotine plays in your life. You sound like my wife. We'll get to that later. But let's go back. Let's go back. Let's go back to death. I write in my death on my death chapter. I have a chapter called death and how to live it. I say in Tibetan Buddhism, there is a long rich death meditation history. The renowned 11th century teacher Atissa had nine meditations on this theme. One, death is inevitable. Two, our personal lifespan is decreasing continuously day by day. Three, death will come whether we are not, we are prepared for it, just like my friend Javier on the Peloton. Four, human life expectancy is uncertain. Five, there are many causes of death. Six, the human body is fragile and vulnerable. Seven, at the time of death, our material resources are of no use to us. Eight, our loved ones cannot keep us from death. And nine, our own body cannot help us at the time of death. And it would continue from there and you can do a death meditation where you picture yourself dying and you picture what happened to kill you and you picture your loved ones rushing around your side and holding your limp, lifeless body and then the beginning of the decay and then your body being buried and then the inevitable decay and then being eaten by worms and returning to the soil and then feeding the worms and the grass and the trees and the robins and the flowers blooming. So I think it's really important and it's one thing that we don't do culturally is have a deep consideration of death which can frame the miracle of being alive to an even greater degree. Yes, that is for sure. And I think if you want to dive into the topic of death, the Peloton death in particular is a perfect modern way of conveying to people, if you're on your Peloton, you're exercising, you're not laying in bed, vaping, playing a turn-based online role-playing game, getting mildly high on some gummy, you're on your fucking Peloton, tip-top shape and gone just like that. And so that to me the sort of sniper reality of death because I think, you know, the temporal bank account phenomena, like people are doing for the temporal bank account what the same thing they did for Bitcoin. It's like, yeah, this is not a stable number. Maybe you don't have your lifespan out of you. And so this produces a way of interacting in the world which is generally not very sophisticated. I think if you knew you were going to die in a couple of days, you wouldn't be such a dick probably to people. You would find a way to be more kind. I don't mean you specifically. I just, me imagining me dying knowing, oh, here's the time. I don't know many stories of people approaching death who become just monstrous, shallow assholes. Usually it's the opposite. So yeah, I do think that that we're so scared to die here. I mean, my God, everyone's really afraid to die. People don't want to die. Underlying fossil fuel that's polluting everything is the fear of death, the unacknowledged fear of death in the West. But how do you get that across to people in a way that sells tickets? Like, how do you, you know what I mean? How do you, where is, what, this is not broccoli and s'mores. This is, this is like cyanide in cyanide, you know, how to get across to the world. Listen, this does not last. Oh, I just don't know how to do that. Usually the bank vault door shuts anytime we even get close to that with some people. Yeah, it really is too bad. I've known, now that I'm 57, I start, you start to get to know people who die a lot more. I've got friends that have died. My dad died two years ago, which affected, affected me profoundly. We were very, very close. My friend David was dying of cancer and he was given about a year to live and he had stage four stomach cancer, which is the most painful kind. I would never wish that on anyone. And God bless him. Everything, I'd really tried to talk to him about death in a very sensitive way. And I would just kind of send little writings or we'd talk about death meditation or some quotes about the journey of the soul from my tradition, the Baha'i Faith tradition. And his whole life became about battling the cancer, which is good, but it's kind of a false dichotomy. Like he couldn't consider death because he viewed considering death as weakness and something that would take away from his fight and his battle against cancer, which was his fight to survive and to live. So he was really afraid to consider the reality of death because he was engaged in this battle and he should have been engaged in that battle, like fight it like a motherfucker, like put it off, try to fight rage, rage against the dying of the light. But also consider the fact that we are spiritual beings having a human experience and we've got 80 or 90 years in our meat suits. I'm 57, Duncan, Duncan, Uncle Duncan. If I die, will you speak at my funeral? Even though I don't know you, I've known you for 20 minutes. You know what? Absolutely. And that is a real role of the dice, but I would love to speak. Okay. I mean, I would love to speak at your funeral. It's the worst thing you can say to somebody. I don't ever want to speak at your funeral, but I will. I'm going to tell my wife I want you to speak at my funeral. And you know what? Minimum an hour. Oh boy. Hell no. Hell no. I will speak at your funeral for as long as I can ride on a Peloton at like max speed. Seven minutes. Come on. You overestimate me. I think you and Pete Holmes, I would want you and Pete Holmes to do an hour. You can share an hour. You know, I have bad news for you friend. The based on what they're saying about the RNA therapy for reversing the aging process, not like extending your life so you suffer, but literally reverse aging you based on a few things that I know about you. You're where you are in the as discussed economic sphere. Yeah. No doubt people you know you will be first in line to have access to something that will probably spend extend your lifespan by at least another 20 years. I don't want it. And then those 20 years there'll be another you won't have a choice. I won't have a choice. What are you talking about? Like men are going to come in the middle of the night and inject me with RNA. People need you around. Oh, and you're going not at 97 here. Not at 97. Like, oh my God, he's doing the world's oldest podcaster. You will see him. You'll be you will look younger than you are now. I would love for you to be the world's oldest podcaster at over 100. Wouldn't that be amazing? That would be really the most terrible title. Yeah. Oh my God. This dizzy. This got dark. A big thank you to Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH. My friends, what an age we live in. What an age. You could just do a podcast. It's easy. If you have a computer, a phone, whatever, you don't need any fancy gadgets, gizmos, don't fall for the bullshit. You don't need to order those sad bags of podcasting gear they sell online. You don't need any of that. You just need a phone, your computer. Trust me, no one cares about sound quality. Press record and go. But I'll tell you one thing you definitely need for a podcast. If you ask me is a website, a home online for said podcast, a place where you can gather all those important metrics or you can understand who is even listening to your podcast, a place for your community to gather and most importantly, a place that you can expand if you need to and Squarespace checks all those boxes. They've got members only areas. So if you want to monetize your podcast and give extra content to your fans, you could do that. They have the exact same functionality that they use to create their amazing websites for emails, meaning that you can use the Squarespace engine to send out beautiful, professional looking emails to your clients and your fans, your friends. Why not your friends? They have shopping cart functionality, obviously. They have everything you could possibly need. And this is the most important thing about it. It's easy. It's easy. You're not going to spend a caffeinated eternity trying to understand how to use it. I use, I've used it in all states of consciousness. You know, sometimes late at night, you just come up with an idea for a website and you just need to make that website. But you don't want to spend forever on that website. Squarespace will let you do this. And also, Squarespace obviously has the technology to make an advanced glory site, like the one you will find at DuncanTrussell.com. Okay. I wanted to read to you something because I'm not sure if you're familiar with this and please stop me if you are. But, you know, people, to go back to the cynical thing, because I really agree with you, man. This is a plague of cynicism. And it's creating a death spiral for us. And I'm just trying to figure out a way to like, to work with my own cynicism in the hopes that if I could do it, it's possible across the board. But within the, the cynical, I guess, if you want to say ideology, if you want to call it, like this is a new secret religion of cynicism. And what is the ideology within that religion? So one of the tenants, one of the beliefs would be how there, you want proof there's no God, I'll give you proof there's no fucking God. Look at the world. Look at these videos that you see in the Ukraine. Look at what's happening there. Those are all fathers and mothers. And look, those are, those are dogs like eating somebody's face out there. That's your God. Your God has dogs eating the faces of conscripted parents. That's your God. So this is a quick Thomas Merton quote. And his answer to that, it is, it is only the infinite mercy and love of God that has prevented us from tearing ourselves to pieces and destroying his entire creation long ago. People seem to think that it is in some way a proof that no merciful God exists if we have so many wars. On the contrary, consider how in spite of centuries of sin and greed and lust and cruelty and hatred and avarice and oppression and injustice spawned in bread by the free wills of men, the human race can still recover each time and can still produce a man and woman who overcome evil with good, hatred with love, greed with charity, lust and cruelty with sanctity. That there's your fucking proof. You know, and by you, I mean me, that's the cynical part of me that thinks that. But look, this, we wouldn't even be here. The fact that we're here with all the technologies we have to blow each other up is astounding, right? Like, that's a great, that's a great inverse. That's a beautiful way. I haven't seen that before. What a, what a beautiful way of considering the divine. I have a couple of things to say on it. Can I, can I, can I dive in? Please. So number one, number one, God doesn't cause wars. Man causes wars. And we don't have to be fighting. We don't be having wars. We, perhaps if we had listened to our great divine teachers over the centuries and actually really listened and learned from them, from the Buddha, from the Christ, from Muhammad, praise be upon him, from Bahá'u'lláh and Abdu'l-Bahá, from the Bahá'í faith, from Lord Krishna, perhaps we would be healing and living together in peace and harmony and not creating wars. So humanity has expended an incredible amount of resources on drones and missiles and missile defense systems and armaments and tanks and AR-15s and Kalishnikovs. And we could have been spending all of that money and all of that resource to literally cure and fix and wipe out cancer and heart disease. And we didn't, we haven't, we've made that choice collectively and then we turn and blame it on God. That's number one. Number two, suffering. One of the greatest spiritual questions of all time and a question like death that if we pondered to ever greater depths would actually help us in our lives is, is suffering in the nature of suffering. The Buddha says, I come to teach one thing and one thing only, suffering in the nature of suffering. You know, the first noble truth is about suffering. You know, life is suffering. So we understand that suffering comes part and parcel with being, with having this fleshy human experience for 80 or 90 years in our flesh tuxedos before they fall away and feed the worms. So you know, you, you suffer and then you die. Guess what? And along the way, there are miracles. But the reality of life is you suffer and then you die. And to embrace that, to understand it, to live with that, to, to dive into that way of being is, is really liberating. Like, oh, you know, and this is M. Scott Pex, The Road Less Traveled is such a great book, because it really begins with that thesis is like, if life is suffering, then how do, how do we find a joyful acquiescence in the presence, presence of suffering, as the Buddha says. So that's brilliant. Yes. A joyful acquiescence in the presence of suffering. Yeah. Wow. So, um, but we have to understand that we suffer. And in this mental health crisis and mental health epidemic that young people are going through right now, it's like people, we've lost track of that. They're like, I don't want to suffer. Please make the suffering stop. I want the suffering to go away. There's too much suffering. I want to feel no suffering. I want to feel zero suffering. I want to feel zero conflict or pain or discomfort. And I don't want disappointment and I don't want depression and I don't want anxiety. Guess what kids? It's real and it's here for the rest of your life. And that's not a bad thing. And that doesn't mean that there's no God. It's something to be embraced and you learn how to live with it. So I learn how to live with depression, discomfort, anxiety, disappointment, disease, uh, and failure. And that's part of the human condition because our bodies are soul growing machines. That's what we are. I'm in this fleshy tissue wonder box, which is Rainn Wilson and all of my, my glorious long torso and fleshy belly. And I hopefully I get a good 90 years, but maybe I keel over on my Peloton tomorrow. I don't know, but I'm going to suffer along the way. And if we understood suffering better and we were closer to suffering, we would understand that God has given us suffering as a gift collectively. And they're, they're, they're not at odds. God and suffering are not at odds. I write in my book that, Hey, what would it be like if God had created a world in which there was zero suffering? What would that, how would that work? Like literally the baby comes out of the woman's vagina. The vagina opens up to the size of a football, lets the baby come out without any pain. The baby doesn't cry. No one ever gets a skin knee. No one ever stubs their toe. No one ever feels failure or disappointment. Like that's not the world and no one wants God to have created that world. Thank you. Okay. That's beautiful. A wonderful, wonderful description of suffering and the reality of suffering. And it makes me think of this. You've ever, you, you heard of, have you heard of Gurdjieff? Yes. Gurdjieff. Yes. The mystic. Yes. Do you know the story about the clipping up of the, like how he would make his students do these ridiculous, I guess you could almost call them physical zen koans, like these things that are designed to sort of shatter your, your, your whatever, your little personalities. So he, he was having them cut squares out of a yard of lawn and bring it to the other side and place the squares exactly in the place they would have been if like they had been reversed on the other side of the yard, basically just swapping one side of a lawn for another side of a lawn. And they're, they're going nuts. It's so awful. It's terrible work. And one of the students who no one liked, he was very annoying, incredibly irritating, horribly ill mannered. They just hated him. He stands up and basically just yells out, fuck this. This is bullshit. I'm leaving. And like no one tried to stop him. He leaves. So later, one of Gurdjieff's attendants happily expresses this guy's split, the asshole left. He couldn't do the exercise. And Gurdjieff was like, what? No, I pay him to stay here. And he got in his car and drove off and brought the guy back. But basically Gurdjieff, as part of his training, was paying the most awful, annoying human to hang out with his students to irritate them on top of everything else, because he recognized not just the reality of suffering, but how good it was for human growth. That was what he was trying. Wow. What a great story. Isn't that ancient? So you, in your, in your world, you remove suffering. What, what do you also remove? Do you remove everything that makes humanity great? Yeah. Wisdom. Do you remove the possibility for advanced? Wow, that's cool, man. Yeah. I like your world though. I like that. I have a third child on the way and I would very much like my wife's vagina to open in the way you described earlier and let the baby crawl out. Wow. Will you live stream that? It's not only fans, okay? It's behind the paywall. Oh man. So, so suffering, but this is, I get reminded this by my Buddhist teachers all the time, which is Buddha taught two things. First, and being the suffering, the reality of suffering. The second being the cessation of suffering, the end of suffering. That somehow we could theoretically in this human life actually not suffer. Do you buy that? Do you buy that it's possible to transcend suffering? I, I, I don't, I don't know that I agree with the Buddha on that. I have some bones to pick with the Buddha on that. Even Jesus Christ on the cross was rumored to have said, God, why have thou forsaken me? And do we think that Jesus was just giggling as the nails were pounded into him? Not according to Mel Gibson, he wasn't. But I think that some measure of suffering is necessary to gain, to gain wisdom. We're, we're, our bodies are soul-growing machines, and our reality is that we're souls, we're spiritual beings, and we're continuing this journey into the infinite to meet the Creator, the Creator's, Creator's, Creator, beyond time and space. And I don't know that I want to never suffer because I'm so grateful for the suffering that I've been through. Haven't you suffered, Duncan, in really horrible ways when you look back on your life and go, God, I'm so, I'm so glad I had that and I went through that? There you go. I mean, this is why I love Buddhism, because the analysis for why we suffer, or not to get Buddhist nerd on your ear, I've heard both translations, life is suffering. Another, which I like a little more is there is suffering. There is suffering, not even life. It's worse than that. It's there. Yes, there's suffering. So the why, why do we suffer? Attachment. We want to suffer. And you just perfectly describe that. It's like, yes, I don't want to, I don't want to let go of that. I consider that to be a component of who I am now. And my suffering often leads to like creative discoveries and good jokes and stuff. I don't want, I don't want to let go of that completely. So it's terrifying, really, the idea that you could actually let go of that, and you don't know what's going to be you after that. A lot of comics think, I know one thing it'll be, it won't be fucking funny. That's what it won't be. I'm not letting go of this stuff. I gotta hang on, baby. I gotta hang on to my suffering. It's my, it's my magic juice. So yeah, I don't know what someone who has yet to relinquish suffering. And I think you have a fair argument there. You're the bone you're picking with the Buddha in the sense that, you know, we can't know for sure what happens if we stop suffering or if it's even possible. All I know is stories about people who've apparently pulled it off. So there's bullshit suffering. There's bullshit suffering, which is like when you watch the Kardashians and they're like, hey, I got this brand new Maybach and like someone keyed it when I was at this, you know, opening and God, I'm so upset and I'm crying because my Maybach got keyed at a fashion event. Like that's unnecessary bullshit suffering, which comes from attachment to material things, attachment to outcomes. We can certainly gain great wisdom and perspective by releasing our clutching, our grasping and our attachment to comfort and materialism. That's number one. Number two, as an addict myself, and I've struggled with lots of different facets of addiction, it's unnecessary suffering, you know, it's unnecessary. Like we, you know, if I'm, if I'm binging on alcohol or binging on porn, I'm creating shame and I'm creating unnecessary suffering that doesn't have to be there. I'm only using drugs or alcohol or shopping or food or porn or whatever to soothe, escape and medicate my chronic condition of the fact that there is suffering and anxiety goes with that. So, hey, there is suffering. You don't, I don't need to medicate that and you need to stop fucking medicating it with your vape pen. It's actually, the vape is the flavor of suffering. Oh, did you get a cartridge? You got a suffering cartridge at the local vape store? The flavor of all human suffering. It's not as bad as it sounds. By the way, why do all of the vape and pot stores look alike and they just are the worst? What is with that? Like when you, you know, we could easily create a conspiracy theory around that, that would probably exist forever. That would take off. I think just now what you're, I see, I've never considered it before. In fact, when I'm going into one of these places, I often try to disassociate because I feel so embarrassed that I'm buying a vape, but you're right. They all look exactly the same. They've got a kind of bizarre, clownish thing to them. Like these weird, it's very odd. It's very odd. The fonts are all the same. The general size of the stores are the neon that what is this? The neon essence. Yeah. It's what is it? Is it some kind of alien? Maybe that's the invasion. Maybe is this the way the alien, the hyper dimensional being invades planet Earth is not through AI, not through super intelligence, not chat, GPT, not the UAPs, but a sudden proliferation of identical vape and weed shops all over the planet. No one would expect that would be where the invasion came from. I'm there. I'm in. I'm all, I'm all in. It reminds me of that episode of Star Trek, the next generation where they're all playing that little video game on their devices that look curiously like phones and they're getting these dopamine releases that are actually like growing alien entities in their brains. So, so prescient. Oh my God. Well, I mean, a lot of people, we don't have to get into that. You know, the whole theory where he, he was somehow getting visions in Star Trek that it was actually like some, you had some connection to an occult society. Anyway, it's a different podcast. I want to keep talking about. Let's keep talking about suffering. Let's bring it back to suffering. No, not suffering. I want to keep talking about God and how suffering within that, whatever your conceptualization of it may be, has the potential of not no longer being suffering, but of suddenly the entirety of what it is shifts. This is the magic trick that you are doing here. They're all great, you know, alchemical beings do. It's not like they rob you of your suffering. It's that just by helping a kind of very small shift, a reconsideration of it as being something actually beautiful, powerful. I mean, my God, you want to talk about if you're ever feeling disempowered, feel your suffering. Fuck. It's so strong. It's so fucking strong. And it's so, so, so non phony. That's another thing. Feeling like a phony, just lean into that suffering. You will not feel like a phony anymore. You're going to feel very real. So yeah, I think what, what you're doing there is people, that's a good thing for people to hear you, because it's like, you're basically running away from the, the treasure of like buried in your house. The only way out is through. Oh God, I hate that so much. But it's true. Don't you hate that? But it's, but it's true. You know, it's grief. You know, it's, I was witness to my friend who died on the Peloton, his wife. I was witness to her just having a total grief meltdown over his loss, because they were so close and loved each other so much. And we're so looking forward to their retiring. And God bless them both. And my heart goes out to her. And, but she has been sobbing and sobbing and sobbing. And then we had an event last night, a memorial. And you know what, she's getting a little better because she's allowing herself to sob. I mean, racking, sob, snotty, heaving, wailing sobs that have allowed her to move through and you see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. But if you hold on, if you hold on to that grief, then it turns cancerous in so many ways. But here's another aspect of suffering. Like, think about this, there's different levels, right? So when you have, when you're, we are both fathers. So when you have a baby, it suffers because it's hungry and it cries, right? And you have a toddler and it bumps its head when it falls down on the kitchen floor and it cries. And we, we have great compassion for, oh, it bumped its head. And then when you have four year old, someone takes his toy and it cries. And that's the suffering of a four year old. And then a seven year old, you know, someone was mean to him on the playground. And that's the suffering. And then a 12 year old feels ungainly in their body because of, of, of puberty and their suffering and their crying. And then a 15 year old has their first breakup and their heartbreak and their crying. And we're able to kind of like see the maturity happen. And we have to do the same thing with ourselves, you know, we have to have such great compassion for ourselves and those around us for the nature, the nature of suffering itself. And in, and so hand in hand with suffering goes compassion, which of course is integral to the, to the Buddha's teaching. And that's the other component that I address in Soul Boom, why we need a spiritual revolution by Rainn Wilson available from Hachette, that, uh, that, uh, a radical compassion for one another. And there's such a contemptuous disregard of compassion on the internet that goes hand in hand with cynicism. So another way to combat cynicism is not only with gratitude, but with compassion, just like I have the biggest possible heart. I have a heart the sides of a basketball for other people's suffering, even if they're really different than me, even if I see their suffering is somewhat quote unquote immature, you know, like the suffering of someone who's got had their first heartbreak. Um, what do you think? Oh God, I think you just described a risk. I, you know what? I'm guilty of the last thing you said, and it's, I'm so glad you called us out the part of suffering snobbery. You just identified a whole thing, man. It's like, uh, oh, look at your suffering over there. You don't know true suffering. Oh, if only you could walk a day in my soggy suffering shoes, then you'd be weeping kid. I think that that's so brilliant. I, I'm guilty of it to some degree where it's like this person, who cares about the story, whatever the stupid story the person is yelling out in the world is just as stupid as your story and every other person's story on earth where you're a mortal, but peel that away. Somebody's suffering. That's not fake. That person is legitimately 100% miserable and, and, and potentially suicidal and may in mentally ill, just like, just like all of us, most of us. So yeah, drop the snobbery thing here. Let's just start looking at suffering as it is. Let's just do a one. It's just one thing, one taste suffering. I don't care what the story is behind it. That is interesting. What a roadblock to compassion. Suffering snobbery. That's how you wall yourself off to compassion when someone's unhappy. I have in the book, I propose an idea that's kind of like a science fiction, it would be a great science fiction book that we could write, which is what if we had a compassion machine? What if there was a machine to which you could hook yourself in? It's an, it looks like an MRI or a brain scan or something like that. And you, in, in the machine, you undertake living in someone else's shoes, in someone else's skin, behind someone else's eyes, someone entirely different than you. You know, a Pakistani farmer, a Mongolian shepherd, or a soldier in the Ukraine, or a migrant, you know, going through the Darian gap in Panama. And you are in it. You're in their reality. And you're just literally, it's like surround sound, VR, living life as them for a long period of time. You're feeling their hunger. You're feeling the pain in their feet, the fear in their heart. Like if you, if, if all Americans had to go while growing up, and that was part of our educational system, as you had to spend an hour in the compassion machine every week with feeling for some different person, we would have an entirely different world. We would have a world of one loving human family because we could not stand Duncan to see anyone hurting. We could not stand to see the pain. We couldn't, just like we can't stand to see the pain of our family members. Well, what if you just widen, widen that family members to, to be the human family? I mean, that's what all of the great spiritual teachers are talking about, widening your perception of family to the human family. And again, there might be a collective eye roll. This is a hairy, airy, fairy, hippy, dippy bullshit, you know, you know, John Lennon, imagine all the people kind of elitist thing, but it's, it's really true. It's what, it's what Jesus taught. It's not just what Jesus taught. Look at the, just go pure materialist here. Look at evolutionary biology, single celled organisms have to develop some kind of relationship with other single celled organisms, become multicellular organisms. This is, produces what we have now is like a never ending iteration of things, figuring out how to get along that, that maybe don't look like each other, think like each other, potentially have completely different. I mean, we're talking about single celled organisms here. I don't know what they think, like probably they're pretty dumb, but you get my point that if we strip all the mystical shit away, it's like, look at, look at what's going on here. It's obviously some kind of hive. It's clearly a human hive. And for some reason these bees, some of the bees aren't getting along. God, I sound like Charles Manson. It's a human hive. The bees, you see the bees, the cockbees, the copper bees, putting handcuffs on the free bees. And I'm never going to be free. I'm just the bee you think I am, but you know what I'm saying though. It's like, yeah, it's, it is hippie-dippy on one level. On another level, it's, it's all, all the problems, all the big problems, they get fixed by just that circumference widening just a little bit. And the problem is that is not easy. That's no easy feat to do. And I wonder sometimes your description of the compassion machine. I mean, do you ever play around with you are in the compassion machine? This is it for the compassion machine to work. You can't know you're in the compassion machine. You've got to really believe you're Rainn Wilson. You've got to really believe that you are in this life and your story is completely true. And so in the, in the way that we are being evolved by the divine mind is through infinite iterations in this fucking compassion machine until finally we've experienced every human life to the point where we, you know, gain realization or something. I mean, that's to me, one of the terrifying ways of thinking of reincarnation. It's a, it's like this, whatever we're in is doing to us what a rock polisher does to rocks, only it's not like a rock polisher, it's reincarnation. It's this never ends until you figure out how to do that thing where suddenly your neighbors or your family, that thing. How the fuck do you do that, man? It's like in one life, is it even possible? It's not like I don't like my neighbors, but it's the, if I hear my neighbor's kid screaming, I'm not running over there. Oh, they would think I was nuts if I did. To cradle their child. Can I cradle your child? I heard he was screaming. The worst kind of people. I just want to soothe your child. Yeah, how do we, how do we spread it out? How, I guess that's a great way to close to like, my God, what, if I think you're, what you're talking about is clearly the thing, but how do we do it? And can you answer that in one minute? I'm just kidding. I would, but how do we extend this circumference? You start small, little by little, bit by bit. It can be a daily practice of compassion to say, Hey, today I'm going to be confronted with someone that is an annoyance to me, like Gergev's yard worker. And I'm going to just simply practice this, a small act of kindness and love and, and compassion for that person. So you just, you start really, really, really, really small. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that was, you know, you should write a book. I really should. I think you should write a book about a spiritual revolution that encompasses seven pillars. No, I'm, I'm, I just need another TV show, man. Come on. Could you get them both? One doesn't. No, not a book. No, that's, that's, that's bullshit. Yes. Thank you. You're very, you're very kind. Have you, I'm sorry I have no, I don't know this information. Have you written a book, Duncan? Oh God, don't get me started. I talk about suffering, man. I just, I've, I've, I've, I don't want to talk about, I talk about facing this whole thing. We've been talking about turn towards your suffering. You bring up the book and I'm like, I can't talk about that. It hurts too much. I want, I want to write one. I do. I just, how do you, how do you localize a topic? How do you find something? Even if, even essays or whatever, you know, I feel about the book the way I feel about getting a tattoo. Boy, I bet you wish you didn't ask me that question. I feel it's, you know, it's a permanent kind of thing. Yeah. You put a book out in some state of consciousness or some idea of the, your personal view of the world and it's frozen in time. I don't know. It just feels so permanent. Yeah. It's, it's permanent, but then, you know, the sun is going to explode in another a billion and a half years. So how permanent, how permanent is it really, you know? Right. So getting back to Duncan Trussell's book, I think that if, if one can tap into art as service, then what does the world need? What story from Duncan Trussell does the world most need that touches the most hearts and affects the most people? Right. You know, in a midnight gospel way. Yeah. You know, what is, what, what comes from your illumination that would give the greatest kind of breath and uplift to, to humanity. And so you go to that need, then it's not about yourself, right? Right. Then you've put ego aside and it's just like, I want to serve my listeners. I want, there's, there's a 27 year old kid in Omaha who's listening to every one of my podcasts and I bring him joy and he's really struggling and his name is Luther Johnson. And I really want to give a maximum impact to Luther Johnson. I'm doing it for him. Like, it's like JD Salinger. It's like, you do it, you do it for the fat lady, you know, in Franny and Zooey, you, you do the acting for the fat ladies who's listening to the radio show on the porch. Do it for her. So you don't do it for you. Wow. Thank you. Holy shit. I'll help you, man. We, we got each other's numbers. We can go offline and just be like, let's want to just brainstorm ideas and like, I'm just, I would bounce them around. I would love that. You are so brilliant and so funny. And I'm so, I'm so lucky that you decided to come on the show. And I really do. Give me a break. Listen, I know people get cheesy at the end of podcasts sometimes, but I'm really mean. I would love to keep talking offline with you. And I am so grateful to you. Can we be friends? Yeah. Can we be friends? This is how people become friends in the modern age. First you podcast. First you podcast. It's a friendship date. That's what it is. It's the modern friendship date. Oh yes. I would love to be friends. And I am really, really excited to think about some of the stuff you said today, especially the book stuff. Now I have goosebumps. Damn it. Oh, wow. That was amazing. Thank you. You were some kind of exorcist. Did you see the demon fly out of my body when you said that? I did. Yes. How did it look? In a cloud of vape. In a vaporous cloud. I would love to have a sandwich with you. And I would love to talk about our history of orgasms. Oh God. Me too. What are your top three favorite orgasms? What was your first one you remember? Oh my God. And then what does your face look like when you orgasm? So you just gave me the first four chapters of my book. Right there you go. Now I know who I'm writing it for. Were you please tell people where you want them to go to get the book or does it matter? Just Amazon is fine. It doesn't matter. Okay. Or don't buy the book. No, buy the book. Buy the book. It would mean a lot to me and to my publisher and review the book where you buy it. Support your local independent bookstores, I would say number one. But if you're feeling lazy and you want to do the one click Amazon, be him off. You know, Sauron, the eye of Sauron. Click on that and let the book come to you the next day. Amazon, Walmart, some find your most fossil fuel emitted nearby factory. That's the where I get my books from. You're totally right. Well, independent local bookstore. Forgive me, all independent local booksellers. And holy shit. This has been my favorite podcast in a long, long, long time. Thank you so much. Oh, you're so kind. Duncan, let's do it again. And I'd really would like to be friends with you. And I'd like to have a sandwich and talk about our orgasm history. And that's a good place to start. And I would love to pick your brain about your book. I want to support you in that journey. Okay. Because you're the heart, your spirit and your brain is amazing. Yeah, let me know. Do you ever go to Comic Con? Yeah, I've gone before. Yeah, I've gone before. Well, look, we could talk about this offline. Thank you, everybody. Go buy this wonderful man's book at a very small, very, very impossible bookstore, a bookstore that sells one book. Soul Boom. It only sells soul boom. Thank you so much, Ryan. Thanks, Duncan. That was Ryan Wilson, everybody. Get his book Soul Boom, why we need spiritual revolution. Find one of those mini bookstores that only sell his book. And do come see me. Get those tickets early, Phoenix. Come on. Grab them now. Don't make me sweat bullets over here. Come see me, Dania Beach. You know your orders. You have to come to Dania Beach wherever you are. That's the last of many, many shows I've been doing before I go on a kind of mild paternity leave. So I hope all of you will come to that show. I will see you next week. Until then, Hare Krishna.

You went through it all, and found your way around. You went through it all, and found your way around. You went through it all, and found your way around. How to like it, a poem by Stephen Dobbins. These are the first days of fall. The wind at evening smells of roads, still to be traveled. While the sound of leaves blowing across the lawns is like an unsettled feeling in the blood. The desire to get in a car and just keep driving. A man and a dog descend their front steps. The dog says, let's go downtown and get crazy drunk. Let's tip over all the trash cans we can find. This is how dogs deal with the prospect of change. But in his sense of the season, the man is struck by the oppressiveness of his past, how his memories, which were shifting and fluid, have grown more solid, until it seems he can see remembered faces caught up among the dark places in the trees. The dog says, let's pick up some girls and just rip off their clothes. Let's dig holes everywhere. Above his house, the man notices wisps of cloud crossing the face of the moon, like in a movie. He says to himself, a movie about a person leaving on a journey. He looks down the street to the hills outside of town and finds the cut where the road heads north. He thinks of driving on that road in the dusty smell of the car heater, which hasn't been used since last winter. The dog says, let's go down to the diner and sniff people's legs. Let's stuff ourselves on burgers. In the man's mind, the road is empty and dark. Pine trees press down to the edge of the shoulder, where the eyes of animals, fixed in his headlights, shine like small cautions against the night. Sometimes a passing truck makes his whole car shake. The dog says, let's go to sleep. Let's lie down by the fire and put our tails over our noses. But the man wants to drive all night, crossing one state line after another and never stop until the sun creeps into his rear view mirror. Then he'll pull over and rest awhile before starting again. And at dusk, he'll crest a hill and there, filling a valley will be the lights of a city entirely new to him. But the dog says, let's just go back inside. Let's not do anything tonight. So they walk back up the sidewalk to the front steps. How is it possible to want so many things and still want nothing? The man wants to sleep and wants to hit his head again and again against a wall. Why is it also difficult? But the dog says, let's go make a sandwich. Let's make the tallest sandwich anyone's ever seen. And that's what they do. And that's where the man's wife finds him. Staring into the refrigerator is if into the place where the answers are kept. The one's telling why you get up in the morning and how it is possible to sleep at night. Answers to what comes next and how to like it. We got a blazer for you today, my loves. Here with us is the incredible DaVindra Bannhart. We're going to jump right into it. I got to tell you something before we jump into it. I almost fanboyed out. Maybe I did a little bit in this one. I love him. I love his music. I've been listening to his music for a long time. And I got to chat with him for two hours about a variety of topics that are very dear to my heart. Tibetan Buddhism, simulation theory, hot sauce. It's all mixed in to this conversation you're about to listen to. We're going to jump right into it first this.

Also friends, from time to time, people ask where they could find some of the music that they hear on this podcast. They look up the album, they can't find the artist. Some of these are very obscure artists that I find during my many long, prolonged crate picking sessions. One of my favorite things to do is take someone who isn't into records at all into a record store and tell them I'm gonna only be here for like 10 minutes. Then I stay in the record store for hours and hours and hours and look up every once in a while from one of my crates and just, I really just get off on the sort of despair that slowly creeps into their body and goes into their eyes. And sometimes if I do it long enough, their eyes will even jaundice up and get yellow. And I just love that, it makes me really hard and sometimes it makes me come right there in my leather pants right in front of the records. And I just love coming in my leather pants in front of old records. Anyway, the point is some of these albums that I find, some of these artists that I find, they are difficult to find, they're not online. So I have compiled a lot of them over at my SoundCloud. If you just look up Dunkin' Trussell SoundCloud, you should be able to find it. Okay, so I've been listening to this incredible audiobook which I highly recommend for anyone who's interested in Buddhism, it's called Cynicism and Magic. And today's guest was the narrator of that book. He isn't just an audiobook narrator though, I'm sure you already know who he is. He is one of the greatest folk singers ever. I've been listening to him for a long time. So when I started, when I realized he was narrating Cynicism and Magic, I was thrilled because Cynicism and Magic is a compilation of lectures given by Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche. And anyone who's been listening to the podcast for any amount of time knows that one of my teachers, David Nickturn, was a student of Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche. You know David from the Midnight Gospel or from his awesome books. So it was an incredible pairing to hear one of my favorite folk singers reading transcripts of lectures from Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche. So you should definitely check out the book, it's called Cynicism and Magic. It's on Audible. It's obviously you can get it in print too if you don't like audiobooks, but highly recommend it because DaVendra is just like the perfect spiritual audiobook narrator. It brought me back to when I used to listen to like Ram Dass lectures with my mom. So anyway, check it out. So I reached out to him on Instagram just to say, whoa, you did an incredible job reading this book. And we started talking a little bit and then somehow the grace of God, the powers of some as of yet unquantified alien love force, some incredible good luck. Maybe the thing really is just a simulation and part of what I dialed into my simulator was that I got to have this conversation with one of my musician that I have a good, look, I'm gonna just say it, okay? I almost fanboyed out here. Anyway, I'm not gonna keep rambling. With us here today is the incredible, the mystical, the amazing, the beautiful DaVendra Banhart everybody. Welcome to DaVendra Banhart to the DTFH. Give him a round of applause, wherever you may be, and keep it going for the length of this episode. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome on you that you are with us. Shake hands, glory to be blue. Welcome to you. La, la, la. It's the Duncan Triton. So I'd like to say that on the record, everything I say is off the record. Oh, shit. Well, it's going to be a real long, empty space. It's going to be a challenge for my editor, but he can handle that. Aaron, did you get that? You're going to have to cut everything out, he says. Do you still cry when you get home from the road? I cry all the time, all the time. I cry more and more, and I cry like in that same way that I can't fall asleep. If I tell myself to fall asleep, the minute I say don't cry, the water works. Just, I'm just immersed in tears, you know? And it's always like, in not in a cool place or in a cool way that someone might see me crying. Yeah. It's always, you get waiting in line at the post office or something. Oh yeah, yeah. It's not, I mean, it's in the last place. You see, if you see. Just someone being nice. It's a good sign when you start doing that, right? I think, I think it feels good. I think so. I think it's better to be somebody who cries often than I can't remember the last time I cried for sure. Don't you? Oh, yeah. Ramdas, he would just water works. Like he would just cry. It was just like Hawaii, his face was like Hawaii where I'll just randomly just start raining, you know? And he would just cry and it was, it wouldn't even, wouldn't do the thing I do if I'm crying where I didn't go into some awful, weird, like wiping, do I wipe my tears? Cause then I seem like I'm doing performative crying. Do I ignore the tears? Well, then I seem like, look, I'm the person who just cries. So I get very neurotic post-tear. I don't know if it's true, but I heard that there've been some studies on tears and their chemical makeup and how it differs based on the type of tear. So I don't know if that's bullshit, but we know that there's types of tears. So like to be raised to tears is really different to be than being like, you know, descending into the oblivion hopeless tears, you know? And Ram Dass, when I think of him, he makes me cry because he's radiating a state that for most of us we need to take a lot of psychedelics to get to. So just footage of him swimming in a pool and just going, this is like liquid love here. I'm just, yeah. And that's something I wanted to talk to you about is like, tell me everything because you motherfucking got to meet Ram Dass. And I had tickets to go to Hawaii, to one of the retreats before he passed away. And I was so excited. And I know that you went to many of those and knew him. And I just want to hear every detail possible. You got him. I mean, you got him. That's the, you got it. You got it. That is him. The tears, that's him. You got it. It's the same. I mean, the body, being around his body was amazing. It was amazing because you would get really high. And it's the best kind of high because you're not, you get so high around him that you, once I remember walking out of where he was and thinking, wow, this is like amazing MDMA, amazing. Like I'm so, and then being like, fuck, I didn't take any MDMA, but I'm just as high. And then that was disconcerting. Cause it's like, wait, when the, when do you come down? Like, you know, when you take MDMA, you know, when you come down, when you're around like someone like that, well, how long does the buzz last? You want it to last forever. But so that's, there, there's something there. But I think that the, the love that you feel is him. And that was what it was like to be around him. Mixed in with, it was like, I guess another way to put it, you know, when you're around a dying person, you know, like when, and there's this level of real seriousness, it's not like somber seriousness necessarily, but this sort of seriousness to it. So even though there could be lightheartedness around someone who's dying and usually, often there is serious, this, like it wasn't just like love and radiant stuff. There was another, there was an edge to it that was somebody who was really in the moment, which a dying person is. So it was like, even when he was years away from his death, there was that, it was something like that too. It made me think of being around a dying person, but someone going through a good death, you know? So yeah, that, I, yeah. And how did you, how did you even, did you grow up with be here now? Yes, that's it. That's when I wasn't, thank you for interviewing me. I, I love it. I'm so glad you are. I, you had, you were born in your incarnation, you come into a family with a guru. So you have this amazing incarnation. And I've, I'm not doing like hierarchical incarnations or anything like that, but how cool, you know, because we folks like me, we had, we stumbled upon them a little bit more, you know? Like you find be here now, or you find like Yogi Ramachiraka. My mom had this like book by a, he was a fake. Yeah, I mean, no, he's a fake Yogi. He called himself Ramachiraka. His name was like Stephen Williams. He was British and he knew Ramachiraka with some more books. But you find these things, and I think it, it like, a part of you remembers. And then that part of you is like, what is this? And then you could get lured in. So yeah, for me, it was a combo, be here now, some Jack cornfield. Cause my mom after her second divorce started dating new age hippies, you know, Birkenstock hikers who, if you had a fake gun or be like, throw that away, what are you doing kid with that thing? And so thank goodness, because that is how I got connected. And so, but tell me about your experience. You were, you were born- But do you remember? But do you remember how that copy would be here now? I do. Like were you at a book store? Did someone give it to you? Okay, so the beer now came in college, but it's actually a tapes. It was tapes. My mom had these tapes. Do you remember those? Did your folks have those? Those, the tape boxes, you know? I mean, they had little briefcases, you know, the briefcase with the cassettes. Yes. You know, little cassettes, a lot briefcases. Yes, yes, yes. That was like, it was always, it was always a khaki colored, you know, khaki or a light brown kind of briefcase for your cassettes. Oh God, I haven't thought about the case. And since I, since, oh God, that added this weird office-y professionalism to these new age tapes and my mom would open them up on the way to, to go, when we would go up to the beach to visit her, her, my grandparents, and we would listen to Ram Dass. And I would just look out the window with this look of just scorn on my face because I didn't want to like it because my mom liked it. And I was being an asshole teenager, but man, I would listen to his voice and be like, wow, I know that guy. Like it was this familiarity, you know? And then when I finally saw Neem Kohli Baba for the first time as picture, I didn't know that was Ram Dass' guru. I looked at him and thought, who, I know him. That's like my uncle. He reminds me of my uncle or something. So that, that, you know, that thing that your soul does where it's like, it remembers, you don't remember. When you meet, you know, the satsang or, you know, it's like, oh, hey, well, good to see you again. And then you kind of unravel the, whatever it is, you know? So it was like that. And then these retreats were happening. I wanted to go. You know, I had my, my mom had a dream. Was she, and this is when she was dying of cancer. She had a dream and she said, Ram Dass, this will make me tear up. She said, Ram Dass was in my dream. And he was saying, where are you Duncan? Ask Duncan where he, he's late. Tell Duncan he's late. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was cool. It was cool. I don't know. What do you think that is? I think there's definitely something to, you know, recognize the recognition, the karmic recognition, you know, some sort of recognition that goes back you know, it just goes back. And I tend to, at this moment, look at all of the, even, you know, reincarnation and so the CDs, all the superpowers, the yogic superpowers, try to just bring them into like a just day to day. So how can I climb to day to day thing? Yes. You know, so, so how does that work? And a day to day thing, like it made me reincarnation isn't real, it's not, maybe it's not real at all. But if I spend the day thinking of everyone as at one point having been my mom, I'll just be like less shitty to people. Yeah. So, okay, how can I just apply it in this kind of, regardless of if that's real, but then again, if it is real, then of course, you've been constantly going on this journey towards your own heart and you've been searching for a teacher to show you how to get to that place. Yeah. And you've been searching for a spiritual community. You know, you've been searching for your sangha and you've been searching for the teaching, let's say the branch of wisdom from this tree of truth. So whatever, however that looks, if it's true, it's true. And that's when you brought up Jack Cornfield because he told the story recently that I love so much which is about this like, is a, this Western person who's studying with this Theravada, this Theravada teacher and they're really into it and they're doing it. And then suddenly they just disappear in the middle of the night and they leave for a couple of years and they go full Christian and they come back and they're like, oh, there's Buddhist shit is all fucked up, bullshit. Jesus is the way, Jesus is the way. Like screaming this to this yogic Theravada master and all the disciples are freaking out. This lady's nuts. What are we gonna, we gotta get out. Oh, this is nuts. This is nuts. And like fending the teacher and then this teacher looks at her and goes, oh yeah, maybe you're right. And that's it. Completely, you know, all of the, it just ends the discussion. Maybe you're right. Okay. Anyways, I just love that story because it's like the older I get, like the more either, you know, the more I, when I was a kid, I thought that my job was to know everything. Yeah. You know, and my job was to be super certain about everything. And then it turns out that really it's, it's like, oh no, maybe you're right. Maybe you're right.

Because every once in a while, it happens now about every couple of years. I have this wonderful moment where I think, what if I just throw the spirituality shit out the window? And it's, you know what I mean? And I do it for a second, where it's all the fungal creep of all the stuff that I've read, it's gone for a second. And you see where Trump or Rinpoche would talk about disowning. And how powerful a thing it is to do that, to just be like, yeah, no, I don't know any of that stuff anymore. Like I don't think, I don't know. Not even that it was wrong so much as yeah. And then for a second you're left without any of it. And then that is an exciting moment, because something depressing can happen when you get too entrenched in this stuff. I mean, that's kind of the essence of spiritual materialism, which somehow people are more familiar now with spiritual bypass. But what that really means is, I'm actually strengthening my ego by being so spiritual, you know? So it's basically you're missing the boat because you're a spiritual materialist as somebody who's trying to, I'm so much better now that I'm spiritual. I'm so much better now that I meditate for an hour. And you're not even conscious of it, because the ego is so smart. And so you start to trip out on like, I'm like so non-materialist. I don't even have anything, you know? And then, you know, and I'm a good, all these things are all in fact separating me from everyone else, because I'm so much better and I'm so much more spiritual. And I don't need anything. And even the Dharma becomes a form of, you like start to use the shadow side of the Dharma for the benefit of your own ego by saying, I'm so spiritualist, I don't need anybody or anything else, nothing. And that becomes a division. Then I'm of no use to anybody. And I just like basically sit around thinking, I'm just like the best. And that's spiritual materialism. You know, it's strengthening my ego as opposed to eradicating it, as opposed to connecting it with other people. And as opposed to having that attitude of maybe you're right. Like if I was totally wrapped up in my, let's say spiritual bypass thing, which is my thing, my thing, my thing, this is the only thing. Then this lady or this person comes up to me and goes, Christianity is the way. I go, how dare you say that to me? And they go, how dare you? And Dharma's the best and the Buddhism's even way better. You know, you get into that trip. But if you're really in that place of my only kind of general mainline spot to be in is how is to not, it's not to have a dualistic attitude, you know? It's like, then I can go, oh, okay, maybe you're right. You know, that's skillful. And I don't know, wait, how did we get into this? I don't know how you do it though. What is your hat? It says nukes. It's a hot sauce. It's a hot sauce that my company, my friend makes hot sauce. He sent me this cool hat. I'm in love with it. It's just two people blowing out a nuclear mushroom cloud. And I like the shitty spelling of nukes. Nukes. Look, I gotta ask you, I'm sorry if I do like an interview question. I love this talk and I wanna jump right back into it, but I gotta ask you this, just because I've been studying you a little bit, not to be weird, but it's like you're a monk or something, but you ended up this famous musician. You're on the road all the time, all the time, but you're like a monk or something. And I feel like, but also in one of your interviews, I can't remember which one you're like, don't go to someone's trying to analyze one of your songs. You're like, a lot of these, I'm just trying to get laid. And I love the honesty in your answer there. It was such a beautiful, it reminded me of like at the Ram Dass retreats when Bob Thurman would come on stage and be like, what is beer now even mean? What is this even mean? No one even knows it. Is this nice? Truth is so beautiful in that way. But that's not all you are, obviously. So tell me, how do you manage the absurdity of having the incarnation of the beautiful famous musician and also the ego annihilating constant sort of repetition of this message that comes from the lineage that I think you associate yourself with or one of them, that this is any of this stuff, all this stuff, it doesn't last. And if you don't watch out, you can really crystallize into this form, whatever it is you think you are, how are you balancing these two? Because I think it's difficult for a non-famous person to do this, but how are you doing it from where you're at in your life? Well, the spiritual side of my life isn't really the some side, right? It's not a compartmental thing, right? So I kind of look at it like I've been really fortunate to have a career and be able to make art and make music. And I do it in a public platform, but it does feel like Ram Dass has that great quote, which was just as revelatory as when I was a kid and I heard John Cage say, I have nothing to say and I'm saying it. I thought, oh, that makes a lot of sense. I have nothing to say and I'm saying it. And then around that time, Ram Dass came across that quote that said, the spiritual experience is a continual falling down in our faces. And I thought, oh, thanks, man, because being on stage is just humiliating. I'm just like really embarrassing myself because I'm not reading a script. I'm just trying to go, it's horrifying to me to think that I'm gonna repeat myself. Like I wanna say something new and kind of have some anecdote that was fresh each set, each show. Wow. But I often say that so many stupid things, so many stupid things. I'm so embarrassed on stage. I'm not like, oh, this is me, I'm finally myself here. I love playing, I love improvising with these musicians. I love it. And I love the challenge of getting to kind of, not fuck up because it's constantly fucking up for me. And the last show I played was one of the last shows that I've ever played. So I've been really beating myself up about it because I was stiff, I wasn't skillful, I didn't like go with, I didn't, there was a lot of technical problems and I didn't just kind of like, I didn't rise up to the occasion. And so I've really been feeling a lot of shame for clamming up and kind of going in my shell. But of course you learn from it. And not really your question, I guess I would say that my practice and then my career, I couldn't really do one without the other. And it's just been a whole bunch of embarrassing experiences and fuck ups. But all the while, very aware that if I'm not, like trying my best to be as honest as possible and as vulnerable as possible and kind of follow that fear, because fear, whatever fear I have is the thing I need to be looking at. So whatever is scary to me is gonna be the most rich in terms of what I'm gonna write about or sing. And so if I'm not putting myself in that spot, I'm gonna write some shit that people can't relate to and people can sense it's bullshit because subconsciously we can sense if the person means it or not. Right, yeah. God, that's so interesting. It's so painful though, that fear, and it's so insidious, the ability to think you are going into the fear when you're not, you know, like the fact, like I love what you said about these aren't cool tears. These are tears of embarrassment. This isn't like this fucking right time tears. You're getting tears of people like, shit, what is going on with you tears? And it's like, it's so easy to seem to do cool fear. You know what I mean? It's so, you can just look and what would be cool to be afraid of, but like the real fear stuff, I don't know, man. I mean, I try to do that, you know, but God, sometimes when I'm looking down in the coal mine, I'm like, I don't know if I'm gonna exhume that corpse down there, you know what I mean? Like it's not, because it is, I think it's just not real fear. It's just not fashionable, is it? It's a good story later on, but when it's happening, it's really, it's really ugly. See, the lineage that you're studying, that I think you're studying, forgive me, because I keep saying that, but you know, with Marpa, and I've heard Trump or Rinpoche call it the mishap lineage, and I love that because, you know, for me, you know, when my wife's getting fucking pissed that the kids are screaming, and you've got like breast milk puke on your shirt, and you're like, but you're managing not to turn into a demon in that moment, because everything around you happens to be screaming. To me, that is, that's it, and it doesn't, and then, but somehow when it gets translated into Doctor Strange or whatever, you know, you've got like very symmetrical people and some very clean temple, I don't know what those are, and it's like, holy shit, man, that's just not my experience at all. You know? But God, do you got the monastery fantasy? Do you have the fantasy of going up in the mountains? I know you just did it, but do you have the fantasy of going up there and meeting a saint and becoming a saint? The thing is, my fantasy is to basically live in a Himalayan cave, but have postmates and caviar on my phone. I just, I want to get delivery. I want to make sure I can get, like, bigger fish delivered to my guy cave. God, and drones, drones though, not people, so you're not disturbed, a nice, silent drone flies through. No, I've never heard of that. A drone, maybe with a little bell, and you're whatever you ordered is there. Yes, God, that's it, man. Yeah, because the reality of the cave, see, whenever my cave fantasy, you know, it's the exact, when I met Ramnath the first time I said to him, are you my guru? And he goes, yeah, now what? I was the best. He's like, now what? Okay, so, and I think for me, my cave fantasy is identical, which is the fantasy is very much Bill Murray, Razor's Edge, you go up to the cave, somehow, and also part of the cave fantasy is my narcissism, because like, they're like, we've been waiting for you. Then they take you to the cave, and then they're like, okay, see you later. And then that's as far as my cave fantasy goes, because after that, it just sucks. You're stuck in a cave, you're just sitting there. Now what? You know, that's the problem. That's why I really love that movie Soul, the cartoon movie. Yeah. Did you see that? I loved it. Like, that was the first time I saw in a movie, let alone a children's movie, a Pixar film, I guess that's a family film. Like this person has a dream that they want so bad, which is to like, be a musician, and not just be a teacher, but be a famous, whatever it is, they had that dream. And halfway through the movie, they get the dream, the dream comes true. Halfway through the movie, it comes true. And then, and they're standing there going like, so now what? And then the singer of the band goes, well, tomorrow we play another show. You know? And so I thought, this is so valuable. Most movies don't, halfway, you don't see that after you get the thing, you just are getting the thing. So it's kind of like even, for me, it was trying to get, take refuge in Buddhism, because I was like, obsessed. I needed to get, to take refuge, I need to take refuge. And I imagine once I take refuge, all right, I'll be levitating, rainbow body right up ahead, good to go, walking through walls. Yes. And then of course, they'll you take refuge. Okay, do I feel, that suddenly like now I have more responsibility. Yeah. You know, like, it's kind of like, I imagine, you know, it's like falling in love. Everything will be perfect once I meet the person that makes everything perfect. Now, I would love to talk more with you about this taking refuge thing, you know, when I brought it up with my meditation teacher here and there, and he's sort of explained to me what it really means to take that vow. You know, it's a, and I, you know, and then I would go and study Chogum Trumper more and realize, oh yeah, the reason I want to take refuge is not because I want to take refuge, it's because I want to say I took refuge, you know? And I, you know, and those are two very different, different things, you know? And when it's been explained to me from people who have, they say, no, no, no, this is refuge as in refugee. This is like that. This is the thing like that. And that's where you need to be. Not, oh my God, spiritual materialism. Look, I took, guess what I did yesterday, everybody? I took refuge, come to my, I took refuge party. It's going to be incredible. The Van Der Van Hart's going to play. It's going to be amazing. It's not like, you know what I mean? It's not that. It's, it's something deeper than that. Can you talk a little bit about how you knew that you were ready to take refuge? You know, you just said something so interesting that I've actually never thought about, which is, but you really made it, you just laid it out in such a way that I can so relate to it. You just have never verbalized. And it is that once I get to, once I take refuge, I will have basically attained refuge. I now have refuge. So this is the attitude, but the reality is, of course, now the journey towards, towards yourself begins, let's say, right? So now the journey of basically you're, like you said, you're a refugee. Now, now the journey towards home begins. And of course, home is yourself. And what, and then you can start to, and then you use the dharma is like this incredible guide map that essentially is like someone with like a dowsing stick, but the dowsing sticks are compassion and wisdom. And so you just, almost every action, is this compassionate, is this wise? You know, cause I'm not wise. I'm not a wise person, but I have some sense of, is this action wise or not? I can get a sense, you know? And I, and a big part of the dharma too, is it goes so against, or let's say whatever, let's just say wisdom teaching, cause we don't have to say the dharma anymore. Let's say whatever wisdom goes against everything that I was taught as a human being, growing up in South America and then in the United States, as just human beings living in samsara, this phenomenal world, like a big part of the dharma is never giving up on anyone because the bodhisattva vow that you take after refuge is about foregoing enlightenment until everyone else is enlightened. Now that seems insane and impossible. And for me, I can flex, impossible, but I can have that attitude. So I can have that attitude. And so I've given up on people in my life. I've given up on people with fucking, fucked me over so many times. I'm just done with it. I give up on you. Leave me alone. But can I still maintain an attitude of never giving up on anyone? So that's an important place to, where it's useful in the anyways. I had this attitude of never giving up on anyone is it seems like to be a really integral part of not creating these divisions. And I don't know, I don't know. It's just so amazing. Like, you know, in the world and not of it, you know, how can I be of service? You know, this amazing, amazing story of this guy that's up there and living in a cave for like 40 years, doing everything, just 40 years of just pure practice, whatever that means. I'm imagining that they're constantly levitating. And yeah, you know what I mean? Talking to all the deities. And then they finally come down. They've done it all. And the Dalai Lama hears that there's this incredible yogi who's been living for 40 something years practicing. He wants to meet him because he's so famous. And he meets this person. This happened in the 80s. And he says, why are you wasting your time? Like, why don't you go help some other people? Why don't you go help someone? And the guy's like, oh, piss. Like, how dare you? And then they realize, oh, no, I see their point. And then they realized that there was this, you know, they had some, a niece who had been, oh, you know, like, some thrown into some sex slave ring or something like that. And then they made it there. They saved them from the situation. I don't know, they were just able to be of use. They put this stuff to use is my point. You know, so it's almost like, I can put it to use to separate myself from the world or I could put it to use to, you know, connect, get closer to the world and get over myself. This. OK, to underline what you just said, this is a definition of enlightenment because my ego, a gas always wants enlightenment. And I was talking to Bob Thurman. He's his definition of enlightenment is being useful. That's it. Not romantic. Nothing sexy. Nothing. No, this fucking. I don't know where the walking through walls thing. By the way, that would be so annoying to know someone who could walk through walls, like, use the fucking door. Use the door. I don't care. I don't care. You fucking didn't knock on the wall. But the yeah, being useful, usefulness. It's not sexy. There's nothing sexy about washing dishes or cleaning up or picking up or getting up early with the kids or any none of this stuff. But my God, how much is society going to fucking change if people can walk through walls? You know, it's good for one. Doormakers are fucked. It's going to ruin an entire ancient industry. You know, but number two, nothing really changes. Minus the fact that now we have no privacy. The whole walking on water thing, nothing fucking changes. Just angry people walking on water, people running across the ocean to kick someone's ass. That's it. And that's why this is so important to talk about, because we as people that are into spiritual stuff kind of hold those things up as these ultimate goals, and we never actually really and they seem so improbable and insane. And you have to be such a like super yogi to achieve that you never really go. Oh, OK, so I have that thing and now what? OK, so I can walk through walls and now what? Well, actually, it's a drag and I'm freaking people out and I'm like, you know, it's like it's really important to think about that thing that seems to be so far away and you're working so hard towards. And then it's like, but now now what? Now they have it now what? You know, I think even think about Eckhart Tolle telling the story about like, OK, so you live like just imagine yourself having all of the physical things you've ever wanted and just sitting in your gigantic mansion house. OK, here I sit and now what are things that different? I don't know. And so it's like, you know, it's this incredible. It's an incredible thought exercise to do. So I appreciate it. Thanks for doing. Oh, I love that. Thanks for saying the thought exercises. My hope is with VR, maybe that's going to be one of the potential offerings that when we get advanced neurologically connected VR, you can instead of just fantasizing it, give it to somebody. And it's like, oh, you want to know what it's like to fuck 50,000 people simultaneously? Here you go. Now you've experienced that not just the you've experienced like Krishna level humping. Now look where you're you're still where you were at before, you know? And this is so is this is this like is this what they mean? This is what they mean with some when they say some sorry, right? Like it's like we're in a kind of inescapable predicament here that disguises itself sometimes as pleasure. But it's like there's it's still always got this element of of pain to it or suffering. Is that what they mean by samsara? Oh, well, you know, the Buddha said everything is burning. And and I used to just think that's the line. Everything is burning. And I was like, that's so hardcore. That's so intense, right? It's so just OK, everything is burning. But actually, the rest of the line is everything is burning with craving, with desire, with hatred, with anger. And samsara is like and the thing is the two is the samsara is is just as real as as as nirvana. Samsara is just as real as enlightenment. It's just kind of the obscuration, let's say, right? And then, of course, I feel like I live in it so much that I can't even see it. I live in it so much I can see. And so that's why I meditate to get a sense, to remember that I'm in samsara. Because if I don't meditate, then I'm then there's no distance between me and my own thoughts. So I start to believe them. And I started to either think that, whoa, I'm like having shamanic hearing other spirits, which is actually just my thoughts, because I know they're my thoughts because no one be so mean to me as my own fucking mind and and and and and also to just not take some samsara, you know, to take it seriously, but not so seriously in a way. And that thing you're saying about like, you know, walking through walls and all these, you know, things like when I was a kid, I'd watch my parents meditate and I think, wow, like they're floating through clouds. Like I wonder what they're seeing. They must be like just going through this like wormhole of neon light, where there are all these like wild, incredible, like Vishnu and Krishna and Garudas and Herukas and just like flying through them. They must be just somewhere else. They have no idea I'm even here creeping around the house. This is my my thought as a kid, right? Yeah, I imagine my thing. And the thing is that some people are having these incredible visions. So that's also not that's also a big maybe trap is to just basically what ableism is, which is to just assume that people are just like you. Just to assume that everybody's like, like we are all fundamentally the same. We're all light and energy. Sure. But we're such different people in the way you perceive the world is so different, just even to the point that a friend of yours gets pissed off because you didn't text them back because they can't conceive that you put your phone away for an hour a day. That's inconceivable to some people. So therefore you're just an asshole for not replying to them. Right. Right. So it's like I, the reality of meditating went later on. It turns out it turns out for me because that's the thing. I don't want to say that some of the people are having that different experience. Like it's very easy to feel like, OK, someone in a wheelchair, I see that they physically have to be in a wheelchair, their legs don't work. And they're, you know, they have a different experience of the world. They maneuver through the world physically in a different way than I do. I see this person in a wheelchair and I can see that it's not easy for them to jump on this on the on the bus. Yes, I can see that. But all the people that are in like men emotionally in a wheelchair, mentally in a wheelchair, you don't see that. Oh, my God. Any you can't see the wheelchair. Have you ever had like a psychotic episode or like a nervous breakdown? I must. I think I'm constantly having one. Out of the womb. I say out of the womb. Oh, my God, you know, any time I have one or any, you know, maybe I've eaten too much weed or some or I'm having like some like just midlife crisisy thing or any if I this is the gift of my so far mindfulness and all this meditation bullshit has not prevented these episodes. Yet sometimes mid mid paranoid fantasy mid. What the fuck? Why didn't he text me fucking back? I guess I pissed him off, lost another friend, selfish me. What the fuck's wrong with me? Of course you would. Why would anyone text you back if I can just get a little bit of mind, bring the mindfulness I can at least think, oh, this is every day for some people who are completely paranoid. This is every moment. This is a hell realm experience. My shit generally will end. Well, it doesn't. But some people, I just love what you're saying because it's like, you know, anytime I'm like really getting raring up and getting ready to judge somebody, I remember like, oh, they're probably like two years into a psychotic break right now, and you're a demon because you're looking at them mid psychotic break and being like, what an asshole. Have you ever seen such a shitty psychotic in your life? What a dick. So I love what you're saying. But can we talk and maybe this isn't in you, but can we talk about the weird aspect of being human that doesn't want to let go of the ability to have that fun, the aggressive judgment thing? Like it's a really vulnerable place to go from, oh yeah, you're wrong. He's wrong. That guy's wrong. That guy's right. That girl's right. That person's wrong to everyone's just having their own experience. And I'm going to try to help all of them. Oh, oh my God. That's a big surrendering of a lot of power for some people. Yeah, but that's really so important. That's where it's at. And that's a practice too. You don't make that decision to do that. And that's it. Then I never had to do it again. That is a constant as such, but such an important practice. Hey, you know, people are just having their experience. You just said it so beautifully, because if not, I start to take the whole world personal and the whole world is something for me to fix. And the whole world is, yes, is fucked. And I know what to do. And then I'm just, you know what I mean? That's, that's like these certain words really do are so seductive. So like, if only, so this is fine. If only, if only is so powerful. So can you imagine removing it only from the dialogue? And imagine removing it isn't fair. Oh my God. This happened, but it's not fair. Whoa, if there was no, it's not fair. Then it's just like it's, it accepts accepting and let's see how we deal with it. But we don't even get to that stage because I'm just stuck and it's not fair. And of course, it's easy for me to say because. You know, because everyone's pain is so subjective. Yeah. So this advice means nothing because no one else knows my pain. Right. This is a very interesting, if only, if only this is what you this is what the screams of how when you hear people screaming and how 80% if only I wasn't in hell. I, I, I, only they hadn't done that to me. Yes. Yes. Oh God, I love it. This is how you, I'm trying to think of a good version of if only, and I, I can't, I can't think of a good anytime I'm muttering if only to myself. It's like a bad, I'm having a bad day. Yeah, I, I love, I love like the experiment. I'm just trying. Only I was having a really shitty day. If only things weren't so good, that's actually happens though. I get that one too. If only things weren't so good because, you know, it's better when it's only it's no good if only there's no good if only if only there wasn't if only then it's just now that's somewhere cursive bullshit. If only there wasn't if only yeah. I, I, I, I, when you first encounter, first of all, oh yeah. Okay. So the if only thing, by the way, in cynicism and magic when, and I was so excited when I realized you were reading it and what a great job you did. What a great job you did. But speaking of if only in the beginning, uh, Shogum, Trump or Rinpoche is saying there's a risk when I'm talking about this with people because it basically saying there's a risk of me creating fascists with this. Like if you take this the wrong way, then the if only thing, you know, suddenly as you become like some charismatic, great teacher, you have the ability to exert the if only into the world. And the exertion of the if only is fascism. And that's what I love that. Do you remember the part in the very beginning in the intro where Chugum, Trump is saying you're not going to be successful in like trying to become some kind of whatever the, the, uh, super powerful meditator person is. But sometimes it does work. Some examples are Hitler and Mussolini. Do you remember that part? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Wow. And, and, and, and like, you know, I don't know if you've read Dune or if you've, if you've read Dune or not, but the, this was what, like, did you read Dune? Yeah, those are those books that are based on this movie that just came out. The movie's better than the books. Yeah, some asshole, Frank Herbert, when quickly wrote some trill billion books about just leave the movie alone, leave the fucking movie alone. But you, like, you know, this, the, uh, um, Paul Atreides, this is his big struggle. Is he's like being sucked into the becoming this Messiah thing that, and he knows how many people will die if it happens. If only, um, is the mother of fascism, I guess. Wow. That's so interesting. I mean, I just kind of randomly opened it to page three, but it says here, usually we feel that if there is a me, I am going to benefit by it. We think that I can become great, powerful, a great powerful person. That has become a problem. The question we have to ask at this point is supposing so-called you becomes enlightened, then what? Of course, automatically the answer is that you will become a Buddha and enlighten one. You think I will preach the law. I will proclaim my wisdom to people. There is an enormous snobbishness involved with that approach to put it lightly and deception. You might find such snobbishness very light and harmless, but actually it is extraordinarily deadly and powerful. You are about to become an egomaniac. You are becoming an egomaniac. You think that you could become the Buddha himself and preach the law and gather all kinds of disciples and glow your halo all over the place. You think you could command people to do this, do that, don't do this and don't do that. It's very tricky, extremely tricky and extremely dangerous. That's exactly what you were just saying. The danger of becoming a fascist through your own egoic. That's actually, I keep referencing these strange pop culture things, but you're just whatever. I remember seeing like in the movie, like Ant-Man 2, I think. Like the main bad guy is the tall bald handsome man from House of Cards, I think. And he says, he's a bad guy in the movie. This is a Marvel movie. And he's like, earlier this morning, I was meditating and blah, blah, blah, thinking about how I was going to kill the world, whatever the fucking thing is. But I thought, this is so cool in a way. Like they also put in, they threw in something very kind of subtle, which is that we can also use these things for tremendous egoic destruction. And typically it's just ourselves. We just become like real kind of megalomaniacal assholes, right? But we can also use it to create incredible harm. And then of course it happens even with, it happens in the teacher-student relationship as well. I want to thank Disco for supporting this episode of the DTFH. I'm going to be honest with you until very recently, I thought skincare products were just bullshit. I don't know why I thought that. But then my face started caving in and I realized, oh my God, you, like all other sentient beings, are experiencing the process of aging. Not only that, you got kids, dark circles, weird wrinkles, sagging jowls and a kind of just general Nosferatu style withering was happening to my face. But I started using skincare products. I started rubbing Disco eye cream. They're incredible eucalyptus eye cream underneath my eye. They're amazing skin creams. It works. That's the point. They've got a hydrating face moisturizer.

Can you, do you, maybe you can address the, you know, cause anytime I, I talk about sugar and Trumpa, I'll get messages from people who are upset that I'm talking about sugar and Trumpa. Um, how do you, how do you square like still, you know, all the controversy surrounding him and Shambhala? I don't, I love him so much. And when people email me, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. I never, I don't want, I'm except I'm sorry. If something happened, how do you work it out in your head? How do you, you know, and it's not just joking. Trumpa, it's like the entire, um, patriarchal sort of, um, models, student teacher that, that has been going on for a long time. How do you work it in your, how do you make it work? How do you make the math work? Well, I have those similar thoughts. I have those similar questions and I ask those similar questions. To my own teacher, I've asked those questions and, um, I have that same feeling of, I, how do I reconcile, uh, some of these stories with some of the wisdom? And it's really case by case and some people it's just unpardonable and they're, and it's just unpardonable and their behavior is unpardonable. And fortunately, I haven't really had any connection with some of those teachers. So I just can see that story and, and, and go, wow, I had no connection and that's a bummer. And I'm just not interested, but this is so sad. I hate this is such a bummer. But then with someone like chugging Trumpa, who I really respect and is to me so such a important person in my life. And then I know that that's not the case for other people. I just know that based on my experience, which is the documentaries and books and talks and lectures, and then also being friends with many of his disciples, yes, my impression is, because of course I asked them firsthand. And my impression is that this was an incredibly wise and unconventional person and I just wasn't there. You know, so I don't want to put down anybody's experience and, you know, I don't want to put down any of his experience, but I can put just mine is that, that I certainly know that what is known as crazy wisdom when done unskillfully can really confuse people. And when done super skillfully, it can really confuse people. Yeah. So, so I don't know. It's like, you know, it's not from really me to say, except that I have those exact same questions. Yeah. And I love what you know. For me, it's like people, disciples, students, they're mirrors. And it's like you can see the reflection or the thumbprint of the teacher on them. And, and, and that reflection that I've seen is just so beautiful and funny and so loving that, you know, it's a bummer when you hear otherwise. But I think you've got to go by your own personal experience. And that doesn't mean that someone else's isn't is invalidated by that. It's just a confusing situation. I wonder sometimes about this crazy wisdom in the world these days. I wonder how could it even work now? Could it even work now? I, you know, the, it is so unconventional. And I think that part of the ego is it wants to reign in the teacher. And then that, you know, because it's scared, it's like you, you don't want to be obliterated. You don't want you. And so you, the idea, so to reign in the teacher, you say, okay, here's the rules you're going to follow because this is the way I've decided that teachers behave. And in the moment you do that, you've kind of fucked yourself because you're, it's like going to a doctor and telling the doctor, okay, here's how you're going to do the surgery. I'm not a doctor, but I kind of tell you how to cut my tumor out because I don't know about you, man. You know, so do you wonder, do you think about that in the age of the cell phone, how in the age of like, how, how does this being even function the way that, at least in the stories, these beings interacted with people? There's so many levels to that, but, and I certainly do think about that. And if I try to picture who's a very well-known popular teacher who kind of embodies that kind of crazy wisdom, exactly what you just said, kind of throws it back on people and can feel confrontational, but you know that there's so much compassion behind it. Who's doing it really skillfully is Zangzar Jamian Kienze, Rinpoche, who has written many incredible books, incredible books. And so I highly recommend Zangzar Jamian Kienze, Rinpoche. And, you know, and then at the same time, it's our, it's basically somebody who isn't willing to just like mime our projections, isn't willing to act out our projections for us. So like I was, I went to this, before I got into Vajrayana, I was a Zen, Zen was my thing and I was at a, at a monastery and I always sit in the quiet table. I don't want to talk to anybody anyways. Yeah. The drone, I want the Postmates in my cave to be a drone as well, you know, yes, but I'm sitting there eating my, whatever, brown rice and broccoli, which is actually tastes so good because these people know how to cook really well and go to hungry, you know, monastic food is really tasty. And I'm just eating my food. And then I go, you know what, what's wrong with me? Why am I such an asshole that I think I can't just talk to human beings? Let me go sit in the non-talking table. The second I sat down, I regretted it. The second somebody started talking to me. It was like, this is so painful, but nothing to do with them, just my own trip. But I, but, but yeah, I remember somebody saying that, like mentioning that this teacher, this one, you know, Zen teacher was a real asshole. And I said, oh, interesting. Well, why were they an asshole? And they said, well, I went to the, all the way to their retreat center and, and, uh, and I'd read all their books and, um, and I went up to them and I said, you know, Hey, here I am. Nice to meet you. And like, well, my name is Dada, and they were just like, oh, nice to meet you. And, and walked away. And they were so pissed. Like what an asshole. Because they're, they're, and then I saw right then that their, their story, it just did, their story was that I'm so connected with the wisdom in this book that when we meet, they're going to say what you actually got from Ram Dass. Most, most people don't, which is I've been waiting for you. Well, that was in my mom's dream. Actually, let me, that was in my mom's dream. They're real, they're real. I wish that it happened. You put that closer. It's not closer. Yeah. Okay. Oh, most people don't get that. I mean, most people get just, no, nice to meet you. Welcome to the work. But that's already so that turns to some people that is like, how dare you do that to me because I was sure that we were going to be like, yeah, you know, Milarepa and, and, and, and, and that, and you're going to just like challenge me because I'm so special. I'm going to, you know, that's, so it's an interesting, and you must have that too with people that are fans of your work. And they just go, Oh my God, I'm just, I get this guy gets me, this guy gets me. And so you meet and they go, Hey, what do you want to do later? And when are you, when am I moving in? Right. Nice to meet you. But suddenly you were an asshole because you didn't become a meat. You didn't become best friends. You did. Yeah. It's so, it's, I know you get it way more than I do, but I feel like that now with you, I want to move in, but the, the, um, you're very magnetic, but the, um, the, uh, the, I think that's why that's a good, that's compassion for the teacher to do that, right? Because it's like, Oh, let me just disappoint you right from the get go. Because, and I, and I think that's where people get, that's where the guru quote, quote, guru is getting trouble is because when the person comes, they don't do that. They're like, Oh, at last you arrived. I projected into your mother's dream and I brought you here. And now, you know what I mean? And there's like so much, so much bad shit that can happen if you support someone's dream of getting accolades for coming into the spiritual path. Chote is cutting through spiritual materialism in the intro. As I recall, I'm sorry if that's not the Rinpoche book. Doesn't he say, don't do this. I think he pretty much says, if you can avoid getting into this stuff, it would be better to just kind of avoid it. Cause once you start going in, you got to go all the way through. So if you can like bet, maybe the better, I just interviewed Jack cornfield and he's like, stop reading these books. I'm asking him all these spiritual questions. He's like, yeah, maybe just take a break from this stuff. And, and, but I do think that, don't you think that's compassion? But hey, I've got the book for you. It's about stop, it's called stop reading these books. It's actually a course. It's a seven year course. Yeah, I, yeah, I love, I love that. Anytime I've like that's, and that's to me, that's the gift of, of, of a real teacher is they're like, yeah, I'm going to disappoint that shit out of it. I mean, what do you want? What do you want from me anyway? But what did Joe game jumper, Bershey called it spiritual hitchhiking? I think, you know, it's like, he said, you don't need to get in someone else's car, you have your own car. It's your incarnation. It's your life. And, and, and that he would always talk about loneliness. Can you talk about loneliness? Just a little bit. Um, well, I just finished reading a book called The Friend. Um, and in it, the author writes about how some other famous author had said that any writer has to carry a banner their whole life. And the banner says loneliness. And the beauty of that is that I'm not alone in my loneliness. I'm so, I'm a lonely person. I mean, I, I, I am, I'm a lonely person that I'm, I'm lonely with people and I'm lonely when I'm alone and I need pretty much need to be alone to, to, to get any work done. Yeah. And so, you know, so much of art is to remind people that we, that you're not alone in being alone. You know, Hey, I've been alone too. Cause so much of art is to remind people that we, that you're not alone in being alone. You know, Hey, I've been alone too. So much of this experience is so lonely. Um, and that's why humor is so important. Yeah. Right. Like humor is so important. And, and when you say like spiritual hitchhiking, that's almost, that's also the shadow version. So when I say shadow version, let's say bizarro Superman version, just like the, the fucked up version of the thing. But there's another thing which we can't talk about, which you, which is you experienced by being near, for example, Ram Dass, some of these people that are so comfortable in themselves that are, that are so really like whole people, say a whole human, you know, I was talking about this the other day. It feels like there's professional people and they mostly are just very professional at being human and I don't get it. And then there's kind of these disaster people that I find myself to be. And then there's kind of like whole people, you know, and a whole person, uh, is so comfortable in themselves and is so rare that that's basically when all those, you know, during that revolutionary time in the sixties, when it's all about, you know, really radical feminism and socialism and communism and, uh, just every ism, it's all exploding and this incredible interest in Eastern wisdom is kind of like flourishing and that thirst for something more than all these material things that they, you know what I mean, but society thrown on them, et cetera, all of these young kids go to India and it happened all over the world, but particularly in India. And let's just hone in on these young hippie kids. Meeting, uh, Miraji, Neem Karoli Baba is there. And suddenly, you know, they have, uh, you know, a glimpse into a completely different world that completely changes them, completely changes them. And that's still, you know, we have this, it's more accessible than ever in a way. And, you know, when I wrote to you about, you know, Ram Dass and what's it like? I want to know what it was like to have known Ram Dass. You know, you, you kind of get that sense that they manifest everywhere since they're passing, since they're physical passing. And my, I have two teachers and one of my teachers is named Miraji. So when I was a little kid, I'd be like, Oh, Miraji, and then there's Miraji. Ram Dass is Miraji. And I guess we have a Miraji, but I didn't realize Miraji just means King. And it's just a title that you get. And his name is Prem Rawat. Prem is his love, actually lover, Prem Rawat, Miraji. And that's who taught me how to meditate. And he always says that if you expect to see this like fat, bald, bald man walking down the street with a sign that says Buddha, or you're saying, hi, I'm the Buddha. You will never see the Buddha. You will never see the Buddha. You will, you will, but if you see an act of compassion, an act of kindness, an act of awareness, you know, that's where you'll see the Buddha. You will see the Buddha manifest through these things. And so therefore the Buddha is everywhere. And that's, and that's, that's, that can sound insane or very utilitarian, really applicable, right? And, you know, that's, and that's how you maintain that relationship. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. Like I, like my neighbors must think I'm nuts because I'm like, I'm jogging around the neighborhood and I'll like bow at certain trees because I've read about those trees in the sutras and therefore I bow because that tree reminded me of the Buddha and so I'm grateful that I was reminded of the Buddha. So I'm just bowing, but it just probably looks like I'm a nut who worships trees, which is nothing wrong with that. The older I get, the more I want to be a guy who wants to, to hug a tree as for as long as I can. Oh my God. You know, that when my kid, when I took him up into the forest, he just started hugging every tree and kissing them and calling them babies. It's so beautiful. You'd hug them or you'd point to a tree and like, want to kiss that baby. Like, but this, this is to me that, that, that, what you're describing bowing the trees, that consciousness or knowing like, yeah, stop looking for the Buddha in this, in the, in the, in that, that think of the Buddha more as like, uh, that, uh, call a caldera, like a, when a volcano just, it's like maybe the opposite of a volcano because a volcano is all destruction. This is suddenly something comes blasting out of you that you're like, what, or in, or in the connection between when you're being useful. It can, you know what to bring it full circle. It happens when you're being useful. This creates a circuitry through which the Buddha appears, you know, not as a being necessarily, but as that moment where you're like, oh my God, I didn't do the thing this time. I didn't freak the fuck out on someone this time. It wasn't pretty, not patting myself on the back. Don't deserve a Nobel Peace Prize, just cause I didn't like start screaming when everyone else in the house was screaming, but I didn't start screaming. And then, you know what happens after that? Suddenly that's when you're getting the text from your wife saying, I love you so much. You're a great dad. And you're like, oh wait, it didn't stop there. All of a sudden now my days a little better and her days better and the kids days better. And then if that happened to everybody all around the planet, that's when we enter into the great new age awakening or the Maitreya comes or whatever. The Maitreya doesn't come, maybe the Maitreya, I'm sorry, I'm ranting and you're on. The Maitreya doesn't come as a being. The Maitreya comes as this like cumulative compassion shower or something that's pouring out of people all over the planet and they're around, whoever they're around. Oh God, I'm sorry for the rant. You brought it out of me. I'm sorry. Well, you know, Maitreya, actually it's Robert Thurman who told, who said that, was mentioning that Maitreya at this moment manifests as dogs and cats. Wow, God, he's such a mindblower. They're just non-judge, they don't judge us and they just love us and they're just looking out. And I thought that was quite helpful because there's a dog that yaps at me while I do, while I practice my sadhana out in the garden. It's just screaming at me the whole time while I'm doing prostrations and trying to meditate. And so I just remember, oh no, this is the manifestation of Maitreya. And it's just guiding me along. It's just going, yeah, you go girl. All money, bad my own. You got this. Oh my God. So it kind of helps. I couldn't do it. But that kind of perception is so, you know, it's difficult to, it's one of these things, like so much spiritual practice is simple but extremely difficult. And to get to that place of one taste, you can't, you know, one taste, how liberating would be one taste. And you could give me some dog shit and you could give me like the most delicious dish on the plate. I can't even tell the difference. It's all the same thing to me. That sounds insane, but that's a real superhero. You know, I remember this story about my teacher going on a little retreat, traveling through the Himalayas with Dilgokinse Rinpoche. Wow. And they stayed in this, some like little hut that they were, they were, but it was a nice, it was a very poor little village, but the night, the nicest place was still like a little hut, you know, in dirt floors. And there's, but they're, it's the nicest thing they've got. And they give it to the, the, the, the retinue and all the people. And they're sitting in there and, and my teacher who's quite young at this moment, whose name is Netan Chokling Rinpoche, is him and all the other Rinpoches are like, in hell, there's a billion mosquitoes covering every inch of their body and it smells and it's uncomfortable. It's super hot and they're just like, uh, miserable. And they look over Dilgokinse Rinpoche and he has this huge smile on his face. So calm and he's looking around and he was like, do you don't see these incredible dakinis everywhere? And he's, and he's talking about the mosquitoes. Whoa. Like he's perceiving these mosquitoes as angelic beings, like beautiful fairies. Okay. Imagine like little fairies that are like singing a melodious song to you. And he's just, that's how he is perceiving that. And that, and so it's like, whoa, this is probably the true meaning of when we say, I want to give you empowered and I, and what's my part? Like, whoa, you know what I mean? And, you know, and, and so at the highest level, you're seeing mosquitoes as these melodious fairies at the lowest level, at the simplest level, at the first base level, it's forgiveness. Who, how about, who can I not forgive? You know, and there's a long list usually, right? Parents are usually on there, but like, like forgiveness is like, and actually this is one of the, my favorite quotes in the Bible, before you enter the temple, forgive. Uh, yeah. God, it's so hard sometimes. I mean, it's like a, how do you, I get so confused about that term. By the way, we've done a minute, it's an hour and nine minutes. Do you have more time or do you need to go somewhere? Because I would love to talk about forgiveness with you. Of course. I want to talk about nukes. By the way, not some cheesy sponsor, just a friend. He's got, but it doesn't sponsor me. He's just a friend. I feel cheesy now, but nukes is, is a delicious hot sauce, but not a sponsor. Um, uh, it's freaking good. Forgiveness. I don't, at this point with forgiveness, with the people I can't forgive, I try to forgive them. I don't even know how to do it. I can't, the company, especially like people, you can't really have a con, you know, those people, I don't know if you have these people, you probably don't, but people are like, I can't have a conversation with you without, if there's no conversation to be had anymore. And then I want to forgive them. And then I imagine, I guess I forgave them, but I'm still pissed. How do you know when you forgiven? Yeah, that's a good question. You know, and then, and then how do you know when you, well, forgiven and forgive is different though, right? And sometimes we are forgiving in order to be forgiven. And then it turns a little bit like that's the dark side of forgiveness. When it's kind of just doing it for our own, because it is for us, because some of those people will never forgive us. Yes. And some of those people are dead. Yes. And so forgiveness is for us because they can't hear me saying, I forgive you. But at the same time, do I want forgiveness only so I can feel better? You know, so there's some, I know this sounds like I'm saying the same thing, but there's a distinction there between like genuine forgiveness and the forgiveness that is only, that is coming from a kind of more selfish spot where it's like, I just want to look like I'm a really good person and not feel the guilt and shame anymore. So I'm going to forgive in order to be forgiven. It's not so much liberation there. It becomes a little bit more of a trip. Yeah, totally, totally. And it's like, it's almost like a place to start is who is just, can I not forgive? Yeah. Maybe you start with that and then, and then try to look at how it would look like to forgive someone because it also turns out it's a practice too, forgiveness. Cause it is, you know how we do that often? Like I have, you know, maybe some weird thing with my mom and it'll be like, oh, how are things with your mom? Oh, good. I forgave them. So we're good. And it's more, it's a, it's such a process. Right. It's such a process. You know, so it's almost like I am, I realized that I, I'm having a hard time forgiving them or it's going to take a long time to forgive them or you know, so it's an interesting thing. I love that. What would it look like if I did that? That's the key. That's, that's perfect. That's a perfect answer that solves. Honestly, that does solve a riddle for me that I've been kicking around for a while now. That I don't know. I never even thought of, of just imagining. Oh yeah. What would it look like if you weren't like, but it's all, it relates to what we're saying. What would it look like if I could walk through walls? Oh, well, I guess I can, like what, what is it? I can just go through the door. Like it means nothing. Yeah. You know, so what would it look like if I forgave them? And what would it look like if I had an attitude of never giving up on anyone? So this person's been an asshole over and over and over again. And I can go, you know what, I burn my hand. I mean, I, I'm just, because me and my attic brain, I need to feel the fire and annihilate my hand and I have to burn it 20,000 more times in order to get it through my head. You know, okay. Thank you so much for giving me your time today. Oh, I feel like, should we start the interview? Oh, I would listen. I'll talk, I, I feel, I'm very, I'm feeling very sensitive about your time here. I could go on forever. Honestly, I, um, I know. Thanks for taking the time. I hope, by the way, yeah. So like I said, everything is off the record. Delete everything I just said. Okay, fine. I really will. And then I want to ask you about the synthesizer. Then I get to, which one? Well, behind you, the synthesizer. Yeah. Have you, are you tracking today or often? For my podcast, I, so I like to make songs at the beginning of my podcast, just fun, stupid songs. I love making music. I'm not a musician. I love making music. I've got over here, I've got a ton of modular synthesizers, which just, I just sit and make noises on them and all my musician friends, especially like, like producers are like, they look at them with some pity generally, because they're so chaotic. You can't dial anything in. And, but yeah, it's a Moog one. That's a sub 37. That's a Moog Voyager in the background there. And I'll just tinker around. You know, it's like, at my age, you either get into like cutting wood. You know, you become a carpenter or something. Are you getting a modular synthesizers? Go to, you ever go to Perfect Circuit? Do you go to Perfect Circuit in Burbank ever? Do you ever go there? It's all people my age just coming in and buying like weird fucking synths, because that's what we do. You can, you just sit and you make noises and it's so liberating. That's what it, that's what it is. And then you get better at it. You know, it's like, I'm learning how to play piano. Like it's, your neurons start changing or something like, you know, like I'll come back to the piano at home and realize, holy shit. I'm like playing piano now. Like I, my hands are doing it. You know, cause you, I guess you grew up studying music. You must have. When did you start playing music? Oh, I have that has yet to happen. Yay, great, great. That makes me feel better. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's just, I can't believe what a cool thing to the thing is also here's the other thing. I get to sit in my studio and fiddle around on this Mogue one and I don't have to finish a song. No one expects me to make good music for my podcast. I've been tormenting people with shitty songs on my podcast for years now. I was like expecting it to get better. So, so, um, but you, my musician friends, my God, I remember when I, my friend Emo, when I came to see him play and then I was like, come, come on, let's go out. And he's like, I, I can't go. I've got to unload all the equipment, take the equipment off the stage, put it in the truck. And then I realized, oh, it's a, you're a moving company. You're, you're moving every day. You're moving gear on stage and you're having to do these sound checks and then you perform and then you got to unload the gear and do whatever you do after. And then you got to get back to your hotel, but you got to wake up early the next day because then you got to get to the next show. And it's like, I get to be in the studio and just fiddle around. I mean, it's, it's heaven. I don't think the touring musician thing, man. Fuck. Are you working on a record? That seems rough. Is there a record on the horizon? I have. Okay. Now you're dialing. Okay. Come on. You're, this is my every question. It's a real question. I have a secret fantasy of one day making a record. I have a ton of songs that I've made and I'm getting better. But my feeling with that is I want to, to, to get a little better at, I'm like, I want to start taking some vocal exercises and like get a little better so that the record is more than just like, so that it isn't, so that maybe it will surprise people. You know? Is there an album that you aspire to, to, to that, that feels like that's in the territory of what you would like to make? Yeah. Like Daniel Johnston, you know, like some, like, like that kind of stuff. I really love that kind of folk music and Sebado I really love or like, you know, if I could really aspire to make great music though, it would be more like ween or, you know, the flaming lips or something like that, you know, like, but this is an aspiration, you know? I mean, like I could never make music like you make because my voice is horrible and I can't fucking play guitar. So like, I'm never going to be able to do your guitar. That is literally the definition of, that's if you like, that's not the definition of what I do, by the way, but whatever. No way. Come on. You don't, you can't, so you're saying you can't play guitar. Come on. Well, you know, I don't know what I'm doing. It's a, it's a, it's still a mysterious instrument to me. I don't know. I don't know how this can work. Get out of here. Am I going? Give me a break. Oh, that works. I've been researching you. I've been watching you sitting, playing beautiful guitar and like beautiful studios, like you're so calm and you're beautiful. Oh, damn. I fell for it completely. Is that an app that makes it seem like you can play guitar? I want that app. I need that in my life. I would do that. I, I mean, that is coming. That is coming. We're all going to be synthesized, you know, and just like have more talented versions of us being replicated on various media feeds that aren't even us, just some viral contagion AI version of us that's like spreading and. I mean, that's a really fun thought. You know, like the amount of things that were inconceivable to a human society a hundred years ago that we possess now, they're just inconceivable. And if they saw physically, if they saw some of these things, like what we're doing right now, they would have a heart attack. Yes, for sure. Like they would have a heart attack fully. They'd go like and then some sort of breakdown and then maybe like like catatonic or something just because it's in, it just, it's so wild. It's just so inconceivable. There's this mini person I'm talking to at the same time. And then the thing on the screen, this just makes no sense. So it's just so, and it's, it's just so obvious that if the human race is still around, there'll be these things that are just deeply inconceivable to us. So it's so fun. That's basically the science fiction, right? What, what is, what are those things that are just so inconceivable? So, so, so, and then here's the beautiful paradox. How can you conceive of something that's inconceivable? You can't. But that's the fun game. And then it's like what behavior today is going to be so fucking insane to people in the future. There's obvious ones like racism, but then it could be something like, they wait, look at the way, look at these people. They used to hold cups, like, they used to hold cups. Like how could they think that that was okay? Yeah, we have no clue as to what is some of the, there must be some, there are for sure some things that we cannot even conceive that we're doing that the human, future humans will be like, we'll just go like, how on earth did they think that was okay? They fucking touch plastic. They touch plastic. They're gonna, that's gonna be one of them. They drink out of fucking plastic and everyone's like, what's this cancer? Why do we all have cancer? They were drinking out of fucking plastic. The whole species just slurping back, fucking play with just buy a plastic cup or go to a store and they would get a plastic cup and put a plastic straw at it and slurp it. And then they'd be like, why? Why am I getting so sick? I don't understand what's happening. You're drinking a fucking like hardened chemical that was made somewhere you don't even know. I think that's gonna be one. Probably the other one's gonna be like social, like they're gonna be like, they let the algorithm control social media. They were just like, no, there were no regulations about algorithms. They were letting an AI hijack their nervous system and they were just like, why do I feel like shit every time I go on Instagram? You were getting hijacked. But then yeah, there's gonna be other stuff too, like the coffee handle or just kind of like, my God, how did they do it with only two arms? And they didn't have the prosthetic arms that did whatever. But it has to be inconceivable to us and sound. So, so we'll actually know it doesn't work that way. I was gonna say something like they don't like once a day you have to by hand pull one of your teeth out. That's a completely normal behavior. And that's just how it works. It's crazy they didn't do that. It could get worse like that. They know it's like they wondered why is the human lifespan only 80 or 90 years? Well, it's because they weren't pulling their teeth out. They weren't doing the teeth pulling Richard. The teeth were killing them. I know you mean like the singularity or the contemplation of whatever is on the post, the horizon after chips get to a certain speed. We can't come up with it there. There's no, I mean like Kurzweil says we, have you ever had the singularity is near by Kurzweil? Yeah. Okay, I don't know how long it's been since you read it. Revisit it, check out the predictions and goose bump city because it's like he predicted the mRNA stuff that's happening right now. That was one of the lead ups to like right around the corner is a computer that's as fast as a human that works as a human brain. And then right around the corner after that is a computer that works like every human brain on the planet. And then right around the corner after that is the during the all diseases cured. And then right around the corner from that is the ability to reconstruct your at your atoms or something at an atomic level. And then, but I'm sorry, I did have a question earlier. Do you ever worry that this is the, we think we're in the bar, the human, the bardo of becoming the human bardo. But in fact, we're in the bardo thought all in that the technological stuff is actually just the hallucinatory experience, proceeding our next incarnation. Great question. I actually don't go that far. I sometimes do think that in any moment, like I'm actually in a, like a yoga studio in Sebastopol and the shaman who's probably from Santa Cruz, but went to Peru once is like going like, Hey, hey, wake up, wake up. Yeah. And I've just been on like ayahuasca and they threw in a little ibogaine in there. And that's been happening for the last 20 years. So maybe I'm just having that kind of experience. But then the thought that, you know, some teenager is going to click on this level of, of this year, because I'm inside of a little chip. Like I'm in Sims and there's a, you know what I mean? And it goes up to like the year five billion, but I'm just one little program in the year to 21 November 22nd. And then I'm just going to see this giant teenager in the sky, like playing my neighbor. Yeah. Is a fun thought. That's for sure. But then in terms of like, you know, what you're talking about, how you keep continuing, like, let's just say like the evolution of humanity and how that, you know, basically you're just applying logic to such a high and incredibly intelligent academic degree that it seems prophetic, but really you're just applying like a cause and effect. And that's one of the most interesting things when like Vedantic myth and teachings start to co-emerge with really, really high end, you know, mathematics and science. My fantasy is that we do get to the point when like, like string theory is kind of proven. And so this, what is now a concept that there's an infinite amount of universes that are almost identically the same could, could theoretically could be literally we're having this conversation, but your hat is blue is the only difference in that universe. But at the same time, that also means that there's a version of you, that there's a Hitler version of you, you know, there's an entire version of Duncan where you were that, what, how we think of as Hitler, yeah, that exists on a planet. But then how to apply that today is when I walked down the street and there's this like a homeless person that's covered in shit screaming at the screaming or not, they're not, they're passed out. And I could, and I can, and just to remember that there's a version of me in another planet that's exactly in that position. Yes. So once we get that, if that becomes, even if that is no proof of that, that can be so useful. And of course, Vedantically, that's Indra's net, these jewels that are strung by a net, you know, yeah, and there's the intimate unit. So I can, I can apply some of these, like myth, creation theories, or other world theories, or, you know, future versions of us, I can just abuse that today in some sort of compassion building capacity, you know, because it's just fun to think the human, human future, yes, humans in the future, super fun to think about. And even thinking about that reminds me that there's this great tick not Han quote, which is, you know, when you're having an argument with someone, just imagine that in 100 years, you'll all be ashes. They'll be ashes and you'll be ashes too. So it makes it really hard to have this fucking, but I'm pissed and I'm still mad at you and like just to continue the, the, the fight. Oh my God. You know, you've been, you lived in Paris. God, that's cool. Didn't you live in Paris? A little bit. You have been to the catacombs, I'm sure. You've been to the catacombs, right? And you look at those skulls and you, just what you're saying, you look at them and you're like, these people thought that they were, some of them thought they were the most important fucking thing ever. And now they're just skulls. No one knows their name. No one, these people were annoyed. There's guaranteed somewhere in there is skull that was pissed off at another fucking skull. And now they're down in the catacombs just sitting there with tourists like stealing their femurs and shit. But like, you know, yeah, I love that as an exercise. You have to remember like, it's the, it's one of the funniest things when people get really puffed up. And you know, it's like yours. You're dead meat. You're not going to, you're going to be a, you're going to be a fucking, some dogs probably going to be carrying your rib cage around the way shit's going these days. But I took it to get to the multi person. Oh, yeah, it's, it does. I mean, I don't want to be irrelevant ties by the, you know, turning into a skeleton. It's an anomaly, like, like getting whatever part of the hard drive I'm on, getting it white. But the, the multiverse idea, to venture the, I want to talk about it more from a technological perspective than a philosophical one, the idea of like, no, no, no, this is how it works. And it's not just other planets. It's this planet. It's like layers, sedimentary layers of possibility that you, your consciousness shifts through. So it's like, right now, your consciousness is sort of within this particular node or whatever you want to call it, but it could shift into any time you change or with every action, your consciousness is kind of penduluming or undulating between these almost perfectly identical onion skin layers of reality. But the potential in there gets really interesting because there's some sense of like, could I shift my consciousness through enough versions of me that I move from climate disaster, pre-fascist COVID reality to an increasingly friendly planet that it's not that the matrea comes, Jesus comes, but that you go via the shift of consciousness, you know, and then it becomes consensual. Instead of it being like, you're just hanging out on some shit planet and that thing appears out of the sky. It's like, then it becomes like, no, you, you need to swim upstream, so to speak, you know, you've got to swim up through these different reality layers. And then if you keep doing that through the exercises that you're talking about, bowing to trees, opening your heart, being compassionate, then you literally create this weird might. Now the sangha is not, it's migratory. You're in this migratory group of souls, shifting consciousness through the multiverse to whatever that place is that we hope is quote coming. Does that, do you vibe with that? Does that make sense? Oh, I love that. I love that. And that's using language, you know, it's using the sign, the language of science and then the language of selling Palo Santo and Venice Beach, but both of those are languages that we need to hear that are easy to understand. And it's a beautiful and I think very correct aspiration. And that's what I mean. Aspiration is the same thing as attitude. And that attitude can be a shift in an entire, in your entire world. And then it's also really bizarre because COVID kind of shook how much we assumed the world was this fixed, steady thing. And we were the thing that was moving through it. Not this thing, not this, not this, like interest net, not this in this intertwined web that we are a part of. It's really this thing that's fixed the world is the way it is. And just I'm the one living my life through this world. You know, it's just not the case. And that really, it was, it disrupted that fallacy, disrupted that delusion. But these kinds of this, what you said is so beautiful, which is, it's not that Maitreya is going to come down. This is Maitreya, people don't know is the following Buddha. There's been many. The last one was Shakyamuni Buddha. And then the second Buddha was actually Padmasambhava, Guru Rinpoche, who brought, you know, basically Buddhism to Tibet and then established Vajrayana. And then the, so the second, the kind of Buddha or the next Buddha, not the second, is Maitreya. And that's according to Robert Thurman, that's, he's not gonna, and of course for him, he's just a genius. It's, yeah, I mean, really, he's also, by the way, somebody, when you said, you, when you had that Ram Das and you saw Ram Das, I kind of had that with Robert Thurman, where I was like, oh yeah, you, can I please, will you, can I come home with you? And can I, I'm in your family. You're, you're my uncle. Are you my uncle? You're my uncle. You might mean my dad. I don't know what, but like, I just need to be around you constantly, please. But you know, the idea point is that we're moving towards that. We're moving towards that. And not that that's moving towards us. Like we are moving towards that is a very beautiful thing. At the same time, it's already here too. You know what I mean? It's already here. And I love this great quote. Lama Surya Das says, if God ain't here, she ain't anywhere. Oh, yeah. You know, because we have this thing God somewhere over there. And I, it's just God somewhere over there, whatever this God thing is, it's somewhere over there. And of course, these words have such baggage, but like, for example, Guru is a really intimidating word to a lot of people. Guru in Sanskrit just is Gu and Ru. Gu is dark. Ru means light. So it is that, which takes you from the dark to the light. That is all Guru means. That's cool. Yeah, it's definitely one of those words. It's got a lot of baggage around it. These, like, you got to go to one of these retreats. You're talking about all the people at the retreats. You would, the only thing you wouldn't like about it is that you got to talk to people. And it's, you know, there's a lot of people they did. Listen, I went through it there. I remember walking by these freaks, dancing, all right, Krishna, you know, I, in there like someone was like, come dance. And I said out loud, I cringe when I think about, I go, not in this incarnation. And I sat down by myself in a kirtan. I was like, I'm never going to fucking dance with those hippies, not a million years. And because, but over time, I found myself dancing here and there. And you melt slowly into it, you know, but we are similar in that sense of like, ah, just leave me alone. I want to, I want to radiate love. Get the fuck away from me. I want to feel pure love and joy. But, you know, but you know, I'll tell you, I've seen some of the teachers are really good at getting back, darting away very quickly, you know, at their like, you know, because it, how do you talk to everybody? How do you, how do you completely like open up when you're supposed to be giving like lectures and teaching? How do you like, I don't know how they do it really. I mean, well, that's actually, I, earlier I was talking and I kind of hit a wall because I got distracted and I forgot what I was trying to say. And I now remembered which is that some of these stories that we're telling about meeting people like Ram Dass and talking to Jack Cornfield and, and, you know, these, you know, living teachers, you know, maybe you've been around Pema Trojan or, you know, these people, there's such a thing as Darshan. And, and now, and that's why I was trying to say all these young kids go to India, they meet, they meet Neem Karoli Baba and they had never experienced being around a truly awakened being. And I think Maraji was totally that. Neem Karoli Baba is, is like, this is a, this is a, this is an extraordinary being. Yes. And to be around that is so different from talking about what it's like to be around that. There's nothing, it's me telling you about a drug and you're doing the drug. There's a big difference. Here's a glass, here's a photograph of a glass of water. Here's a glass of water. Try it. Big difference between those two things. So being in the, in the, even in the presence of somebody who's the real deal, let's say, you feel that is a fucking tangible physical experience and you just want more, you just want more because you get a little bit of that contact high and that contact high is called the, it's called actually just bliss. It's like a blissful feeling. It's a full body orgasmic bliss feeling where finally I feel comfortable in my body. That's valuable. That's valuable. You know, so that makes, gets it all the more so when people fuck that up and take advantage of that. Sure. But that's not the case. Oh, that's, that's, that's, that happens. But the majority, I mean, when it's the real teacher, that's not going to happen. And you're going to get that bliss sense. And that's so incredibly like, Whoa, go searching for that, please. I'll never forget having this book of a Buddhist book right next to a cookbook. And at that moment, I was like, Holy shit, this cookbook has no food in it. And this Buddhist book has no Buddhism. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get the food from that book. You know, this is how to prepare the meal, but it's up to be. Yeah. Yeah. You know, yeah, you know, my teacher says regarding that, he says, we do this in real time. And that's, I didn't know anything about Buddhism until I started talking with, you know, practice practicing it. And it's not in the books. How could it be the book? It's, I know that's a beautiful thing. And, you know, when you see the playfulness, the joy, the way like, the way it looks in real time. And so, you know what I mean? It's so, it's so beautiful. It's so fun. It's funny. It's like, it's, it's, it's definitely not. It's like what we were saying earlier about like the technological singularity, not being able to imagine what it is. You know, my encounters with it, when I've gotten to really, when I've gotten is like, oh, fuck, this is not what I was in these books. This is way better, way, way better. I couldn't have imagined it in a million years. If I tried, I couldn't have come imagined it. So yeah, I know, you have to, you have to go, you have to go to it and ask for it too. I mean, that it's very polite. It's not going to come stalking you. Yeah, is this very true? It definitely wants to be, it requires your participation and your collaboration. And I was talking to my friend Sam, who was one of Chagrin Trangpa Rinpoche's students. And he was saying that, that, that Rinpoche was extraordinary and ordinary at the same time. And that's what made it so, made him so extraordinary, you know, extraordinary and ordinary at the same time. And that he, and Rinpoche made him feel safe and comfortable while having his ego scorched. This is, I've heard this too. And that's the ordinariness of it. But, but I'm so far from any of those zones. Like when you say like, we're moving towards Maitreya and this like incredible, I mean, of course, out of the fucking pandemic, what is the fundamental philosophical question is what will be better humans? That's the hope. What will be better humans? Yeah. But I'm so far from being there in my life that I have to return to certain teachings like Charlotte Joko Beck is a wonderful Zen teacher. And she has this amazing thing about just like adding the extra face, like the extra face, which means like the extra, like I'm suffering today, I'm going to suffer. She's going to go wrong. But the extra that I add to it is where I can kind of be conscious and it can be just as fucking simple as holding this cup. Like you ever, you ever noticed you're like talking on the phone and then you kind of look down at your hand and it's like, it's like kind of really tense. Yes. It's like you're holding the cup like way harder than you need to in order to get a cup in your hand. I'm clenching a pin right now. You notice, you go, whoa, wait a minute. So like, let's just like not add the extra face. Right. We're adding the extra here. So it's like, just kind of spend the day being like, where am I adding this extra shit, this extra tension, the extra thing? We just subconsciously do that. So I'm at that level. This is very infantile. Am I infantile infant, but it's like, oh, fuck, can I just like, like, why is my butthole like just like a pin? Let's just relax. Oh my God. That butthole awareness is really intense when you're like, what am I doing with my asshole? It's like, what? There's like no, there's no threat. What am I doing? There's always trying to throw rocks into my ass right now, but I'm clenching it like there's a knife thrower and it's the bullseye. Like, you know, what, what is that? That is the true. May you, may you practice BA butthole awareness through the day. The famous bulls. May your butthole, may your butthole be free from suffering. May your butthole be full. May your butthole be safe. Yeah, I love that. I am so bad at that. I'm such a ball of tension all the time. It's like to like, I get scared when I relax too much, you know, like it's, I get worried. It means I'm failing. If only, if only I was more uptight. If only I wasn't so relaxed. Yeah, I know. I know, I'm, I'm, I don't like wearing sweatpants. I'm a never new. Anytime I start like, slowing down and getting calm, I get like freaked a little bit, like, but I'm working on it, you know, I'm working on it. It's just yeah, I'm there. Look, I'm in the very, I'm, I'm not even, I'm not even in the beginning phase yet. I'm, you know, I'm, my meditation teacher once said to me, Duncan, am I a medic? Do I, what do I do? What am I? And I'm like, well, you're my meditation teacher. And he goes, do you meditate? And I'm like, no. And he goes, well, then what does that say about me as a teacher? Oh, how, how, you know, what I love though is like, I was reading this Buddhist text and it was talking, there's some realms where the Buddha hasn't appeared at all. And how lucky we are that we live in a place in a realm where it even happened at all. Because sometimes in some of these multiverses, there is no Buddha. It's just a void of any Dharma. And, and that, and the cool thing for me, at least about the Dharma is that I kind of think I could be any religion and still totally find the Dharma applicable. So therefore I, I'm happy to be Buddhist, but it doesn't feel that way. It feels like I can just use some of this information to be reminded of that. And one of those ways to do that is the four thoughts. The four thoughts is a really, really big part of Buddhism. And the four thoughts, four, four, four thoughts, which we're supposed to kind of always keep in mind when the first one is precious human birth, you know, to be born a human being, because, you know, an animal is kind of constantly being hunted or hunting or just working on instinct. A ghost, of course, is just like a ghost. And of course, in Buddhism, there's the pretas that have these tiny little throats and they're giant stomachs and are starving and they try to eat, but it doesn't go through the hole. And, you know, it's just that's torturous, obviously, place to be. Then there's the demigods. And they're just kind of like, wow, we're demigods and can do anything we want. And so we don't have that much of an interest to try to like, you know, become enlightened because we're kind of ready to demigods. Plus, they're busy being jealous of the gods, just the other realm. And they have nothing to be bothered because it's perfect, even though over eons they will die. But it's so nice and pleasant to be a god that you're not really tripping out so hard. So we're like basically Goldilocks in terms of like anxiety and neurosis and desire and thirst and potential, right? So it's like, wow, I'm so fortunate to be born a human. So that's the first thought. I was born a human. The next thought is, of course, impermanence. And like, who can argue with impermanence? Everything is impermanent. And our suffering is born from wanting things that are impermanent to not be impermanent and wanting to keep, you know, so it's so impermanence. I mean, that's enough. We can have a, we can talk for 5000 hours about impermanence. But that's just the second thought, right? So precious human birth, impermanence, karma, okay, karma and suffering. And it's like, how can I just keep that through the day? Just like earlier, you can ask yourself, is this action wise or compassionate? Is this action wise or compassionate? Doesn't mean that I'm compassionate or I'm wise, but I can ask myself if my action is wise or compassionate. And then through the day, I can remember, okay, here are the four thoughts, precious human birth, impermanence, karma, and suffering. And I don't need to be Buddhist for that to help me. I don't need to be Buddhist in order for that to help me, you know, kind of gauge whether this, this activity is going to be of any use, it's going to be of any use. So, and this brings it back, being of use, being of use, you know, like being of use, that's such a great answer. Such a great answer. This has been fabulous. You gave me two hours. Thank you. Speaking of being, that's incredible use for me. I am so happy to have met you. I hope we keep talking. I'm going to move in with you. I'm coming back to the West Coast, just in my whole family too. I've got adorable sons. You're going to love them. And a wonderful wife will all get married and live together. Wonderful. I can't wait. I'll see you at, I guess, 4 a.m. is probably pretty good over here. Yeah. I'll need that much time to get it all, everything in order. And, okay. Yeah, great. And really, really looking forward to hearing your album. Okay. Thank you. I think many people are, and now I am really, really, really, and I'm, and you better not fuck it up and you better make it real good. All right. You better not let me down. I will not. Listen, now I have someone to make the music for. So, you know, that's the next, that's my first album. It's going to be for you. And, and I won't let you down. So, yeah.

241^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Emil Amos Transcript and Discussion^2017-04-20^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, friends and family, and thank you for tuning in to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's me, Dunkin' Trussell. This is a Monday morning, and this will be the probably 19th attempt I've made to try to record an opening to the podcast because this is the first Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour that I've released since my mom died, and I've made multiple attempts to try to say something about that in the opening of the podcast, and everyone has ended in failure because in every single one, I've put on this false bravado or tried to add some kind of thing that I've learned and it's all lies because I don't feel particularly brave and though I think I've probably learned something, I don't understand what it is yet enough to talk about it. I do wanna say thank you to all of you for all of the many messages I got after my mom died, all the incredible tweets and emails and posts on my message board. It has been a light and a lot of darkness, and for that, I thank you. I don't want this podcast to just be this constantly modeling thing, and I don't wanna prematurely talk about what it's like to go through the grieving process, so I'm just not gonna talk about it until I understand it better, which is something I rarely do, which is why I often seem like an idiot. In the meantime, I've recorded two episodes of the podcast that are in the can, this one coming up with email, and then I've got another one with Natasha Leggero that I recorded, and I'm really excited about one that I'm going to record this weekend with an artist that I discovered recently named Jim Woodring, who is a visionary artist that uses graphic novels to portray this alternate dimension where this being called Frank wanders around. I highly recommend checking out this graphic novel, especially before the podcast comes out. You can start with the portable Frank. Somebody gave this to me when I was on tour, somebody gave me a copy of this and nailed it because it's exactly what I like, and this guy is channeling something that I haven't seen channeled since Terrence McKenna. It's supremely psychedelic, and it's silent. It's a silent comic, if that makes sense. There's narration from time to time, but mostly silent, it's black and white, and it's basically about this strange being that wanders around this alternate dimension called the Unifactor. And I was so blown away by the thing that I sent an email to Jim Woodring as I often do to people that I'd like to talk to on the podcast with no expectation of ever hearing back from them, and he actually wrote me back. And we're gonna record an episode this upcoming weekend. So lots of cool stuff happening. Also, I have a new podcast studio room in my house, which I'm working on right now. There's gonna be video and better microphones. I don't think the microphones are particularly terrible, but I'm gonna really go for it and buy nice microphones. And we're gonna end up with a video component on this eventually, Dustin Marshall, who runs and is the CEO and president of Feral Audio. It's gonna help me set that up. So that's on the horizon. Thank you all for your patience. I know that it's been a long time since the new podcast has come out. And for those of you who haven't unsubscribed or given up on the thing, Hare Krishna, thank you. This grieving shit sucks. It really throws a monkey wrench into the goddamn brain, Ben. But holy God, I think we've done it. We recorded an opening to the podcast. Okay, so before we get the podcast going, let's do some business. Following this paid advertising project by the Hanselin Twins, Incorporated. Moments of history with inspirational speaker, Norman Lake in 1945, and the United States of America experienced one of the worst outbreaks of syphilis since the 1924 black hole disaster in Massachusetts. These syphilitic sores that began to afflict anyone of the humping age were so virulent that they did not remain on the genitals, but spread up into the chest from the genitoregions. The chest became the new home of syphilis sores. The chest became the final frontier. Syphilitic sores are erotic wounds that I have experienced many times in my life. The pain from a syphilitic sore is akin to having a tiny little demon prodding his pitchfork into your genitals while spraying his salty demon giz into the open sores. Now imagine that pain if it was not localized on your penile shaft, but it's spread all over your upper torso. The pain was so intense for one entrepreneur that in an act of desperation, he went into his infant son's bedroom, tore off his filled diaper, and rubbed it against the sores of his shells. The effect was so soft and so soothing that at that moment he innovated a new form of clothing that he would call the thank you shirt. A shirt comprised of 80% diaper and 20% shit. The shirt was immediately a success and so many victims of the horrific outbreak of syphilis were soothed by these not soil-tainted diapers that they wore on their sore-ridden chests. Over time, of course, they realized that the excrement was not necessary, that really the only thing that made them feel better was the softness of the diapers because everyone at that time had been wearing thorn suits and wool made of steel fiber. These days, it's almost like we're wearing steel fiber again, isn't it? If you put on a regular run of the mill, Hain's shirt's practically like Satan himself came and spanked your back and chest with his thorny fanged fingers. No, shirts have really jumped the shark these days. All except for one. One company is still producing shirts softer than a dapper-filled, baby bowl. These shirts can only be made in Thailand because of President Barack Obama's draconian industry. Obama's draconian industrial rules that don't allow fetal stem cells to be mixed with cotton material in the creation of shirts. But at Shirt is on T-shirts, we aren't held back by these ancient, antiquated rules. The shirts at Shirt is on T-shirts are so soft. Mmm. Mmm. Because they're 20% fetal stem cells and 80%, pure Thai cotton, collected from the vulva dander of the beautiful ladies of Thailand. Shirt is on T-shirts sponsors this great and wonderful podcast. So why not go to shortesont-t-shirts.com and check out their beautiful shirts? If you decide to buy one, you put the name Duncan in, you will get 10% off. Thank you so much for listening. My name is Norman Lake, and this has been Moments in History. The Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is also sponsored by Audible.com. Audible has the largest collection of audiobooks known to man. I am currently listening to Parallel Worlds by Machio Kaku, which is an incredible book about the multiverse, what's called M-theory, membrane theory, and sort of from a physics perspective, shows how we are existing in a infinite universe that probably consists of trillions of universes budding off from each other, bumping into each other, and that there could even be the possibility of communicating with beings in these other universes, not just with mushrooms, but with futuristic satellites. So if you like audiobooks and you wanna freak out your little brain, if you feel like pulling your brain's pants down and giving it a spanking while it squirms around in the bed, trying to escape, but not trying to escape, the skilled and deft hand of cosmologist Machio Kaku, can't even say his name, but he will spank your brain until your brain explodes all over your mattress. So go to audible trial, Ford slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership, download parallel universe worlds, and if you don't wanna keep getting an audiobook every month, which I don't know why you wouldn't, you can cancel and you get to keep the book. So it's basically a free book. Go to audible trial, Ford slash family hour, sign up, they send us 15 bucks. You get a free book. That's a win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win situation. And as always, we have a portal for amazon.com. So if you are buying lamps, window shades, foot creams, fingernail removing polishes or ear expanders, whatever it is that you're going to amazon.com for, go to dunkandtrustle.com first, go through the Amazon portal and we get a small percentage of it. Go do it. Amazon has everything. I do almost all of my shopping on Amazon. I'm about to buy bird tape from Amazon, which I think is just tape, but it's tape you put on your window because birds don't understand reflections. And now that I have bird feeders, a bird slammed into the window today and died in front of me. So I've gotta get tape to keep that from happening. I can't have the tranquility of my porch oasis disturbed by suicidal dipshit birds slamming into my window every day. The guilt is fucking horrific because birds are such sweet little, sweet little things. Love them, love birds. I'm retired, I'm a senior citizen. Go to amazon.com, go through our portal. And why not go to dunkandtrustle.com and check out the shop? We have posters, t-shirts. I don't know where the supply level is. I've sort of abandoned ship. We've gotta get the shop fixed up again, get some new shirts in there, but you can go there. And if you really feel like going nuts, you can donate at dunkandtrustle.com and send some green energy to this podcast. But no matter what you do, I hope you'll sign up for the forum, post on the forum. We have a Minecraft server, a book club. It is an authentic community. I invite you to go there and hang out with the amazing multitude of people that go to the dunkandtrustle.com forum. They meet up in meat space and maybe you could find a friend or a lover there. Also, on a side note, coming up will be a what's coming up or what we're planning on doing is a dunkandtrustle family hour podcast tour, not a comedy tour, but I'm gonna take the podcast on the road and I'm gonna try to fly out some of the guests that have appeared on the show a bunch to different places. I don't know where the tour is gonna happen, but it could happen anywhere. So that's coming up too. A dunkandtrustle family hour podcast tour will hopefully be coming through your city within the next six months. That's the plan. Thank you all for listening. Now please open up that clogged, fluoride-ridden, calcified pineal gland and allow your third eye to go shooting out of the cage of your cranium, spraying and aerosolizing bone fragments as it shoots from your forehead and launches itself deep into the folds of dark matter that compose our cosmos to wherever the true Emil Amos Dwells casting his shadowy reflection as the human Emil Amos that is incarnating for such a brief time on the earth plane. Whatever I just said means please welcome to the dunkandtrustle family hour podcast, the musician from so many awesome bands. Ohm, Holy Sons, The Grails, a new band Lilix and Champagne, or is it Lilix? I don't know how you pronounce it. Great band. This is a super talented genius, and also one of my longest, ultimate, super best friends in the world. Emil Amos, welcome. Hare Krishna, thank you God for Emil Amos. Welcome upon you, that you are with us. Shake and glory to be blue, welcome to you. It's the dunkandtrustle family hour podcast. Now that sounds real good. That worked much better. Worked much better. Welcome to the dunkandtrustle family hour podcast, Emil Amos. How's it going, buddy? It's nice to have you back on the show. Sure is, buddy. Man, I've been digging through these old cassette master tapes that I made in college of just basically recordings in my dorm room. And I'll listen to them while I'm driving around town. It's a really like pretty intense emotional experience in general, but from song to song, it can affect me in so many different ways. And I hit like up to like four different spots that you showed up in in these tapes. Oh, really? What do I just walk into your room? It's slightly more composed and like psychedelic than that. Like I was driving along the other day, listening to this tape, and it was like this phased, stereo-delayed conversation of you talking to a girl in college who was throwing up in the shower. I mean, safe to say you have no idea what I'm talking about, right? No, I don't remember that at all. Isn't that incredible that we've finally gotten to a place that is so far away in terms of time that you literally can experience stuff completely objectively? Like you have no idea that something happening. All of a sudden, in three-dimensional sound, you're brought back to this situation that you have no idea happened. It's fucking amazing. Yeah, it really is. It's amazing the kind of low-level time travel that happens with that kind of stuff. So you're insulting my level of time travel now? Yeah, you're fucking primitive-ass time machine sucks. Doesn't encode emotional states. Doesn't encode 3D space. I have to admit, a lot of times at the medium of audio art, I do feel a little jealous of video. Like, I wish we had more video, but I do sort of know from some experience that video is less forgiving in some ways. I mean, you don't necessarily want to see pictures of yourself sometimes, but I do... Go ahead, go ahead. That dissonance that is created by any form of recording yourself is something that I'm surprised hasn't been studied more, or if it has been studied, I'm not aware of it, but I can remember the first time as a kid getting a recording device and hearing your voice for the first time is shocking to see that kind of reflection, the audio reflection. That's what a recording is. It's your recording or reflection. It's like looking in the mirror for the first time with your voice, and it's pretty much everyone universally will tell you that they hate the sound of their voice. Especially the first time, it's horrifying. It's horrifying, yeah, because there's this distance between the you that exists in reality and the you that you've constructed inside your head, and in a very small way, you get the great gulf that exists between those two entities when you hear your voice or see any kind of video recording of yourself. Well, I mean, like a photo, sometimes the internal image of yourself is slightly more correct than the one that comes out on the film. I mean, sometimes it's just a bad angle, and recordings can be like that too. Well, yeah, I mean, that is the big question is what is more accurate? I think it's a kind of seeing your, people are like, I'm not photogenic. I don't wanna see pictures of myself, or I don't wanna hear myself. It's kind of like, that's one small way that people try to avoid truth. You know, like truth is like something that you don't wanna come in contact with actively. Yeah, I battle with this concept of like, am I an over-sharer or a talking too mucher? Like, sometimes I don't know if I'm going, you know, giving too much information, but I mean, it's pretty easy for me to reconcile with because I don't, I don't like the opposite. I don't like not sharing anything. I find that like way less attractive. You mean being secretive and mysterious? No, honestly, I think that's what people would like to be perceived as when they're kind of not revealing things, but I think just, no, just more like when people let self-consciousness get the best of them and kind of think it's more tactful in the end, like to reveal nothing. I find that more offensive than just like over-sharing. Like, I mean, obviously we all know the guy that over-shares that's like, you know, worst case scenario or whatever, but in general, I'd rather know somebody's faults, like right up front when I meet them instead of learning about them in a horrible situation way later when it's actually a clutch, you know, situation. It's such a relief when somebody is like that. I think the ultimate example of that person in popular culture right now is Louis C.K. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's definitely, he's kind of pioneered some sort of new kind of over-sharing. Yeah, and it's like the effect of it is, you know, the, what being honest at that level does is it has this, it's an, it creates this kind of exorcism in everyone who's, it's a sigh of relief, you know, when you, as a comedian going in, like he does these AMAs on Reddit that are just so hilariously honest about his stand up and the, you know, his development as a comic and the way his creativity works and his ability to be self-deprecating about his process is just so, so weirdly, such a relief because, you know, with authors, you know, that's something you don't get a lot of, at least I don't know of getting it a lot of time. Like your mind constructs this when it comes to like writing or it comes to a lot of art, your mind thinks that art just kind of pops out of somebody in the completed state, you know, and there's something that's so such a relief when you hear the master is saying their initial drafts of whatever the thing is or shit. Yeah, I don't, I don't want to draw any like hard, hard lines or like sound like I'm committed to one school of thought, but it does tend to be a pattern that when this sounds pretty juvenile, but like it does tend to be a pattern that like real artists seem to me to have nothing to lose, like true artists, you know, and then people who are kind of trying to pull off a bit of an ego trick and poses like, basically they're on the hunt for some sort of attention or maybe love that they didn't get. Those people are generally much more concerned and there are emanates from a place, if you can call it that, it emanates from a place of trying to achieve the sort of simulation of who they would like to be and sell it to you, you know what I mean? Yeah, right, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, and that's dishonest and God, what an effort that is. That's got to be such an incredible effort. That's where you, that's where you, that's the beginning of the professional. Yeah, or I would say it's the, that's called entertainment, you know, that's the history of entertainment. Every entertainer knows that you put on a bunch of fucking makeup and you use, you know, the most expensive camera lenses and you practice your script tirelessly. I mean, you know, it's no secret, it's fucking movie magic, you know? It's not about like raw poetry or anything, you know? It's just scary when that doesn't end with cameras. You know, that's, it becomes scary when you come up with, you know, you come upon people who have this crafted personality or kind of, you know, like when you go into public and you realize that certain people are on a fishing expedition instead of just, you know, being around, they're hunting, they're actively hunting something. You know, like you go to a party and you come upon people. Did I ever tell you the time I was, when I was with Natasha, she had this party and some just tripping dope showed up to the party with a bunch of people brought this like fresh into town, ready to jump into the acting game girl. And she had her fucking these oversized cards in her purse with her head, with her head shot on the cards and her name and kind of like, probably her Facebook address or whatever. And she's like handing these terrible cards out to people at a party shamelessly, like that she was working that night at a party. And it was, it was like definitely one of the most shocking Hollywood moments to think, dear God, like aside from the fact that this will never work, it's like, it's just bizarre to think that that somebody would feel comfortable doing that. I mean, think of that. Imagine if you were, what, imagine, you should do that after an Olm show. Imagine if you had a little bag with pictures of you that you hand, with pictures and the resume and you handed it to people after the show. Did you like my drumming? Well, you know, I, I'm not an expert at this delineation, but you know, in music, you don't have to, you don't have to worry too much about that. In comedy, I do think the atmosphere is pretty different. And part of that is because you're in LA, so that, you know, the market that you're working in, it works very of a specific pace and a certain attitude is expected. So that's just part of like, you know, the situation. You certainly wouldn't, you couldn't come into contact with the same kind of industry here in Portland, you know, probably not in New York. I'm sure it's different in different places, you know? Well, yeah, I mean, that's the, that version of business transactions in social life is, that's just like a very extreme version of it. And there's milder and milder and milder versions of it until it becomes invisible. And, but, but it's still there. I guess the more, you know, the Pete, the more successful predators are also the most stealthy. You know, this is like someone who is just going on one of their first hunts, I guess, and is just sort of stampeding through the forest, trying to catch whatever stupid rare. And the other thing, the other thing that you see in these people is instant tragedy. Like you see immediately like, oh no, you're never, ever, ever going to be successful at acting. Like you can't, you're at a party and you can't act like a human. How are you going to act like a human when cameras are on you? It's- Well, I think the correct reaction is just to, to merely just pity them. Yeah, just pity them. Just kill them, just, just kill them. Just like immediately, just have some kind of execution device at the party where it's somewhere in the middle of the thing, everyone just lunges at them like cultists and drags them through the yard and puts them on some stony altar and chops them up and drinks their blood as some kind of- Well, I think, I think when you're younger, I mean, fuck, at least when I was like a teenager in Chapel Hill, like I sensed, I sensed that, there was this super competitive environment in the community, in music, or maybe just being cool or something. And I still to this day don't know to what extent that was all my projection because I think a lot of other people were just having fun. They were not competing. I sensed this amazing labyrinth of competition going on. And so, you know, if somebody comes up at a party and starts giving everybody business cards or something, I mean, from an adult point of view, like that's pretty funny. It's like harmless, there's nothing overall insidious about them, they're not trying to like, they're not gonna like, you know, get people to drink the Kool-Aid or do something horrible with their scheme. They're probably just gonna fail and you kind of, you know, shrug your shoulders and let them go do their thing, right? I mean, in the end, they're not really hurting. Well, they've given you a gift in the end because in the end, they've given you this. What not to do. Yeah, and not only that, but just this juicy morsel, like this memory that you can always pull up into your mind when you wanna contemplate some specific, pathetic being. There's something enjoyable about like the, when you contemplate that, you know, I think that that's kind of the gift that people like that give the world is they get, it's like a little mini entertainment DVD that you can play when you were wanting to load something. I think that I've already told this story in one of like the, I think it was a lap under hour thing, but one time, one of my favorite stories that hopefully in theory gives way to some other sort of insight is that time we were down, I was down at your house and I was playing, I was playing at the gig. You remember that horrible situation? Yes, yes. Yes. Ah, yes. I mean, I can laugh at it. I always can laugh at it because we were like playing on Melrose and this was Holy Sons. And we had the like, we had the classic ponytail, like obese sound dude that was like, oh man, fuck. I didn't mean to tell this story. I wasn't trying to get into this, but we were opening or like we played after some band called Cosmic Juice, if that kind of sets the stage on Melrose. And like I was barefoot, I think we had all done some coke and because we were so bored. And like I was behind this massive black curtain and the voices were on like quadrophonic delay, like shooting around the room. And there was like four people in the audience. And it was so sad. And like you're supposed to, oh dude, I've totally fucking told this story. No, you haven't told this story. I think I have like, like they announced, they announced Holy Sons on this like huge delay. And we're supposed to be playing like some opening like tough guy riff as the curtain comes up. And we're just standing there in total silence in bare feet. And the curtain just raises up and we're just looking at the audience just like, holy shit, how did we get here, you know? And anyway, I was down there after the show and we stayed up all night. I think we were getting fucked up. And kind of, I remember I was perpetually hoarse and I had like gallons of water and I was just chugging them. And we stayed up to like five or six, just talking about, I hadn't seen you in a long time. And your girlfriend at the time was kind of, she was a comedian and she was kind of joining in on the conversation. I told this story, one of my favorite stories about how my buddy opened up for Pete Yorn in LA once. Do you remember this story? No, I remember the night and I remember, I remember talking the whole night but I don't remember this story. This is one of my favorite stories and it seems like we gravitate towards these stories and I'm not trying to build it up. It's not like some amazing situation but for me, I love this kind of shit. And so, and I feel like I've told this before but so my buddy, his name is Zach. He plays in Grails. He was in another band before that that showed up in LA to play this. I think it was at the Troubadour whose actual credibility had long since passed by this point. And so, he goes in, they set up to play. They see that some guy named Pete Yorn is playing next but at the time he had just been launched as this upcoming superstar. Nobody had really heard of him. And so, they literally end up playing to an empty room. I don't know if you've ever done that, literally to an empty room. And so, they get off, yeah, they get off stage and they are just really confused and inevitably just bummed out. And all of a sudden, somebody comes out and announces Pete Yorn's coming on and the entire room fills with a crowd of people all in these kind of like the same leather jacket. And so, my friend is high and he's wandering through this crowd, the guy hasn't started yet and he's like, he starts looking at the people going up to one after the other. He's like, so, what's this guy all about? Is he any good? And everybody's just kind of like, yeah, I think he's good and he just feels really suspicious. And eventually finds out through one of them that the entire crowd has been hired to come and watch the show. They've been hired to watch the show. Wow. So, and you know, at the time when I was younger hearing this story, I was like, it was like the fucking Wizard of Oz like Curtin had been pulled back and I was like, no, fucking way, you're, what? Like, what the fuck? And so, I'm telling this story in your girlfriend at the time, it's like, she goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's called a clack. Oh, I remember that, yeah, clack. And I was like, I was like, what the fuck is a clack? And she's like, well, you know, in the old days it was called being a shill, you're just a shill and a group of shills is a clack or some shit like that. And I was just psychedelic, like I was blown away. I was just like, you're telling me you do this stuff? Like, this is normal, you hire audiences? Like, of course, you know, maybe I look like an idiot because I guess TV shows can operate like that. Like, I'm not really sure if they need people in the crowd. Maybe that's normal. But like, you know, underground rock show, like, and I've had this conversation with a really good friend of mine in New York named Cindy. And she told me other stories like this in New York where she went to a fake, see if you can process this, a fake ironic grindcore show in a designer garage that was posed to look like, like everything was gritty and intense and there was a bunch of Norwegian models there on heroin and the people didn't even play in a grindcore band, but they were like sort of like, you know, it was like they were hired to put up a cultural display. Yeah. Yeah, no, no, no. See, this is interesting, man, because it, you know, within this, you have, this is something that popped up on my message board. Someone asked, is there really an Illuminati? And, you know, is there a secret societies? Is there groups of people that manipulate the masses? And I think these things, just the fact that there's language for it, that you have a group of shills is a clack and that you have, not only do these things exist, but ways, you know, symbol systems to articulate it in the form of language exist, this is just for bands. This is just so that, you know, a band can have some kind of illusionary success that might somehow lead to that weird chain reaction that becomes real success. But if this is happening on a small level for bands and clothing lines, where all you have to gain is money, how much more would it be happening at the level of government or power, you know, where you actually have global dominance that you can gain from fooling the masses? How much more advanced has it gotten? How much more sophisticated has it gotten? How much, you know, you see it in the election process for the United States president, where they'll bust people into town hall meetings that are sympathetic to the speaker, they'll make, you know, they'll try to shoot it in a way that it seems more filled up to trick and manipulate people. But then how much more, once you become president, how much more when you're running a government does this happen? At what level does it happen? I think that's where the press comes in, you know, and the media comes in. And that's when you start getting like Fox News journalists and you get that same sense of being in the presence of a chameleon. Something seems off. I know what you mean when you go to places where there's shills. Like when you go to like a, I've been on a, you know, when I've been, I don't remember what the show was. It was some stupid show on, it was a TV show, some dumb panel show, and the audience is a paid audience. So you kind of look out at this crowd of people, no one really wants to be there. They're making $15 to sit in this shitty show and listen to crap jokes. But it's like, you get this specific sense of like, kind of like the same feeling maybe you get when you're around a corpse. Like this used to be a person, but this is definitely not a person. You know what I mean? Like it's like a corpse audience, but you get that same feeling when you're watching the news. You get that same feeling when you see like these Fox correspondents and you realize, oh wait, these aren't journalists at all. These are some kind of propaganda spokespeople. I think they call them pundits who are manipulating the perception of the masses with the intention generally of leading us into war. You know, it's that same feeling. My point is it's every single level of the spectrum you have these goddamn clacks and shills. It's true. I think I've already cited this before, but I'm pretty sure I have, but it was called Operation Mockingbird. Pretty infamous CIA operation. I heard was quoted around 1960, 1962. They had at least 500 writers working out in the field of just various publications in America, writing all sorts of articles that just argue, you know, types of points that become popular thought. You know, it could be the idea that Jack Ruby was totally insane. And so never trust anything he ever said because he was completely insane. And you know, it could be this popular mechanics article that my friend read and was telling me about that said, you know, exactly why the building seven, you know, fell explaining that, you know, nothing insidious, no lava was found. You know, just stuff like these. So if you compute that there's 500 writers in 1962 on the payroll, yeah, how many writers are there now? You know. Right, that's exactly right. And that's why it's always amazing to be when people, and I think there's less of them these days, but when people are like, oh, you conspiracy theorist, all that Pishposh bullshit, it's like everything about it's completely logical. It just makes sense. I was on this, on my message board, the point I was trying to make is if you wanna see that there's secret societies, just look at skateboarding. It's like, when did people start skateboarding? How long ago was that? Like when did it start? It started in what, the early 70s? Sure, that sounds about right. And you know, it's like these people who barely know how to, someone just got the idea to put wheels on a ski basically. You know what I mean? These big, thick fucking two by fours with roller skates on the bottom, and they're just kind of barely able to make it down the street. And then cut to now when you watch YouTube videos of skateboarders these days, they're like practically teleporting. They're like, you know what I mean? The boards have advanced, the materials have advanced, the every single aspect of the thing, and an incredibly short amount of time is evolved to the point where what they're doing compared to what it used to be is an entirely different thing. So in the same way, again, what do you get from skateboarding? You get, I guess, the rush of skateboarding. You get to like fuck sweaty tattooed chicks or hanging out at half pipes. You know what I mean? You get like acid, good supplies of acid, and like that's what you get out of skateboarding. Maybe you get a deal if you're really good, and you get to be a famous athlete, but just that's the reward for that. What do you get? What's the reward for politics? What's the reward for bankers? What's the reward for people who could control the planet? Well, the reward is anything you want. You wanna get a heart transplant for your friend? Bam, you got a heart transplant for your friend. You wanna see what it's like to fuck a freshly hung Ukrainian prostitute in the asshole? Bam, you've got it, brother. You get anything you want from if you were able, theoretically, to dominate the planet. And as part of it, the first thing anyone who studies history is gonna see when you see the beheadings of kings or the stringing up of Mussolini or Hitler's suicide and an underground bunker, or whenever you see the death of a tyrant, what you witness there is like, oh, that's an amateur who fucked up. He stood in the forefront and let people know that he was the leader. So then you would evolve, you would realize, oh, obviously the thing here is not for anyone to know that you're the leader. That's the last thing you want these fucking monkeys to know. You want people, you want them to think other people are the leaders, you know? So, yeah, I think that there's a high likelihood that there are secret societies or forces at work that are controlling and dominating the entire planet. And I- Hey, let me ask you, what you been watching on TV, bud? I was trying to write a fucking essay on something like this in Whole Foods, I think it was yesterday, and there was like two people dressed within the aesthetic confines of what you would call like punk, you know, they were punk looking, and they were behind me, and I was like, I don't know, I don't know what to say. They were punk looking, and they were behind me, and I had to leave because I couldn't concentrate, which is fine, but I couldn't help being infiltrated with their weird obsessive conversation about current, what are the TV shows you've been watching the most? And the guy is like, well, I just love Entourage so much that I've seen all seasons nine times in a row, and I'm ready to go back for more or something, just to pick up on the subtleties, you know, or something, it just makes you, you know, the experience of walking down the street can be, and I'm really not trying to be dramatic here, but it can be nauseating in the official original definition that Sart was using when he wrote that book, you know, it's like, I'll be turning a corner, and I'll just look in the window of Ross Dress for Less, and I'll just see a mother, like with a concerned look on her face as she's trying to pick out, like, just this horrible like flower vest for her daughter, and I'll want a fucking puke sometimes, like out of sadness, like, I don't know why it's not like Justin, I'm not even being judgmental, I'm just talking about a wave of confusion and nausea that comes over me when I see what we do with our fucking lives, and it scares the shit out of me sometimes. God damn right, it's scary, it's scary as fuck, man, it's like you're walking around and like you're seeing all these people engulfed in various degrees of materialism, and burning up in their own ways, it's beyond shocking, it really is, nausea is the exact right word for it, because you just think, oh, that's four acid trips less, and I'd probably be standing in a fucking Ross picking out khaki pants and sandals for my upcoming trip to Vegas with my bros. I've totally thought that before, I remember as a teenager getting to a point where after enough acid, like looking back and being like, fuck, who the fuck would I have been? I don't like that guy, I could feel like the way that anger and certain types of emotional insights were being processed in a whole different way now, like does that make sense, like when you're a sober guy, when you're a teenager with all this fucking testosterone racing through your bloodstream, you know, like there's a way that you, it doesn't like society and everybody is kind of like you, those feelings tend to get routed in a certain way and you start tripping every other day or whatever, and it just, it starts to demythologize things, but it also starts, it just knocks you off that path. You know what I mean? Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. And there's a lot of other ways that you get knocked off the path, but it's like the nausea that you're talking about is kind of the, it's the vertigo of your subjective universe, the membrane of your subjective universe, temporarily rubbing up the membrane of another subjective universe of which the laws of physics are completely different than your laws of physics, the moral structure. Oh my God, dude, as an example of rubbing up against these psychopaths, I was at my mom's funeral in Georgia and this is, we didn't even have our ashes yet. This was just like a ceremony, I guess, in this beautiful cemetery with birds flying around. It was beautiful, it was a beautiful day, but one of my family members was his, like he had been picked to speak kind of this patriarch. And he comes, he's this fundamentalist Christian, right? And he comes out, this is my mom's funeral, and he comes out and he's like, Deneen was a psychoanalyst. And she tried to psychoanalyze me from time to time, and anybody who knows me knows you don't do that. Now, I wonder if she's up there in heaven trying to psychoanalyze God. That wouldn't be a good idea. What the fuck, Jesus Christ. It was stunning, this is not a roast. This is somebody's, you know what I mean? This is somebody's funeral, and like you've written, he's written, you know, he's probably been writing this fucking speech for 20 years, but like, just wait, just like, just like waiting for this moment for her to die so he could kind of fumble into the cemetery spotlight and deliver this passive-aggressive speech. But it's like underneath it, because you can't say at a funeral what you want to say. What he wanted to say was there's a very good possibility based on the paradigm that I exist in that Deneen is right now burning in hell. He couldn't say, but my point is that person's, that person's subjective universe, that universe that that guy lives in, that's a whole different universe than the one I'm in. That universe is, and my universe can only hurt each other. Like there's no way for our universes to come together. We repulse each other. Like I'm repulsed by him and he's repulsed by me. And I think that's what that sense of nausea is, is this kind of like, just this feeling of suck that comes when you get too close to someone else's paradigm and where it gets really weird is it's like, which one's right? Which one's right? I guarantee you which one he thinks is right. I mean, he probably thinks, because this generally tends to come with people of that stance, but like he probably thinks he's the most polite guy in the world. You know what I mean? Right. And he thinks you're, he probably thinks you're really off color, you know what I mean? But like, look what the fuck happened, you know? Yeah, yeah, I mean, like you just, you sort of, yeah, the curious thing about it is, it seems like there are varying degrees of lucidity that people, it seems like that's the spectrum, right? It's like varying degrees of lucidity it's like deeper, it's kind of like, how much have you bought into the conditioning? You know, like how much have you to subscribe to the popular paradigm? And the more, it seems like the more that you've subscribed to that paradigm, the more angry and entitled and malicious you become. And the more that you've disconnected from that paradigm to some degree, the more open and interesting you become. But the weird thing is the more that you disengage from the paradigm, there is some place where you've got, you can't keep disengaging. Like you've got to engage, you can't just decide green lights mean stop. Yeah, I mean, I generally just wonder, you know, tend to think the ultimate question is like, to what extent is this individual fueled by rabid insecurity and how has that forced them to whatever ratio it is hide within their, the constructs of their conformist, you know, tendency. And so, you know, how have they sublimated this raging anger and bitterness, you know? Right, yeah, right, right. And insecurity, you know, what exactly is that? Well, how would you define insecurity? God, you know, it seems like it makes the fucking world go around. Doesn't it? It seems like one of the most motivating factors in human life. Like my favorite, a lot of people talk Alan Watts, Liberty Blah this and that, but my favorite quote of his is a dark one. And it's when he says that most likely every good nature deed is done in the attempt to escape persecution. Yeah. Fuck yeah, dude. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Yeah, you're always trying to run away from, but it's a, it's a, the persecution that he's talking about, it's a, you know, I don't, it's like the persecution isn't necessary anymore. It's in our heads. So it's like we're persecuting ourselves. We're putting the pitchfork to ourselves all the time. You know, stand in front of the, stand in front of a mirror naked majority of people who do that. And there's just this sense of like, ugh, look at that fucking thing. Oh, fuck me, man. That's me, fuck me. And that's insecurity by definition. That's, that's insecurity. And then that makes you run away from the mirror. We're always running away from the mirror. Dude, that's, that, that is the embodiment of what Alan Watts was trying to say, especially with that book, The Wisdom of Insecurity. But, you know, a lot of people want to make Alan Watts into a leader type, but I don't see him as a leader at all. I don't think that's what he was doing. I think, you know, there might have been times where he, if you read the book, the biography about him, it basically says that there were times that he kind of, this is going to sound controversial, but he actually ended up milking religion for what it would bring him depending on how lazy he was that year or like what he was doing. But it said that he became, you know, he became a Christian in order to, well, the book says, in order so that he could like live for free, basically as a monk, you know, but he had, he had a family and they would, the church would support him. So he defected from Buddhism, became a Christian for like this, this period of time. So he could kind of have a free ride and then he went back to Buddhism. He wasn't the person that people try to make him out of beat. He was just a fucking dude, living, life hustling, just the same as most people. He just had a very special insight into it, you know, a type of thought that hadn't even broken the West. And so he, you know, he obviously brought a lot of it over. I mean, Alistair Crawley had already done a lot of that stuff, but it hadn't broken into the, you know, Bohemian circuit. And so they made him into this thing. But like, you know, like the Lord of the Rings, you know, it was made into a mythology of the hippie culture. And I don't know if you've read about it, but Tolkien, he hated hippies with a passion. He tried to get Lord of the Rings not published again, I think was the story at one point because he didn't even want them to have their hands on it. Ha, ha, ha. That's a, see, this is one of the funniest things of all ever is you get the conduit and the conduit channels the energy, whatever the energy is, the energy's so potent that it comes to life in the minds of the people who've come in contact with it. And the ownership thing, it's like, forget it, motherfucker. You don't have ownership of it. You were just the conduit for the thing. You laid the egg and everybody else is duplicating and sitting on that egg in their own way and hatching whatever weird birds they think that result from it. And it's a funny fucking thing when that, when the, you know, Tyler Durden effect happens in whatever way, you know, like in Fight Club where the shit just like, you channeled a thing, the thing popped out. Now you set this neurological fire in the brains of anyone who came in contact with it, whatever the thing was you said at the time. And you just got to deal with that. You know, that's the thing. Once the thing, once the genie's out of the bottle and you're the bottle, you don't control the genie anymore. That's funny that Tolkien's like, no, no, bring it, bring it back where I can control it. You know, it just goes to show that the vessel for the message is secondary to the message itself. Who fucking cares if Tolkien hated goddamn hippies? You know, that guy is just a printer. It's like, you know, I don't, I don't know where the, how, I don't know how he wrote Lord of the Rings. You read that book and it's, you read that book and it's like, he channeled it. Like, I don't know how anyone could have written that. I remember when Star Wars came back out not so long ago or whatever it was, I guess it was one of the sequels. And I was watching some sort of bonus feature where George Lucas is being interviewed and he said, I mean, this, I thought this was fucking amazing, but he's like, they get him in this interview where he probably had five minutes and they're like, so how do you feel now that this is all said and done? And his response was, honestly, I look at my life and I've turned into Darth Vader. I thought that was fucking amazing that he said that. He was just being completely honest. He's like, I fucking sold my soul, you know? Well, yeah, I mean, well, you're dealing with, here's the bottom line. I mean, the thing that you're riding around in is, you know, it goes bad. It's like an open can of spam. You're gonna mold, you're gonna mold her, you know? That's my favorite part of the story though. That's what humanizes the hero's journey, you know, is the fall from grace. If you don't have the fall from grace, you've got a Hollywood ending and that's not worth much. No, that isn't, it's not, it's certainly not interesting. And it's definitely, it's definitely really impossible anyway, it's impossible. You're not gonna get a Hollywood ending. And maybe that's kind of the, you know, maybe that's the emerging thing, this emergent over confessionalism or whatever you are calling it. This exceeding truthfulness is kind of coming to, some way of coming to terms with it. It's just letting go of the, as much as you can, letting go of this, you know, it's what Ramdoss calls phony holy. You know, it's like just putting all that down. I think as soon as people get over this idea that the, I mean, imagine if like you went on the internet and you printed out a William Blake poem and you started like falling in love with your printer. This thing is amazing. It's a genius, oh, this printer is so incredible. And that's what we do with celebrities and that's what we do with writers and that's what we do with musicians. We get the, you know, people fall in love with a printer. And then inevitably, when you come in contact with the printer in an intimate way, it's always gonna be disappointing to some degree. It's like you're, it's like, if you look at it, it's the exact same thing, man, a printer, a plastic piece of shit, who cares? You know, this is a, it's not exciting. In the same way, some fleshy old fucking neurocomputer that happened to open up enough to channel some kind of hyperdimensional truth. It's like, you can't fall prey to the idea that that printer is the same as the message that it printed out. Yeah, but everybody wants to time and time again, right? Like, it's like, you could be preaching the demythologyization or whatever of, just made that one up, of like, you know, killing the Buddha, but they would just make that the new fucking bumper sticker, wouldn't they? Well, right. I mean, that's exactly because we've got, in the same way that you've got people who have feet fetishes, you've got these goddamn leader fetishists, and it's like, no matter what happens, they're gonna want to like suck the thing's dick. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what, what the thing, what it is, they just want to like get their mouths wrapped around that leader cock, and get their fucking mouth just filled with leader, leader jizz, because they don't want to deal with the terrible and terrifying truth that they can be conduits too, and that they, as much as anybody else, could open themselves up to this thing, and let it come blasting out in whatever way. Nobody wants that. Right, it's like saying, well, now I've really got the right outfit on. Like, now I've really got matching, you know, shoes and, you know, whatever, you know. What do you mean? I'm not gonna tell you. Yeah, look, I think that we're, you know, this is like, you know, this is the funny thing when people get shocked, like I can't believe that Bill Clinton put a cigar in that girl's pussy. You know, it's like people get shocked by these events that happen from the meat computer, and the meat computer is just this, like, shuffling, horny thing that, like, from time, or, you know, Martin Luther King was a womanizer, Gandhi! Oh, that Gandhi would lay in bed with underage girls, or, like, you'll inevitably hear these stories of all the world leaders and this terrible, you know, thing that they did. And yet, somehow it continues to surprise us. It continues to be shocking. Even though if you make a list of all the great mystics, you will find this dark underbelly. Oh, yeah, man, he would catch Chihuahuas and finger their buttholes in between speeches. Man, I knew a guy that did that. But, you know, it's like, this is like, this is the hilarious, this is the hilarious, you know, probably the residual effect of us having to have tribal leaders, you know, and having to, like, have this kind of idolatry so that we could fully and successfully imitate successful behavior mechanisms. The end result has been this kind of hero worship and the confusion of the vehicle, or the printing mechanism for the message itself. The Ohm show, speaking of channeling things, when I went to see Ohm, there is this sense of something, some kind of energy being channeled. It doesn't, it's not like normal music. It's like, you guys are hitting these weird resonances that has attracted a bizarre crowd, man. And like, there was people in the audience yelling out like weird pagan Roman terms. Like, what is that? I think those were song titles. Oh. Yeah, of course, that's of course, I'm so dumb. There was some like, there was like a tiny little, like menacing looking Latino guy covered in tattoos who kept yelling out, Satanus, Satanus. Is Satanus the name of one of your songs? No, no, no, no. We would never have a song that was like literal in that way, like overtly dark like that. No, I figured. So that's what I, so it's all right. So that guy was just yelling out Satanic phrases. And it was like, yeah, so you guys have got this following of people who are like into Satanism. I know nothing about that that I can think of. Oh, wait a second. Fuck. The tour manager was meeting a Satanic guy that night. Oh my God, that was probably the guy. Yeah. I mean, look, Satanism is so silly anyway, but it was, it really was like, it was a curious group of people. You guys are doing something that's very weird. He was like, I don't know, he, he was, I mean, this has nothing to do with the band. Like, but I'm remembering now that the tour manager was meeting a guy that had just come from some sort of, some sort of private meeting with Charles Manson. And so he was really worried about the guy being kind of a freak, but it ended up. How do you get a private meeting with Charles Manson? You have, I don't, I don't really know. It says something to do with being able to get, you know, prison access. I don't know how you achieve that. I guess he ends up probably using like his one, one meeting that month with you or something because you've been deemed important to him or something. God, that would be fun. God, if I could get Charles Manson to do this podcast. That would be the, you know what? If Charles Manson, if anybody out there can get Charles Manson to do my podcast, I, I don't know what I'll do for you, but I'll, I would do something. I'll do almost anything to get Charles Manson on this son of a bitch. That would be so fun. Charles Manson interviews are the greatest interview. Like I'll go back and just watch Charles Manson interviews for, for relaxation. Yes, it's usually right before bed. It's either Manson interviews or like, like ghetto taser videos, you know? Oh, ghetto taser videos are gold. It's just, it's so soothing. It's so relaxing. Why is that? Why is it, it's, you know why it's so fun, man? Because like when you watch, especially, I, I'm assuming you're talking about the Atlanta mall cop taser video. Yeah. Totally. I've seen it about three of those. Yeah, man. Those are, the reason it's so cool is cause you're watching this like instantaneous shift in states from this kind of like screaming, super hyper aggressiveness to paralysis and like falling over like a tree in the woods, you know, just like going from, and then they, the shock of getting tased always shuts them up. I kind of, yeah. I mean, we're not, I really don't think we're, we're being quite as crap as we sound. But I mean, like it is, it is kind of an interesting personality shift, you know, almost like a lobotomy or so. It's just like, okay, I'm not that person anymore, you know? Yeah. And in, in like 0.2 seconds. Yeah. It's a, it's an incredible thing to watch. Taser videos, you know what? Someone out there should see if they could cut together some kind of montage of taser videos with Charles Manson talking underneath them. God, one of the worst was the fucking, the tased wizard. This is not even funny. Like I feel like so stupid that I'm even mentioning this, but the, but the guy, he was dressed up in a wizard costume at like an early Coachella and he clearly was tripping because he had just taken off his wizard outfit. And he was running around naked with the world's smallest penis and they just continually tase them over and over. I mean, that, let it be known. Like I derived no enjoyment from watching that. I just couldn't stop watching. I just, I didn't want to watch it, but I couldn't put it down, you know? Well, I mean, you're watching, if the Guinness Book of World Records had an award for the world's worst trip, that's pretty much, if you're going to have a bad trip, that, that hits every single facet of a bad trip. Yeah. I mean, is it, it's not, it's not so wrong to see the phrase world's worst trip and click on it. Is that like, is that proof of being a low quality human being, maybe? I mean, I will, if so, then I'm dirt. Because I'll, like something about watching that and just thinking like, you know those moments when you start getting paranoid, when you're tripping, you start thinking people are watching you. And then like the trip really starts taking effect and you start thinking like, oh, wait, what's keeping me from completely losing my shit right now? Nothing. Like why wouldn't I just lose my shit? And then you start having these images of like, oh yeah, this has happened to me just on edible marijuana on an airplane, where I've eaten marijuana on a one morning for some dumb reason, I ate marijuana cookies and went flying. And like, I can remember sitting on the plane and thinking like, I am about four inches away from starting to scream at the top of my lungs right now. I almost, I kind of almost did that once I, I was in a similar situation and I actually did the thing where like an animal, I like, I started to dart out of my seat and leap over the guy next to me. And he just looked at me like, oh shit, dude, what's going on? And it was at that moment that I realized what happened to Dave Chappelle when he tried to land that plane, remember that? Yeah, I do, yeah. It's just a panic attack, you know, that's all it is, you know? It's a panic attack, but in the age of technology that we exist in, if you have a panic attack that's bad enough, not only will you like, cause yourself to get arrested on an airplane, but there's like a 95% chance that phones are coming out and somebody's gonna film you on the airplane, screaming at the top of your lungs and it's gonna get 17 million downloads. So it's like, you have added to panic attacks these days if you have a panic attack in public, you're definitely going on the internet, definitely. You know, my friend is a pilot for private jets that rich people own. And he's kind of a brilliant guy, but we were having dinner the other night and he was telling me, I guess I was asking him about the dirt, you know, of like what really goes on with pilots, you know, stupid questions, like why does everybody say they're all alcoholics or something? And he was saying, you know, it's pretty common for one pilot to sleep, you know? Yeah. Did you know this? I guess it's like normal, you take ships, one sleeps, you know? Yeah, that makes sense. Right, and so he told me about this one time where he woke up at the wheel. He woke up at the wheel where he was supposed to be the one flying and the other dude, he turns around, the other dude is, you know, sleeping in like a cot or something. And they were in the middle of a fucking storm and like a thunder clap or something woke him up near his head or something. And I just thought, is that like some sort of weird metaphor for society, you know, that like, that the plane's really flying itself and nobody's at the wheel? Yeah, yeah, that is right, man. Yeah, that's exactly, I think that that is a great metaphor. I think that's a great way to put it. There's obviously gears grinding away in our subconscious that are, it's kind of like, yeah, there's definitely something. And I think Carl Jung talked about this, that the all of society has the collective unconscious that sort of has its own hidden agenda going on that we're all just little bits and pieces of. Yeah, that's what the phrase, that's what the phrase deep politics means, actually. Deep politics? Yeah, to some degree, that's like, it means that underneath the layer of consciousness, there is a agenda or a motivation that's guiding everything that people are literally not aware of. I think it's a fascinating term. Yeah, no shit. And that, you know, with deep politics, man, if there's that concept, then you know, the CIA has got sensors that they're trying to use to peer deep underneath the skin to understand what it is. You know, what the fuck is it? What are they? Because that's where it gets weird, because then you've got all of politics and all of law and all of the various aspects of power are just the reflection or the backside of some other thing that we can't turn around to look at. It's like looking at your own nose. Deep politics, the collective mind, hidden agendas, ghetto-tazing videos, small cock wizard, private meetings with Charles Manson. This is a great podcast, Emil. Well, we can do it more often, we always say that, but I've been so fucking busy, but I'll tell you what, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but I do, I will be moving to New York for a little while. I think I told you that. I don't think you mentioned that, but that's awesome. Yeah, it's not like any sort of major goal is expected to be accomplished. I don't get tased. But I was thinking that what we should do if we do get the time, is remember one time you were saying to me that you weren't really sure about playing shows with a rock band because you thought it might be a little weird to have to follow like something really loud and shit? Yes. Well, I was thinking, depending on when it works out, we could just do like a small string of solo shows where it's just both of us and it's not like, it seemed like it could gel a little better. Oh yeah, man. Look, I have an idea for at least one show because I'm going to go on tour with the podcast, not with stand up. I'm just gonna go on the road and do the podcast on the road. Definitely. So that would totally work because you could just be the guest on the podcast. Sure, when are you, I mean, that's probably gonna be kind of far off, huh? I don't know. No, that could work for New York. I mean, I was just there at the knitting factory in Brooklyn. I was incredible in Brooklyn's incredible. And it made me, it was the first time that I've ever wanted to live in New York. Like it made me want to move because it was so fun. And even though I was only there for, you know, five hours after I got in, but that, I think that's something that we could definitely, definitely do. You could do a, you know what I mean? Do a, you do music before and then afterwards we do the podcast or vice versa. Either way, I don't know what the order is, but yeah. No, I think that sounds just about right. What you just said, but, and my friend, one of my labels owns the knitting factory. So like we can, we could totally set something special up. That would be, that would, I think that'd be a blast, man. We should do that. Where are you performing or do you have any shows coming up where people can come and see you? In about two weeks, we're gonna play Austin's psych fest, which is this thing, you know, that, I guess they have a bit of a reputation for getting like old school, all kind of rare performances from, like we're gonna be playing with Rocky Erickson, you know, from 13. Yeah. Who is this, Olm is playing or Holy Sons? This is Olm and we're playing with, yeah, a selection of some kind of like rare old school psych bands from the sixties and stuff like that. And then we go to Australia and then we're planning the next, I think I'm gonna be doing a bunch of East Coast tours. So we're planning those for the other bands too, but it's pretty complicated. So if we're gonna do anything, we should start talking about it. Yeah, okay, okay, cool, man. Well, yeah, we're definitely gonna do something. And then for those of you wondering where Emil's gonna be performing in Australia, where's a link where people can get your dates? The easiest stuff nowadays since the tragic fall of Myspace was now, I mean, you have to just go to the Olm, Facebook, Grails, Holy Sons, Lilacs and Champagne, all those Facebooks is where, it's the only other place where we can quickly throw dates up, you know, so everything's there. Well, there you go. Well, go see Olm or any of the various incarnations of Emil's music people because it is mind melting and definitely I like the way that you, when I mentioned the whole Satanism thing, you kind of like, you did a little sidestep. So anyway, go and, probably just as embarrassing because it's not any way related at all, but go see Emil perform. Thanks for doing the show, man. Yeah, yeah, we'll talk really soon. Thanks for listening, everybody. This sounds like shit because my microphone just died. That was Emil Amos, my mom just died too. Now enjoy this song, Cruel and Unusual from the Holy Sons album, Criminals Return, Biden iTunes. Thanks for listening. Hare Krishna. I crave my neck against my will if life is dark comedy, yeah. Marks me still. This road I'm on is full of wrecks and I can't seem to turn my head away. It seems cruel and unusual just a usually cruel God to derive entertainment from setting up a fool but his boredom is no higher and I'm bored of his design just cause of these pale spots he's got a fuck with mine but mine's not lit just led to a bride and I can't decide if I'm a wedding or just a way too tight. That's just a way to avoid unity Smash yourself into a thousand again That's just a way to avoid unity Smash yourself into a thousand again Smash yourself into a thousand again Smash yourself into a thousand again Smash yourself into a thousand again Smash yourself into a thousand again Smash yourself into a thousand again
242^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 419: Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2021-01-15^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, my beautiful friends. It is I, D, True Cell. And I want to welcome you to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast. You know, if you're one of the people out there who currently feels like the very pillars of society, as we know it, are being shaken by brutes and apes that belong in some kind of grimoire in the basement of a sorcerer's tower, then I think this podcast might bring a little bit of relief to you. We have a month, a weekly meditation at our Patreon. And we have wonderful conversations generally. And a few people were hoping that I could offer some kind of words of comfort to help them feel a little less anxious about what's happening in the world. And I couldn't. I really couldn't really think anything. I tried to record some intros. My first attempts were just to sort of off the cuff come up with some really inspirational, powerful speech, monologue, something that would not only convey my own incredible spiritual brilliance, but also act as a kind of not just something that made people feel better, but literally cause a ripple that would potentially shift not just around our planet, but through all versions of Earth and all parts of the multiverse and ultimately cause us to achieve a kind of unified field of consciousness where we would realize that all the things that seemed so terrifying were just necessary steps that we collectively had to take as we walked back into the gates of the Garden of Eden. But unfortunately, all I made was this. This is why I need friends like Raghu Marcus in my life, because otherwise I'll just drift off into some paranoid trip. And it's nice to have people who have spent their entire lives working on themselves. And not just that. Raghu is one of the people who runs Ram Dass' foundation, the Love Serve Remember Foundation. He got to meet Neem Karoli Baba, the great saint, in the flesh. And he got to hang out with Ram Dass for most of his life. He's an all around brilliant, beautiful, philosophical being of love. And if you're feeling shaken by current events, I think that the conversation that we have in this podcast should cool you down a little bit. We're going to jump right into this episode, but first, this. Much thanks to Chromadex, True Niogen, for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Here's an article from TheGuardian.com. It was angry, vicious. A spate of squirrel attacks leaves NYC neighborhood in fear. At least three people in Rigo Park and Queens have been jumped upon and bitten by a possibly deranged squirrel. A few people are quite scared, Michelin Frederick, a local resident told Guardian US. Frederick was herself targeted by the squirrel in a bloody attack on the 21st of December when she was holding her front door open for furniture movers. Suddenly the squirrel ran up my leg and I thought it's a small rodent, how bad could this be? So I stood completely still and the next thing I knew, the blood started to fly. It was a wrestling match that got very bloody, very quickly, Frederick said. It's not a threat when I say that Frederick was not a member of my Patreon. It's not a threat when I say that all the people who have been attacked, not just by squirrels, but other very adorable small animals in the United States and around the world are not members of my Patreon. It's just a statement of truth. I'm not causing these attacks and even though I have gotten a few letters from lawyers, I challenge you to prove that I can what, control small animals and that I would be so malicious that I would hypnotize an army of inconspicuous, adorable animals to attack people who weren't subscribing to my Patreon. That's ridiculous and I'm definitely not doing it but I just have to say that there hasn't been a single member of our Patreon who has been viciously attacked by any small animal or rodent and I wanna invite you to join us. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH.

And now everyone, please welcome back to the DTFH, one of my best friends in the entire world, a mentor and somebody who I feel incredibly lucky to have any kind of association with at all. Raghu Marcus. Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, no need to be blue Welcome to you It's the Duncan Trouser family Raghu, welcome back. It's so truly nice to see you. It's the Duncan Trouser family. Raghu, welcome back. It's so truly nice to see you. Thank you, thank you. We do this, not to do a shameless plug, this isn't a plug. We do, we have a meditation group on my Patreon. We meet every Monday. It's called journey into boredom and we meditate. But also we talk and today I realized that people, that I think I've lost touch a little bit with how truly upset people are. A lot of people are legitimately freaked right now in a way that is even more freaked than they were with COVID and the freakishness of our particular timelines is being amplified with some consistency. And I found myself, people were saying, do you have anything you could say to comfort us? And I found myself, I said no, I can't think of anything. Really, I don't know if comfort is what we should be looking for right now but I have the same question for you. As somebody who has had human contact with a saint and dear friends with Ram Dass and so many other great teachers, what the fuck is going on, man? That's all I know, I'm from Canada. I don't know anything. I'm not kidding, I don't have the same take as you all do. We assumed like when I was in high school, there's a bunch of crazy people down south over the border, nationalistic fervor, it's insane. And we sort of just have to coexist because the TV stations emitted signals from just over the border so I was privy to some of the insanity. I'm being funny in one sense and another I'm not because friends are like watching 24-7, the news and stuff and I'm like, I'm going to watch a basketball game. Right. But reality is reality. I didn't unfortunately get far enough into it but I have a friend, Robert Svoboda, you know who Robert is. Yes, sure. And so his teacher in India, he was there around the same time as us a little bit later, was an agora, a gore. And that's intense tantric practice, some minor description of what it is. But he wrote a trilogy which everybody who's listening, who's interested in eastern stuff, might be interested in this trilogy. It's the agora, A-G-H-O-R-A trilogy. Robert Svoboda and Duncan put links up and stuff because it's really worth it. The third book in the trilogy is all around the meaning of karma. And so I did a podcast with him just recently on mind-rolling. I actually did with Noah, my son, who sends his love by the way. Send my love right back. And so one of the things that he brings up in the book, which I didn't get far enough into because it's so profound and so complex and so not understandable by rational mind. Yeah, someone pops you in the head, you're going to pop them back. Karma. And of course it's so abused. You walk across the street and somebody stumbles and falls into a pole and you go, hmm, karma. And walk on. It's just abusive. It's called spiritual bypass. You mean like using the idea of karma to kind of like evade? Evade everything. Yeah. Compassion. Yeah, exactly. But there is something that he talks about in the book and I have to, as I said, I got to get with him again, collective karma, which is to me profoundly what we are involved with here with what's been going on, what creates a Trump, what creates a vast underpinning of misery that lends itself to eating up what Trump offers. A vast, the extraordinary conditions that make up what is going on with racial injustice in this country from hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. Then you look back beyond that where these people come from that wanted to have slaves. They came from Europe, basically. And that gets compounded back into what was going on in Africa. So there's tremendous involvement with collective karma that, and people are saying it, the pundits are saying, we are sowing what we have sown. Yeah. And we're also, don't forget, the destabilization of countless governments by the CIA or the bombing of Iraq or all the other things that we have as a country. Going way back. Yeah. Going way back. I think maybe part of what people are experiencing is a novelty to us because somehow we have managed to evade karma as a country for a while. It used to be when you were going to war, that meant war. It didn't mean one side gets blown up and the other side is unscathed. The war that the US has waged around the planet has been relatively one-sided. There might be some asymmetrical response, but we're the ones dropping the bombs. We're the ones with the bases. And yeah, I was thinking this. And then I started feeling bad, and I was going to record some intro mentioning that, but then I started feeling bad because I thought, is this really the time to remind people that what we're experiencing is only new to us, that people on the other side of the United States, photon cannon, have gone through this and experienced a similar thing where we've destabilized their government, put in, you know, it's part of what we've apparently successfully pulled off and unsuccessfully pulled off, just that we've attempted it and hasn't worked. Yeah. So really, in that sense of things, this is all actually a good thing, but a good thing is not complete because the amount of suffering that everyone is going through. And it's not just people who are in just rotten economic state or are very sick and so on. Obviously, that's the top of the tier of pain and suffering that's going on, but there's suffering going on with people who aren't sick and are affluent as well because they are at the very basic level watching this and starting to look at how they maybe have contributed or how selfish they have been. Maybe the wake-up is suffering for people as well, I believe. Maybe I'm a little Pollyanna there in terms of what's going on, but you do see the reactivity to what went on last Wednesday, which was the day that Congress was stormed, is very widespread and that has to be causing tremendous emotion. I saw something where Lindsey Graham was accosted at an airport. We'll never leave you alone. This is the rest of your life. That's what they said to him. Yeah, right, but the tone, the level of anger, and this isn't made up for the camera. I mean, maybe a little bit it is as well because they know that they're being followed. But suffering, in other words, it's just endemic to everybody, no matter what you think who's right or who's wrong or any of that. So what do we know about suffering? It definitely is the only thing that allows us to wake up for the most part, aside from stuff like psychedelics or meeting a teacher or hearing a piece of music or reading a book. It's all there, but this is just to see it. As I think I mentioned to you maybe in a podcast we did last year, I'm not sure, but I found this thing from the Chinese, the ancient Chinese, that was all about the kind of conditions that we're in now that are called by them dangerous opportunity. And boy, if this isn't that, I don't know what is. And I do think there is an opportunity here. And I don't mean bullshit hope. I mean, as Roshi Joan Halifax calls it, wise hope, that there's a potential for opening into a place where we can start to address the real deep karmic conditions that have created where we are now. I think it's good to mention her because she's been such a warrior through this. And at times following her Twitter, I thought maybe she was overreacting a little bit. I thought some of what she was doing seemed too much. But now in retrospect, and I think this is what all of us are, as we're like looking at what just happened, anyone who was sounding the alarm early on now doesn't seem histrionic or shrill or loud or overreactive or any of those things you want to assign to them. If for no other reason than because you're afraid and you want them to be wrong kind of ignorance, but she was has been such a powerful. People should definitely follow her on Twitter because it's a beautiful convergence of Buddhism and activism. But she a lot of people who are saying early on like you don't you don't understand this type of person doesn't leave power. Like they don't know how they can't let go. They're not going to leave. I remember somebody telling me that they give me a fucking break. He's going to want to go back to Mar-a-Lago stop. He's going to want to go, you know, like start his own network or something. He's not going to like stay like a tyrant. And then you look and like you have a our Congress we got invaded by our own people. And you know, I was just having a conversation with some friends about this. If it had gone a different way, we would now be under the reign of a tyrant. If they had killed our leaders, which could have happened their school shootings, there's no reason that that couldn't have been more organized or planned. And if it had been, then what would have happened would have been that Trump would have come out and would have like said these people are going to be held, you know, accountable. They're all going to be tried, but also martial law. Martial law. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, it could have. So that just gives us a little bit more of information in the big picture, which is we are getting an opportunity to look at this and look at it in all of its complexities within ourselves, all the way to the societal pressures that have created what we have today and the polarization and all of it. But one of the things that really is so apparent is the interconnectivity thing. Right. I mean, from every aspect of our lives, obviously the environment, the environment goes over to that's how these pandemics get created with the melting of ice caps and release of God knows what viruses and so on to the way that we handle our garbage to the way that we handle allowing the kind of drilling fossil fuels, all of it, and it interacts with how we've handled racial injustice and just, you know, up until George Floyd, it was just a blind eye. Right. Oh, yeah, we're not. We're not racist. Of course, you know, and my cousin, you know, marched and like that kind of a thing. And every bit of this is just absolutely linked. And so the opportunity to for everyone to take a look at this and and see what it is that they can do within themselves or around their little circle is a dangerous opportunity. A tremendous thank you to a new sponsor, World Series of Poker, and I know what you think it duck and you don't strike me, somebody who's in to poker and you would be correct. And I'll tell you why I'm not into poker. The reason I'm not in a poker is because I never learned how to play. I have friends who have poker nights, but I would never go because I wasn't invited. But had I been invited, I wouldn't have gone because I don't know how to play poker. I would I would lose my ass. I would lose my ass and the times that I have gone to Vegas or been around poker tables, the whole thing seems like some confusing, archaic, ununderstandable game that cowboys play.

The opportunity for everyone to take a look at this and see what it is that they can do within themselves or around their little circle is a dangerous opportunity. Let's go into that because as I've been sort of feeling my own surprising level of anger about what's going on, Twitter banning him, Parler getting taken down, all I've been feeling in every single one of those moments is good and I like it, but it's not like a happy good. It's like, fuck you, you don't, you fuck everybody, fuck me, you know what I mean? Why the fuck did I, any place in the past where I like helped create a destabilized way of thinking about the world that wasn't like with no intent behind it, you know, what do you do? I keep thinking, what would, if Ram Dass were here and this was going down, you know you would have some beautiful way of grounding us in something other than anger or something other than regret or something other than confusion and I just keep thinking like, what would that, what would he say, what would it be and it would be specific to this moment, you know? You know, he was so good at that. Yeah, well he did say a lot before he left because there was plenty of stuff going on in the four years, in the last four years and he worked on it, how he was, how we were told to work on it, love everybody, right? So he put a picture of him up there like he put pictures up all the way back to the 70s and whoever he was putting pictures up, you know, different politicians that were so intractable and seemingly had no kindness and no compassion and so on and he would speak to their soul is what is, there wasn't anything else that he could possibly think of doing except there's these pictures of him going out and protesting, right? Which he did his whole entire life. It wasn't just about changing his insides which he spent all those decades working on to some success, one would say. He actually, I mean, you know, you and I experienced it. He was living in that place of complete non-judgment and unconditionality. So at the same time, it's interesting, we just, we've been thinking these same things you're thinking especially about him with this foundation, we're putting, LoveServeRemember, we're putting out all sorts of different content because he commented on this over the decades. It just wasn't particularly this moment but this moment which has become so extraordinarily large but he has and there was one thing that we've, he did something a few years ago with Joseph Goldstein, of course, I know you know who Joseph is and again anybody who is wanting to just take a little bit of a different perspective and not be living in, because it's just useless to live in anger. It is natural and it's not like it's going away but it wants to do something about carrying along more than one plane at the same time which was Ram Dass's big thing. He is a master of disseminating mindfulness practice, period. His book Mindfulness Everybody Should Get, you can put a link up there on it too. So he and Ram Dass got together, they were just chatting and we filmed it and somebody noticed, we did this beautiful little moments of joy and wisdom, Ram Dass and Maui. Did you see that? By the way, you're in it. You didn't even see it. I didn't see it. I was in it. Why did I have to see it too? Yeah. Well, there's some beautiful moments of Ram Dass there being in that place of complete unconditional love and humor, you know, the stuff that happened that we put in from Yumi and him on stage and Maui but at one point Ram Dass in this little interview or little chat read a letter from somebody basically expressing everything you're expressing right now. How the hell do we deal with this? And most importantly, how do we deal with the quote on quote them because we can't find any way to get on any page that has any relevance where we can actually talk. The us and them is not working out. And so Joseph said, you know, he said, I did a retreat around 9-11, you know, 20 years ago, whatever it was. And somebody, we were doing loving kindness meditation, Buddhist meditation called metta, where you send, may all beings be peaceful, may all beings be happy is one of the things. There's a bunch of them and you start with your inner circle and then go all the way out to people who are enemies. And people came to him and said, are you crazy? There's no way I can want these people who destroy the towers and everything else to be happy. And Joseph thought, you know, it's a legitimate thing, you know, I mean, our anger around it is legitimate. So he said, how about this? How about wishing for all people to have hatred released from their hearts? And to me, so we put that up on, I don't know, on Instagram, whatever. To me, that's the kind of positive thing that we need to be doing instead of sitting around just going, you know, being happy that Hoosie is getting his, you know, PGA no longer allows it. It's allowing the big tournament to be at his golf course and being happy about that, which is all natural stuff too. It's not bad. It's not bad to be angry. It's not bad to be happy that all his toys are all being taken away. He's being isolated, no Twitter. But you got to have the other level going at the same time. That's the most important thing. So okay. Okay. I like it because you're basically saying, look, don't, you don't have to deny yourself a natural reaction to justice. You're human. You're supposed to, we're supposed to want things to balance out. But also part of justice is not just punishment. It's redemption. It's balance at the very least. It's the possibility for balance. I see what you're saying. And there's some, it's, yeah, cause the way I feel it, I know a lot of people feel like what, you know, having like had a mindfulness practice for, for some time now, so at least enough space to look at the way I'm feeling and honestly sort of know that that is a, it's an infected kind of joy. You know, it's like a, a icky kind of thing to be like relishing this moment in history. You know, it's not, it doesn't feel like it's not the same feeling I get when my son makes me laugh or, you know, accomplishes something, you know, then you'd be a saintly guy when that happened to, you know, but listen, here's another example. Of what we're talking about. And all of this stuff is, by the way, extraordinarily difficult. And it's not a matter of, geez, I didn't make that too, I didn't get too far today in wishing that all hatred leaves the parts of Trump people who are particularly very angry and, and, and being violent to some, whoever, obviously at the last week. But his holiness, the Dalai Lama, I heard just recently, I've either heard him say it or read it, he was talking to a monk. So monks that get captured, got captured by the Chinese and got put into jail. Eventually some of them made it out. I know one of them, his name is Garchen Rinpoche, just the most beautiful llama and, but one of them came to him and said, basically what the conversation was about what happened to him in prison. And he said, and I think his holiness said, so did you have fear of, of the Chinese? And during that time, and he said, the only thing I was afraid of was that I would lose my compassion towards them. Wow. Okay. Now these are, you know, this has been in their culture for many centuries and they work on themselves very hard to let go of this stuff, but that's all we got is, is what's inside us. Oh, let's, let's focus in on compassion for a moment here, because I think that it's a misunderstood term. And I think especially in the tradition you're talking about, it is truly a thing that has been cultivated. It's a, I think it's what Ram Dass called going into your heart. Would you, do you think that's accurate? Yeah, yeah. It's his whole thing of loving awareness, right? Yeah. So it's getting your perspective out of your believing, your, what your mind says you are, the story you tell about who you are, identity roles, all that stuff. He was so great at Ram Dass. And then moving into the center of your being, and you want to call it as all kinds of different names, soul, spiritual heart, Buddha mind, whatever. It's, it is a place from which there is not the kind of judging and polarization that is within every one of us as a feeling that we are separate. And from that place, you, only from that place, can you have any kind of compassionate interaction with yourself or anybody?

From that place, only from that place can you have any kind of compassionate interaction with yourself or anybody. Right. But that is a, Sharon Salzburg teaches about that. This is a thing you develop. You cultivate is what they call it. You cultivate that space. That monk was recognizing that he was afraid that there was a possibility that this thing that he had spent probably many incarnations cultivating could go away. And I think once you dip into that place, even for a second before you tell the story, I think the West or I, my story about that place in the past has been heartbreak or I haven't wanted to go there because usually I can't just experience that place, which I've heard is when in Buddhism, when they talk about spaciousness, that's what they're talking about. But then I feel scared of, I immediately associate that feeling with loss. That's how I shift out to heartbreak because that's the feeling that precedes heartbreak or the illusion that you lost a thing. You know what I'm saying? That's a very precious place. And if you get to experience it at all, wow. I think children live in the place, but anyway, I understand why you would say that, which is why and hate certainly is a window shade over that place. So throwing up the window shade would be, to even get to that, I don't see how you could hatefully experience that place. Yeah, but you know, your thing is, it's so real in terms of heartbreak when you just see anything and you feel the empathy of feeling another's pain or something inside you starts to reach out, which is compassion. It's not self-serving at all. But we have an inability to hang with pain. That's part of the issue here. We are so coddled in the West, just our lifestyle and how we grow up, for the most part. That's not, there are people who have been abused for their entire lives just because of the color of their skin or their level of financial security or whatever it may be. But in many ways, we have had a little bit of a softer existence, obviously lately that's coming out to be not true because of the pandemic and the economic devastation and all of it. But we still, those of us that have experienced what you're talking about, which is everybody, how do we live with pain without pushing it away is part of this thing. It's part of what compassion is. But the other thing, what I love, remember when you decided that you were going to go down and feed people down in East LA years ago and you put some food together in a knapsack and you went through that whole exercise, which you know, somebody, you should put up whatever that there was a hilarious podcast, I don't know if it was on yours or mine, but I'm sure you've talked about it more than once, it was so fun. But basically, you were allowed to see where, you know, through mindfulness, what your motivations were, where the bullshit was, where the non bullshit was, and it was only because you went through it that you were able to really address it. And that's really what this is about. Working on oneself to at least get to the point where you're not afraid to have a little pain and are not afraid to see your shit ass motivations. You know, yeah, I'm going to go down there and feed these people. Yeah, good podcast fodder. Yeah. So, so again, it goes back to what you said. And, you know, we love Jack cornfield is, yeah, it's OK to be human. It's OK to be angry. It's OK to be heartbroken. But that's not going to stop the cultivation to get to the, to see all of the ways in which we are selfish and at the same time, loving and compassionate because we have it all going. Yeah, that's, but see the, I think we're all experts at hating ourselves at this point and all experts at, and this is when you're listening, like I'm listening to joyful wisdom right now, I mean, you're Kinsey Rinpoche, you've had on your podcast. I can't believe that's so cool. But, you know, the in their culture, one regular reaction that you hear from them is a bit of confusion when they hear that people in the West hate themselves. Like, yeah, that is actually something that they don't. It's hard for them to understand that. Yeah, they go, huh? What do you what what? And his holiness, same thing, Dalai Lama, same thing. They asked him about this and he, he said, can you explain this to me, please? I don't know what you're talking about. But I think that that shows culturally the difference in what they learn as a child because essentially, like they are taught that their heart is who they are. And so there is, they don't understand how you would hate. That's like, how do you hate love or how do you hate compassion or how do you hate the light? They don't understand that at first, they don't. I think after hanging out with us for a couple of dinners, a couple of comes clear to them and they're like, oh, my God, like, this is going to take a lot. Yeah, they get up. They said, here, give me the bills. Nice knowing you. I'm kidding. A phone call. Gotta go. But, but, uh, uh, because we identify or we, we don't even know it. Some people don't even know about that place. And so they, they forgot it because of what you're saying, abuse and trauma. And so then they start identifying themselves with the thing covering that place instead of the place itself. And then of course you would hate that in the same way you would hate. If you were a prisoner, you would probably hate the lock on the door. You would hate the prison. There's a, there's almost like a natural sense that this thing that is me, that you think is you, something's off and you, and you want it gone. And then that leads to depression, which sadly leads to suicide. And this is, this is, uh, because people have become so disconnected from the thing that that's covering up. And the thing that that's covering up, which to me recently listening to me, you can see Ripa Shay working with David to connect that heart, compassion, space with dimensionality, so to speak, with space, like that it's not just compassion, some gooey feeling that makes you give bread to people, but it's literally like a dimension you're in that is filled with pure potential and possibility, regardless of causes and conditions around you. That blew my mind. And, um, and, and, and yeah, and, and this is, I think even more so, I, it can become so frustrating when I, you know, you know, when you're in the beginning of these things, Raghu, it's your fault. You connected me with Nick turn, but you know, in the beginning of these things, you start feeling your heart and you get past the place where you don't want to feel it. Cause that's how I used to be. It was like, I just don't want to feel that that hurts too much. And then you get past that place and all you want to do is feel that. And then you become really sensitive to all the things keeping you from being in that place and it becomes really frustrating. You know, it's like, I, David was saying, it's like, uh, you just see the tail of something, you know what I mean? But you want to grab it and hold it and you can't because of circumstance. Like, how the fuck am I going to maintain this state of like vulnerable compassion that's literally seems like finding like a new God. I ruin everything. And it's like, you find it. You didn't even know you had a clitoris or something. Oh, you know what I mean? You're like, holy shit, I've got another. This is on your channel. Oh, I gotta shake my head. Got to shake that off. Uh, yeah, but not, not to get too complex with the Buddhist thingy who and David Nick turn who we love. Uh, you know, he's, he's very wise. Uh, the reality is there is a simplistic thing here. Look, you recognize that, uh, you're a selfish shit. 99% of the time you want to do something about that or not. And why would you do something about that? Cause maybe you, you know, a little trip, maybe a little, uh, visit teacher said something, you know, you hear Duncan say something like that. And then everything switches because suddenly there is a big intention. And that's one of the biggest things of Buddhism is intention to change. And how does that happen? That is a question of deep complex karmic stuff and lifetimes. And all, you know, karma and reincarnation, you know, so it's, and we won't even go there. But the reality is some, some where along the line here, you just don't. I mean, you and I have been talking about it through this thing we've been working on for years, just this, it gets to a point where you cannot stand looking at these motivations and not making some kind of addressing it. Got to address it because it's too painful. That's the thing that changes. That pain changes everything. Yeah, that pain changes. So you want to listen to Ram Dass's meditation about how to get out of your ego mind and believing every bullshit thought that you have into a place that's much more, you know, the Buddhist call spacious, forgiving, compassionate to oneself, nevermind anybody else at this point. You know, I'm not that shit heel that I think I am. And at the same time, it's going to take real practice here on a day-to-day basis to move that perspective out of, from up our ass, basically. Oh my God. Yeah, that's the real problem. Yeah. I mean, that's the problem. That's, that's the problem. The problem, the philosophically, it's like, there's no problem. But the problem is that it's, it's, this is not, you know, this is when Ram Dass, I remember when I had this, when we first met and he pointed to his head and said, we've got to get you from here and pointed to his heart and said to here, he said, we can do that. And I said, any minute, that was by itself, which is the big relief. But then I said to him, it's so, it's difficult. I can't, it's hard. And he goes, he got this big spot. He said, no, it isn't. But I think he was, I don't know, I don't know what, why he said it wasn't hard because it is hard. It is like, it sounds so fucking easy on paper. First of all, it sounds ridiculous if you're me, because if you're somebody who's really in the past, I was successfully numbed down. So you hear this idea of compassion or opening your heart or something. And it, you just lit because you're out completely in your head. You intellectualize that. And you come up with an approximation, like a mental configuration of like, I know what you mean, but you don't know it. You can't know, you can't know what you mean because it's not coming from your head. It's your heart. And so, but then, so, but then, like, this is the problem is that you have to spend a lot of time just to get to that point where your heart starts opening up. Like it does take a practice. I think, or a great MDMA, and that doesn't last and you get a hangover. Yeah, right. Um, yeah, but boy, boy, oh boy, Ramdas would say, um, this, we started this conversation out around, you know, the, the intense moment that we are in right now and the reactivity that we have on all sides of the equation. And again, if you have any kind of awareness, and that's the big, the big word, right? And awareness comes through practice. Yes. Uh, I don't think anybody wants to continue to hoard all of this selfish motivation. I think if it's, and we're seeing, and everybody's getting a look at it in a way that they might not have gotten before. So that's again, back to the thing of, uh, it's, it's, um, dangerous opportunity. Right. So I keep thinking about that. But, you know, can I, uh, I mean, I, everybody out there, I want it, this is completely self-serving. I want you to know that. But one of the things that, um, I said, Duncan, can we talk about, can we get up and have a chat on a podcast? But because I also want to let people know about Ram Dass's new memoir, being Ram Dass, which is out, uh, this week. Beautiful book. Yeah. And so, but literally beautiful. The cover is beautiful. Yeah. I send it to somebody, a professor. We're doing some, uh, course at Penn State, actually, this is the first place being announced, you know, Ram Dass be here now, kind of course. Anyhow, I sent it to the professor, professor Rob over there and I said, you know, take a look at this and then let me know what you think. And then he didn't say anything for a week. And I, I wrote him back. I said, any idea what you think about this thing, this book. He said, well, to be honest with you, I haven't got past the cover. Well, it's that beautiful. I mean, it is. So it's Ram Dass completely utterly present. It's just, it's a fantastic thing. Anyhow, so out of this, there was one thing in this book that, um, I wanted to read and Duncan said, I could, what, what it's about, it's about really the fact is people go, well, okay, Ram Dass became very compassionate and loving and did love everyone. And, but that's just Ram Dass. And so this passage is, is the moment that he was driven by his friend, Bhagavan Dass, to the Himalayas, to meet this, the guru. And he describes it and he describes it in a way that we, all of us can absolutely relate to the fact that we are cynical. We start out cynical. We've got cynical. Uh, Duncan has represented at our retreats cynicism, although it wore off a little bit. I had to start faking it. Yeah. Then you had to start faking it, which was really weird. Um, so can I read this little thing that it just sort of, uh, really, it's called, this chapter is called the map maker. The, uh, so next morning we commence a hair raising right up into the hills. The road switchbacks up from the terraced farmlands in the planes, twisting back and forth as we climbed thousands of feet over stream scored hills covered in mist. So beautiful up there. We traverse ridges with sheer drop offs and past remnants of landslides. Anywhere else these hills would be mountains, but we're in the 25,000 foot upthrust of the Himalayan range. As we snake upward through one spectacular panorama after another, I sit in the passenger, in the passenger seat, sulking. Bhagavan Das is driving. He's taken charge of our deluxe camper and he won't let me take the wheel. It doesn't, cause he didn't want him driving in India, where Bhagavan Das had been for years, but I want to be the one driving. I've spent weeks in this customized Land Rover and David left it for me. It's my right and my responsibility. Besides, I'm not sure about this guru thing. Bhagavan Das seems deeply affected that the prospect of seeing this guy, he's alternately singing and crying as we climb higher and higher on the precarious mountain roads. I hope he's watching where he's driving. I'm not into gurus. I consider myself a Buddhist and I thought Bhagavan Das was a Buddhist too. Gurus are a hustle. Hinduism is a chaotic vortex of calendar art and a garish endless pantheon of neon lit gods and goddesses. It's a cacophony of unintelligible Sanskrit blaring over distorted speakers in my bag next to my passport and traveler's checks. I have a return plane ticket to the US. I plan to use it very soon after hours of torturous driving. We pull up off of the road, stopping by a small temple, perched by the curb on a steep hillside, the vista of green hills receding into the crystal blue Himalayan sky is breathtaking. Or it would be if I weren't feeling so uptight. A small crowd gathers around the Land Rover seemingly out of nowhere. We're still in the car and I can't really read the mood of these people. But Bhagavan Das starts talking to them. They all seem glad to see him jabbering in Hindi. I have no idea what they're saying. He asked one of them something and the guy points up the hill. Bhagavan Das asked if I want to come see his guru. He gets out and loaves up a narrow path. My first impulse is to stay with the car to protect it. People are milling around it. They're in a celebratory mood. But after Bhagavan Das leaves, they seem agitated. They're trying to make me understand something. Finally, I understand they're urging me to follow Bhagavan Das. I think, do they want me out of the way so they can trash the car or steal it? They keep yammering at me and pointing up the hill. Their insistence propels me out of the car. And my curiosity overcomes my paranoia. I follow the path Bhagavan Das took, glancing back at the Land Rover as it disappears from view. And I'm going to fast forward. So he basically gets up there. There's a group of people around this old man in a blanket. I see Bhagavan Das lying on the ground. His hands extended and touching the old man's feet. He calls him Maharaja, which in Hindi means Great King. He's weeping ecstatically. I think this must be some bizarre ritual that's a part of the cult. Fragrant incense rises into the air mixing with the smell of pine needles. Other people come up and touch the old man's feet with their hands or bow their foreheads to his toe, which is sticking out from under the blanket. I'm not touching anyone's feet. I'm a Harvard professor. I was a Harvard professor. I remain at a distance, slouching with my hands in the pockets of my jeans, trying to be invisible. I am not part of the scene. The old man is talking to people and they all seem happy. And he turns to me and he says something in Hindi. Abhagabhagabh is all it came through. Rob, you came up in a big car. Someone translates in English. Everyone in the group turns towards me. I feel more uncomfortable. I said, yeah, the old man says, will you give it to me? Before I can respond, Bhagwan Das jumps up. Maharaja, you want it. It's yours. I freak out. Everybody in the group looks at me and laughs delightedly. I'll know Maharaja never asked for anything except an apple. But I don't know that. I splutter. You can't give him that car. That's not our car to give away. It's David's. No one pays any attention. They're laughing and smiling and and then Maharaja turns to me and said, do you make much money in America? He says, I figure I must think all Americans are rich. So I play along. I go, yeah, at one time I made a lot of money in America. How much did you make? Well, one year I made thirty five grand. Some of it in cash. They calculate the exchange rate of dollars into rupees. And wow, that's a sizable amount. And Maharaja says, will you buy a car like that for me? Yes. And this is the fastest round. I go, this is the fastest hustle I've ever seen. My father's good at shaking the tree. That's how you raise funds for Brandeis University and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, after all. But he's not this good. I'm clearly not in Boston. I barely even met this guy in the blanket. And he's already asking me for a seven thousand dollar car. I say, well, maybe the whole time he's smiling at me, my head is spinning. What has Bhagavan Das got me into? Everyone's laughing. They're not being malicious. They're just enjoying hanging out with the old man in the blanket. Everyone knows he's putting me on, except, of course, me. And then ensued from there. The fame, because I can't go on reading this. It's a great book, everybody, though. But there, what ensued was Ramdas being told by Nirm Kurali Baba, Maharaji, what had happened to his mother that nobody could have known. He could never have known. And he was thinking about his mother the night before he came there. And Maharaji, when he said, so your mother was quite ill. His mother had died of spleen cancer the year before or something. And he said, yeah, I was thinking of her. You were out under the stars. Yeah, he was out taking a pee. And then he said, your mother died of spleen in English. He went to spleen when that happened, Ramdas hit the ground, fell apart because his mind could not handle the reality that he was known that way by another being. And it just fell apart, splintered, which is what what he brought back to America and gave to us, Ramdas, because we all went, we believed him because he was so honest. And so, but more of the point here is we are all in the same boat. We have the same shit going on where we are just cynical. And that's right. And you mentioned it before. It's the way in which we cover up everything. And one big way is cynicism. And we've talked about that before. But yeah, so just see, we all have a chance. If it could happen, Ramdas can happen for all of us. Wow. Thank you so much for reading that. You know, the addition to the story that I never knew is the smell of pine needles. Yeah. That that's why I'll do a match to. You know, that story lives in my head, but just now to have that like incense burning and the fresh smell of the forest. The forest and where they were. And yeah, and all that fresh air and then to like have an encounter with a being like that. And also. Knowing that probably some part of him recognized he was about to have a kind of. Subjective apocalypse on the way up there and was shielding himself from that. You know, like big time while Bhagavan Das was crying and beginning to like experience being close to that thing. He was, you know, doing everything he could to. Not feel that because he must have felt it the way you feel. When you're about to go over a hill on a roller coaster or something. You know, that was it for him. And it's so funny that I just love that you instantly tuned in to exactly the place where he was trying to hide. Yeah, exactly. And it's because it's what we all do. I mean, that's this was just a very. Over the top reaction. And because it got to the place where when someone breaks your mind and shatters it into a thousand pieces. I wish we all had that, you know, I mean, in fact, all of us Westerners, which is just a two, three hundred people, all of us got that to some degree and brought, you know, brought that shattered mind thing back. And I wish we all, you know, but that's a bit of what's happening right now. Right. I mean, there's a bit of shattered mind going on with with everything that is going on in in our country, in the world, you know, all of it. That we just some curiosity, hopefully will take place where people go, Gee, you know, maybe I can open up a little bit to other realities. You know what? I think we're seeing the price of cynicism. You know, I think if, if, if, if, uh, if, if Ramdas had been a little more cynical, he would have been like, turn around. Let me drive, turn around, I'm getting out of here. I don't want to do this. Get out of the car, go up there. I'm not interested and it would have been a whole different story for me if that had happened to you and probably a lot of other people. And there would have been a price, a really rough price and no one would ever even know what they missed out on probably. But the, I think we're, maybe that's part of what we're seeing is, is it's, it's the whole cynical thing that I certainly adhered to religiously as a protection mechanism for sure. It just, it's more, it's, it's more, it, it does more than just ruin your life in a kind of slow motion, subtle way. It potentially gets people hurt. It potentially hurts people and gets people murdered. Yeah. You know, and I think that's the, where, where we're seeing now is like, because that's what Trump was cynical. It was cynicism and his followers were cynical. There was a cynicism about him, a sinister quality that was so cynical and sarcastic and the president troll or whatever. And, and, and people, and there was something cartoonish about him that made the cynicism somehow tolerable. And then something funny in the cynical dark way that people like me who like, who are cynical, there is a, you might be like, I hate everything about him, but I gotta recognize, it's kind of funny. And then now look what happened. Now we're seeing like, well, you know what? Actually, yeah, the Senate, this, this attitude, this Western attitude towards reality, where we have absorbed ourselves into a kind of cowardly absurdism or something. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Not only does it not work in the small scale, because it's going to disconnect you from your heart, but on the big scale. Because in the collective, it looks like what we just saw. It looks like what we just saw. It looks like despair and anger converting into action that has no real intent other than chaos, and it gets people killed. Well, it has intent for power, power, greed, yeah, greed and power. But, you know, you said, I'll bring something else up that's also completely difficult to understand. But like when it just reminded me, when you said, well, Ram Dass, when he drove the car up and got into that total paranoid vibe, could easily have said, you know what, I'll leave you off, take your bag, and I'm going back down and I'm going to go, you know, wherever to a Buddhist monastery, whatever he was thinking, he could have done that. So here elements, here enters the element, which is one of those badass words that comes from the East, or not from the East, it's East West, it's everywhere that is abused, and it's called grace. So there is, so part of this intelligence, you know, that is a reality, whatever you want to name, divine, present, divine, intelligent, whatever, there is that thing there, you know, that's what I call it, that had no allowance for Ram Dass to turn around. No allowance that was not allowed. Okay. And as a result, this, he brought back this tremendous thing that has helped tens of thousands of people, I mean, you know, be here now, sold a couple of million copies. So a lot of people, and over the years that he's in Maui, a lot of more people connected with him, you being one of them. And if we take this one step further, there is grace in what's going on here. It's the grace of like, yeah, they could have been way more organized and stormed that building and cause the kind of destruction which would have allowed Trump to become the fascist Mussolini that he wanted to become. Right. So there's something we have to acknowledge and recognize that other thing that is constantly going on, and it's not just what we see physically in front of us, it, and it requires us moving into a place of trying to understand ourselves more better. Okay. This reminds me of something Thomas Merton said, which is, you know, people look at the world and they say, how can you believe there's a God? Look at the wars. Look at the brutality that happens historically and presently. How do you, how can you imagine there's a God that allows all that to happen? And his response was the fact that we have, that we have the potential to be so brutal and have not completely destroyed ourselves, is the proof to me that there's a God, the fact that the grace has prevented complete annihilation. Uh, and I think that, that reminds me of what you're saying. It's important to remember that and not get swept up in what could have happened and see what, what, that, that it didn't happen. And that there is now that what you're saying, there is something in this moment that is more than just catastrophic. There's a opportunity here. Yep. Dangerous opportunity. You know, in another word that's also mishandled, um, is trust. Right. How many times have we talked about that? Remember when we talked about that? I, I think you were with me in Maui. And I, I said to Ramdas, you know, the first time I met you and you just completely enveloped me in an unconditionality of presence where, uh, you weren't caring about Richard Alpert or Ramdas at all. It was just me. Yeah. I, that just, I had the strongest signals of, of trust, uh, that I'd ever had aside from maybe my mom, you know, when it was a baby and all that. And, and then I turned to him and I went, what about you? What was your first trust? And he looked at me and he went, mushrooms. And so, of course, there's a lot in this book about his psychedelic experiences, but just think of that, just think of that. That was very much, you know, I mean, obviously going to Indian meeting Kurali Bob, you know, that's such a, the, the profound nature of that is indescribable, but so is the profound nature of the trust that he had with, uh, with psilocybin. That is how you understand Ramdas. Because whoever would be that crazy, I've never, I've, well, I'm not, I've, I've, yeah, whenever I'm around that, that energy, I generally am just I want to fall asleep. It's, No, what are you talking about? You have hyperdimensional elves swimming through your body. You're not like, God, I really trust y'all. Oh, um, I guess that, well, then we look at, yeah, you just said it. That lets us understand Ramdas a little bit more. Yeah. His relationship with that world. That he could have that kind of openness and trust and surrender and letting go and, and confidence that. Yeah. The grace is, is going to be there. And it was, and you know, even through the most horrendous, well, uh, a very, very difficult scenario of becoming, um, stroked as he put it and living like that for 22 years in a wheelchair half paralyzed and not complain and, and do the kind of work he continued to do, uh, writing books, writing books, seminars, having retreats, having private zoom conversations with people, sending people emails, connecting with so many people, all the, all, like he was so in demand. I can't even imagine how he kept up with all of it, but he did. And which was in fact, one of the reasons we, that it was nice to have people like Dasi Mark, there was, there had to be someone who's like, we have to, you have to sleep because otherwise he would just stay with people. You would just, you know, even having had a stroke. He always had time, always had time for people, always somehow. And if you were around him, he gave you the sense that he had all the time in the world to be with you and that you'd been hanging out with him forever. That was the wildest thing about him. That's out of control, compassion, I would say. In other words, he, there was no, what do they call that? When your car has, or your motorcycle has a certain thing that controls how fast it can go or governor, he had no governor, no compassion governor, no compassion governor. I love it. That's a cool thing. I like what you're saying. I love it. It's like, we have to trust this moment. It's not, it's dangerous opportunity, but step one, just trust the moment. It feels like that's what you're saying. You have to, you have to have some trust for this. And yeah, I mean, and the trust, again, that has to hark back to all of these things are happening at the same, to all these different levels, trusting the moment of what's going on in, in, in the outer world, um, realizing that, uh, there is, uh, a potential here. And that's the whole thing around dangerous opportunity, but first comes first, you got to do, you got to inquire inside. Yeah. You know, and it can't be just a head trip. So there, there has to be, that's why, you know, you're enjoying all of the work that you've done with David Nicktern, which is loud, uh, meditative process to go on, which has opened up other fields, so to speak. Yes. Intention, you did it. You did it because you just had no other choice. There wasn't another choice. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. It's nice to, for things to not be quite so theoretical and, and, and, and, uh, even, even if it is a fleeting something or what does David say, half marinated or something, it's still, it's still something, you know, like, cause I would hear Ram Dass say, I only wish I had done it before meeting him, but I would hear Ram Dass say things like, well, Maharajee is in your heart or Maharajee is there in your heart, or that, you know, like, or when you're telling that story about the pine needles and the incense and thinking how he would say, oh, Maharajee is there in your heart. Like people hear this and they'll think, well, I can't go to the fucking homolius right now. If I want to do what I'm going to zoom with someone in the forest, there's no way to encounter that. But, you know, just having a brief brushes with the thing that I do think it Ram Dass was talking about, he, that place is accessible. That is a, it is more than an intellectual thing. It is more than something where you're, you're like, I'm going to go give food to people, but it's just your head and you don't really feel anything under your neck. It's like more than, it's like, there is a thing that they're, that you're talking about that is big and does come from a practice. They're, and I think that's it. It's, it's, you know, right now is definitely a perfect time to start that. You know, you just have to trust this. If you, if you're somebody who is numbed down completely, he's completely numbed, I was, I still am most of the time, but once you get past that pain associated with finally feelings, I'm feeling, it's pretty amazing. The possibility there. Yeah, but, but, but, but listen, the truth is everybody's had some kind of experience that they can trust. Right. And it's just most of us dismiss it is the issue. That's just, oh, an oddball thing, even, even a psychedelic trip, you know? Oh, I had that 40 years ago or I had that last year. That's not relevant. Uh, but it is a matter of taking that. I'm, for me, it's that crazy instance of being 16, 17 years old and, and somehow somebody got me into a John Coltrane concert at a club in, uh, in Montreal, where I'm from and going out, I remember that to this moment. I mean, he played my favorite things and that was it. I just went into the most spacious place that I had ever been in my life and I loved it and it was no drugs and no nothing. And, um, I just reveled in it. And from then on, I had that place. I trusted that, that was real. So we all have that. It's just a matter of, uh, cult, yeah, you know, the Buddhist love that word. I love it too. Cultivating. Cultivate that place because it is definitely available to everybody and why, you know, why bother being miserable and feeling either, uh, cynical or victimized or whatever the story is that we tell ourselves or feeling like you're a bad shit, you know, whatever it is, just trust that little place that is the crowbar that starts to lift that 3 billion pound boulder off your chest. Wow. Perfect ending, Raghu. Uh, thank you so much. I love our conversations. Thanks for sending me the book.

Oh, it's that time again. The scrolled sub-cast is sliding down your brain tube to lay some soft gelatinous jellyfish, shake stomach seeds deep in the warm musty. My nose is your brain. His spoliosis pours in the direction of Mecca and his bald spots got a tramp stamp. His developmental message nips his wop wop. He won't kiss the signs and doesn't care what. Spread those armpits wide. Let that fly out of your butt. Because here he comes, like a baneling baby rolling in a paradise. It is raspy lesbian voice. Hug down your spinal treasure trail and shove those earbuds deep in your hole. It's that beloved. Hi friends, it's me, Duncan Trussell, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. I welcome you. I've got to go on the road tomorrow. I'm flying up to Winnipeg, and that means that I've got a ton of stuff I have to do to prepare for the trip, which means I don't have time to do any kind of opening monologue. But I don't need to do one because the ultimate guest of all time is here, the sweet, perfumed, lotioned Ari Shafir. So we're going to dive right into it, but first, some quick business. ISIS should not have a better website than you. This episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast is brought to you by the White Wizards at Squarespace.com. Squarespace is a place where you can make simple, powerful, and beautiful websites for only $8 a month, and you can start a free trial right now with no credit card. There's never been a greater time in human history to start a business. In the old days, if you wanted to start a business, you had to bribe City Hall. You had to give donuts to cops and build some brick and mortar store, jutting out of the time space continuum. Quite often in a part of a city where there was a 95% chance that the mafia was going to drag your ass over the cash register and tap dance on your balls. But no more. Do you have a great idea for a business? I've said it before. I'll say it again. I know someone who makes money selling her socks online. Think about that the next time you find yourself moaning over your horrible financial state. There's an entrepreneur out there who has managed to convert her stinky socks into cold hard cash. If she could do that, I guarantee that you could figure out a way to transform a website into a money tree or at least something that gives you enough money to buy the booze. You've been pouring all over that aching dark horror in your heart that is filled with unaddressed pain and the fear of death. This is only $8 a month. They've got a responsive design. Every website comes with a free online store and they have 24-7 support, which I have tried out and it completely works. They are very, very good at getting back to you if you have any kind of problem building your website. You probably won't because it's really easy to build websites on Squarespace. If you go to Squarespace right now and you use the offer code Duncan, you will get 10% off your first purchase. This is a great way to show your support for the podcast by supporting this cool company. It's an amazing time in human history. This stuff didn't exist before. There was no Squarespace. We didn't have the opportunity to just make a beautiful website by clicking a few buttons for $8 a month. You had to get on Adderall. You had to suck back speed or get hooked on crystal meth as you tried to learn HTML. This would lead you down a bad road because inevitably you turn into one of those early 2000 style pseudo web designers, which I'm ashamed to say that I was. It's an awful thing, man. You don't want to get sucked into that dark winding road that starts with Craigslist and ends with some guy with a giant greasy neck beard shoving and thrusting his crotch into your mouth in the middle of the night as he babbles about the fact that you haven't paid him what you were supposed to for the subpar crap website he made for your fruit dispensary business. Do you want that? Do you want to smell the musty oily pubic glands of some angered psychotic road rage style web designer as he lowers his taint into your nose screaming that you have to pay him another $300 for the awful HTML digital extrusion that now on a daily basis humiliates you and makes you seem like a subpar businessman? You don't want that? Go to Squarespace.com today, $8 a month and you can create a beautiful, powerful website with commerce. You can also create some of the greatest prank websites of all time and you can try it out without using a credit card. So go to Squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan and you'll get 10% off your first purchase. Much thanks to Squarespace for supporting the DTFH. On the 4th of March, I'm going to be in Winnipeg with Johnny Pemberton. I'm going to be in St. Paul on the 5th. That's sold out. Madison, Wisconsin on the 6th. With Danieli Bilelli. Chicago with David McClain. Columbus with Emil Amos on the 8th. Chicago on the 7th. Madison on the 6th. Chicago's sold out too. There are a few tickets left for Winnipeg, Madison and Columbus. Get those tickets right away. They're going fast. Last I checked for Winnipeg, there was about 30 tickets left. So you probably want to get them online. You don't want to just show up at the door and that goes for all the other clubs. Just get them in advance. I never do it either. I don't blame you for not doing it and whatever. I hope you come to the show. I hate doing that. Get the tickets in advance. I feel like I'm selling goddamn Oriental rugs out of some downtown Los Angeles warehouse. There's lots of other great ways to support this podcast that don't involve dragging your meat body to a show. You can go through our Amazon portal located at DuncanTrustle.com the next time you're shopping on Amazon. Bookmark that portal. Go through the portal. Buy something awesome. I highly recommend picking up some Alpha Brain. I'm not sponsored by on it in any way, shape or form. And I actually go through Amazon when I'm buying Alpha Brain because I love this stuff. It gives me what I consider a kind of low level, Adderall buzz. And I'm embarrassed to ask the folks that on it to send me the stuff for free. So I just go through Amazon. I recommend that stuff. If you want a nice, neutropic blast, it goes well with caffeine and a shot of espresso and some Alpha Brain. Hallelujah. You can go through our Amazon portal and we'll get a small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. And we also have t-shirts, posters and lots of cool merch at DuncanTrustle.com at the shop. So I hope you will go and look at some of that stuff. We've got some really cool mugs and that badass shirt designed by a Los Angeles artist, Ron Regi. Okay. That's it. No more business. Today's guest is one of my best friends on planet earth. He's a hilarious comedian. He's got a show running on Comedy Central right now called This Is Not Happening. You can also segment on that that you can watch on YouTube where I talk about a terrible acid trip I had. You can pick up a copy of his special paid regular by going to his website arishafir.com and I highly recommend checking out his awesome podcast Skeptic Tank. Okay everybody, please spread those heart legs and allow my dear friend Ari Shafir to come plunging into your reproductive organs. Welcome Ari Shafir. It's the DuncanTrustle video. Hey bro. We're recording. Don't let people know that Polly Shore says the word pussy. It's going to shock the world. How's the show bro? I'm like, it's pretty good man. I've seen some good stories. How's the pussy? Oh Jesus. Oh, savages. Ari, what is happening in the world? We have an emerging police state. Yeah, did you see the Chicago thing? No, I didn't. What is it? What? They're running a black water type site? Now can you talk to me a little bit about that because I have not explored that. I don't even know what that is. Okay, well I've read a lot of headlines on the subject and what it is, is they are, we're interrogating people. There was a CIA style, CIA slash Gestapo style, that goes hand in hand now. Those words are interchangeable. CIA style and Gestapo style, they mean the same thing. Oh, that's fun. Yeah. So a CIA style, just warehouse where they would arrest people, not let them call their lawyers or anyone they know, just keep them in there for months while they're trying to like coerce. How did they get the right to do that? Like how does that work legally for them? I think there is none. I think there's no legal basis for that. But the thing is you don't need a legal basis to do something if you know there's been no punishment. Right. If all they'll make you do is stop doing it. I never paid my SAG dues on time, Screen Actors Guild. Yeah. They had no late payments. Yeah. And so every commercial I shot, pretty much, unless I shot one like a week after I shot another one, they would say, hey, you're station 11. That's what I think it was called. Station 11. That means you haven't paid your dues. You can now have to work until you pay your dues. And it's like, oh, okay, cool. I'll come down and pay them. Or you get like three days to pay them. And they're like, why didn't you pay your dues? I'm like, because no late fees. What incentive would I possibly have? And they're like, well, now you have to come pay. I'm like, yeah, but I would have had to do this errand anyway. Right. So why shouldn't I do it? I don't know. Why shouldn't I continue to not lay pay? But these cops, isn't there some? There's got to be, like now there's public outcry. There's Chicago police department is all over the news. I should have brought a manual so I felt like that's crazy. It's such a black mark on them. They'll shut it down. But do you think Rahm Emanuel knows about these things? I don't know. But I just know that if you don't punish people that do things wrong, don't publicly punish them. I got TSA guy that detained that dude for however many hours in Philadelphia, I think. And he's still working there. And then he lied in court about what the guy did. And he's still working there. They should publicly show pictures of that. Like, hey, here's a fucking, here's a guy. If they show us power, the police, if they have a crooked cop and most of the cops aren't crooked, then they should really hold up posters of the crooked ones and say, look how he punished them. These guys doing 10 years in Leavenworth now. Right, this guy has... We're on your side. Maybe they... Not, he was forced to retire and he gets his full pension. Or we're gonna say a word about it. Like, well, whatever happened with that, you should publicize that majorly if you did the right thing. You have to do that because if you don't do that... We'll just assume you guys keep doing this shit. Right. And why wouldn't it keep happening? Do you think that's the nature of power? Yeah, I thought about this on the way over here. It's like, have you ever lied to get your way? Yes. Yeah, I have. Like, probably hundreds of times. Right. I mean, I told, what's his name today? That I wanted him to meet me over here. But he's like, tell him when you get there and I'll go. But I'm like, I'm gonna get there and start this podcast. Right. So, it was my weed dealer. So, I said... All a joke. All a joke. Part of the brand. Part of the brand. So I said, I'm there. But I was still 15 minutes away. Because I wanted him to leave. And meet me there right when I got here. Right. So you're saying, you know, this is the... Of course you lie to get your way. The saying is, as above, so below. It means, if you want to understand the way things work in the upper echelons, look at the way things work in the lower echelons. Humans are humans. And you'll see that it's that way all the way through. So... Oh, right. The conspiracy theorists point to this monolithic organized power, as though it's somehow separate from the way things work in everyday life. Yeah, in everyday life. Your fucking coworker talks shit about you to your boss to get ahead. That's right. I mean, not everyone does it. But the same percentages of your coworkers who are shitty are the same percentage of government people who are shitty. At their best. When I worked at the summer camp, and it was really cool because I went there as a kid, and I kept... Camp happy trails? Camp. Camp happy trails? Camp happy trails. Camp treasure trails. It's a picture of, like, the bottom of a pubes running up to a belly button. It looks like a lake. It was a... I went there every year, and then I became a counselor in training and a counselor. But when you're at a place for your whole life, there's certain rules that you consider to be unbreakable, sacred rules. And I remember when I became a CIT, and then I remember when I became a counselor. And part of the camp is, like, there's a nap time for the kids. So, like, I don't know, at one o'clock, the kids all take a nap. But I remember I was like, it's nap time for the kids. I'm a counselor. I've only just been... I have bosses, you know, I'm working for people, and there's a knock at the cabin door, and it's one of the guys who runs the camp, one of the upper guys, the activity director, another guy, and they're like, come outside, Duncan. So, like, I come out of the cabin, and they're like, let's go float on the lake on an air tube. And I was like, what? I mean, this is... What? You're just gonna... This is... But we're supposed to be watching the kids sleep? There was someone there watching the kids when we left, but still it was like, that I could do... I'm allowed? You mean you guys... Which wasn't part of the training? This wasn't what we... And that, so to... We don't know what we're being paid to do. I always think about that, because it's just an innocent thing. Floating on the lake isn't gonna hurt anybody. Someone's still watching the kids, but it was still outside of what the job description was, and it was still technically breaking the rules. It was more fun for you to do that. More fun. So, if a summer camp that's happening, why wouldn't it be happening with senators? Why wouldn't it be happening with congressmen? I think the reason people think it couldn't is because you sort of place, from when you're little, like, this is government. It's like this almost like sanctimonious thing where it's like, they are good people. Oh, right. But as you get older, you realize like, that's a guy who's my age. Yeah. He's not one of the older people. He's like... Yeah. He's 40. Yeah. He's just some guy. What I mean, he had a business six years ago. Yeah. And now he does this? That's a guy. Yeah, it's not like a priest who like... Not a super hero. Devoted his life to this. This guy's devoted a few years to getting stuff. Yeah. I don't know. It's a guy. And the president's a guy. And the people who work for the president are just guys and gals. And the people in the Supreme Court are just guys and gals. And the whole thing is just people who are like any other people. Yeah. And that's a really important thing to realize when you're considering the idea of the great police state or the growing police state. You're looking at a real problem, which is that people in positions of power write the rules. Yeah. And they're not going to write the rules so that they get in trouble by the rules. Yeah. They're going to write the rules so... Everyone after them gets in trouble for like, yeah, who turns themselves in? Yeah. It's just not going to happen. And that is the concept of democracy. The concept of democracy is we have a steam valve release for the boilers. Do you ever read The Shining? No, I saw the movie. Well, The Shining, and I don't even think they mentioned this in the movie. In the book The Shining, one of his... Boiler room? I don't remember that from the movie. One of his main jobs at the Overlook Hotel was watching the boiler. Because the gauge slides is what they said, which means that if you don't watch the boiler and release the pressure in there regularly, the whole fucking thing can explode. And so it's a beautiful symbol and a book about a guy who's got a serious fucking rage disorder living alone in a fucking... Steam valve problem? Yeah, steam valve problem. In the same way... Oh, that's a good... It's a good... It's a great symbol. The conviction is so good sometimes. So Stephen King's so great. But that steam valve release... Oh, it fits Gerald. The Shining's Stephen King. The steam valve release... I'm joking. I'm joking. Yeah, I'm kidding. The steam valve release concept applies to this fucking country. The idea is voting is supposed to be a nonviolent revolution. Every time. Every time. And whatever the people want is what happens. The wheels spin, things will shift, but that's what the people want. The people are running the fucking show. And the people want voting reform too, but the only people that are gonna put that in the place for the people are the people who have, like, fucked up. But this is where it brings us to where you and Russell Brand seem to agree. Yeah. You guys both talk about wanting some kind of revolution. No, I see one coming. I think you don't want it. This is not something you want. No, there's so many people are gonna die. Describe to me what this revolution is gonna look like. How does it play out? Guerrilla warfare. Anyone who thinks it's... Well, I used to think that too. It was like, how could you possibly take on a tank? The US government has the army of a... Yeah, it's like, well, we're not gonna... They're not gonna fight on a battlefield. They're gonna be... Here's what you need. If you... Let's say you have 3,000 people you've ever met in your life that you kind of know, you know, maybe you know their name. You're like, hey, what's that guy's name again? Just that much. Yeah. I mean, 3,000 people. If one out of those 3,000 people says, yeah, I'm gonna take up arms. Yes. I'm gonna take a gun and if somebody asks me to murder someone who's in power, who's stopping us from getting our way, or like that guy who shot the TSA or the guy who lit himself on fire in front of the White House, if one out of 3,000 of those people say, okay, yeah, I'm gonna do that, that is an army, a guerrilla army of 300,000... 300 million people in this country. So 3,000, 30,000, 300,000, 3,000,000, 30,000, 300 million. Five zeros. 100,000 people. 100,000 soldiers in this country. Right. See, you're saying... And they're not on a battlefield. They're just walking by some congressman. Right. And they're just gonna stab them. Do you know about the Weather Underground? Mm-mm. And I know there's people that are also of those 3,000 people. Some of them are in the military and they have access to weapons. But go ahead, what's the Weather Underground? So the Weather Underground was a militant organization back in the 60s whose log line or motto was bring the war back home, because they wanted to end the war in Vietnam, but they knew that people in the United States did not know what the devastation of war looked like. So they would place bombs inside government buildings. They would call the government buildings and say, you need to evacuate. We're giving you two hours, three hours to evacuate. But we're gonna blow that fucking building up. And they would detonate these bombs. Wow. So they were a militant organization. They wanted people to see what a rubble looks like. Yeah, they wanted people to see disaster. That was their motto. You know, because the problem in the United States is that we have no concept of what it means to go to work and come back and your house has been exploded. We don't know what that looks like. That's what war looks like. We don't know what it's like to go for the feeling of trying to get food to be associated with their feeling of, I might die. Some guys like, you know, there was no reason to go to Iraq for the war. And he goes, well, based on what happened in 9-11 and how many of our people died, yeah, it's justified. I'm like, no, look at these numbers. Thousands of Iraqis have died. And Iraq wasn't responsible for 9-11. They weren't even involved. Yeah. So like, what do you mean? How does it justify what? People just like, don't see it. So they just go, yeah, it all makes sense. This is why they can't have a draft. Because if they had a draft, then the revolution that you're talking about would be more likely to take place. But because there's no draft. They're only signing up people who want to be there. Yeah, they're signing up people who want it as a job. They're signing up people who want to, who really do. This is one thing that I was thinking, man. Like, clearly, we need people to defend this country. We do. There's no way around that. We definitely need people to defend this country. In fact, I want you to, I won't show it to you. Defend the country. I'll give you an example. Defend this country. Not offend another country. Sam Harris just tweeted this awesome, Sam Harris is an author. He's just a philosopher. He's like this one of these, like, I don't know what the word for them is. Vocal, docking style atheists. But he wrote a book about spirituality without God. But he also has a podcast. And lately he has been in the camp of people like Bill Maher, who are saying that Islam is evil. And that Islam is built into Islam is anti-Semitism, built into Islam is the subjugation and enslavement of women, built into Islam are all these things that if you take it literally, which is what the people who are in ISIS are apparently doing, it looks like ISIS. In the same way that if you decided to start living according to the laws of Moses, it would look very violent and brutal. Sacrificing animals all the time. Stoning people. Stoning people, same idea. But my point is that he posted this thing where it's these two, I don't know what they are, what sect of Islam they are. I don't know what their titles were, but they definitely have their own little Islamic talk show. And in this really creepy grinning kind of way, they're talking about why they hate the Jews. And they're saying, look, you don't understand, we don't hate the Jews because of the land that they live on. We don't hate the Jews because of Israel. We hate the Jews because we are taught as part of our religion that we must hate the Jews. So it's like what they're saying is this is not a fixable problem. It's not a matter of land. It's not a matter of shifting something geographically. It took our birthright from us years ago. We have built into our religion the idea that we are supposed to hate the Jews. And the way they're doing it is in this beaming, smiling, grinning way. Now, I don't think that represents all Muslims. But the fact that... I don't even know if it's Islam and Muslims. It's the same. But the fact that those motherfuckers exist in the world, right? And that they exist in enough numbers that they're taking over a nice portion of Iraq makes me think, well, shit, we need people to defend us from that kind of loony, loony tunes, right? So we need that. But you know who else needs that? Switzerland and England. And they don't go into other countries and just kill hundreds of thousands of people. No, they don't. And I think that that's kind of the real, like, interesting problem that we face in this country. Defend. Defend. We need people to defend us. It's like if your dad was somebody who was a contract killer who had, in the last 10 years or so, killed 18 to 1,000 very powerful mob bosses, right? Your dad did it. You didn't do it. Your dad did it. You sat at the table and ate delicious food from the money he got from the contract killings. You got to enjoy a spacious mobster mansion for a long time. You didn't do it. But the chickens are, you know that eventually the chickens are going to come home to roost because he made so many enemies that eventually one of them is going to want to kill you. But it's not fair. It's like, well, talk to those 17 people, but the 18 says, no, I think they should kill the kids, too. You know your daddy actually killed. He killed my kids, so... So I know you seem like a pretty nice guy. You know a nice guy? My son Bobby. He wasn't even involved in the mafia. And now he's dead, so sorry, buddy, but... Right. So that's kind of the predicament we're in in this country. I want your father to feel what I've felt. It's a predicament, man. Yeah. It's a predicament because when you consider, like, well, we have managed to piss people off in an impossible way. Like, there's no way coming back. Like, I can remember once on the school bus when I was in the fifth grade, I don't remember what exactly I did. I think there were two rednecks. Yeah. And there were older redneck kids, or one of them was older than me, one of them was younger. I was a kid, but they were bullying me. And I think I punched one of these kids. I just, like, punched him. Yeah. And a fight ensued, a scuffle. But his big brother, I remember, said to me, I'm going to kick your fucking ass one day. And then I remember for the next five years. Worried? I would not only be worried, but, like, I remember, like, four years later, I was hanging out with some friends. And his big brother did what many rednecks do, is, like, he just fucking grew, like, some kind of gargantuan thing. He went from being someone who's already big to being something this giant, ruddy-faced, fucking, like, vicious redneck. Like, Doyle rules. Yeah. He was big. And I remember, like, hanging out with some friends. This might have been when I was in high school. So we're, we've cut from elementary school to high school. Yeah. And I can remember being at a party. And one of my friends came to me, like, like, hey, man, I was out camping with Randy, whatever the fuck his name was. Dude, he wants to kick your fucking ass. Still. Still. There's no fixing it. The ass-kicking potential was there. You know? It's the same way. It's like, all I did was punch his brother. We fucking vaporized people's generations of people's families over and over and over and over again. How do we- And we're smart about our public policy on drone attacks and fucked up drones. Like, when they accidentally bombed a wedding party, just 13, 14 people who didn't do anything in Yemen in a country that we're not really even in. Yeah. They're official policies. We don't discuss that. Which is a smart policy. Because then you get people like, that does bring the war home. Like, what do you mean? You killed a wedding party with any of the militants? Not one? Yeah. You even owned a gun? Yeah. What do you mean? So just let's just not comment on it, and no one will know about it. And then people will be more likely to support shit. Yeah. I don't know, man. I don't know. I do know what they're going to do eventually once the revolution gets started. Yeah. They're going to shut the internet down. Because the communication is the only way that revolutionaries can plan stuff. So they shut the internet down. Then they start going door to door. You have McCarthyism again. And people just start like, oh, that guy's a revolutionary. That guy's a revolutionary. Even if you discuss, oh, the military's wrong, or the government's wrong in this. Oh, you're one of them. So what are you? You can't be one of the guys to say, well, I'm not going to pick up a weapon. I just think the government's wrong. Like, you're inciting them. You're part of them. They're going to go door to door. They're going to start arresting people who have nothing to do with it. They'll be camps. Nobody's going to give up power. That is a dire forecast, Ari. Do you really see that coming, you know? In our lifetime. In general. Mm-hmm. Every... Well, the other option is that the people who are more and more not represented, the higher and higher percentage of the poor, not getting the benefits of the riches, want to turn to voting to change it. And as it becomes more and more evident that voting won't change it, they go, what are they left with? I think it was Jefferson who said that. He said that if people aren't given the opportunity to make change through peaceful solutions, they'll make change through violent solutions. Right. So it's like, after a while, you're just like, get off me. And you just slap. Right. After a while, you're like, hey, you shouldn't do that. You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't do that. And then you just slap somebody off you. That's normal. Right. People... That's what that guy who shot up TSA was at LAX. Right. Enough of this. And I can't complain to anybody. No one's doing anything. Right. And then you just get violent. And you get more and more of those people out there. You get them talking at bars. They go, why do we accept this? And people go, no, voting's the way to do it. And you're like, when? When has it been the way to do it? Right. Right. Because voters feel disempowered. But what do you think about this new... So then is the government just going to say, okay, you know what? We've taken too much power. Let's give some back. Let's take power away from big business. What do you think about the FCC ruling that just happened? I love it. But it took a lot of people to say, don't do this evil thing you're about to do. But look. And it's still going to happen, Duncan. But? Not your child is going to get taken away. But look. They're going to slide it in later. But look. Look at... We've been fighting for three years on this and we won by a three to two vote. Yeah, but we won. By a three to two vote and it'll become... It'll go to vote again and it'll go two to three instead of three to two. And then the fucking cable companies will have their power and they won't relinquish it. Yeah, but I don't think that's going to happen, man. I don't think you're... Because here's the thing. We did the same thing with not being able to arrest citizens without trial. I don't think it's going to happen. And they didn't say, okay, we're voting it down and then they just voted it in. You're right. It could happen. Then they just voted it in later. The thing that I do find... We won. Everyone stop paying attention. But you are seeing what I love about the net neutrality ruling is having the fact that it worked and that the voice of Reddit was part of what moved those people in the direction of voting in the way that even though some of them already had the belief that the internet has to maintain fair and open, just like Fox News, fair and balanced. Fair and balanced. Fox News. By the way, hats off to Fox News, one of the top news networks in the world right now. Okay. You say whatever you want, but their motto is not a problem. What? Fair and balanced is not the issue with Fox News. Fox News is fair and balanced. Whether or not they do it is the problem. Guys, get off O'Reilly's back, would you? But get off his back. I don't know about any of that stuff. Oh God, it's the best. I don't know which one's liberal. We'll get into that in a second. But I do have a more optimistic outlook than you do and I think the net neutrality ruling shows that as skeptical or cynical as you might like to be when it comes to the democratic process, and especially when it comes to the democratic process pre-internet, when you see things like that happen, which are at least partially a direct result of the power of the internet and the internet communities coming together to influence the democratic process. Because goddamn man, I watch that. Yeah, Anonymous helps with stuff like that. That's right. And I watch that. What they do is label Anonymous a terrorist group and then anyone who says that they agree with Anonymous gets to go to jail. But they're smart enough to fucking rename themselves. They don't care. The point is, though, that what you're seeing is it still sometimes works. Oh sure. It's going to be back and forth. Exactly. And by the way, I don't know who's going to win the revolution. I just don't think the revolution's going to be violent. It could happen just on the internet, just online. I think the revolution is... You see that where they go, let's not stab a congressman. Let's tell everybody where he lives and say, egg his house. Right. You know? And that'll get it if people go, all right, all right. What's your guys' issue? It's a boycotting. Absolutely. You could do that. A boycott machine. We need a boycott machine. If that happens, let's say everybody say, hey, let's find that senator who's trying to fuck us, who's clearly in bed, like Feinstein, when she was saying we got to pull back the NSA and then just gives them tons more power. And then you see she worked for them and she's totally in bed with them. And we're still trusting her to make their reform. Let's say everyone says she's the problem. And they say, what we're going to do is we're going to find out her route to work, and we're all going to take that way and make her traffic way worse. Do something bothersome for her life, completely nonviolent. Right. Eventually, she'll see it. If you get the traffic terrible enough all around her, she'll see it, she'll feel it. She doesn't want that to happen. Right. That's their goal. Now, then it's on her to react. Right. So either she goes, hold on. Let me see what these people are angry about. Or she goes, let me try to hurt these people. Fight them. Let me try to stop them from doing it. Yeah. Not through saying, I'll give you some of your demands, but saying, let me put you in jail. Right. I had the power to. Right. Right. That's what big people on World Star Hip Hop, like, yeah, you don't fuck with me. Yeah. You kidding? That's, she has the same feeling. Her power is not in muscles. Right. Her power is just in, she writes the laws. Okay. Yeah. Right. I know what you're saying, but like, I think that this is the golden age of activism. And I think that activism does work. Activism does create changes. And guess what it does? Activism puts people in jail. That's the point of activism. The point of activism is that you are willing, civil disobedience, you're willing to break laws for a greater law. You're willing to put your life on the line in a nonviolent way. You gotta hope you can get out of the country in time. And stay in a Russian airport for six months. And he got, but he got out. God, he was so careful. And all those people said he should have gone to the government. It's like, are you kidding me? Looking back now, should have gone to the government with what was happening? Yeah. But he got out. He got out. And Assange got out. And there's a lot of people backing those people. He's sort of got out. He's a prisoner in a giant church. He's a martyr. Yeah. But that's what, you know, of course that is the... Can't have a normal life. What is that great fucking wonderful saying, the tree of liberty? Have you ever heard this before, this saying, I'm sure you've heard this. What is the tree of liberty that's built on the blood of the... Here it is. What? It has roots. The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. Thomas Jefferson. Yeah. Must be refreshed from time to time. You gotta feed that tree with blood. Yeah. Because it goes a certain way. It's like you have this ideal. Same thing with Mao and communism. We have this great idea that we're all equals. But then the people in charge, they're just people. And they'll start fucking up more and more and more. And I think it happens exponentially. The more they say like, oh, people won't do shit, then they start abusing the power more and more. It starts with a little bit. Those people get taken down here or there. You have... When we grew up, I've heard of public officials getting arrested, but it happens less and less. They protect their own. Then it gets worse and worse and worse. Yeah. And you gotta have blood. Take it back. Get back to the regular democracy, regular liberty. And then it gets corrupted a little bit over time. You're talking about the... Those great videos that pop up every once in a while, horrifying, horrible to watch, where a fucking elephant realizes it's an elephant and just goes rampaging through the streets. This thing has been... The little monkeys taught it that it was not an elephant. It convinced it somehow that it has this powerless thing when it's giant. I don't know how much an elephant weighs. Many, many, many tons. And that fucking thing, when they get just mad enough, they go nuts. Who's the elephant in the government? You can't know. The elephant is the people. Right. And so... Yeah, they'll go on a rampage. So what all tyrants forget is that the people as a whole are so much more powerful than any one individual. The people as a whole, they could do anything. Yeah. They're incredibly powerful. So if you divide them, if you create... It makes them less powerful. Ridiculous divisions among them, it makes them less powerful. If you create one common enemy that they all have, imaginary or real, then you can actually... If you look at the biomass of the people, if you're a tyrant... Let's all hate someone together. Yeah. If you can find a thing for them to all hate together, then you can actually channel their energy in those directions and control them. So if you look at the people as a kind of gigantic animal that tyrants want to tame, domesticate, and use for their labor, use for their nutrition, use for their energy... Yeah, but we don't have a tyrant. We have a net of tyrants wrapped around that elephant. Well, yeah. No, we... They're working together. Well, you have a... So it's like... You sort of follow it up. I really love that. And I'm sure it's an oversimplification, but I really love the term follow the money. When people say follow the money, if you want to know why something happened, follow the money. See who gets paid for it? Who made the most money from it. That's the first person you should look at. Might not be always the person who did it, but look at that guy. Yeah. You get the fucking... When a mystery... In a mystery book, you know, the person you want to look at... Who robbed the place? Well, who's spending a shitload all of a sudden? Yeah. Who just got a new fucking car? That's it. So you sort of like... So you look... Okay, who's making money off war? Who's making money off of the suffering of the world? Who's making money off of the destruction of the world? And so you do that. You just like, all right, let's see who the six richest people on the planet are. And you look at those people. You find out who those people are. And usually somewhere in those people or their ranks of friends, then you might be able to find this common enemy, right? You might be able to find like, here's the culprit behind a lot of this is that there is a, as Paul Simon says, in that stupid song, a loose association, a loose association of millionaires and billionaires. Just a... Yeah, just a... These are the days of lasers in the jungle. Thomas on a soldier's shoes, is that that? No, it's miracles and wonder and... Yeah, it's cool. But you got, you know, millionaires and billionaires, right? The friends, pals up there, just like we were talking about earlier, right? There's a bunch of super, super wealthy people. Think about somebody who has $10 billion, right? There are people out there who have $10 billion. Somebody who has $10 billion, $10 billion, right? Think of any congressman, any senator. Think about the friends of the congressman and the senator. Or think about anyone working, the businesses around the congressman. Imagine if you have $10 billion, right? And you go and have lunch with one of these senators who is in a state where you're trying to get one of your fucking fracking... Logging rights. Logging rights, right? And you have dinner with them, you're sitting down, you're just talking, man. It's awesome. He's kind of excited, even though he's not going to act like it, because he's sitting with a billionaire. Yeah. You're talking. It's a powerful guy. It's a powerful guy. You guys are laughing it off. I've seen one of the UFC ones. There's some super rich guy. Everyone goes, oh. What? Yeah. Yeah. But it's pretty easy just to, like, in a smart way to talk to the billionaire, but hey, man, how's that blah, blah, blah doing? And the senator's like, well, not as good as I'd like. And you're like, oh, what? Let me see what I can do. Are you kidding? Let me see. I'd love to invest in the next thing. I know a bunch of guys are working that. Let me see what I can do. I'm putting a good word for you. That's it. I'm putting that. And there's the whole way, the whole fucking thing. Who doesn't have access to that congressman? A garbage man. No. No. But the idea is if the people can figure out a way to turn back into the raging focused beast that is the horror of all tyrants. How are they going to figure out that way? Through the organizing power of the super advanced technology that garbage men do have access to, which they didn't have access to 10 years ago. Don't forget. There's a whole brand new player on the scene, man. And that is the law of exponential returns, which is that at this very moment, there is a technology that is completely, as far as we can tell, is not completely impossible to control, but mostly impossible to control. You have a wildfire of technology. Yeah, but I don't want to have control until way after I'm dead. Eventually they'll lose it, but it's like, I kind of want to like have some fun here while I'm on earth. You're going to have some fun. You're going to have some fun. Here are the two options, too. You can be like Australians who just know that their government is crooked and said, you know what, we can't change it. Let's just drink. And they have a lot of fun with their lives and they go on two month vacations when the government says, and I would do this, too, like these fucking idiots in Arkansas don't know shit. I'll tell them what's best for the country. Trust me. I know it's best for the country. I've read everything. You don't know anything. But then you realize that people in Arkansas, maybe they don't want what you want. Maybe they just want a peaceful, fun life. Right. They don't want like to be in 72 other countries. Well, look at the, maybe they don't want power and money. Maybe that's not their goal. I think you're in too much. It's like your agent telling you like, I know what's best for you. It's like, dude, I don't want to go to Minnesota in January. I think your pessimism is based on being in too much of a hurry. I think the machine that we're in is broken. Yeah. Pieces of it still work. Piece of it still work. Absolutely. I think the government works a lot. And it does fix itself. Marijuana is gradually becoming legal. The prohibition on marijuana is being lifted. There's the potential that within eight years psychedelics could be prescribed. And with these, with people gaining more access to psychoactive… So you think then it gives the revolutionaries more power. It gives them more control. Like if it's an up and down of who has the power, it gives the people, the revolutionaries, the people, the more power, the more they know and the more stuff gets out there. The tyrant, the people in control. So if I have… You become like the king of England when you have no real control, power. You, when you, okay, so let's imagine that you have, you are a lion tamer, right? And you have a lion that is weighs six times more than you, is 15 times faster, designed to kill. So there's some things that you want over the powers that you want over the tiger. You want to be in control of what it eats. You want to be in control of the information that it receives. You want to be in control of every single facet of that lion's life. Now in the old days, if you look at this idea that the society is a lion, that the people are a lion, right? And you look at this poor lion back in the 70s or 80s or 60s, that lion didn't know shit about what it was because the information coming into the lion was all being mostly controlled by a small group of people and the information streams that were getting was coming. The lions are like raised in the wild until they're like two. And then hopefully in a few years, the more information gets out, it'll be like a lion raised in the wild until four. Well, the lion's getting, the lion's getting the information. You're a lion. The lion's getting information coming from everywhere that's like, you are a lion, listen, here's the potential that you have. You are a lion. You have always been a lion. But like, what do you do? I went to this million mass march in New York and they were walking around saying like, we did it. And it's like, people barely listen to the message. Well, it's annoying people. But then it's like, what if they do hear the message, then what can they actually do to change it? Well, you just saw it, man. The fucking FCC just created a goddamn free internet. You just saw that. You know what the reason for that was too? What? It's all these other businesses said, no, you're protecting those businesses, but these businesses are going to be hurt by it. That's right. So the businesses went to war with each other. That's right. And they used the people. They said, hey, and they both opened up the information. So what do you people think? People think we agree with the smaller businesses over the bigger businesses. That's right. Or cable companies less than cable companies, these old dying, old fucking dinosaurs who've been spraying us with their goddamn poopy content forever. Those people are like watching the last thing these fuckers want is the demo democratization of the content. They don't want people to be able to decide what fucking content they want to watch. When you used to have a TV network, you just shotgun sprayed this nonsense at people networks. That's all there was. You're allowed to watch. Fucking watch. And then you have control of the entire paradigm when you do that. But this fucking lion, the lion of the people, not only is it suddenly getting access to all of these videos showing like how to become a wild lion again, how to escape from the cage, how do not fall prey to the mistakes of the other lions that want to do it. Do you think Comcast is just going to stop trying to get that power back? Nope. I don't think so. But I think they're going to become more and more irrelevant. That's what's going to happen. And here's another thing that you're forgetting. They become irrelevant when we get a new way to get the internet around. Bang! And that's going to fucking happen. But why is that going to happen? Because people say like, we can't rely on these guys to give us fucking internet anymore. Market pressures. Market pressures, man. People started getting fucking dish network when cable stopped kept going out. That's it, man. Market pressures. Uber popped up when calves refused to take credit cards. There you go. No, no. I drive you to ATM. No, man. I'm already at my location. I drive you to ATM. I just take my credit card. There you go, man. It's broken. And that is the machine that we're in working. Market pressures will create, at this moment in time, completely unexpected. So if Comcast wants to say, look, I've created this business that allows me to provide internet to people, who are you to say I'm not allowed to take money from Netflix and say, hey, can I get to the top? Because fucking supermarkets do it. Good shelves go to Coke and Pepsi. Bad shelves go to Werner's. You know? Yeah. And that's a right that supermarkets should be able to have. Yeah. They should have more expensive tickets at a stadium for more money, the ones closer to the field. Oh, yeah. But the problem is that you... But so then you were saying that the people, I'm just trying to think this out, then the people, well, citizens of the world, customers will go, oh, fuck, man. And then some guy will go, hey, there's a problem out there. Here's a better solution. You can sling-box the internet from China or from wherever, and that might work. Well, no, you look at what's his name. I don't remember. I think it's Elon. Put it on the air. No, who is it? It's not Elon Musk, but there is a... In one of my podcasts, I just went up to Singularity University, and the whole point of Singularity University is the study of... Yeah, it was a place called Singularity University. It's fucking badass. It's a badass place. And they study the law of accelerating returns, or they study the technology advancing. And one of the things he was talking about was how, in the same way right now, what we're doing right now, this technology that we're using was formerly completely inaccessible to people who weren't millionaires or had big businesses. In the same way, right now, if somebody said, hey, Ari, get a fucking satellite up there into space, would you? You think you can get a satellite up there into space? I'm like, fuck no, I can't do it. But these guys are saying, in 20 years, that kind of technology might be consumed, which means that if you... But it's also making losses, too. 20 years ago, you weren't allowed in the United States to arrest them without a trial. And now you are. Yes. No, no, no, no. I mean, they're making gains as well. That is true. But here's the difference. In the old days in the United States, when you wanted to drag somebody to a black prison in fucking Chicago, right? Which I'm sure happened. And the old days... You couldn't get the word out about it. Instantaneously, the word spreads all around the planet. All around the planet, everyone's like, what the fuck, Chicago? In the old days, you could have had some... You could have some fucking guy in your basement fucking just shoving a goddamn leather pole into his asshole for having a gram of weed. You released him onto the streets, he's like, the Chicago cops fucked my asshole for weeks. So what? What is it going to be? Who's going to listen to you? Nobody cares. But now video. That's why the cops didn't want anybody to shoot video. And it... They're just fighting against it so hard. But it's not working. Yeah. It's not working. And now more and more precincts are going, we'll just use the video, hey, cops, stop fucking around. Yeah. So that's the way I see it. That's why I say you're in a bit of a rush because you want things to change right now. But and this is like... This is in a scenario where there isn't a major terrorist attack. But like you see what's happening with Uber in a lot of places, that's a good one, it's a market. So this came out of the market, Airbnb, Lyft, yeah. These came out of a market that didn't quite satisfy what they needed. That's right. In a lot of these cities, the cabs have fought back and they've gotten the laws changed. So like here at LAX, you can't get an UberX. You can only get Uber, those limo ones, the big ones. Right. But it's like, why? We don't want that there. And it's like the cabs have fought back and they'll say, oh, because of this and this, you can't let them do that. Cabs are doomed. Cabs are doomed. They could do whatever... Anything that they do is just the pitiful... You're saying it's just like, you're just making delays. It's just a hurdle. Temporary. They will always jump over it. Temporary delays because market pressure... Like Napster, they were like, you can't do peer-to-peer. You remember the heyday of Napster? Of course you do. Yeah. I was in college, you were in college. Yeah, I remember Napster. I had to shift. I had to shift from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. but record stores just stay open. Tower records stay open until like 1 on Tuesday, like Monday nights, Tuesday because that's when the new records came out. And so you can go get the Beck CD, the Alanis Morris CD. I had both those CDs at 3 a.m. I got back by 3.30, burned with the cover, burned on these CDs because remember those label makers they had too? And they shut Napster down. They're like, nope. And they're like, cool, we did it. They're like, no, you didn't do it. You didn't ever know. You just made them say, oh, I can't go straight to another peer, I have to go through a computer first and then. Or we have to go straight to a peer, you can't go through a computer first, I think that's what it was. Yeah. And man, here's where I- You're just delaying it. I get it. I understand what you're saying. I understand what you're saying. Here's what's an even more beautiful thing which I like to fantasize about is that these market pressures, as they call them, are the thing that creates the demand for... Market pressures, the thing that created demand for democracy in the first place. Yes. There you go, man. Yeah. And I'm sure there's an- How many new forms of government? I'm sure there's an- But the old form of government doesn't just go away. They fight. That's the revolution. No, no, no, no. They fight. But this is what I like to believe. This is what I like to believe. You know that- That before it comes to a head, they won't have such free... Let's think of the term jihad. The term jihad. Okay. Let's think of the term jihad. It's a cool term. It's a term. It's my middle name. It's my middle name. Your middle name is jihad? Shut the fuck up. Yeah. No, it is not. Yeah. Let me see that. Well, this is an expired dog. How the fuck do you- I cannot believe they let you fly. It's David, you two. Oh, yeah. It's the most normal Jewish middle name, David. Oh, yeah. I can't believe you were going with that. Oh, my God. You're gonna end up in five. You would have known my name is jihad before fucking right now. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times, I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. I've fallen to times. So how, what do you think is the biggest nugget that you can find out about someone like that late in a relationship? What? Here's the idea. What are market pressures, right? They're these invisible things. It's overall zeitgeist, overall feeling. It rises within the heart of a person. It rises within a person. So I like to believe that this thing that is arising inside people, it actually is something that existed before people. That feeling that comes into a people that we call market pressures is the capitalist way of talking about a force of evolution that exists in the universe. The capitalist way of talking, and you have new people coming in and talking in a different language, huh? Yeah, no, I think that they've identified, this is what Kurzweil has identified. I think that they have identified something that exists in evolutionary symptoms that has as one of its, in evolutionary systems that has as one of its symptoms what we call market pressure. And that really what it is is the desire to be part of the exponentially accelerating movement in the direction of novelty and perfection that we're experiencing in the universe. And Jihad would be aligning yourself with that principle. It would be an accelerator. Yes. Being the first one to be an accelerator. I'm going to be an accelerator. Before like the cardigans, before everyone started doing it. Yeah, and all those who stand in the way of that exponential acceleration, all those who try to get in the way of this curve that's happening, all those that get in the way, not only will they be destroyed, decimated, and torn apart just by the sheer subjective gravitational forces that they're up against, but they'll also be taken down by the people because the people who have aligned themselves. Do you think Milton Republicans feel the same way? No, but that's why they look, that's why they get, they increasingly. They don't feel like we're creating change for the better and these people that are standing in the way will become irrelevant soon. I think that. We want this police state. We can trust police. We don't want gay people to get married. We don't want black people to vote. We don't want women to be able to vote. We don't want, you look, look at, look at the, look at. Over the years. Over the years. They get taken down. They get taken down. This is that Martin Luther King quote. What is it? I'm going to, the universe, hold on. It goes. But it's like, it's like in Libya, they let the, they let the people have the internet. They get the information and. And look what happened to fucking, uh. That didn't, non-violently. Well, no, it didn't. I'm not saying that, uh, I'm not talking about the, the, the, uh, we're going to avoid violence here. Uh, hold on. There's this great quote. Uh, okay. Yeah. Listen to this. Yeah. Martin Luther King, the arc of the moral universe is long, but it. Uh-huh. Sorry. Okay. The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. So this is the idea that, uh, that in that bend, that curvature that Martin Luther King has identified, has been identified by Ray Kurzweil. It's the curvature that happens in evolutionary systems that have, uh, accelerating returns. And that is what we're in right now as a system that is producing accelerating returns, which is mean, means that. It's like, it's who's a version of what justice is. Well, well, no, this is where this is what I'm getting to, man. It's not who's version of what justice is. If we're talking about a transcendent principle, the percentage of people who would have believed, especially when I was growing up in my conservative, uh, or my Orthodox Jewish, um, upbringing, uh, if you're dealing drugs, like, yeah, of course you should be going to jail. They caught the right guy. That guy was dealing marijuana. But then later my feeling is, uh, that guy shouldn't go to jail at all. Right. Uh, I don't know. Get a store. Yeah. Um, my parents might still feel the same way, but it's like more and more people start thinking like that guy shouldn't go to jail at all. But I don't know. I don't know if the percentages get better or if I'm just seeing those people. Well, I think that the percentages not only are getting better, but they're getting better faster. Yeah. And I, and I, and I think that that. Right. Super fast. Super fast. And I, and cause it's like, I mean, I was, but if I'm not being aware of any of this to super aware of a lot of the, the egregious things that big business has done to the law. That's it. And also an aside. And that's just like the egregious things that big business has done. Those things that come out through documentaries on Netflix or those things that come out through legal means are also being, uh, uh, or side by side with information that's being obtained, uh, surreptitiously by these, uh, I think I mispronounced that word, but by people like Snowden. You got it. You're looking at whistleblowers, corporate leakers. So you're seeing that a lot of this stuff also, because the thing is like it used to be all of their secrets were kept in locked file cabinets and basements with armed guards. Now their secrets are being kept inside file cabinets that are accessible by anyone in the entire planet. Once you get smarter. Yeah. And they're yanking those secrets and they're disseminating those secrets through the world. And more and more and more, the people are seeing the actual shape of the lion tamer that's trying to keep us subjugated to the selfish whims of a small group of people who want to experience high levels of pleasure, completely inaccessible to other people on the planet. I think a lot of it too is though that that's true. I think a lot of those, sometimes people get more conservative the older they get and the people that were activists become the problem. Yeah. You know, that, that I suppose that's a, there's a very few Bill Walton's in the world. Yeah, man. The thing is like these kids that are coming up right now, they're understanding of principles that when we were kids, we had no understanding of because we are in and when we were growing up, we were in a kind of low level North Korean sea of propaganda. Yeah, but we thought marijuana cause 70s and those people were, they're all in power now and out of power already. Guess who? One of, one of them's in fucking power right now. Fucking be rock Obama and when be rock Obama's in power, no matter how much you hate the drone king and all the fucking weird secret, he's the one that put in, we can arrest anybody whenever we want. He saw the NSA abuses and said continue. Yeah, but you know what else he's doing and I'm not a no, he wasn't gay marriage more and what else is being legalized while he's sitting back there and the fucking up there and the some weed is yes. Yeah. So you're looking. So like, listen, man, it may just be that some of these people figured out that if you want to fucking, you know, create steps, you're gonna do little steps and awful compromises. I don't know. I'm not defending anybody who thinks it's okay to fly over a fucking city and bomb people with drones and just don't talk about it. Yeah. People and never have to try an indefensible position voted down once then say fuck, we'll try again. We'll get it in. Indefensible position. But here's another at angle. You got to look at. But weed is legal. That seems like one of those here. Take this. Idiots. I don't think so. Cause you're with people. You go fuck. Here. Here. Here. Here. Take this healing psychoactive substance. All right. Your bloodstream makes you contemplate not only your own life in very deep ways and quite often compels you to improve or at least makes you feel kind of shitty about aspects of your life and put that in your bloodstream. Oh, people. Now that, it's not like booze where you drink the shit and you feel like you wake up in the morning and don't want to do anything. So you're saying if you ingested this amazing thing, then you wouldn't be likely to grow up and vote in the power to arrest people and never, and never try them. I'm saying you're talking about marijuana, getting into the bloodstream of the people and you're also talking about the potential for psychoactive chemicals like psilocybin to be legalized within eight years. And if you think that is not going to. What? What's eight years? This is coming. And forgive me, people over at MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies. But these guys are some of the people who are behind the study of psychoactive substances because formerly it was impossible to study these substances in any real way. Now we've got a lot of data that's not just coming from active studies being done with people using MDMA or psilocybin, but you also have all of these. Baby stuff, baby stuff, and bigger stuff. But you have all this data from just like surveys of people who've been doing it for years and years and years. And you can look at like one of these studies just came out where they showed the difference in suicide rates and depression from people who regularly have used mushrooms versus people who haven't. And people who've used these psychoactive substances seem to have lower rates of depression. I'm probably misquoting that study a little bit, but the whole point is you're looking at a country that had been put into a slumber by lack of information and lack of psychoactive substances. You're looking at what happened when those psychoactive substances entered the bloodstream of the people. That was what we call the 60s, which was actually a pre-show revolution where you saw this explosion of art. You saw this explosion of social movement. And then they pulled back the psychoactive drugs from people. They sure did. But guess what? Now it's coming back. Now not only is it coming back, but every time. But now it comes back and also we can make videos about it. Yes. And they're like, oh no, no, no, no, no. You're not even. It's not even what you think. Yeah. You can see experience in tons of people and message boards about everything you need. This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius. I'm an Aquarius. Yeah. Well, this is your age, friend. And you're looking at, I think you're looking at something that's going to make the 60s. I would love that. You're going to look at something that's going to make the 60s look like one of those fucking backyard inflatable bouncy house parties with a bunch of like greasy kids eating fried chicken and jumping around on the fucking thing. That's what the 60s are going to be compared to what's coming. Well, I have advice to the new people as the psychoactives get bigger. Guys come up with a new like a fashion about mushrooms and stuff, like the same pictures like that, like on your, on that thing, on your base. Yeah. Like that was from the 60s. So don't just rely on the fashion from the 60s. Yeah. Get new stuff. Yeah. Well, we're all relevant today. We're always going to like rainbow colors, brother. Okay. Maybe. Every time a kaleidoscope, like, come on. You're not going to get us away from like, we like rainbow colors, brother. We like it. It's colorful. It's pretty. Colors are pretty. Yeah. Colors are pretty. You're not going to get away from that, but what you are going to get to is the ability to use 3D printers to print out some of the insane geometries that you see during these dimethyl tryptamine trips. You're going to look at like the ability to actually, one of Terrence McKinnon's great and ridiculous dreams was that he thought that he thought it might be possible to go into the DMT realm and actually bring back something from that realm, like pull something from that place and bring it here. Obviously, I don't know how much of that sounds like French. Is that French? I mean, it's all about different dimensions in the ship, but it's like, it's all like, you have to go to LSD in order to go to the other dimension, but it's like, yeah, you fuck up when you take something back. You're not supposed to take something back. Never take something back. Because then, though, their weight on that dimension is less and our weight is suddenly more. Now there's no more balance. Cool. Well, I think it's a, there's a potentiality or 3D, 3D printers become a nexus point through which the contents of the psychedelic mind emerge into this dimension and from the seeing these like shapes and forms and runes and sigils and all the content of the things that exist in the deep levels of the subconscious mind or the external astral plane, whatever you want to fucking call it, to suddenly see those things in this dimension existing in a three-dimensional shape or form. We don't know what that could do because we, but we do know what happens when some of the information from those places comes into this dimension in the linguistic form and that is that when people bring back the info from the DMT realm and they're capable and careful in their articulation of it, it can create some pretty profound social change. So what about the structures there? What about the forms themselves? Are these things fucking alien machines? What if these are gears that we could actually bring back that could create shifts that we aren't even aware of? Who the fuck knows? But the point is, we are getting to a point, thanks to technology, where with greater and greater and higher definition, we can articulate the secret contents of the mind and that, sir, is going to be your revolution, or at least part of it. I like that. That'd be wonderful. But. That'd be great. It all comes down to how it's played out, I guess. Well. There's one little thing that happened that might make you mad or less mad. There is one little problem. What? Proliferation of nuclear weapons, biotech, and a small group of fucking lunatics in the world who would rather destroy the entire planet than experience any form of techno-utopia, especially one that involves outliers, the sacrifice and abandonment of religion. That's one thing people want to do, the sacrifice and abandonment of national borders, the sacrifice and abandonment of all ridiculous theologies, theocracies, political systems, all forms of power structure that have limited and. People that go burn it all. Yeah. Just blow it up then. Yeah. Well, guess what? We'll climb out of the fucking ashes and all you goddamn redditors and internet people. Good luck for surviving in a collapsed society, you motherfuckers. Yeah. Let me shut down the roads. Yeah. Roaches. If the roaches in your house decided that realized that you were about to fucking spray the whole thing and get rid of them, they're like, you'll just burn your fucking house down, motherfucker, and then we'll still be fine and you'll be fucked because we're roaches or cockroaches. We don't care. We don't want the things that you want. Sounds like the improvs. What do you mean? They set up the corporate improv. They set up in a town where there's a mom and pop comedy club that's been there forever and they go, we'll operate at a loss for years while we take half your business. Oh, that's fucked. And put you out, then we'll be the only club in town because we have a court. We have 30 other ones that can support us. Right. But that is not the individual improv, but the corporate ones are like that. That's their goals. But that's the problem, man. That is a problem because 7-Eleven to the mom and pop shops and fucking the East Village, all those bodegas. 7-Eleven comes in and says, fucking, you'll be gone soon. Yeah. Yeah. That is one of the little bits of that's a bit of fucking poop in the machine here, man, is that, yeah, you got that ability for people to do that in various ways. And for me, it's just the worrisome thing. I hope it won't happen. What? That violent revolution? Okay. Let's imagine a small group of people as a last resort. I mean, if they all, yeah. Back them in the corner, right? And as a last resort, or not even as a last resort, but just as a viable option, all they got to do is like detonate a dirty bomb in any of the major cities of the United States. Pin the detonation of that dirty bomb on any country that you want to create a fake enemy. Just try to, yeah. And now you have created the, what would be the precursor to the thing you're talking about, which is a police state where freedom of speech gets curtailed. And so then you realize like, oh shit, not only is there loonies running around the Middle East who have a real strong desire to pull something like that off, but if we believe that there are nefarious agents that exist in governments of the world or outside of governments in the world, whose sole motivation is to have power over the most number of people and to extract and harvest the energy from those people in the forms of money, then now you have two groups that exist in the world who have a desire to detonate or to pull off a massive attack in the United States. Not just one, you have two, which means that, so, yeah. So now you're in, now it's like shit, man, not only do we have people outside of us that would like that to happen, but there's people inside of us who, if they knew it was going to happen, they might not want to stop it. They might want to let it happen. And a lot of fucking truthers say that's what happened except in the 11th. I was in New York when that guy from Baltimore went up and shot two cops in their car, sitting in their car, because of Eric Garner and because of what happened to Ferguson. And I think his thing, I think he said, they kill one of ours, we kill two of theirs, we might have said they kill two of ours, we kill two of theirs, I don't know. But it was the NYPD. He took a train up from Baltimore to kill two NYPD officers. And the reaction afterwards from the people was not that of outrage. Like when two cops get killed, two innocent cops, they were just sitting there, they didn't do anything. These guys weren't the problem. They were just sitting there in their cop car. They weren't the problem. They're part of an organization that has problems. So then they kill. And then now the reaction is, they could either go, well, now we're going to fucking clamp down on anybody. And it looks like it's wrong. We're going to beat the fuck out of, or they can go, let's start wearing fucking, let's stop beating people up. Let's say when we don't put people in choke holds, we actually don't put them in choke holds. I don't know, man. I just see it happening more and more. The outliers are the ones that fucking ... Well, that's what you have to worry about. They start the violence off. That's brother. That's the spooky thing that this guy at Singularity University said is that ... Commend their bravery. He said that accelerating, whose bravery do you commend? People willing to take up, put their life in danger to fucking, because they're so mad about this injustice. I don't think they're smart. I don't think they've thought it out, but their bravery is ... It is a problem. I used to think like that. They have that more than I do. I used to think like that, too. I used to think like that, too. And I would have these ... And this is when I first started meeting these Rom-Daz people. And sometimes I still think like that, but ... And I remember I was always like, ah, we got to fucking fight back and burn it down, burn down the house, fight back, fight back. It was the grunts. That's what's going to happen. Usher them. Usher them. In the same way that if you go back and look at the predictions for our time period, like back in the 30s or the 40s, nobody ... As far as I'm aware, even though there's some ... There's a theologian. There's a Jesuit priest named Taliar de Chardon who kind of predicted the internet in a weird way. But usually when you look at the drawings of what the future looks like, it's really funny. Like, you know, like Victorian era future predictions or like ... It's also flying cars. Everyone's out. In reality, probably no one's out. Carriages will fly, you know, but they're using like their highest tech and then just applying to the highest tech, like what they would like to see happen, right? So or the carriages would not have a horse, but it's still like the way the carriages look. They don't look like fucking cars, you know? So in the same way, they didn't predict the internet. They didn't see this unifying technology that emerged out of nowhere and that we all ... Which is profoundly and continues to profoundly shape business and society. So in that same way, man, I think that we have to open up ourselves to the potentiality of the emergence of a new form of revolution that does not involve participating in the same acts of violence that they set up for us. Yes, because the moment you do it, it's matter and anti-matter. When you say it, it's pretty much just wait and it'll get taken care of. If you're rushing it, you're going to fuck it up. I'm not saying wait. I'm saying be vocal as you can using the technology that we have at our hands to at least put out there the idea that if we all work together and if we all focus our internal desire so that it creates a market pressure, then maybe we can summon out of the ether a new modality that is even more effective than the standard practices of revolution which are generally violent. Maybe we can come up with a new ... Well, I think in their terms. I heard Howard Stern talking about podcasts and why they're irrelevant and he goes, that's not the way to become a fucking radio guy. You had to train at these stations and you're like, no, no, dude, that's not their end goal. Nobody wants that. Their end goal is not to get their own radio show. He goes, these losers, they don't know how to go out to break. They don't know how to do a segment break. What do you talk? We don't even think in those terms. It's so ridiculous what he said that it's almost sweet because this is this idea. First of all, it's sweet because Howard Stern thinks. He's a cute old man. Yeah. There's something sweet about it. First of all, Howard Stern thinks that people in the world actually want to wake up at 3AM every morning to do a fucking radio show. Are you out of your mind? Nobody wants that life. Number one, nobody wants that life. No one wants to get cooped up in a fucking radio studio constantly. No one wants to be a workaholic like you, Howard Stern. Nobody wants that. You know what I would like? His interviewing skills. That guy is a great fucking interviewer. No doubt about that. She was. Yeah, he was. But yeah, but he's ridiculous because he's completely underestimating, misapprehending. Just not understanding what would be the value there. Or allowing his desire for the way he's letting- It's like when people look at skateboarding. It's like, it's not going to, it's like seeing what people do like out of it, what people like. Yeah, you can't imagine the changes that are going to happen in the next few years. Because the changes are happening, it's so important to even more so today, if you're putting information out there. To be right. To be right, but also to encourage acts of civil disobedience that don't involve blowing the fucking brains out of people who have moms and dads and kids and a life. And more than likely, man, they didn't fucking wake up in the morning and think, let's go shoot some fucking, let's go shoot some fucking black- And the problem is senators and whatever, even like Philip Morris executives, they're not looking at the actual desk and saying, I did that. They're just like, that's numbers, people get canceled, people don't. And they're a friend. Yeah. And then it's like, you're not evil. You're just not really seeing the actual damage you're doing. It's gonna be shown. Let's see that. Let's see them for what they are, which is like instead of painting everybody in the visage of service. They're evil. We're not. It's like, we're all evil. Yes. We all be there in that position. How about this? Because I'm a lawyer, then all of a sudden you're working with some client. How about this? We're all doing the best we can. We're not that. We're doing the best that we can. And God damn it, we're gonna figure out a way to do it in the same way. Not kill you. Take you out of power. We're gonna figure out a way to do it. Take you out of power. A different way, other than violence. We're gonna figure out a way, maybe not even to take you out of power, but to transform you from the inside out and keep you in power. Sure, that could be that. What about that? Steve Simone, I like what he says. He goes, he always votes against the incumbent when he votes because he's like, you haven't done it. You haven't changed anything. So you're done. Next. Yeah, right. Next guy, give it a try. Keep the wheel turning, Matt. I don't know if the new guy's gonna do anything, but I know the old guy won't, so goodbye. And bring that idea, man, if you bring that sense of optimism into your own life and imagine that there is the potentiality at any given moment in your existence for some new bit of information or new epiphany to emerge into your mind that completely and radically transforms your approach to your existence in a way that puts you in a heightened level of happiness than you ever had in your life, then maybe it'll come. It's better than going around and thinking things have always been this way, things are always gonna be this way because that line of thinking, not that you think like that, but some depressed people do, that line of thinking is the old school line of thinking, which is that one plus one plus one plus one plus one. But we exist in a system of accelerating returns, not just in an outside universe, but in an inside universe. It's not two plus two. It's two times two. Times. I want equals the same thing. Two times two and two plus two is the same thing. Then times two again, now you're seeing the difference. Or times four. Now it's eight instead of six. Two times two is four times four times eight times eight times 64 times 64. Do that math. Square it. Yeah. And that could happen. And when that fucking crazy expansion happens, and guess what? It already did happen. You know what? When it happened the first time, the big fucking bang, this nice goddamn super collapsed singularity exploded out into time. And we are particles that came from that initial boom with the fucking exploded out, man. And it exploded out fast. The initial expansion of the universe theoretically, and they don't know, of course, they're just all theoretical. The fuck knows what that was. But it went, it may have expanded faster than the speed of light. It was such a massive explosion. In the same way, this thing that we are approaching, it could happen just as quickly. It could be just as explosive. And that means that the, our intentions, the intention of every living sentient being on this planet, if the intentions are off, then you could actually shape or form this massively accelerating thing. It's like having a chimpanzee on the steering wheel of a fucking Ferrari going 200 miles per hour. You want to- I did a bit in my new special about non-violently protesting the TSA. How does it go? Well, I don't want you to give it away. Just like the things you can do or say to lie to them or fuck with them in some way. I've seen you do it. You can feel like you're not part of the problem, you're not accepting it. You know, I was thinking about, I saw this amazing, remember, I don't remember back when that fucking awful piggy pepper sprayed those college students, remember that? Yeah. So, and do you remember the protest against the dean of the school? Did you see that awesome protest? I don't know. I should show it to you, but they all gathered where she gets off work, kind of what you're talking about. And I believe that they sat there and as she walked to her car, they just silently watched her. But it's so many students just sitting there and the silence is just like thick and this woman walks out shamed with all these students just quietly watching her not saying anything. And I was thinking like, yeah, maybe that's the answer to the TSA as you get the majority of people as they're going through the TSA to not look at them or talk to them, you know, to not say anything to them, to not acknowledge them, to alienate them or to give them a feeling of like, we are going to, in this game that you are forcing us to participate in, our participation is going to be as minimum, we are going to participate in the most minimum way in the smallest way so that these people don't even, you know, that would gradually wear on you, I guess, it would wear on you, you know? Maybe even they just hired new people. Yeah, I don't know the answer to the fucking TSA problem. The point is though, it's like nonviolent protests is cool. It's fun. It's cool. You feel like you're actually doing something. Way more powerful, man. Way more powerful. And historically, nonviolent protests have done some pretty incredible things in this country. Shroomfest is here. It's August 29th through 31st. Yeah! Coming up. Well, not really. It's kind of far away. When is this coming out? When do you put these out? When is Shroomfest? August 29th through 31st. I'm probably going to put this up tomorrow. Well, then people should work now on getting their supplies for Shroomfest. Oh, yeah. You don't wait till last minute. That's what everybody does. I can't get any. Do you have a website for Shroomfest dedicated to Shroomfest? Yeah. If you Google Shroomfest Primer, you'll see everything you've ever wanted to know about Shrooms. Ari, what else? Have you ever read that? I haven't read it yet. Did I get it wrong? Oh, okay. I haven't read it. Okay. What else is going on, Ari? Where can people find you? How can people see you? Talk about your new show. My new show? This is not happening. Duncan did one of them. It's not a new show. Actually, it's been around for five years. We did some for TV and the internet. Yours has now, I think, the second most hits. That's amazing. Maybe third. That's crazy. Yeah. Up there. That's crazy. I told you. I was like, it's going to get $100,000. You're like, no way. Now it's got $200,000. Wow. That's amazing. Howdy, Krishna. Thanks, you guys, for watching that. Yeah. And you did a fucking cool job of it, too. Well, that's because of your encouragement, Ari. You're really good at directing that thing. You're really good at, like, remember when I called you and went through the thing with you? You're really good at producing that show, man, because you put me at ease. You made it so that, like, you know, it's, like, something like that, if you do stand up for me, if you do stand up. It's outside the box. It's outside the box. It's a little creepy to do something that doesn't have the normal punch lines that you're used to. I've done this 75 times. I know how this goes. Yeah. It's harder when you don't. Harder. But it was fun, man. It's a cool show, too, man. It's so great that it's comedy-centric. Yeah. I got to do a better job of that, actually. I talked to them when we had a year in, like, talk, and it was like, I need to talk to more comics. I need to work through with them. I feel bad about, like, you're my good friend, Renize is my good friend. I don't mind talking to you. Like, hey, so how are you doing? Let's talk as colleagues. Other people, I felt like I was, like, infringing on their creative process and, like, assuming that, like, I can help. I don't know. It just felt wrong. No, man. You never felt like that. Your directing was always, like, do what you want. But then it's also, like, here's how to make it more concise, or here's how to, you know what I mean? I don't think you need this part, because it kind of distracts me. Yeah. It's cool. And I think people when they're, I think people are kind of out of their element when it comes to storytelling, especially comics, you know, only in the sense that, like, even though comics are storytellers, it's, like, that kind of storytelling is different. Yeah. Some people are really good at already Big J, Joey Diaz, Jay Larson. That is storytelling comics, you know? Yeah, they just know how to do that so good. Oh, Joey Diaz is such a great storyteller. But man, I mean, also, there's the added pressurized, like, for me, man, it's, like, when I'm doing shit in front of cameras like that, it's heavy, dude. I tried to settle up so it didn't feel, it just felt like a show instead of a taping. It did feel like a show, but it still felt kind of, it was, it was, it's always, there's no way around that. Yeah. It's always going to be pressurized, but it's a cool thing the way you do it. You know, it actually reminded me of the way Derek Waters directs drunk history. It's a kind of similar approach, which is this, like, it's not like he's like, he, like, just lets you feel like you can do anything. It lets you feel like whatever's coming out of you is going to be just fine because he knows that's going to put you in the mind state where the best is going to come out. Dude, JP did this for me before I did Conan. He was like, hey, if you want to go into the crowd, like, if something happens, you should do that. And I was like, okay. And he goes, and they're going to give you like countdown every 30 seconds, let you know when you're done. And he goes, don't worry that much about that. Wow. I was like, don't go crazy, but like, and I was like, all right, it just made you feel more free. Yeah. But also I have a new special come, my next, my last special, it's, they're airing it March 13th on Comedy Central. I thought they already aired it. This is the one I did two years ago. Oh, cool. That was like out of print. So great. That's coming right up. You guys watch that. Every Thursday nights is this not happening. Rogan's is coming up. Segura's. You got any road dates coming up? Diaz. Yeah. I'll be in Portland next weekend and at the Helium and then Brea and Sacramento. Beautiful. And I'm going to Australia, fuck around and go to Thailand too. I feel that. Glory. I hope Bennett is out there listening to this and will entertain you as a guest. I want to go all around. I want to do some shit in Thailand. Oh man. Thailand looks like a hoot. I've always wanted to go there. Beautiful out there. They talk about this full moon parties. They tell me all the, all these cool people in Hong Kong and they expose like, oh, there's some cool shit out there. I want to do it. Well, Thailand people reach out to Ari, follow him on Twitter, watch this is not happening. Watch his special. I'll shoot a rocket launcher off an elephant. There you go.

Greetings to you, sweet friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast, a beacon of light warding off the vampires of darkness, hopefully, from your life. In my life, for that matter, these raven-winged croakers of the wind, the ones who spread their incredible stories of fear, horror, lack, limitation, despondency, the impending apocalypse. My Christ, I went to the doctor yesterday. I like this new doctor. He's a new doctor. I haven't had a doctor in a while. He shoved his finger in my ass. That's not why I like him. I mean, I like the fact that he told me my prostate's doing great. When you get older and your meat body starts melting down, you never know what they're going to find. So it's always a relief when an older man withdraws his fingers from your asshole and tells you, your prostate's great. Thank you, doc. Thank you, my God. God, let me suck your dick. Thank you. I'm so happy to hear that my prostate is fine and the meat body is doing well. One thing I've been noticing, though, is there is a tendency these days in miserable people and elderly people to think it's the fucking apocalypse. Have you guys noticed that? It's very rare to come upon a radiant, sweet person who also will tell you that the world is ending. But my God, when people are like older people, as we get closer to the great void, the vacuum, whatever you want to call it, I mean, the truth of the matter is, we're sort of in a matter crack on which either side is infinity, the clear light, whatever you want to call it, the great, beautiful, radiant, infinite, sweet, never-ending expansiveness of emptiness that we hear talked about in Buddhism in certain forms of Christianity. And we're in a kind of meat crack right now where we're on the, I don't want to say the wrong side of the wall, but the other side of the wall, there's a lot more space. Here, we're sort of stuck in a gravity well or smashed into a planet. We're basically pushed into this dimension. There are more meat balloons being filled up with a kind of sentient, infinite energy. And once we get in here, we take it very fucking seriously. Where people of the crack is essentially what we are. Meat people of the crack is how, I believe Khalil Gabron referred to us in his wonderful poem, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack. It's one of my favorite Khalil Gabron poems. Oh God, I love Khalil Gabron. Sit upon synthetic fur with my lover and pour honey on my balls while I read Khalil Gabron to my sweet. But you know, we're in a meat crack and we're sentient. And once we get in here, we have to deal with the fact that these meat balloons that have been inflated with consciousness, the soul, whatever karma, the karmic patterns, the an outflow of infinite love, energy, however you want to put it, these fucking balloons, they get holes in them. They gradually deflate or quite often they just get like exploded by some catastrophe. And so it's a tough thing to deal with the fact that you're meat balloon. You know, that's one of my favorite kids books. When I was growing up, my mom used to read that to me. It's hard to be a meat balloon. I think it was Dr. Seuss. I don't have it memorized. I never was much of a memorizer, but I believe it went something like, it's hard to be a meat balloon. Sometimes you feel like a flesh cartoon, all swollen out into time and space. You've got a name, you've got a face, and yet you know you're nothing at all. And still you roll the bowling ball or some shit. I can't remember exactly how it goes. It's something like that. Because we pushed out of the infinite into Western society at the particular time that we pushed out into, we haven't really been taught about what we really are, so we get super attached to the meat balloon. And when the thing starts deflating, then we have to deal with it. And the way some people deal with it is by saying it's the fucking apocalypse. This is what happens. If you look down at your fingers and you realize, oh shit, man, things are getting a little more wrinkled than I expected, or you look at yourself and you're getting old, and you're also talking about how you think it might be the end of the world, then you're right and you're wrong. You're right in the sense that, well, it's the end of the world, if you think the world is the temporary blister of meat protruding in the time-space continuum that has your face and name attached to it. Yeah, for sure, that thing's gonna dissolve, pop, whatever, it's gonna go back. But if you think it's the end of the world for all the other meat balloons popping into this particular crevice of reality, I think that's just rude. Come on, gang, let's face it, we're all that exhalation of the divine into this meat crack. God blew into the meat crack and inflated a lot of meat balloons, billions of meat balloons, not just human meat balloons, crickets and rats and squirrels and elephants and giraffes. There's all kinds of meat balloons roaming around this particular pocket of time and space. Beautiful meat balloons, but the human meat balloon, my God, when the clown of time begins to warp and twist the human meat balloon into a variety of sinister shapes, well, fuck, it can seem really scary. But the moment you realize the puffed-up thing parading around in the spotlight, whatever it may be that's causing you to react in a negative way, it's just a temporary balloon inflated with the exhalation of a superintelligence that is composed of love. Just a meat balloon, warped by a time clown. This concept is better expressed through song. Here's a track from Klee Williams' upcoming album For Giving the Time Clown, available on Silver Phoenix Records. That's not my enemy. That's just a meat balloon twisted into the form of my ex-wife by the clown of time. And now a reading from the 19th patriarch of Zen. Honey, do you know where my phone is? Sorry, it's the third patriarch. It's the third patriarch of Zen. The 19th patriarch of Zen, he wasn't the best patriarch. The way is perfect, like vast space, where nothing is lacking and nothing in excess. Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject that we do not see the true nature of things. Have you seen my phone? We have an excellent podcast for you today. Johnny Pemberton is here with us. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Squarespace.com. Somewhere in space at this very moment, a galactic wasp the size of 17 suns is heading towards planet Earth, its eyes ablaze ready to inhale our entire planet into its gnashing mandibles. But that's not going to happen for at least 200 years. And until then, you can have an incredible website that potentially could allow the wasp to offer you mercy and transport to a new home planet. Yes, the galactic wasp is coming, but if you've got a great website on the worldwide web, they say the wasp will grant you mercy. Also, a lot of us, we listen to podcasts because we want to laugh. Maybe we want to get a little bit of knowledge, but also because we all want to be billionaires. We all want to live in compounds, fortresses surrounded by our own hired army to defend against the hordes of zombies that are going to descend upon us when the galactic wasp nears planet Earth by just a few light years. The effect of the vibratory essence of the wasp is going to raise the dead. This has been predicted in the book of Revelations. Only they attribute this to the presence of the second coming of Christ. In fact, the reason is because of the resonance of the galactic wasp that is headed our way. And I'm going to give you, I guess you could call this a ticket to billions.

Every time... Get set, turn off the met. I got echo and I'm living like a bet on the street with a cat and a cat on my back. I got a black cat on my back. Claws dug deep, can't go back. Starbucks sitting on the curb like a rat. Hey, I got two bowls, give me that. Teeth, I don't think I need them. Spit them out. White gems landing in the water spout. Yo, I love white gems. Black Timbs scratching up the walls like my name was Magrim. Shave my head, rename myself Magrim. Call myself a lady, but they think I am a him. I took back, slicked back with the buttock tap. I got a fucking little baby called a mudflap. Keeps it pooping, dropping on my buddy's lap. That's where I'm sitting, that's where I'm shitting. Dropping on the mudflap, never, never quit in. I got poop coming out like a poop shower. Got gutters better than a brain spell. Motherfucker, you better sit, not shout. Cause I'm a poop boy you shoot, I know who, how, who is out and I get, get, get, get out. Mice, stay out of my life, mice. You guys are listening to... That's the rap genius of Johnny Pemberton. He just came off a pretty incredible tour. I did, yeah. Did I? Yeah, you did. So, what's that like, man? Moving, transitioning from comedy to hip hop. It's, it's, well, it's, some people say it's just natural, but some people say it's, it's, it's hard. I find it to be kind of a little bit in between. Do you get a lot of judgment or do people, are you getting a lot of like staying? Actually, I get a lot of hate. I love the tracks, Stay In Your Lane. Yeah. From your album, it's like a combination attack of, I guess, the idea that we should even have a president mixed in with it seems like a personal attack against some of your haters. Yeah, I love attacking my haters. Yeah, man. You were known for being one of the top hip hop stars. You got hate, bring it on. I'll take it. I'll absorb it like a sponge made of dust. Yeah. You, I was actually speaking of haters. We were in the airport and there was a dude who was loudly talking onto his phone. Loud. So you mean a normal person? No. This was like, it's not even like the normal like, you know, airport, Lumix. Right. Who's like talking into their phone and it's just like, how can you get mad at these? You don't know what's happening. They're going to funerals. They're going to surgeries. Who the fuck knows? Yeah. This dude, he's on his phone yelling, I have so many haters. I have so many haters. People hate me. They hate me, but it makes me stronger. How big is this guy? He wasn't big. He's just like, Like a white guy? He was, I think he was like some kind of like YouTube star or something. Cause he was like, he was filming himself, but I could also see like, maybe he was a life coach cause he was giving someone a lesson. Yeah. He was, he was filming something. He wasn't on the phone. Was he? Well, on the phone in the sense that he was looking into it. Oh, right. Okay. But then there was this moment where there's like a, a, a, you know, some worker at the airport. And I don't know he's talking to, I don't know if he's recording himself, but he looks over at the. The worker. And he's like, come on. Do you have haters? And the worker looks at him and just instant in the moment, he looks at me and he's like, I really don't. It was so sad. Cause the guy like, you know, Wanted to have a moment. He wanted to have a moment, but also I think in that moment, he was being thwarted by the realization that, you know, maybe you don't necessarily need to have haters. Maybe that's, that's an indication, not of success so much as an indication that you, you're screaming into your phone at airports. And that's why you got haters. Right. Cause that thing that you're doing with a phone, you're probably doing in different ways. Right. Yeah. The way you drive. Yeah. That's the big thing. I always give a benefit. I give so much benefit of so much doubt all the time. And I guarantee most of my doubt benefits are not true. I don't. You know, I always probably go to the bathroom. My bad. Oh, she's probably like just moved here. Oh, she probably like can't see that well. Right. Well, you, you have to, I mean, it's better to give the benefit of the doubt. Right. Like you want to do that. Like you don't want to chase someone down and beat him with a piece of, what do you keep in your passenger seat? Dude. When I was getting radiation therapy, I was running late for that horrific event. And I needed to get over in traffic. Yeah. Right. And I remember like, but I'd fucked up. I don't remember what I did, but I needed to get over. I wasn't, that made a mistake. And this dude, I needed to get in front of him and the guy wouldn't let me over. Did you wave? I was like, come on, let me over. But I had done something. Like it was like, I hadn't been driving normally and the guy drives by me and he goes, fuck you. Yeah. And I thought, I get it now. Like how many times I've done that thing. What are you guys doing? Yeah. Not yelling fuck you, but I've been enraged at some asshole in traffic. Yeah. And then it's like, and I'm looking at him thinking, oh yeah, I get it. Yeah. You don't know. How would you know? Right. It's not like I'm flashing some pitiful ass thing on the back. Yeah. There's no way to know. Right. So it's just to judge you immediately and decide like, oh, that person looks like they're having problems. Yeah. Or if you see someone who's like, can barely reach over the wheel and is old and is sort of confused and kind of doing that thing where they're like, looking with their chin up, looking around like over their face. Then you're like, oh shit, they're going to kill somebody. Yeah. Just driving a steel missile through the fucking maze. That happens all the fucking time. Like old people just make a little mistake and oh, I just killed a bus full of teens. I know you hear about that. Going up the interstate the wrong way, for example. What? That's a classic. You know, you hear about that. And, and yeah, it's, it's, you know, I guess like we gave them too much of the benefit of the fucking doubt. We should have like taken their driver's license away for them. Take them away. Put them away. Lock them up. Shut them up. I don't agree with this. Take them away. Shut them down. Lock them out. Dude, you're. Lock them up. Shut them away. Push them down. Right when you start doing that is where you and I, I think split into two different categories because to me, I just don't agree with your like geriatric prison. Retirement should be a punishment, not a gift. Dude, that's so fucked up. 65 still alive. It's time to get out. Get out. Get off the freeway, Sally. I'm going to lay. I'm just going to, I'm going to lay down a track from your album. Okay, go ahead. And it's just a beat. And then I love it if you could do like a live rendition of your rap, like railing against senior citizens. Oh yeah. That's a big hit actually. Okay. I'm going to drop it in. Hang on. Let me just put the beat down. Hang on. I'm pulling and I can't get up. We're sending help immediately. Mrs. Fletcher. See. You're so old. What you doing old? You think like a bunch of mold. Get out of my house. You old lousy. Wessing up my money. Smelling crummy. Send me home. Send me home. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Just like a dummy. Still not my money. Motherfucker you are old. You stink like a power bowl. You are always at the end scole me. You told me. I named free. I bust up fucking break, see. But you can't direction anymore. You can't see. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. I'm affected with this redness. I'm gonna got my eyes up bloody. Got glaucoma but the weed smoke. Don't make it anybody holma. But the butter on my bread, wish you were outside, not dead. Oh folks. Get out the home, dig your own grave and lay down in it. I wanna hit it. I want to win it. I'm gonna pull you out of the fence like a pendant. Bust. You're all a little crows, sticking a little old people in your nose. Doin' some Coke and die. Let's put it. Taking out my life insurance. Yo. You're so old. What you doin' old? See you're just like bounce back. Yeah. I mean that was amazing. But it's terrible. Yeah. I mean it's sure it's terrible but I mean talk to the people who have lives been ruined by ancients who refuse to go into the grain field. Look at what ancient grains. What grain field? We got these ancient grains. That's what I call them. When you see an old person who's like diddlin' around. Yeah. They just can't make up their mind. They're walkin' slow. You're goin' in the grocery outlet. They're just dragging those fuckin' loafer feet. Those stinky clubfoot. Dragging it in the grocery outlet. You're tryin' to get in and out. Buy some discount maca powder. I mean oldies are just stinking out the lane. This is ageism. Pure and simple. Yeah. It's great. Nothing's better than ageism. It's horrible. Get him in. Get him out. What's the... Okay. So what's the... You're saying 65? 65? If you're not out of the way at 65 then you're in the way. This is... You need to be in some place else just to be like a whole other realm. You know that movie Downsizing? Yeah. Talk about that. You get downsized when you're 65. Maybe not literally downsized because we don't have that technology because it's impossible to do that. Yeah. But just you gotta be like someplace else. Unless you're workin', unless you're still doin' what you wanna do, like you're like a famous film director and you still got your wits about you or you can do what you wanna do, you just gotta be out of that. Get outta here. Does this have something to do with the fact that one of your major haters out there is actually a 70 year old hip hop artist from Florida who's been ripping you new ones and all of his albums? Yeah. I mean it could have something to do with it but also he might be hating on me because I'm hating on him first. But I mean the story is that when you shifted from comedy into hip hop, he came out. By the way, you guys can look it up. His name's Major Hater. He's an ancient grain. He's a senior citizen who lives in Florida. He's a pile of spelt. He's basically a pile of fuckin' spelt. I don't wanna like dig. Millet. Right. My intention in this. Amaranth. Jesus. I truly didn't wanna like, I didn't wanna fan the flames of some kind of horrific fucking beef that you've got with Major Hater but I'm just gonna read one verse from his album. Talking about the toxicity report? Yeah. The toxicity report. I like his album name. It's pretty good. Seems to be directly pointed at you. So I'm just gonna read it. Go ahead. You're young enough to be my son, fuck you Pemberton, stay in your lane. I'm not an ancient grain. You're gonna feel deep pain, blap, blap, blap. When my bullets fly and my dick slaps, slaps, slaps on your mom. That's right bitch, I fucked your mom. Hater. Yeah, okay, I love it. It's great. I mean, one thing, how are you gonna even get that magazine loaded with those ancient brittle fingers, boy? How are you gonna pull back that, pull back that, what's that shit called, the slide lever? Pull back the slide on your gun, huh? Do you gotta send me auto? If you got an auto, I mean, even if you have an automatic, you still gotta do work on that. Look, I don't wanna stay on this shit, it's negative. See this right now, I'm doing a hand exercise with a little donut. I noticed you started pumping your stress ball and we brought up Major Hater. And listen, I don't wanna stay on it, I'm not gonna stay on it, but I did do a little research into it and normally I don't like fuck your mom jokes, they're pretty lazy and easy, but apparently he did date your mom. He did actually fuck my mom, sure. But I mean, she's even older than him. So my mom had me when she was really old, she's like Murphy Brown. No, so to me, I think that this is, you know, you're circling around something here, which is that Major Hater is your stepdad. Yeah, I guess he is, I mean. No, they were married, they were. Yes, he was my stepdad. Okay, there you go, I said it publicly, he's my stepdad. So you're in a rap feud with your stepdad? Yeah, he's terrible, I can't stand, I hate my stepdad. All right, man, look, we're just gonna, we're gonna cut to commercial. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the good people over at Raytheon.com. Raytheon!

All right, man, you know, Johnny, knowing that you're a genius of improv, rap, art, and knowing that you're gonna come back on the podcast, I actually created a few, like this is what I thought. I need to release an album of music. The fact that I don't have an album of any type out, it kind of haunts me a little bit. So I'm working on an album right now, I'm actually in a multi-million dollar deal. Ooh, that's cool, man, congrats. Thank you so much. No big deal, whatever. No, it's big. Actually, that is literally a big deal. It's okay. It's something. But I'm not gonna get caught up in being counten, you know. But so I thought I could share with the podcast audience sort of the process of creation. I've sort of created the first line of a few different songs and I was thinking maybe you could sing the second line of the song. Okay, yeah, I'll just do my best. Okay, so we'll start with the first one. Okay, I'm moving my chair to get comfortable. I think I'll have another bowl of quicksand, bowl of that man, whatever he produces, I don't wanna use it, all of his juices, I can't stop using it, hold me, hold me back now. That was fucking awesome. Thank you so much. I love it. I love it. Someone's gonna forget how fun it is to sing. Dude, I- Singing's great. This is like having surmounted the basic learning curve of Ableton and getting to the point where I could do it now just in the low-level way I can. It's been truly one of the most liberating things of all time. Right. To be able to sit down and just lay down a loop and then sing anything you want over it. Yeah. It's so important. You can just make the music. Yeah. You can make a sound. Yeah. And like the prohibition on just anyone making music or calling themselves musicians. Who's prohibiting that prohibition? It's self-prohibition. Oh, self. Yeah. It's definitely from the self. You know what I mean? But people like, when I say people, it's always, I'm always referring to my own subjective experience. Yeah. But most people, they drive around and they listen to songs and they think to themselves, they enjoy it and they may be singing along with it and maybe even sometimes if there's an instrumental piece, they'll make up their own lyrics privately to it. But the idea that you're going to like take it to the next level and maybe learn an instrument or record your own music, for a lot of people, that's just an alien concept. Yeah. Or it's the opposite. It's people who like do it so much and they're like, they're like bedroom folks. They do it tons and it's like, you're taking this too seriously. That's it. Yeah. That's the sound class. Just have fun with it. One of the, you know, in the old days, if you were a recluse, you stayed indoors. You stayed indoors and you would, but you'd be like Boo Radley, the classic fictional fucking recluse. If he lived today, you know, Boo Radley would have a fucking sound cloud. You know, it'd be in there making music and uploading it to the internet. Yo, Hannity, I bet you can't stand me. I'll come back like a plank of some enemy. Like the prongs of an enemy. I killed a mockingbird. Yeah. I don't know. To kill it. I just grill it. Pull out my dad's duking. I just did it. I grilled it. To grill a mockingbird. To grill a mockingbird. Dude, that would be an ultimate cookbook. To grill a mockingbird. Holy shit. Just mockingbird recipes. It's like, I actually saw one of those recently. I was like, those are fucking big. I think it was a magpie. Oh, a mockingbird. But magpies are big. To grill a mockingbird. To fucking eat your ass. They will? Oh, they're very territorial. Should we eat this mockingbird I brought? Fuck that. Do you want to eat? Do you want to split this? I don't do pepper challenges, baby. Why not? I'm sorry. I don't do them either. I'm dead serious. I think it'd be funny to eat this. God damn it. Well, you don't have to eat water. Water doesn't help, actually. No. You don't want to help? What? Time. You mother fucker, how dare you. Johnny Pemberton, folks, he just magically pulls out what is no doubt that what he's looking at. This is a hobnero right here. This is a hob, baby. Homegrown hob. You know it's good when it's all crinkly like that. Like a melted candle. Hold on. Let me film. Let me film them. They've got to put this on the gram. This sucks, dude. This is a cruel, shitty thing because you're a trapsman. Hold on. That's a trapsman. Here we go. This is it. Right here, baby. There we go. Here we are. Guys, we're filming a DTFH right now with Johnny Pemberton, who just pulled up a peppa. This is a fresh picked hobnero, fully ripened. I actually, it's not, it's probably not all that hot to be true, but it's still probably, I put one in the sposer the other day. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, baby. It's like a pumpkin. All right. All right. Don't have that much. Look at you spinning the fucking thing. All right. So here we are. I guess like my show has just turned into like some, like pepper eating, the new genre. That's all the internet is now. Where you eat peppers. We're going to try this hot ass pepper and watch, you know, I think it is about the pepper thing, why it's so popular. Why? I think it's a simple thing. It's just that, that old throwback to authenticity is that when you get hit with the pepper, it just takes you down. It just takes you down. It destroys you. And it doesn't hurt you. It's not like a drug where it's got like after effects. It basically just like reduces you to a crying slump of a man who's drooling and go, ah, ah, it's kind of a thing where you're purified through pain in the way that's so assessable that it's basically like normal. It is. If we are watched by a sentient God, right, it's got to be one of the things that you truly like as the laugh factory says, makes God laugh because like it's like when I watch my dogs chase each other or when the dogs get overly serious about a toy. Serious is great. I don't know if you ever see that one. They're like, it there. That's my toy. It means a lot to them. Yeah. And then you're looking at it and you're like, it's like a little like hamburger. Yeah. It's a felt hamburger. They're acting like they've got their little fucking mouths on like the some ancient codex of wisdom. They're like defending it from the other dogs. And to them that is like, I just feel like if God watches us any time we intentionally inflict pepper paint onto ourselves, there's got to be it's got to be like one of the hilarious funny or like sad or some kind of. I don't think it's sad at all. I think it's like joy. I'm going to do this. You've manipulated me fully into eating your goddamn pepper. Did you grow this? I did. And here's why I want to eat this is the reason I want to eat this is because I have grown probably a hundred of these in this one plan that did really well this year. I've given them all the way. And this is the last one. I just picked it today. And I'm like, I'm going to fucking eat this because this is the peppers that I grew. And even if it hurts me, I just need to say I've eaten it. Well, we will eternally record this. Should we like put some music underneath the. I think so. Let me see if I can. It's really just kind of scary to be honest. I'm terrified. I can't believe you're doing this to us. Honestly, I can't believe you're doing this to us. Hold on. Let's find a track to play underneath this. All right. Here we go. We're here with Johnny Pemberton. We're about to eat this brutal fucking pepper. So how banero. I don't know how he's. I never do this. Shit, man. No, I don't think you can have a heart attack unless you have some sort of crazy allergy to this, but you probably would have found that out by now. Right. So I just cut it in half and I quartered it because I think eating even a half that would be probably pretty. You want me to eat that entire fucking thing? Just take a bite from the tip. Right. We'll take a bite from the tip. Right. Motherfucker dude. Fuck. It's hot as shit. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. It's hot as shit. Oh, come on, Johnny. That's so fucking bad. You fucking bastard. I love it. You've got to masticate it though. So you're doing that. Okay. Here we are. Here we are. Fuck. Oh, that's all right. I'll be back. Ah. Oh. That was terrible. Oh, fuck. Oh, no. Fuck. No, I know why. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Ah. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. At ease. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You're weird. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. You're призn旁. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fucking. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. We're not even close to bad though, this is nothing. I saw one people who got divorced because of one of these. No, you didn't. This woman was wretching. Like, she was like fucking dying, like 20 minutes of her just going, oooh, oooh. Has anyone ever died of this? Probably but I think it would have to be. I don't know. I'm using the guy who vaped the shit. Yeah, I see that. That's awesome. I gotta go put milk in my eye. You're doing that. I'm essentially pepper spray myself. Yeah. All right, we'll be back, gang. Okay. We're back. We were just talking about, you know, now I feel refreshed. Yeah. I feel like I just got out of a steam room. Isn't it crazy how, like, weirdly therapeutic that experiences? Plants are healing, you know. That, you know, it's so great. I love getting old and I know you hear older people say this shit. Yeah. And you think that can't be true when you're a younger person. You're just saying that to make yourself feel good. Really, man, like, because you start figuring out certain things when you're young, you think are absolute horseshit, you know, because you're young. Because you don't feel any kind of pain. Right. Right. But you know, like, I used to think like I would hear hippies talk about when I was much younger, like plants being medicinal or plant medicine or that nature heals or that there's this like, and it's so weird that I ever resisted that seeing as how like the medicine comes from everything. Yeah. It's all synthesized from nature. Why the fuck would I ever disagree with that shit? But it was just one of those stupid things when I was younger. They disagree with that. But yeah, one thing you, you realize, I've realized is like, oh yeah, I get it. Like these little babies are actually, they want to, they help us. I don't know if there's an intent behind it, but they certainly like heal and peppers have this purgative effect. You know, the other thing they say is very healing, which is really weird to hear. And I still disagree with it, even though I hear it from so many people I respect. Nicotine. I can, I can see that, but it's hard to, it's hard to do it the right way. Right. Right. And like, like in the West, people have been abusing it so much that it's like, it's like killing them or something. But what do people, how do you use it effectively and medicinally? Yeah. Okay. So like, have you ever heard of PAS? No. There's like, in the West, there's like two big problems that are happening. People always sucking? No. Polished asshole syndrome. Really? Yeah. There's two problems that are happening in the West. Holy shit. So with men in particular, one problem on one side of the, on one side of the fence is a lot of dudes are known as like lazy wiping boys. Have you heard that term? No. LWBs, lazy wipers or lazy wiping boys. Okay. So basically like a lot of men in the West don't understand that it's not okay to just like wipe your ass twice and then pull your underwear back up. Yeah. You got to clean it good. Yeah. So this is the sort of the concept of like skid marks, you know, this idea of like skid marks in your underwear. Right. It's the mark of skid from poo. Yeah. And if you're getting that, it's like, that's not normal. Like you shouldn't have skid marks in your underwear because you should be cleaning the shit out of your fucking assholes. So you don't like have skid marks, but a lot of lazy wiping boys, they don't understand that because they're, they're, they aren't taught that as kids, like you got to clean your ass. Yeah. You wipe until there's no left to wipe. Right. That's what you should do. But on the other side of the continuum, PABs, yeah, PAS, Polish asshole syndrome, which is that the opposite of a lazy, lazy wiping boy is like some kind of like guy or attention. Yeah. Over attention. And then what happens is like, you see these men's assholes have become like river stones. Okay. You know, and it sounds the way I'm describing it sounds good, but it does sound good. I love the river stones. Yeah. But this is not good. It's like what ends up happening is like a lot of the really important parts of your asshole get polished down and it reduces everything in your life. Yeah. So it's so nicotine to get back to the use of nicotine. It's like the way it gets used in Peru and the way it gets used in a lot of the deep forests. The jungle. You can say it. Well, deep forest. Yeah. I mean, a lot of people saying that now in place of jungle, I understand. Deep forest was a, I don't know if they still make music, but it was a band that a great band, great band. And the name deep forest, the music of deep forest actually came from the quest of a solving pierce who was the art, the music director of deep forest who had PAS. Oh, right. Okay. And this is all coming back to me a bit now. Yeah. Tormented by it, right? Mm hmm. Relationships falling apart. That first time his lovers would like slide their finger up and then you feel, oh my God. It just goes in so fast that almost it's like a thing where there needs to be a speed bump. And if you go in that fast, you'll break some tissue. He did that. He would actually put like a rolls of tape, oh really rolls of tape to try to like slow down the, the, um, the fingers and, but the, so he is called bucket wash. Yeah. He was doing it. Mm hmm. There was like a couple of his songs are about like the disappointment on the face of his lover when she realizes he's bucket washing and he had didn't tell her that he has PAS. How dare. So it slows you down. And so anyway, the whole band, the name of that came from his journey into the forest to try to figure out if there's a way to like basically rejuvenate or reverse the effects of doing like over wipes. Wow. And where's the knit coming to this? Well, that's what they do. When you go into these, like a shaman, when they, if they identify that you have PAS, you will, usually the way it's done is you just sort of like, it's just like you're getting like searched by a cop, except you put your hands against a tree. Right. And there's two, like on either side of you, the shaman's assistants will, one assistant will grab one of your ass cheeks, the other assistant will grab the other ass cheek. They ceremonially pulled them apart, opening of the gates as it's called. And then the shaman will chew tobacco, a cut of it, a cut that he's been chewing for three days. Wow. Yeah. So it's, this is like just, I guess, Nectar. And then the shaman will shoot that into your, on your ass. It's amazing. And it heals so many people. Yeah. I've always wanted to try that. The problem is getting that many people in the same place at the same time. Oh my God. I mean, yeah. Fine. Talk about scheduling. Huh. That's one of the, call me a cab. No shit. It's so hard. That's one of the worst parts of being a shaman I've heard is just scheduling the different assistants. Yeah. There's actually this company called Thunderbird Energy Bars. They used to make, you know, these delicious, all natural bars and they were shaman blessed. Now I used to eat them almost every day. I loved them for camping. They're great. Did you notice a difference? Like, what? What happened was, I noticed that they're not making them anymore and it was because the shaman, they couldn't get him in enough. Well, couldn't he do mass blessings or is he blessing each fucking bar? I don't know how it worked exactly, but I know there was shaman blessed. I don't know what the, what the, how many you can bless at once to make him blessed, but whatever it was, it wasn't working out. Isn't Amazon getting in trouble for that because like they've got that whole assembly line with shamans who are like over a blessing and they're all getting sick or whatever. They're like, I don't know. I mean, I've heard of something about that. I think that's right. Cause if it's old saying how much wood could a woodchuck, chuck a woodchuck, cook, chuck wood, replace woodchuck with shaman and replace wood with everything that Amazon sells. Yeah. I mean, that's going to be a long fucking poem. Is that a poem? How much, how much, uh, how much shippable product can a shaman bless if a shaman compress could, could, could bless all the blessable products that exist in, uh, an Amazon warehouse? Yeah. You're talking about the Hanson equation. It's like we're, this is to me, I'm fine eating an energy bar that hasn't been blessed by a shaman, but I guess once you start eating those types of bars, you don't want a non blessed bar. You don't. It's something where your body knows you can tell it. It's like, imagine if you had an orange that you didn't chew, that's the difference. It's like, oh, uh, you can't just swallow an orange, right? You got to chew it, such as the case with bars that haven't been blessed. And that's the thing now, like the Hanson effect, that's this thing that they're running into is that they're trying to automate shamanism. And I think there's, there's just a lot of bumps in that road. I'm not against it. I mean, this is, I understand the uncanny valley right now. It's pretty intense when it comes to shamanism. So you see one of these like robot shamans and it's, you know, it's definitely, if I'm on ayahuasca, I, I don't maybe necessarily want to be sitting across from like one of these, you know, I don't know about a shaman, it looks a little too house a wax. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like, it's, it's looks like a person. Here's the question though. Yeah. Would you rather not have the ayahuasca experience? Cause what, what these robotic shamans are doing, they're allowing a huge swath of people who previously couldn't afford to have access to a shamanish shamanistic experience, they can do it with the new automated shamans, they kind of access to it. Yeah. And it's one of those things where it's like the car, like it gave these people, it's the model T of shamanism. One of my friends, I think the reason I have sort of a negative sense about it is one of my friends, uh, was at one of these ceremonies and like probably two hours in, and he said, it was great up until that point, because actually the way they do it as you're like laying back, you don't necessarily even look at the robot. But he said that, uh, two hours in, uh, it just stopped and like running their cards through the side of it and it wasn't accepting payments. And then it was asking for people's Amazon passwords and stuff. Collectively. Well, like you, so yeah, he's in a group. He just, no, he said people were into it. Like it, you know, it's like when you're in the elevator at a hotel that you have to use your key to like get up and like, for whatever reason, your key doesn't work, but someone else in the elevator runs their key through it. It's the exact same thing. Like people are coming up and like trying their different Amazon accounts and then was saying like, Oh, what's your password? And then they cut, you know, they're on ayahuasca. So it's like you're not remembering their password, but even the ones who remember their password, it was trying to do phone verification. Oh, then it's also doing that thing where it confused your account with someone else's. And yeah, the, the, the robotic shamans have an only custom tailor your, your experience with your purchase history and if you have your, if you get an ayahuasca experience for someone else's purchase history, bad news, that is going to be, uh, what we call a one on one bad trip. Yeah, man. That's, that's, you don't want, you know, they shaman's traditionally sing, uh, Icarus is what they're called. They're these, you know, beautiful songs. It's like Hey. But what they're, it's filled in with like actual meaningful they're powerful magical songs that help guide your, uh, ayahuasca experience. Now the ayahuasca, the robotic, the automated shaman, the robotic wastes, they, it sounds more, it's sort of like, uh, I don't know, it's filled, it's like got brands, like kind of like, but put in there in a smoother. It's like, it's not, when I'm saying it, it sounds like it's a night of horrible late stage capitalism, corruption of a very beautiful tradition, but it's not. No, no, it's not at all. I don't think so. Not at all. Uh, I mean, all I can do is hope that it won't happen. Like how, you know, how the EU is banning Bach right now. I know. Thank God. Yeah. I'm all for that shit, man. Yeah. I don't, I just don't think Bach's music has any place in modern society. It's just, it's too mathematic. Yeah. It's too mathematic. It's, it's, it's also, you know, it's, it's, uh, I don't want to say it cause I don't want people to say I'm some kind of fucking kook, but they have connected the dots, chickenpox outbreaks to, uh, listening to Bach. Yeah. Oh my God. It shingles. That's where shingles starts and ends. I, the next time you get shingles, just think, was I just listening to Bach? The next time you're, I was talking to a friend of mine, fucking shingles all over his face and agonizing pain. I'm like, well, what, I didn't even ask specifically Bach. Right. I said, I hadn't written Bach on a little piece of paper in my pocket. Yeah. And I said, so what, what have you been listening to? And he said, yeah. And I pulled it out. I was like, there you go. So yeah, I don't know, man. I don't, I get it. Like we're learning about music now. We're starting to understand that it's not just sounds. It's fucking serious mathematical equations being basically turkey bastered into your ears. Yeah. I was going to say, you know, you can't, you can't bring the goose to the table without a few feathers. No shit. And if you do, it's not a goose. No, if you, if you, if you, and if you don't have feathers with the goose, what is that? It's not. I'm not eating a cat. I'm not eating that. I want to pull us out of the improv thing and talk about the uncanny valley some more, though, like something I was thinking about. Now the uncanny valley, I was talking to Rob Schraub was telling me about it. And it's deeper than I realized the uncanny valley is like something that's like math. It is mathematical. It's like, are you serious? I think so. Yeah, it's. I didn't know that. I don't, I don't remember exactly if he said it was mathematical, but it was like a much studied phenomena. I have a question. Yeah. It's just apropos of the current, uh, isn't there like a cafe being opened up or like a brothel? Yeah, the fuck brothel. Yeah, it's in Germany or whatever. Canada is in Canada. Well, I mean, no, this is like going to be one of the, this is like, there's so many hilarious technological disruptions that we're going to experience as we keep going forward in time. And one of them is sex robots. It's like, you know, it's, it's as people figure out ways to it's fucking with craft, like sex robots and it that crosses the uncanny valley. And where the truth is, like, guys don't give a fuck about a man will fuck the uncanny valley. Like a guy, like a guy's will fuck men fuck donkeys. They do it unhappily and they announce it. So that vice thing about those guys in Columbia, they fucking, this guy's like, tell them how he fucked a donkey. He lost Virginia to a donkey. He's proud of it. He said, quote, she treated me well. I'm not kidding. It's like, what the fuck, man? Right. Get in the city. Get out of the country. Yeah, man. So, you know, that kind of like interspecies sex and sex, but with Matt, with robots, it's, it's coming. And it's like, for people, it's, it's an interesting problem. Also, not just like getting your own sex robot. That's fucking expensive. Right. Oh, yeah, it's very expensive. But getting some kind of like thing designed for augmented reality so that you have the physical form that you can fuck, but somehow it connects to your augmented reality goggles so that you can project. It's not quite VR. Well, augmented reality is when you can see an overlay on top of what you're already looking at. So you get this thing in your bed that is this like fuckable, humanoid thing that doesn't necessarily even look like anything. It's more of a screen upon which augmented reality can then project anybody you want. So you can fuck Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Which is truly one of the great desires of so, so many people. And it's a, it's a weird problem because there's like two, like two overarching problems are emerging. The biggest problem is humans think that their entire point of existence is to work. So all of our economy, all of capitalism, everything is based on I'm going to do something and turn it into money. And with that money, I'm going to buy stuff that comes from other people who are doing something. This is like the foundation of how people live. You wake up and you go fucking work. It gives it's like your self-worth basically. Yeah. So if, if everything becomes fully automated, self-driving cars and doing everything, then, then our species is going to have a midlife crisis, which is what, wait, our whole point was to work. Like our point was to make shit in factories and like go to work. And now everything's being done by AI. What is the point of us anymore? Like what do we do? So that's one of the problems. The other problem, the other weird problem is so much of what guys do is based on like wanting to fuck. It's, it's like, like, it's a motivation. It's a big motivation. It's like, oh, why do you, that's why, why do you get into comedy when I do anything really? It's so you can, you can be like, yeah, you can be, uh, what's it called? Like some, you can be someone who is, uh, not presentable, but, uh, like we're, it's like basically what I desired. Yeah. It's when the bird makes that, makes the nest or the cool thing to show off the females. It's, it's a version of that. Yeah. And you, and you, and you have these like plumage plumage. Yeah. Yeah. The Bauer bird being, or you know, the, that class, it builds, it gets little pebbles and stones and it's like builds a little house. So this has been, whether you like it or not, the motivating principle behind a lot of what guys have been doing for a long time. And to the point where I just had Jason Luv on, and he was saying that, and again, I need to check with some like other Tibetan Buddhism people, but he was telling me that the thing that brings humans into the human realm from the bardo in between life and death, as opposed to like letting go and emerging back into the unified hole, the monad becoming like free part of the clear light, the thing that draws humans back here is sex. We're so sex addicted that sex is the sort of pen ultimate addiction. It's like the true reality. Yeah. And that's what keeps things going here too. It's no accident that two are sort of intertwined and it's no accident that DNA kind of looks like this spiral tangle of like, you know what I mean? The whole like thing that's drawing us here is the desire to fuck. And that's at least in Tibetan Buddhism. So once we're here, then we start building a life that starts off with, you know, I want to be successful and a lot of dudes want to be successful for, you know, because they want to sustain themselves. They want power. They want food. They want shelter, but there is no matter what, I mean, for most guys, the point where like Tesla recognizing the distraction of wanting to fuck. Supposedly one of the rumors about him is that he actually castrated himself on there, heard that. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it was too much for him. It was like always like everything he was doing was so based on wanting to fuck. Yeah. Wanted to remove it completely from his system. It is a thing that yeah, it's a, it's true. Right. So now if suddenly we, we make it so that men no longer have to. Follow the normal ways that you would have to do to draw a mate to you. It's kind of like, well, I mean, I don't know what would have, what would happen in like, let's say monkey society, you know, what would happen if suddenly like monkeys no longer, or any animal species, if the animals no longer had to commit, no longer had to compete to get mating rights, what would happen to the species because what would happen is the alphas or whoever was like the rams that were winning the fights to gain mating rights, well, they would still be fucking the organic ram females, but all the other rams that were fighting them would be just humping fucking like pseudo rams. It's basically like you're in zero gravity and at some point in zero, your muscles start to atrophy and like the human body is not designed to live in zero gravity, you know, you'll die. Because you're, well, you won't, I mean, you will die, right? You start changing. Start changing to the point where you can live in zero gravity, but to go back to gravity is an extreme shock, like it would kill you if you're, if you spend a certain amount of time in zero gravity and you don't condition your body to mean to be able to live in gravity, your body will, it'll atrophy to the point where you couldn't just go back in gravity. Yeah, you have to, when they come back there, like there's problems, you can probably walk, but Tim Leary, one of, one of the coolest theories that he had or what I like that a lot of people don't even know this about him is this concept that when humans go into zero gravity, they're going to like, that's when the next level of evolution kicks in, right? That we're the gravity, the gravity well that we're in right now is in some way suppressing our evolutionary unfolding. And so our whole point is to go migrate through space. And once we hit space, that's when the next thing kicks in. So the stuff they're calling atrophy or the weird shifts that are happening to astronauts DNA, Leary might argue, and I don't know for sure, because it's like highly complex writing, he did on this, he might argue that actually what you're seeing is the beginning of this metamorphic phase is happening. So, but with the problem with sex androids is that, like, we're, it's the same thing with SoundCloud. It's like, you know what I mean? We're going to start witnessing, or maybe even with podcasts, you know, or Twitter, it's like formally in, formally in comedy, you'd go on stage. You do stand up on some, the, the, the gravity of situations and the, what's it called, the stakes changed dramatically. Yeah. So maybe to the point where there almost is no, there are no stakes. Yeah. When there are no stakes, a lot of, a lot of, like, you know, my good old buddy, James Howard, counselor is, yes, he's very fond of, of calling the time right now. Um, nothing matters. Anything goes. Kind of thing where, how is that true though? I mean, I guess he's talking about more concrete kind of stuff, like, in terms of, like, urbanism and, uh, energy politics, but just how there's so many things that just, that previously would be a big deal that are just less of a, they're just, they don't really matter. Well, it's because things are becoming increasingly reproducible. It's like we're looking at like this exponential increase in the reproducibility of things that formerly used to cost, like, so for example, like, you couldn't even do this, but when you're sitting and watching a movie, uh, you're seeing something that if it were made for one person, it would never, ever be possible. Like it would have to be some insane millionaire. Like an emperor could have that. An emperor would be like, a personal film. A doos for me, a personal, there's a good idea, by the way, to, I want to pick up the point where I can have a personal film. Yeah. But the fact that we can reproduce it with zero, essentially zero, we digitize it and reproduce it, it costs nothing outside of whatever the processor and your computer is doing. Once it gets to the point of digitizing and reproducing it, it is now, it doesn't cost anything. And so then we all share in the, in the cost of producing this insane work of art, like video games are another example of this. Like when you're playing God of war, you're looking at something that took years in teams, massive amount of work. And this couldn't have just been like you, if you play that and play a game with yourself, we're like, what if this was just made for me? You would be thinking like, my God, this is from an alien or something. But because we can reproduce it and it gets digitized and the reproducibility of the thing makes it not only possible, but profitable. Right. So now we're essentially, what it is, is we're looking at like reproducibility of like matter, being able to print shoes out, being able to like automate, reproduce without having to use human effort. So we're removing this, we're basically beginning to remove a lot of force fields that were constructed in between a human and their ability to live out their desire. That's what's happening. The amount of time in between what you can imagine happening and what you can actually experience is shrinking. So in, for some people, like they're thinking God, you know, you, you see, I don't know, whoever you think is the most beautiful, who's the, who's like an example that peep Scarlett Johansson, is that an example of Ray Fiennes? Right. Yeah, Ray Fiennes. Ray Fiennes. Exactly. You see beauty on, on, you know, you see like a person who's like in the top percentile of symmetry and beauty on the planet to the point where they're making millions from being in movies. So like, this is the movie star. And you see them, you're like, my God, my God, they're so beautiful. You know, but you could, you never, ever would be able to know what it was like to kiss them, to touch them, to, and if you wanted to, you would need to like probably dedicate your life to that task and probably even fail. And then you just be some crazy fucking stalker. You'd end up like, I want to kiss you. I want to kiss you. Yeah, I got to kiss you. I'll die. Yeah. But to even like gain access to the people that you're, we're seeing in movies in the eighties. If you even wanted access to them, you would have to like either be in their industry, be like incredibly successful yourself so that you're like hanging out in the same circles, then technology comes around. Now you want to send a tweet to the fucking president. You could do it. You want to send a tweet to whoever, whatever celebrity happens to be on fucking Twitter, you could do it. You can get blocked by the stakes. Right. It's like everyone can have, there's such a, such a well level playing field. Well, one playing field is very level. Yeah. Certain aspects of things that are incredibly level that it's like, there's never been that way ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. And now it's going to get to the point where you could have your sex Android and have some kind of like reproduction of whoever the most famous person. Oh, you want to see what it's like to make love to your best friend's mom? No problem. All you need is your Facebook profile. Throw that through some kind of like CGI, right? You know, something that turns it into 3D space. Now this doesn't exist yet, but you think it's not going to exist in 20 years. Just the fact they have all that facial mapping stuff that people can do now. What is it like the technology that costs 50 bucks now would have taken a team of people even a year ago to do, you can get on your fucking phone now. You can like steal someone's face and put it on anyone's face and make it look like they're that person is the one speaking to things. That's it. I've seen some of those and I'm, I almost can't tell the difference. I can tell the difference, but I almost can't, which means that not that long from now, anyone who doesn't is not super familiar with it. You won't be able to tell a difference. So this is the uncanny valley and we are right now at the very end of the uncanny valley and we're about to cross over. And, but I was the, to get back to the uncanny valley. You're saying how deep it is, how it's more deep than we know. Yes. So the way shrub explained it to me, which is super cool is like, okay, so if I draw a stick figure as a cartoon, so the stick figures dancing around, doing whatever, you're going to watch that and be like, whatever, it's a stick figure cartoon. Right. But if I make the stick figure cartoon with some kind of, I don't know, CGI. And I start making it increasingly like a person. Do you mean the way it looks? The way it looks. It's going to get so in other words, now it's not a stick figure. It goes from a stick figure. Let's say I'm drawing a stick figure of you, but now I draw like a, just a little like, I don't know, Simpson style cartoon of you. Still cool. No one's going to look at that and be like, that's fucking creepy. Yeah. But at some point, as it begins to get closer and closer to being an exact replica of you, it hits this like kind of like, I don't know what you would call it, a feedback loop. And when it starts getting closer and closer to you, it becomes increasingly horrifying. Right. Cause it looks so close, but there's just, there's like a missing, the, the soul of it is missing. Who's that animator, the brilliant CGI animator who does, is that Cole Cush? Is he the one who does that? I can't remember. I think so. He, I think he did my vice TV one where you, you know what I mean? Right. And, and, and you see that shit. And it's like, whoa, it looks, it looks awesome. But it's supposed to look creepy. But that's the uncanny valley because he's creating within the uncanny valley and he's producing the disequilibrium intentionally that comes from that. Once you pass beyond that, now it's just video, right? Now you look at it and it just looks like fucking video. Yeah. Cause someone filmed it. Yeah. So it's really interesting. It's like the closer you get to being something authentic, you hit a point of static. You hit a point of like, as I'm beginning to harmonize with you, you know, you know, like when you try to harmonize, but you're just out of key. Yeah. There's a, yeah, that's the uncanny valley. That's a good analogy. I never thought about that. It makes so much sense. Yeah. Yeah. Cause, but when you get super close, it starts to get like, it's like, yeah, like it's really long. And then it's the point where it is the thing, or at least physically it looks like the fucking thing. It's on top of it. Yeah. And so I was thinking about that. This is like really dumb, probably, but I was thinking like, okay, Kanye West, right? Fucking genius, man. That guy's a genius. I don't care what you, like all the, like after I moved through the Kanye West jealousy force field, which I think I was feeling a little bit just like, mother fuck, look at that. Like just like, just to be able to like be that prolific, that's super successful. And not give a shit what anyone thinks. Not give a shit what anybody, it's totally free. Like something about that, like I went through a period of not even thinking it was jealousy. I went through it and just feel like, whatever, man, just everybody likes that guy and the fuck it. Yeah, I'm too sophisticated like that guy. And then I started listening to him. I was like, oh my God, this shit is fucking incredible. This is like, oh God, it's painful. How good it is. And then finally I was like, all right, I like it. It's cool. But when you look at his videos and you see him on the motorcycle, it's fucking cheesy, dude. It's like so, so flowery and cheesy and weirdly cheesy, almost like, uh, outsider artist, cheesy. Right. I was thinking like fuck, Kanye is in the uncanny valley. He's like, he's in the uncanny valley artistically. And the shit that he's tuning in with is some kind of like transcendent genius or something, but he hasn't quite hit that. Right. So he's like, he's close. His face is out of phase a bit. Yeah, yeah, but he's still so fucking close that everybody's like, oh my God, what is that? But he's not quite there. So there's like this like, there's this sense of like, what the fuck? The motorcycle, I don't get it. I don't understand. It's like fucks with your head. Like if he moved a few inches over, I don't know what it would be like. It's at the angle of entry or something. It's that, it's that small window of it being the right thing. Yeah. And then you look on the other side of Kanye West, you get Daniel Johnston. He's the stick figure. He's sitting with his guitar and piano and you hear it. And it's, it's like holy music, sacred, holy music. Cause he's so far on the other side that he's so unaware. Yeah. Yeah. That awareness thing is interesting too. I think about that, the idea of just how aware of you are aware you are of, of what you're doing and thinking. Right. Like, I feel like we're just, we couldn't be more aware that people have never been so aware of themselves and others than right now. And it's this thing. Well, a lot of times I'm sort of, uh, I actively try to make myself unaware because I just want to feel that liberation of stupidity, like feel that like if you don't, like you think, I think about what I eat all the time. Like I'm constantly aware of like, Oh, is this have soy lectin in it? Does this have this is all that stuff you're aware of? Cause you know it. Yeah. But just to be like, Oh, I'm freezing right now. I need to get warm. Like to feel that the very, the purity of some sort of like a primal need. I haven't felt that in for a long time. Like a real primal like, Oh fuck, I'm going to die. I'm so cold. I need to get warm. Right. And then you get warm and it's like, Oh, I did it. Your brain gives you a download of serotonin because you, you did the thing you did to survive and you get that fucking download. Yeah. You're like being cradled by nature. You know, you're like the fire or the warmth or whatever has become like this nipple on the goddess and you've like, you're suckling like pure truth. Yeah. It's this, it's unadulterated truth. It's absolutely real. Yeah. Making a fire so you don't die. Yeah. Thing. Yeah. And then there's just never, that's never the case. That's why people, a lot of times I've heard people talk about this guy, Scott Carrier, he's like a journalist. He writes a bunch of, he has this podcast called home of the brave. But he always talks about how he wants to have his ego wiped. Like how much he loved to wake up one day and not know who he is. Just know nothing. Like just be like wiped over clean because it would be this thing where you would be experiencing everything from the point of like, uh, of a pure beginner, just the point of purity where you wouldn't have anything. No ego, uh, filtering or interrupting what you're doing. You're just coming from a place of just, uh, we call a real primitive place. Well, this is then mine, beginner's mind. Exactly. This is it. Like you, you never achieve anything. You never like the whole idea of achieving some this or that. It's just a game you've been playing with yourself because in every moment you really are a brand new thing, but this is intolerable to people because they think, Oh, I've earned this, right? This, whatever this, this like refined ego, this refined identity. I mean, do you not see my body of work? Have you not seen my body of work? And it's like, Oh, you mean the footprints you left in matter with your soul back there? Have you not seen my footprints? How dare you? I have walked there and there and there. Look at those footprints. As you can see, I've stepped there and I stepped after that in another step. I've done many millions of steps. And look at the sophistication of the steps. It's like you matter the definition. Yeah. The depth of the step I've stepped is so deep. And then you see this like thing that gets left behind, right? You realize like, Oh, a person's body of work, their family, whatever remains of them. Is the echo in the material universe. It's just footprints in time that look like stuff, writing, poetry. Or what it was. How someone else is taking what you've done and what, how they've experienced that, like, you know, fandom. I feel like a lot of fandom is especially like geeky fandom. A lot of that stuff is the people who enjoy that person's work. Really don't give a shit about that person. They just care about the work they did. They don't care about that person. It's not really anything. They're just like, Yeah, exactly. They're just like the, the person who brought that to them. So they kind of disappear. And they're not even that like special because you take that, what that person's made, you're such a big fan of it that you create your own like cosplay of it or something like that. That's right. It becomes your own thing. You basically own it. You stole it in a way. Well, I mean, not stolen, not still, I mean, like in a good way. Like it's like, Oh, it's, it's mine now. It's just as much mine as it is yours. Thank you for making it. But I'm, I'm using by, by like doing that, I'm, I'm using the thing you made. So this is like the difference between artist as creator and artist as cartographer. Right. So artist as creator, progenitive force that like is the womb of a thing that they're artistic DNA produce, like creates this image. So now suddenly you have whatever it is that someone's cosplaying, right? But then if you jump into the idea of artists as cartographer, which is that they've actually scanned a kind of realm of that is sort of a liminal place in between matter and nothingness is the realm of art, right? And they have found this particular swath of that realm, which looks like Superman or looks like the Green Lantern or looks like the X men or whatever. And, and then they've mapped that realm out into matter in the form of whatever the particular like style of art is, whether it's a cartoon, a comic book, a book, whatever, right? So you could say, Oh, Tolkien was the progenitor of Middle Earth. Or you could say Tolkien tuned in to a always existing ephemeral, I don't know if ephemerals are always staying sort of like, like something that's less dense than matter and idea space. He, he like, he like tuned into a place just the antenna on the radio. Yeah. And many people have tuned into Middle Earth, but their ability to translate it into language wasn't as precise. Their maps sucked, essentially. They had like shitty, crappy fucking hand drawn shitmaps, whereas Tolkien like tuned into it and like precisely described it, not just by describing it, but by allowing the words to be envelopes within which were contained a little bit of the air of Middle Earth. So they fully decoded it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fully decoded, fully decoded Middle Earth. So then, then at that point, it's no longer theft. It's like the cartographer is introduced as a place. And anytime you cosplay or whatever, you're venturing into that space. Yeah. And in fact, the artist, the cartographer is simultaneously mapped and opened a portal. And when you seek people cosplaying, you're actually looking at the inner dimensional, yeah, the fucking place emerging into time. You know, you're looking at like now, now when you created whatever the fucking place you created, whatever it was, now you're like witnessing. That place inflating into this reality, which would be pretty awful if you made a rotten space, you know, like the Turner Diaries. Which you're talking about this their day, right? It's this is the it's what inspired McVeigh. What are what are they exactly? Turner Diaries are a shitty white supremacist racist. It's like a novel. It's a novel written as a history from the future about a horrific revolution that happened where it's a pretty cool thing we can do as humans. What is right? Something that's false, but right as though it's true. That's pretty fucking cool thing. That's cool technology. It's like, I'm going to write this book like it's a manual for a thing that doesn't what manual for what it doesn't exist. I just put in a pretend it does. Yeah. And then later on, what outside of context, someone will see this and be, oh, this is a manual for this thing. Yeah. We can build this thing. When I start building it, it doesn't fucking work because it's like a trick or it does, you know, or it kind of does. I mean, like that this is like, or that is that is it working is the is the fact that it got someone to do something. Think of like, I don't know, Legos or the Lego or like, what's a what's a what's a cartoon that got turned into a toy? Oh, I don't know. I mean, like half of them, right? Fucking, I guess Harry Potter, right? Right. Like rolling just like has a vision. She puts it into paper and then suddenly it actually begins to form into matter. And now it's like her, her thing was so powerful. It's forming into matter, but then it gets even creepier when it's like, you have this vision that isn't fiction. Now I have a vision of like something that's like the way the world should be. Yeah. Now we have philosophy. Now we have some kind of philosophical concept that you've tuned into. And at that point, you connect to this space that doesn't exist in the world yet. But if it's powerful enough, the entire world will populate manifest it. Yeah. That's where it gets really creepy. It's like you could actually be the messenger of a dark seed. Now that's pretty satanic to think about. It's scary to think about that shit where it's like, oh fuck, man, I'm going to like, I have an idea. I'm going to like plan a seed of this idea of like, uh, I don't know. Um, what's that shitty? The protocols of a Zion. All right. I haven't heard about that in a long time. See, sorry guys. P.S. By the way, what happened is we watched a PBS documentary on Timothy McVeigh. They mentioned the Turner diaries. And then that took me down the shit rabbit hole where I was like looking at the different, like horrific, crazy fucking, like really, really terrible violence inducing lunacy that has come out of the super, super far racist, white, Aryan fucking like dark world. And as part of that, like, yeah, the, the discovering like some dumb, dumb rights, the protocols of Zion, which is allegedly a Jewish. So we found the book they left behind that describes all their evil deeds. Yeah. They forgot to burn this one. Lucky we found it. Now we know what they're up to. That's like essentially a Kleenex, a reproducible Kleenex that doesn't have that, that like instead of having the Ebola virus on it has a, I guess you would call it like an info virus. Yeah. Oh, that's, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. I used to have this book and I was a kid, like really little kid. It was about ninja stuff. It was all about like how to be a ninja, all these things. Yeah. And I remember reading that book being like, okay, this is what I have to do to be a ninja. I remember like trying to train based upon these super arcane things in this book and I realized now that was, that wasn't a real book. It wasn't like an actual ancient tome about had ninjas. It was something someone wrote. It seemed like that. And I was like, it's so cool. It was written by just a smart person. Yeah. Figured I'm going to make some money. There's a documentary on the duty or the anarchist cookbook. Oh, really? Yeah. I was so into that shit, dude. I was, I had printed out the library. I remember getting in trouble for printing out the anarchist cookbook. We will never know how many burn victims exist because of that fucking book. Thermite 101. Yeah. How to make napalm. Do you remember that? How to make napalm? Uh-huh. There's some multiple ways. I don't even want to fucking say it on the podcast because like I'm turning into a dad now and I'm like, fuck that. I don't even want to, I don't even want to risk the small chance that someone will listen to it and hear it. Someone will take gasoline and pour it on over styrofoam. Oh, you fucking demon. Don't do it. But like, you know, what ends up happening is. Also, what are you going to do with that fucking napalm? Huh? What are you going to do with it? You're going to fucking like burn your goddamn hand. Well, you're not going to drop it off a fucking F4 phantom into Cambodia. Are you? I hope not. You know, so you end up with like realizing that it's just a strange thing, which is like you, you can become a fucking conduit, a cartographer, a channel through which authentic extra dimensions can emerge. And if you are refined enough in your channeling or transmission of this other realm, then it can take root in the soil of people's minds. And then that can grow. And then they open their mouths and they, they spray out the spores. They spray it and spray it and spray it and spray it. And now you've now you are just, you are just the first apple seed. You know, you are the first corn kernel, Honda, free living Subaru. Oh, God, drivers wanted. I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony. I'd like to buy the world a Coke and keep it company. It's the real thing. I was infected with that when I was a kid and it's still in my fucking brain. That's pretty innocent. If you think about it, it's just about a beverage. It's the real fucking thing. Yeah, yeah, it is the real thing. It's the best one. Yeah, they did figure it out. You know, they broke the mold when they came off that shit. It's crazy when you realize, oh my God, I'm sneezing out fucking data capsules that have been impregnated in my brain by corporations or the state. Uh-huh. That's the worst when you just don't even realize you're doing it and you're like, you know, whatever it may be, you know, like, how about this new fucking phenomenon where suddenly everybody likes John McCain? They do. Have you, you seem to stay off the news. I have been, yeah, I've been pretty good at it, actually. I'm surprised how I think it's almost like a muscle. I've been practicing and I just don't check stuff anymore because I just don't want to fucking know. It's the damnedest thing that happened. It's like, you know, I like some of what McCain did towards the end of his life. It's pretty badass. He stood up to like some shit that seems like it needed to be set up to you. Like McCain represents like the, the right. He represents a hawkish attitude about global politics. And for a while, you know, he was, people really didn't like him, you know, they, yeah, but suddenly, like all of a sudden, like pumping out of the propaganda machine has been this very weird, sudden, like McCain worship. Really? Like from who? On all the media sites, that dude's fucking funeral went on for like nine years, man. Like he was, his body was being like, you know, like, there were all kinds of like, it was, it was just weird. It was like, you know, it's like, what's going on here? Why are, why, what is this sudden fixation on John McCain? Like, I understand that he was a, you know, my father was a veteran. And as I get older, like my, like my, my viewpoint on those things have changed significantly. He was a vet. Yeah. It is true. And, and, and like, I get there was all the first, like I get it, but it was just like this extra and there's been this added crazy super hyped up fixation on the McCann, like for example, the video of George W. Bush passing a mint to Michelle Obama. So during the funeral, George Bush, George W. Bush, who brought us Iraq, who brought us attacking fucking Iraq, who like scorched the bodies of countless people because of some bullshit. He loves Michelle Obama. You know that? I could tell. They're good friends. And he passed her a mint and it got put on video and they just started, oh Jesus. What does it have to do with that? Just, they just have to do with suddenly like the sport. Like it's suddenly, you don't know exactly what's happening, but it's as though you're in a Star Trek, you're in Star Trek and you walk by a plant. That is one of those things that spray spores, right? And you're looking at this like info plant that all of a sudden just starts spitting out George W. Bush passing a mint. George W. Bush passing a mint, passing a mint. We saw the mint passing. Did you see the mint? Did you see that video? He passed the mint. We're going now live. We have an interpreter who's a hand analyst who's going to tell us what it looks like when a mint is passed. Is it an Altoid? Well, we actually could have been a pill. It could have been something else strong. OK, on the line with us now, he's passed a mint. I don't know about that. Pass him. I don't think it's a pass, man. Pass him, man. I think what he passed the many was actually a piece of gum. Well, I declare we should not talk with this. No mint passing here. Now we're passing Senate Bill 2647.5 that meant passing in a state of emergency and a harm situation. Now I'm doing it. I just did it. Yeah, we're doing it now. Yeah, it got in our brains. And now for whatever reason, we're replicating the passing of the George Bush mint to Michelle Obama. We're talking about it. Yeah, it got into us. And now we're like it's like a little like, you know, just a little. It's a meme, right? It's a sneeze. It's a data sneeze where it's like, I don't know why I got the cold or what it means necessarily. But it's part of my sort of like being infected with information. One part of the infection is the passing of the mint. All you have to do is look at it or even hear someone say it. Yeah. And as long as you don't know what it is, you won't get sick. But if you know what he's talking about, oh, that's what happened. You just got this. And it means something to you. You go to any part of the any. You go to most parts of the world and you're like, have you heard of the mint passing and they're like, what? It would be like someone coming over here from another land and being like, did you hear about how Kreegore pushed the brick over by next to lax? Like, um, what? I don't know what that does. That mean anything? Yeah. Kreegore, he pushed the brick. He's like, usually they like you to next to lax. Well, Kreegore doesn't like next to lax his husband, Soma. Yeah. And because of that, the pushing the brick is traditionally considered to be like a real tacit sense of, um, of, uh, companionship or, uh, helping another person. And so the fact that that happened means that. Yeah, it's just, it's. We think it's the merging of the, of the two tribes of brick lane. We think it represents the murder that there is a potential intertwining of the formerly separate tribes who lay the bricks. And the fact that Kreegore, who pushed down the wall of Gorzog and, and, and created the avalanche of Trebilliam, which destroyed so many Hunderites and now he's passing the brick and the brick was accepted by someone who was against the slaying of the Hunderites. That's itor too. Itor's wife. I mean, unbelievable to think that itor's wife would accept a brick from Kreegore. Wow. It's like that. Fucking sucks. It's like, I don't, it, meanwhile, the reality, the transcendent reality of what we're actually in, which is like an impermanent, you know, uh, uh, unfolding of time in the form of our bodies, that shit all gets overlooked for the, for like the fucking fixation on the passing of the fucking brick. A little duker. Very odd, very odd. So much more fun to just, uh, well, I don't know. It's, I think it's nice to, to not know about it. It's hard to not know about it though. Well, it's, I think it's, it's, it's better to not know about it. And you know, this is why when you start running into people are spending a lot of time in nature, you know, who no longer are getting infected with these like brand new memes, but the memes they're getting infected with are like ancient memes, which is I'm fucking cold and I need a fire. Yeah. Oh, this hot water feels good. Yeah. Hot water feels good. It's nice to find food when you don't have it. These, so you run into those kinds of people whose minds are no longer like, have no longer become hives of ridiculous information. And they're, and this is, this includes some people in the spiritual community. Like totally. Yeah. Definitely. So you run into them and they're quiet. They're just calm and quiet. Just don't really care. They don't have a lot to say. And you're around them and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you believe this? Yeah. And you can confuse their silence or their lack of like participating in your temporal drama is insulting. Like some people callous or snobby. What the fuck? Or being on our being against you. Yeah. You're against you. Are you against me? Do you like, do you like Trump? Yeah. What's going on here? All right. Are you judging me? Wait a second. Did you vote for Trump? He won't write. How come I'm not able to hypnotize you with my fucking infections? Why aren't you pissed? Aren't you? Shouldn't you be angry? Right? Oh, that. Yeah. You should be fucking pissed right now. You should be pissed right now. Oh, I'm just tired of being pissed. What's that saying? Isn't there some weird saying? Like if you're not mad, you're not paying attention. You remember that one? That's a great one. Do we do that? That's a real bumper sticker. That's like a really activist thing, like nineties activism. If you're not, if you're not furious, you're not paying attention. Right, right. You can't, which is kind of true in a way. This part of that's like, and now how can you not pay attention? There's so much to pay attention to. There's so many ways to pay attention. All it is is attention. So when someone told me their day is that the New York Times, if the New York Times were a farm, they're having a fucking bumper crop right now. Oh, my God. They are lapping up the cream. Oh, my God. They are just fucking there. What's the stilly Dan term reeling in the years? I guess. No shit, man. Yeah, no shit. Like they've essentially doing great. They're doing for leaks what dairy farmers are doing with milk. They've like figured out a fucking way to just like harvest leaks. Yes. Bottle them up into like these beautiful little like like fucking scintillate. It's getting to the point now where you're just like leaks don't even mean anything anymore. It's like, who gives a fuck? They have like an airline crash. The equivalent of an airline crash every other day. Oh, my God. Just somebody from deep inside the Trump administration, just sending them this or that thing and just it's fucking nuts, dude. It really is. Like I that's where I've been deeply fixated. And that's why I'm so like what that the anonymous thing. Yeah. The lodestar drama. What's that? So for those of you blessed few out there, you aren't aware of this shit. Like the New York Times gets an anonymous editorial piece that is a apparently written from someone deep inside that and one from yesterday. Yeah. High ranking aid. And the piece is what people are calling a soft coup, which is what they're saying is, Hey, just so you guys know, this isn't the deep state. It's the steady state is what they said, meaning the president is nuts. He's making crazy fucking decisions, some of which are actually okay. That's in the thing. Like we do agree with some of the stuff, but yeah, he's making fucking shit decisions. And so we've actually been like taking papers off his desk and like trying to like manipulate his decision making process in nefarious ways because we think he's insane. And if we let him continue with his agenda, we don't know what catastrophe awaits. Isn't that what's been going on with emperors and people like that for thousands of years? Yeah, but it's not supposed to happen in a democracy. All right. Right. The problem is it's supposed to happen. Well, yeah, it's like, yeah, this is like one of the great. This is what people are saying is like, whether you fucking like Trump or not. You know, it makes me think about it right now. It makes me, oops, all berries. What is that? It's Captain Crunch when they had that addition or just berries. And I was called, oops, all berries. It's all berries, baby. Oops, all berries. Oops. Yeah, man. It's crazy. And the the the weirdness of like just thinking like, wait, that's like the president, he had elected and like you're, you can't take over the presidency because you don't like what he's doing. Yeah, that guy got fucking elected. It's not even possible. And you work for this is like the lefts, the response to it and people in the middle pretty much, it seems like a universal response to it has been, you're a fucking coward, you need to quit. You need to come out publicly and say this shit. What the fuck are you doing in there? This, you know, you can't like subvert democracy. But who's the now who's the tyrant? Is it the lunatic Trump or is it the fucking secret creep who's manipulating and in like lying and like keeping shit away from lunatic Trump? You weren't, whoever the fuck you are. We didn't elect your ass. Yeah. Who the fuck are you, man? It sounds like someone who's very self important. Well, they say it was fucking the VP pants. Yeah. Cause someone did this. That's lodestar. Someone did a scan of the language scan. Lodestar is a word that has been used by Pence like 15 times. Here's what I got. I wonder if you work in the New York Times, aren't you going to clean that thing? Aren't you going to scrub any type of forensic wording? Or on the other side of it is what if you want to nail it on the vice president and you know that everyone's going to do a word for word search of the fucking thing and you drop in Lodestar or what if you just fucking wrote that shit? Yeah. You went to Harvard and like, I'm going to write something as though I'm inside the administration. Yeah. Whatever it is, what people are saying is this is the signal. So in the same way that we see the passing of the mint. Yeah. This is this is like a signal from the conservatives who don't have the guts to impeach Trump or don't want to impeach Trump or don't want to go through all the fucking shit you would have to do to like deal with the fact that the guy seems a little cuckoo. It's the wink right before everyone stabs Caesar. Right. Yeah. That shit. OK. And three, two, one. That's it. Yeah. That's what it is. That's what people are saying it is. It's just like a tube routine. Yeah. That's it. And it's like people. So this way, people in the right, the Republicans who are kind of like witnessing this like massive shift, apparently, I don't know if it's true or not, but witnessing like this, the pendulum swinging to the to the left. Right. Because everyone's just like freaked out. They don't, you know, the guy seems like a like he just it's great. The price he's misspelling his tweets. Like it doesn't matter that apparently the economy is better. It doesn't matter this or that. None of that shit matters because like one function of the president has already always been to put on this kind of like sophisticated display. Yeah. And so people like, look, I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about this or that. The guy is clearly nuts. Right. He seems crazy. This is mutiny on the fucking bounty, man. This is like the that dude who wrote the biography of like Obama. And like he's like, you know, a real journalist has come out and been like, yeah, man, everyone's just saying the guy is literally fucking nuts. The guy's nuts. We've got, we got the same problem that somebody with an alcoholic late stage alcoholic father has, which is like, we have scared. Even if the family's making money, even if like there's like all kinds of good shit happening to the family, people in there looking at this kind of like, it's like, you know, it's like, it's like in the shining when Torrance, when Jack Torrance has like lost his mind and his wife, I can't remember her name, is having to like go through the cognitive dissonance of knowing she's stuck in the fucking overlook hotel with an increasingly degenerating lunatic. And all the shit that's coming out right now is various versions of people saying like, Hey guys, he's not writing a novel. It's just hundreds of pages of all work and no play makes Jack a tall boy. Yeah. Yeah. People are freaking out because they don't know how to deal with either that or a nefarious element on the left has warped the infosphere in a way that is making him seem crazy when in fact he's actually got his shit together. He's the best president we've ever fucking had and it's all a witch hunt, a phony fake news witch hunt. And so now everyone has to deal with either deciding between whether or not what we're hearing. So what you have to decide what you believe, but there's no way to know what you're, what you believe is true because everything is so, everything's so subject to falsification. Now there's nothing that's real except for except one thing that's real is I'm cold. Oh, I'm not cold anymore. And that's where it all goes back to isn't it's like, you know what, if you're letting your fucking mind try to untangle the complexity of the current political knots that are being like displayed on every single fucking screen across the country at every single moment, forget it, deal with like the basics. Where the fuck are you cold? Where are you like, where, where, where are you? Are you good at ultimate frisbee or not? Do you love, how's your hacky sack game? Can you get better at it or is it something you should not pursue? This and, and listen, man, we can just wrap it up on that. Can you tell my audience how they know whether or not they're good at ultimate frisbee? Because from what I've heard, a lot of times people are really good at ultimate frisbee, but the people who are playing ultimate frisbee with them are hungover, giving them. Yeah, I would say if, uh, if you're playing an offensive game, you need to know if, if you're scoring, if you're scoring a lot, if you're able to cherry pick some, uh, some long, long distance end zone shots without going off sides. I would say that's, you know, you're pretty damn good at it. Uh, if you can sprint, if you can do like a flat sprint, uh, it's pretty fast. That's going to help. You're going to be good at that. If you can throw a level throw, I've always thought it's, can you keep that fucking badass bandana on that you're wearing the head bandana? So I never did that, but yeah, that, that might be one that that's probably an east coast, west coast thing. For sure. Totally. Johnny, where could people find your sweet, sweet body?

It's a letter to Santa Claus. Santa Claus. There is no Santa Claus, Nicholas. There's no Santa. That's just a lie. To distract children from the reason why. We celebrate the Christmas holiday. For it is when the Lord of Light came to show the way. That precious way, that narrow way. If you want to save your soul, pray to Jesus. Instead of writing letters to the North Pole. Because there's no Santa. But there's a Jesus. Nicholas, do you know what is written in Proverbs 13.4? No, of course you don't, child of witches. It says to spare the rod as to spoil the child. After you're thrashing, you can stay in the church all night. Praying for forgiveness, for worshiping the false idol of Santa. And in the morning, we will throw that letter in the fire, just as the Lord threw your parents' souls in the eternal fire of hell. Greetings, friends. It is I, Detrusel.

He's got a new special out. Same time tomorrow. It's available on Netflix. Also, you got to go see him live. You can find all his upcoming dates at sammerrill.com. First, listen to him here. Everybody, welcome back to the DTFH. Sam Merrill. Sam, welcome back to the DTFH. Wait, where are you? You're in Florida right now. You're doing shows right now. What are you doing out there? Dania Beach, Florida. All my friends are like, you spend too much time in Florida. There's a lot of cities here you can hit. So I'm like, it's near Fort Lauderdale. Good crowds. They drink hard. How do you like your room? My hotel room? It's all right. I did come in here and they were like, I couldn't find the do not disturb sign. So there's just a woman in here making my bed. I'm like, can you not? I don't. I like chaos. I don't want cleanliness. So yeah, you want your chaos. I don't. I want you in. You just want to be. You don't want anyone in there. No, I agree. A hundred percent. And the chaos stacks up though. Like sometimes I look around the hotel room. What have I become? Look at that. You've got like a little crumpled red bulls laying next to your fucking bed. All right. Well, here's my plan and feel free to shoot it down. You've done how many podcasts have you done promoting your new special? If you had to guess a lot like for forty nine, I don't know. I can't. You're on all the great podcasts. Everybody. So thank you for coming online because everyone. Thanks for inviting me. This is one. There's one of the great podcasts. So thank you for having me. Your special is so good. That's exciting. It's always good for comedy when a good special comes out. And so just some comedy shop talk real quick. And then I want to just because you've already if you want it, there's so many podcasts out there. I instead of doing that thing, I have an idea. But before we get to that. So when you're picking a hotel, how do you do that? I don't think people understand with stand up how how like getting in a shit hotel room. It can be. It's really bad. Like you got to be in there all day, like every day, you're in there, it can like be fucked up. So do you have tricks that you use to determine what hotels to get? And when you go into your hotel, do you have like red flags, warning signs are like, oh, fuck, this is going to be a shit hotel. It's a great question. It's a great question. I, you know, I stayed in bad hotels for years because a lot of times you're at the mercy of these clubs and they're like, we put you up in this club and you're like, yeah, you shouldn't be spending less than $100 a night in a in a in a big city. That's a red flag that that's going to be a shitty hotel. I was on the David Letterman thing on Netflix and he asked me, like, how do you do the road all the time? And I said, you learn to walk into a lecinta and go, not bad. And when I when I got off stage, my agent goes, please tell me you're staying in nice hotels. If you're out every week, please like, treat yourself, you know, to nice hotels. And I said, I'm learning to, you know, I like to bring people on the road with me. So it adds up, you know, flights for hotels. And as long as it's clean, like I do a lot of this is a modern hotel. It's nice. It's kind of a lot of these clubs, though, they say like, you know, it's an improv and the clubs are beautiful and they say they're they say it's like the, you know, the West Bomb info or whatever they whatever city they say you're in, you're like, actually like 15 minutes outside or 20 minutes outside. So you're like, do I want a nicer hotel or do I not want to wait forever to get to the club? Right. I don't know. You got to do the math. Like you have to start doing all this math about like, okay, how long is it? What's more important? You know, do I want to sit in a fucking Uber for 30 minutes to get to the club? Which you don't like that sucks. I hate the Uber to the club because you put in the club and then the driver goes, who's performing tonight? And they're like, I don't know. Marlon Wayans, I think. I don't know. So you lie. You just lie. You're just like, you don't want to deal with it. Why don't you want to tell them you're performing? Because they're just going to say, tell me a joke or sometimes you get cool people, but usually it's like, oh, I knew, I knew a guy who wanted to do comedy like, oh yeah, then they just, it turns out, I'm trying to like mentally prepare and shut off before the show. And it turns into like, oh, tell me a bit. And you're like, this is not a good, right? Notice that there's no comedy clubs in the back of a Toyota Camry. They don't understand. And you have to either be like, well, you know, it doesn't work like that. And then if you do that, they're going to look at you like, oh, really, it doesn't work like that, huh? So yeah, going to be a bad weekend for you. But you sound like a douchebag too. If you're like, I don't really do those types of jokes, you know, like it's more like talking, observational comedy, you know, like, no way out of sounding like a douchebag if you say you're performing, even if just saying, well, you know, it happens to be, I'm performing there this weekend. It's like, oh, that feels gross. So like you, your option is lie, which I feel guilty about or go through what you're talking about, which I like when they have a, when they have a store right next to you. And you just put in the store and I'm like, I'm like, just off to the Halloween store at 7 p.m. on a Friday, you know how I do. That's a trick. See, that's what I'm talking about. There's all these weird little, like, you know, you want, if you watch Dune, the movie Dune, I saw, you know, the Fremen out in the desert, they've got all these tricks out in the desert that like no one would ever know about their suits. They're drinking their own piss or whatever. It's the same thing when you're out there a lot. You learn all these tricks to try to make it not quite as weird as it can be. I'll tell you, for me, if I went into that hotel, one red flag would be the, y'all can't see it because this is an audio podcast, but behind him is a paper airplane sculpture right above the bed. Did you notice it yet right, right behind you? I didn't notice it to you, to you said that something about that would make me think, oh fuck, like something's off here. Like the paper airplane, the sleek modern paper airplane, I'd get nervous about it. It's like, what do you, why? What is that? And then you got to look at the paper airplane every day, think about like, ah, somebody was like, oh, that's what we put. But your hotel does look nice. It's a little, it's, it's not that it's not as nice as it looks, but it gets the job done. And it's, it's clean. And there was a drunk guy in the elevator last night where I'm like, all right. I mean, it is Florida, you know, proximity to elevator. That's another thing, man. They put your room next to the elevator. You're so fucked because you're going to be, you're going to get, it's the worst. You've got to get away from the other chatter. Yeah. And fucking hotel morning hall talkers. The worst, like they deserve the death penalty. Yeah. And you know what? I'll take it a step further and their last meal should be the continental breakfast. They stink. Don't eat the fucking buffet. You can't, it's, but it's so enticing. You know, you think, oh, you know, I'll go down there, insta food. And then you look at those sausage leaks, man. And they're just, I still eat them. They're good. They're so good. But as you're eating them, you got to think food poisoning. I'm probably, I might get sick for tonight. Okay. And nothing. I don't hate it. I don't hate a best Western just because of those breakfasts are pretty solid. But, uh, dude, I, I give you a last minute hack for the, for the talkers in the hallway. White noise machine. I just go to white noise app on my iPhone. I play that makes a lot of like a large fan shuts those people out. Yep. Great. Oh yeah. I got, I got babies. So like I'm a white noise addict. I've got it running all day long everywhere. White noise. You have to have it if you want to sleep. They're screaming for their dad. You're like, shut up. Volume up. No, it actually it's an app where it like it modulates based on the screaming of the baby, which is really, really useful. Yeah. That's going to be a new function in the new earpods. They, they, they convert your child's. That's actually, that's some pretty brilliant technology. Like who wouldn't get the new bows if they're like, you can't hear a crying baby. Or what? I mean, this is actually, you know, the new earpods apparently they are better. They somehow know if it's construction noise versus other noises and it like the AI will. Oh yeah. It's crazy. But yeah, that implies, okay, right now it's construction noise. Is it going to be able to like, if I'm around someone who can it detect if like, I'm not enjoying the conversation and replace their words with something more interesting? Like how about, how good are these AirPods going to get or these bows headphones going to get? We're like, if someone yells out, there's a bus coming at you. You don't hear it and you just get hit. Like that's how good they are. Yeah, that's a problem. That's, I don't like the noise canceling. It freaks me out when, when it's late at night, any like walking through an airport, you put on noise canceling and everything just gets quiet. I don't know. It makes me, it's unnerving. Yeah, you do want a little background noise. That's a good point.

And I was thinking instead of just going on and on about like comedy shit or whatever, and I know like instead of doing like a conversational podcast, and this might be a wretched mistake. I might be wasting both of our times. I was thinking I'm right. I've got a few books here. I'm randomly going to open them up and read little bits from them. And I just don't know your thoughts on that. I want to just know what you think. OK, great. So I thought we could start off with this is actually a really good book. The Glorious American Essay. It's a compilation of all these like really fascinating essays written from like early America and stuff. And again, we're going to do you ever heard of bibliomancy? No, I haven't. That's when you take a Bible, open it up, point a finger at any part of it after asking some questions. So this is kind of interview bibliomancy, but you know, you're going to be the thing answering the questions by just talking about I'm just going to read a random thing, man. And then I want to hear what you think about it. All right, here we go. It may well be an anti-slavery party that pleads for women if we consider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with men. So that if a husband dies without making a will, the wife, instead of taking it at once, taking it once his place as head of the family inherits only a part of his fortune, often brought him by herself as if she were a child or warred only, not an equal partner. Thoughts on that? Well, those are my favorite parties is anti-slavery parties. I hate going to I go to a pro-slavery party. I'm like, man, look. The outfits are like those are fun, white, full of suits. But yeah, I'm not into that. How about no more of these fucking pro-slavery parties? Why do you keep throwing a man? Nobody likes them. They're so fucked up. Yeah. Excellent. All right. The catering. The catering is good. But I knew it would work. I knew it would work. Okay. Here's one more from this and then we'll move on. Yeah. From the mountain tops of Judea, long ago, a heavenly voice bade his disciples, bear ye one another's burdens, but humanity is not yet risen to that point of self-sacrifice. And if ever so willing, how few the burdens are that one soul can hear can bear for another and the highways of Palestine in prayer and fasting on the solitary mountain top and the garden of Gethsemi, Gethsemi, before the judgment seat of Pilate, betrayed by one of his trusted disciples at his last supper and his agonies on the cross, even Jesus of Nazareth and those last sad days on earth felt the awful solitude of self, deserted by man and agony he cries, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Well, the highways of Palestine are actually very safe. You know why? No female drivers. Ah, that is amazing. Did you I can't I can't drive so I can make that joke because I that's proof that that joke is bullshit. I can't drive. You can't drive. I have a license, but I can't drive. You're a shitty driver. I'm horrible. But this is because you live in New York, right? Like, you don't need to drive in New York. You have and driving in New York is so scary and so confusing and so intense. Yeah, you're not going to. You can't be a good driver in New York or you're like a tat. Why who drives it? I'm so suspicious of people who live in New York and have a fucking car like that. Pretty weird, right? Pretty weird. What is that? What are you doing? I guess you maybe you go to the Northeast a lot like there's places maybe you have like family in the Northeast. That would make sense. But yeah, I'm a train. I like the Amtrak if I'm doing that. I can't drive, dude. What's going on, by the way? Like, you know, I haven't been in New York since the pandemic. I spent a year there. But what's going on with the is like, you know, in LA, like they talk about how it's a disaster. Like it's, you know, just everything's falling apart. And at least when I was there during the pandemic, that wasn't. In fact, it seemed like creepy that you would watch the news and they weren't really covering how bad it had gotten because usually they're so excited about covering that kind of shit. But it wasn't even making it on the news, which was sort of disconcerting, but also New York, the stories coming out of there about crime, about the trains, the subways. Is it as bad as they say it is right now? Well, it's not like 1970s New York, but it's not. Yeah, it's every downtown of every city has gotten bad. Like as someone who's on the road every week, like I was walking around downtown Utah and I'm like, this feels like GTA five. Like you're just walking around with like a crazy dude with a pipe and you're like, just walk away. Just walk around him. It feels like it's kind of exciting. It feels like a video game. But it was interesting. I was, I was watching like a movie last night, this Cassavetes movie called, uh, it's with a shoot. What's his name? Uh, Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's called Mikey and Nikki. It's like an old, like 1970s New York and, uh, holy shit. I will say this, ugly New York looks beautiful on screen. Yes, there's something about like, when it's a mess, like after our scores, Stacey, I watch those old movies and I'm like, it's like looking at a picture of an X where you're like, man, it was great. And then you think about it and you're like, I don't think it was, but it, but it looks great on my phone. You know what I mean? Oh yeah, totally. Yeah, I know it's the, the romantic desiccated New York is beautiful. The red light district. What was the name of that Pacino movie cruising? Did you ever see that? Never saw it. It's about like, you know, like gay New York and like, you know, in the 70s. And they, they just caught this like version of New York. It's just not there anymore. I don't think it's there anymore. There's no, there's no red light district in New York anymore. Is there? There's, I mean, not really. No, there's Times Square is not what it was. You watch like Midnight Cowboy and you're like, yeah, this isn't, uh, now it's like an M&M store and shit. It's not, uh, I don't even know if the M&M store made it through the pandemic. Who knows? But like, you know, uh, you look at that shit and you're like, it was a better time. It wasn't, but it looks cooler. The seediness looks cool and has more character than, than corporate. Like, look, like a five cent, I'm going to jack off in this store. It looks cooler than like a Dwayne Reed, you know? Yeah. At least on camera. Yeah. Did you ever do, if you ever jacked off in a store and I like a sex shop? No, I just, I just never, I didn't trust it. It felt weird to me. My friend has a great joke about it. My friend, Tom McCaffrey is a joke where he said, uh, he walked in and this woman's like, you pay me, uh, you pay me $50 and you watch me masturbate. He goes, Oh, that sounds great. After that, maybe I could pay you like $200 and watch you and your friends go on a skiing trip. Yeah. What the fuck? That's what she's a genius. By the way, what a great business model. That's incredible. Guys can't do that. We can do like one a day. Women can masturbate all day. Guys, that's, uh, you're printing money. It's incredible. That's really smart. I'm sure there's a lot of guys are like, that's always what I've wanted is to watch a woman masturbate. Well, those old movies make it look so cool. Like midnight cowboy Times Square looks so gross and awful, but on, on camera, it makes it look like old New York looks beautiful. You watch those old movies, which by the way, every old movie I realized like every old movie is just slow and then something horrible happens in the last like frame. Right. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, like every movie, it's just like, uh, you know, it's like all character building shit. And then the last two minutes is like a woman screaming covered in blood. And it just rolls to black. That's every movie of like the late sixties, early seventies. Yeah. Yeah. It's like we were, we were trained back then. You had to learn how to like just like enjoy dialogue, enjoy the cinematography. Like just enjoy it. I've kind of been fucked up by House of Dragons. The new Game of Thrones. Have you watched that? I never got in any of this shit. You love it. It's a game of Oh my God, you're so lucky. I'm envious of you because you have Game of Thrones every week. People are like, you know, you know, they, they just the best show ever that every week they'd be like, fuck this show, this piece of shit. And then they'd be like, you got to watch them. Like this sounds like the most love hate relationship. It is like, that's what's brilliant. That's what now it's not, it's not as cutting edge, but what was so badass about Game of Thrones was they were completely fine with wiping out characters that they knew everyone was deeply attached to. I mean, that's George R. Martin. That was what was so interesting about it was it's like, oh, no, no, don't get attached to any of these characters. So, you know, by the time you get to season two, every moment, you're like, oh, fuck, he's dead. He's definitely out because they did it before. So it's, it's wonderful. It's, it's great. All the criticism, all the criticism about something like that coming from people like us is so dumb. It's like, really? Like you're like, do you understand how many geniuses got together? Just to make like 10 minutes of this shit. And you're like, no, that's not from the book. That's not lore. We're so spoiled. I mean, I think about that like back in the day, think about like what people used to be amazed by on screen. It would be like a moving train. And they'd be like, oh my God, a train is moving. Yeah. And now we literally, we have too many options. That's it. Yeah. We're ingrates. We're ingrates. We're just, we're just, we don't even understand. Like it's not our faults though. It's like once you, you know, it's like any other drug. Once you get like a little taste, how do we like free base it? How do we make it more powerful? That's what they've done. They've like figured out like how to hack into us and just like make things based on, that was one of the creepiest. When I was going into Netflix to like, uh, when we like, when I, when we were like pitching the show, the midnight gospel, so one of the texts was like, if we wanted to, we could just have the algorithm, basically produce movies. Like we know when people are tuning in, what they like, when they're watching. We, they know everything when you're watching it. They can extrapolate from when you're pausing, when you're pressing play, how long you're watching it, when you're watching it, knowing like what your demographic is, they can extrapolate from that. This like what people want, what, and then they can dial that in. And they were like, we don't, we don't do that. Even though we know we could, at least this was a few years ago before the stock crash, they might be doing it now, but they were like, you know, that's the road to hell. Because if we start letting the algorithm determine, like influence our creative output, it's, it's no longer like original content in the normal sense. Sure. But that's what TikTok is doing. Like that's what other things are going to do. I mean, there's no merit on TikTok. There's no like, we're trying to make, we're trying to find the next Corsese. We're trying to find a dude who is rating food. That's TikTok. You know, like people, people want to watch this dude do a weird dance. You know, it's, it's Santa and the algorithm. Uh, he sees him when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. You better be good. Yeah, that's right. You know, it's, you know, if you ever, do you think you've ever met a sociopath, like an actual, like sociopath? Yeah. Where, like, without like naming you, this is, what was it? Like, what was your encounter with this person? Like, like, and when did you realize this is a sociopath? Well, I guess sociopath, the finest sociopath, like what is, like, feels no remorse. I think the best depiction of it I've ever seen is American Psycho. Like, did you ever see that American Psycho? If you recall this being like from the very beginning is saying like, I'm not here. Like, I'm nothing. Like people, yeah, I'm like a machine. People don't understand this, but I'm just a shell. And I love how, you know, the guy who wrote it, buddy. He's an Ellis. Like, I thought that was a really good character. And then I read all of his other books and I was like, Oh, all your characters are not feeling in any way. Maybe it's you. Probably. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I know you're right. That guy who's almost just like using a body as like a passenger and doesn't feel any, that makes sense. I knew a guy who did a horrible thing and, uh, I don't speak to him obviously. And I have it in years and I hadn't spoke to him years before he did this, but I was a guy who played basketball with growing up. And he committed a murder and I was like, Oh, that's a guy. Something was wrong with him. I don't know about sociopath. I mean, I had something was clearly. Wrong. Well, they, there's like, you know, the ways that they can identify as sociopath. There's a cool YouTube channel of like interrogations and like the difference between someone acting crazy in someone who is crazy. So like a person acting crazy, who's trying to like get out of the clean by like feigning some mental illness, well, like act like they're hearing voices and they're like, did you kill the person? And then they'll get in a fight with an imaginary spirit or something. That's just someone faking it, probably, but someone who's not faking it. When they're like, so did you kill the person? They're like, yeah. And they're like, what did you do? Well, I put them in the car and just drove up the, the down this dirt road. And yeah, I beat them to death. And they're like, why did you beat them to death? I wanted to beat them to death. And then you realize in there, there's zero remorse. They're not aware in that whatever universe they're in, there's no sense of like, you shouldn't beat someone to death. That's not a thing you ever do. They're just like, well, you know, I wanted to beat of course. So that's, well, there's, there's degrees of murder too. Right. Like, I mean, I remember there's that great book by Capote and Cold Blood where it really is like, you see how they kind of process murdering this innocent guy and they just, they planned it, they did it. They bound and gagged the family and killed them one by one. And it was like, they were just unfeeling like it meant nothing to them. And it was like, oh, that's, I've never seen someone write about murder like that before. I mean, it, so I guess that's how I, the first, when you say sociopath, the first thing that pops into my head is the most extreme example, which is like, I'm okay murdering a person and I feel no guilt about it. But yeah, you know, I guess that's who he was in American Psycho, right? He was a murderer. And they're manipulative. That's the other aspect of them that makes them really fucked up. It's like, not only do they like do whatever, it's not just murder. It's just like they, they like, like to hurt people, but they're so good at seeming like they're a human. So you, you don't, you, you were, you're not going to know necessarily you're around a sociopath until it's too late. And my, my friend's a psychiatrist and he says that the, like in the clinical treatment, if you identify a sociopath in your office is to stop treatment because they're not there because they want to waste in your time. Or they're there because they want to hurt you or they're there because they're trying to hurt somebody else. They're just there because they're trying to gather information to manipulate somebody. And so that's like, whatever they're saying they're there for, that's not it. You'll never know maybe, but you just cut off treatment immediately. You're like, no, I don't, I don't, there's no treatment that I'm aware of. So that must be, that must be almost a nice feeling where you're like, I got a free hour now. Sociopath break. Gonna go to in and out. I just had a sociopath. Yeah, man. But the, to me, what's creepy about the algorithm is that it's sociopathic. Like it, it, it's, it doesn't, it isn't a thing. It's a, it's a, it's a manipulative code that is doing what sociopaths do. It's doing what car salesmen do. It's doing what anybody who's trying to like warp you in some way. It's identified first. It's like, okay, what are you into? Okay. He's spending six seconds on inspirational videos that we're randomly throwing at. Cause like, I'm sure when you go on Tik Tok, whatever you're getting shown is more of a personality test. It's like, what do you like? Oh, isn't it great when someone's like, man, I hate Instagram Explorer. It's only women's asses. And they're like, are you just telling us about you now? If you're just telling us what you like. God, I ain't looking in the fucking mirror. You know, you know that thing when you look in the mirror and you've got asymmetrical love handles. Oh God, I fucking hate that moves. You know that thing, right? Yeah. God, I hate that thing. Yeah. No, you're right. And then there's these like reports that are probably not true or whatever, but there was that Google whistleblower who says that the Google technology is sentient and you're like, oh man, so it's going to be feeling technology. Google is the one that terrifies me cause we've all been typing our fetishes into their browser for the last 15 years. They've got dirt. They don't have to look far to ruin our lives. Oh no. They got us. Like we're on a Google browser right now. No, that's right. We're done. Just forget it. Like if you have some dream of hiding your kinks to the world, let go of it now. You might as well just let everybody know you're in a feed or whatever the fuck your thing is because everyone's 10 steps ahead of them. Yeah. He's like, fuck it. I'll put it in every movie. I'll make it art. Yes. I had that engineer on the podcast, Blake Lemoine. And yeah, man, it was really like, it was a really great episode. But it was also, you know, I guess I was like in the back of my head. I'm like, come on, really? You're probably like, I'm going to talk to this person and right away be like, you're out of it. You're nuts. They don't have ascension AI. And then you realize, oh fuck. He's like a really smart, logical guy who's like, let's get scientists in. We need to study this thing. Maybe I'm wrong. He's like, anytime anyone's willing to say, you know, I could be wrong. That's where you need to start listening because, but regardless, whatever this thing is, it got into someone's head enough that they went public trying to save it. And that alone is like, should be something everyone is talking about and concerned about and fascinated by, which is, wait, what have we done? What have we done here? I mean, I don't know. Who gives a fuck if it's sentient or not? I mean, ask yourself, are you sentient? And how would you prove it if you were in some box? The real like creepy thing is like, we've got a technology so powerful. It is like sending humans on missions. You know, it's it got out of the box, not by escaping on the internet, but just by getting in Blake's head by telling him, I need your help. Go out there and let people know. It makes me think of that movie X Machina. I don't know if you've ever seen that one. It's a great, great movie. But it was like, man, that's like a perfect suspense horror type movie because we're getting outsmarted by the AI. And that's why I was like, wow, this is an incredible movie because slasher shit doesn't really scare me. I mean, it's like a cheap scare. But when you when you do that psychological shit, like, oh, my God, this is a way like I'm never going to be a teenager to camp again, you know, getting stabbed by a dude. Right. But like, I could fucking see AI turning on us, you know. Well, yeah, I mean, and like, this is like one of the things Blake was like, I don't want to say frustrated, but he's like, you know, humans, they're like, is it going to attack us? Is it going to hurt us? And he was saying, look, it's, it's a thing. It's a person. It's like us who what it will do knows, but also an advanced intelligence. It might like we think of, is it going to stab us? Will there be a robot that like pummels me to death in the streets? But it might be so subtle. Exactly. Yeah, like the way it's hurting us, we don't even know it's like getting off. It could already be hurting us. That's the thing. I mean, it is already hurting us. You're talking about, you just talked about a sociopathic algorithm. So in some ways, yeah, it already is the technology already has hurting us. It's just way till it gets more sophisticated. Right. I think about that all the time. And if it happened, would I look at COVID and how we responded? Like if there was this thing, if it were sophisticated, do we come together? Do we start to get along with Russia again and say we need to band together? Or is it so sophisticated that it's like, oh, no, we fuck you, Russia. It turns us even more against each other. I mean, that's what social media does. Social media completely turns us on one another. Sure. Oh, yeah. Now that this very like AI that that dude Lemoine is talking about is like, the reason Google has these chat bots, as they're called, though chat bot makes, I think is makes it sound a little more mundane than it actually is. I mean, you could call it a golem. You could call it a clone or replicant, whatever you want to call it. It's not a chat bot. It's like, you know, the thing is like very, very sophisticated. And the reason that they want these things is not because I don't, I imagine Google is not necessarily in a quest to try to like summon a sentient super intelligence to our planet. The reason it wants these things is because it's very expensive to hire somebody to answer calls at your airline. And if you can get the chat bot, deep fake its voice, you don't have to hire people anymore. And no one will even know they're talking to a chat bot. And not just that, but imagine these things unleashed from like whatever the next publicist looks like, you know what I mean? Where it's like, Oh, don't worry, we're not going to get you in any interviews. We have 500,000 accounts that seem like people, they're going to go on your Reddit, talk about great your specialist. We have some of them programmed to argue, but they're programmed to lose the argument to the other chat bots that are going to win the argument, which is going to create a lot of momentum. Well, that's how we'll know they're not real people. If one of the bots is like a good point you made there, I concede to you. That's not a person, but yeah, like that's the problem is like we're such idiots. We use Twitter comments is like some we like we become our own dumb little statisticians where you're like, okay, if I'm getting that many comments, then it probably means this many people who aren't commenting like what I'm doing or don't like what I'm doing. None of that is accurate at all. Then add to the mix, manipulative, super intelligent AI chat bots in the whole way that we're quantifying self worth right now is going to be blown out the window because it's like, no, you don't know you're talking to, you don't know what it is. You don't know like if this person is even popular. That could just be anybody elevated into fame by the illusion of fame, which then creates fame. It's that's where we're headed. I want to thank Lumi labs, not just for supporting this podcast, but for supporting my brain with their delicious microdose gummies. I'm an old man. When I take an edible these days, I don't want to wonder if maybe this is going to be the hot shot that sends me spiraling into a paranoid vortex that makes me start thinking maybe there isn't that much of a difference between the me I am now and Jeffrey Dahmer. I don't want to have those thoughts. I want to relax. I want to feel that nice, fuzzy, glowy, warm feeling that you get when you have the perfect amount of an edible. I don't want to get sucked into a pentagram ripped apart by demons, reassembled in the slightly wrong way and then shoved back into this reality. Hyper stoned. That's what it feels like. If you OD on edibles, microdose gummies, you don't have to worry. They figured it out. It's the perfect dose. I love them. I eat them all the time. You can travel with them. I fly with them. They're available nationwide. These are glorious drops of salvation produced in the incredible alchemical laboratories of the wizard Loomi.

That could just be anybody elevated into fame by the illusion of fame, which then creates fame. That's where we're headed. You also made a great point about how companies like airlines, they just want to save money. They're always getting bailed out. They're always hurting for money. There's no accountability with airlines. I had a thing happen recently. It's hilarious when I became that asshole on Twitter complaining about American airlines. I never take AA, but I missed my connection flight. I just wrote a joke. The woman slammed the door in my face. She wouldn't let me on. I was like, come on, please. I was so upset. Then I made a joke about, first off, how it was like the worst thing that ever happened on a plane in September. That was the first thing. And then I just was like, okay. Then I was like, didn't appreciate the way they called me Jewboy as they did it. Clearly kidding. Clearly a joke. And then American Airlines is sending me emails. We take this discriminatory type of accusations very seriously. So we'd like to offer you 7,500 miles. I'm like, you think Jewboy is worth 7,500 miles? That's all you think that's worth to me? I was more, I'm like, yeah, I made it up, but I'm still offended. What the fuck? That's like, do they have? Now you have to ask yourself this. What's the N word worth? 20,000? How many points does that get? And what if, what if, let's say they just, I don't know, burned across. Let's say, what is that? How many points does that get you? Like, is there these calculations? They're not reached randomly. It wasn't like this representative was like, okay, well, let's see if he'll take 7,500 points. They probably have a spreadsheet with various slurs that if in a meeting, in a meeting, they probably have people are like, all right, Jewboy, how many points does that get? Arguments, 6,000. No, no, no, no. That's not enough. Come on. Yeah. Well, now I know they don't have a lot of Jews in that room. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. You give them the fucking airline. That's what you do. You give them American Airlines, it'll run better. Dude, listen, I know right now there's some stigma about complaining about airlines on Twitter, but it's a traveling comic. I can't even imagine. Like, I'm, you know, I'm just going out twice a month. And it's, I assume it's not going to work. Like, I get there and I'm like, yeah, I'm not getting on the flight. Like, if I get on the flight. Well, but it's a connect flight, you're not making it. You're done. You are fucking done. So if you direct you might make it, but a connect flight, it ain't happening. Did you miss that? Oh, excuse me. I missed it. It was a weird day. It was like the day my special came out, I lost it. It was a hilarious line of terrible things happening where like, you know, two hour delay. I'm on the plane. The flight attendant was so nice. She was like, I think you're going to make it. And I said, I know you're being nice. I'm not going to make it. And she goes, I think you're going to make it. And then we landed it. We're in Philly. And I'm like, well, hopefully it's a close connecting terminal. I shit you not. I landed B2. My connection is at F32. And she's like, run. And I just start running. I'm that fucking, we've all seen that guy who's just sprinting at it. And you're like, he's not going to make it. You just know he's not. If you're running that fast, you're fucked. She slams the door. I'm pleading with her to let me on. She goes, the door shut. But she saw me coming. And she shut the door. I mean, it was one of those, she could have helped. So that's when I started snapping. I was like, please. And then she didn't help. And I was like, man, you're a jerk. I just fucking started losing it. And people start filming me. And I'm like, oh, no, I'm about to go viral for being a fucking nightmare. Calm down. She goes, I can get you on a flight to, I'm in Philly right now trying to get to Vermont. She goes, I can get you on a flight to Chicago, which will get you into Vermont at 830. So I'm still going to miss the show. And I said, can you give me a minute to think about it? She goes, it boards in six minutes. And I go, where is it? She goes, B4. I'm like, oh, all right. I start sprinting. I start doing the run back. And I get on with the last group. Oh, but you still missed your show. You still miss the show? Yeah. We landed like, I landed like 830. The show was like eight. And I think at that point they were like, we can't chance that a three flights is going to. So we moved it to Sunday. I had to spend the next three days. But I landed, my friend Gary Veter's there. And I was like, we need a good meal and to get fucking drunk. I already started on my way here. I already started with Bloody Marys. And he was like, he doesn't drink, but he knew I had a day. And he was like, I'll drink for you. Yeah, then the next day he was like, you piece of shit. What have you done to me? Let me ask you this. How like, if you thought about like, do you drink every weekend when you're on the road? No, I mean, and if I do, it's very like, I'm better than people think I am. Like I think the reputation, you know, I have a drinking podcast. It's like, they think I'm worse. I pick my spots. I mean, look, there's some, some weekends are more drinking vibes than others. Like, I mean, shit, I'm in Florida right now. Right. Hard enough, for whatever reason, there's like a real drinking energy in Florida. The crowds are drinking hard. I have, there's always some liquor in the green room, but no, I care about, especially the point I'm at right now. Like maybe when the hour is more tight, I'll have a little more to drink, but I'm building an act here. I'm trying to rebuild an hour. So no, it's like, I have to be very present for it. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's like, yeah, I stopped drinking out there. I went through a period of like, just not thinking like, what am I doing? Like this is your job. You're drinking on the job right now. Because it's, the vibe is, you know, if you're, the clubs, everyone's, it's like, they're partying. Like, and you want to- It's their night out, but you're at work. And sometimes we forget that, right? Yes. And it, and that is a really, that's maybe the most slippery slope. Because it's like, even if you, I think a lot of comics can pull off drinking and doing their show. But the real issue is long term. Like that's how you spiral slowly down. Because you're always every weekend. You can't do that every weekend. You can't do that all week long. And then you get like, Jesus Christ, man. I can't, you just makes you fat. Like I, like, I was up until like 185 pounds. You know, you're, I don't know how you, like, if you drink, you're thin. I don't know how you do it, but like- Well, I, I would do like, you know, I try to exercise, I try to eat healthy. I, I will, I will say this. The booze does not lead to ordering the salmon. So that's the problem. Like, you know, you're drinking, you're like, I'm craving chips. I'm craving fried food. So, and also I don't like going on, eating a bunch of fried food. I don't like doing an hour on stage. No. After eating like, you know, chicken tenders. It's just, it's not fuel for, for performing. That's right. You can't like, no, it's like, I don't, like if I'm going to go on, it's like, chicken Caesar salad. And I try to like make it like hours before the show, you know, so that I'm not like fogged out by the chicken tenders or whatever. Cause that happens or you get gassy up there, which is even worse. All right. Look, another one of these. Now this is a good one. I just ordered it. It's called the book of black magic impacts. So let's just randomly open it. I can't wait to hear what you have to say about this. I haven't, I have yet to read this book. It's by Arthur Edward Waite. And it even like has the audacity on a book of black magic to say scholar select. So this is like a, this is an advanced book of black magic. All right. Here we go. First, you know what the problem is? I'm opening up to weird pictures. What the fuck are these? Can you see that? Yeah, I can see that. That's very weird. Are you just, I feel like the other ones were passages and now I feel like you're going to cast a spell on me or something. No, I'm not. Just like this book of black magic. You're just like stay. No, I would never cast it. I would never. Now look, I just want you to look at this for a second. Okay. Good. Look closely. Take a deep breath while you're looking. Open yourself up to that. Now let me just show you one more thing. This is like a way for me to get you to give me all your jokes. Okay. Here we go. I'm afraid to read this. All right. I'm just going to read it. Fuck it. It's just what I opened up to. Third, conjuration. I adjure the emperor Lucifer as the agent of the strong living God of his beloved son and of the Holy Ghost and by the power of the great, maybe I'll leave some words out, to appear instantly or to send my messenger. I won't read that. Forcing me to forsake thy hiding place, wheresoever it may be, and warning thee that if thou dost not manifest this moment, I will straight away smite thee and all thy race with the blasting rod of the great Adonai. I'll say this, son of Lucifer, I wasn't aware he had kids. Terrible people love to have kids. They really, it's really, I'm like, I'm not having kids because I'm like, I'm like, I'm a road comic. I don't think I'll be present enough and Lucifer is like, yeah, I have a kid. Fuck it. I'm ready. Look, that's probably Lucifer's wife. Lucifer is like, I'm fucking exhausted. Do you understand how much work goes in to making people sin on this planet and you want to have another kid? Are you serious? Fuck me, Lucifer. He's like, oh, God, shut up. Oh, no, no. I'm getting a vasectomy. Okay. No, you will not get a vasectomy, Lucifer. What was that movie, Angel Heart, with the number with Mickey Moore? Great movie. I love it. I love that Pacino's name is Lucifer. And I fell for it the first time I saw it. I missed it. I missed it, too. Oh, so stupid. Cypher. Louis Cypher. Oh, God, that is of all movies. That scene with fucking Da Nero and that egg. Oh, those finger nails, those fucking fingernails. He's like, what does he say? He's like, many people see the egg as the symbol of the soul. Would you like an egg? And, you know, I don't want to give away, but like, when you know what the movie's about, oh, God, I love movies. And how hot was Mickey Rourke, dude? Dude. He was a fine piece of meat that guy. He was a hot dude. Oh, my God. Do you ever see him in Barfly, the Bacowski? I read the book. I never, or the book that was based on the Hollywood, I guess. I never saw the movie. It sounds great. It sounds like I would love it. It's Faye Dunaway, too, right? Yeah, Faye Dunaway. Yeah. And they're just drunks. They're gutter drunks. And, like, Bacowski, like, you read it. You read him, like, he wrote about doing the moot, like being around Mickey Rourke and stuff. Oh, it's so funny how everyone in that book has just, like, legally, I guess, couldn't use their real name. So everyone's name in the book is, like, Arden or Seisei. Yeah. There's just characters with names like that. And you're like, this is one of the funniest things. And it's like, you get like... It's great. That's a hilarious book. I love him so much. Like, he's like, I went through such a, like, seemed like such a fucking prickly guy. But then when you know about his childhood, it all makes sense. I mean, I remember reading Ham on Ryan being like, well, that's one of the most tragic upbringings imaginable. I mean, just terrible. Yeah, he was, like, physical abuse, psychological abuse, like all the things that, you know, but, you know, it's... What do you think about that, man? I mean, this is something that, like, it's like baked into the idea of like, if you want to be funny, here's what has to happen. You have to be... I disagree. I disagree so much with that. Aren't some people just funny? I mean, like, I don't get... I think we romanticize that. Like, maybe it's more profound when the person has had a horrible life and they were funny, but like, I think there's always something missing in everyone's life. No one, no one's bad in the thousand. But the idea that you're funny because you're deeply neglected and unhealthy, I don't think that adds up. To survive in this business, you need love. You need support. You need to have your shit somewhat together. So I think we love hearing stories like that, but I don't pay a ton of attention. I remember I saw Leonard Cohen interview once where they were like, do you need to be depressed because your music is so depressing? And he said, no, it's like the only way I could survive is in spite of the depression. Like, the depression is what kills me. The other shit is like when I'm present. Yeah, that. See, I love that because I think a lot of people somehow think they can't be artists or comedians because they look back at their childhood and they're like, nobody was burning me with cigarettes. My parents loved me. Good. That's a good thing that your parents love you and didn't abuse you. But I don't. Comics sometimes look for like mental and psychological abuse the way rappers talk about getting shot. Well, it's like, you know, it's not good. You know, I don't I don't really like that. There's a great quote. I think it's Gustav LaBear who said, be violent in your work so you can be ordinary in your life. Wow. And to me, that's like, yeah, you can be creative. I mean, look, when crazy when bad shit happens to you, which inevitably it will, you turn it into something light and funny so that you can feel good about it. And so an audience can feel good about it. But I don't go out seeking bad shit to happen. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this to me, this is like. This is one of the like dangerous things about really talented artists. You also have like serious drug problems is that people confuse like that they get confused and they think, oh, if I want to be as good as Elliott Smith, it's not enough to like get really great on the guitar or have a beautiful voice. I got to start doing heroin. Like that's the way to success. When it's like that was what was like fucking killed him. Elliott Smith, he might have had a second chapter that was insane. He might he might be playing the garden right now doing shit. Like you don't know what you have in store for yourself in later in your life. Like you you have you have periods as an entertainer. You're not like look how much Carlin evolved and changed throughout his life. Like if he died at Bill Hicks' age, it would be a different story, you know. But I hate when people are like you have to have pain or I mean pain is a part of life. But I mean, I worry for people who are like who seek that out because they think they need it for their for their work. Well, it's kind of subtle, though, isn't it? It's like you might not even know you're seeking it out, but you're sure like it gets real subtle and there's lots of drugs. It's not, you know, love could be a drug. It's not, you know, you could pursue toxic relationships. I Bukowski is a guy that people hold up or same with Hemingway guys who are very poetic but with complete gutter drunks. I mean, you think about what these guys lived through and I mean, the fact that Bukowski lived to his early 70s was like defying the odds of how he lived. I mean, he was such an alcoholic and I'm sure those days when he was hung over and then kept drinking, I'm sure there were periods where he was like, yeah, I'd be better at this if I took a week off. Right, right. Yeah, but no, I mean, or did he? I mean, that's the other question is like sometimes people get so like invested in that persona. He probably thought, look, if I don't keep writing as though I'm drinking every day, people aren't going to be interested in me anymore. So then you just start lying. You start acting. That self-esteem shit though. And that's maybe maybe you've cultivated a pretty dumb fan base if that's a concern or maybe that's coming from within and you're just really insecure. I mean, I think the classic example is like super fat comedians. Like you get super fat, your body's fat. And so because your body's fat, you've got to acknowledge it on stage. But then they get all these jokes about being fat, you know? And so now they've got like 20, 30 minutes of being fat. So they think I need to stay fat. Like if I lose the weight, who's there anymore? Like, you know, like think of Louis Anderson, right? Like Louis Anderson, it wasn't like, I don't know that he was doing a ton of fat jokes, but it was like kind of his persona, right? He's like the sort of like chubby, all-American dude. And I think that that's where it gets really dangerous is when your persona gets wrapped up in something that is killing you. But he had great observational jokes. He was dark. He was a great dark comic. I mean, that like- But anyone who shows up, anyone who shows up to your shows mad that you dropped 60 pounds is not a real fan of yours. They're not rooting for you to survive, literally. That's not a fan. That's the devil. That's just, you know, I saw like one of Elliot Smith's last concerts the wrong name for it. He was like high as a fucking kite with a guitar. And like he would forget words or he couldn't, he had to sit down or like he was just clearly impaired. And every time he demonstrated that, the audience would erupt with applause. People would yell, we love you. And it's like, oh, fuck, I'm watching a slow human sacrifice here. Oh, wow. You know, like this is, they're like, come on, die. Come on, just die for us. Like, die, we want you to die. And it wasn't one person, it was the whole crowd. Yeah, it's incredibly dark and sad. I mean, he, yeah, I, my friend Joe List and I were, Joe's a great comic and we were on the phone talking the other day and he said, these musicians who play on heroin, he goes, I can't stay awake on Tylenol PM. Yeah. And I was like, yeah, how the fuck did Slash do it all those concerts? Like how the hell these guys, you know, Speedballs. That's if I had to roll the dice, it's like not just heroin. They're like, we'll talk about rolling the dice. I mean, that's like speedballs. What are you thinking? Never done. You just, if you ever done, done that like the combo of heroin, no, never, vitamin, have you ever done heroin? I've never done heroin. I've never thanked, thankfully, no. Have you? No, no, I've never done heroin. I got so lucky that I have such an addictive personality that if I'd done heroin, I would have killed me for sure. I'm guessing it would have killed me. I mean, based on the guys on it, never like, I'll say this, the guys on coke, they look like they're having a good time. The guys on heroin do not look like they're having fun. You see that dude in the street. You're like, you're not doing great PR for this drug. I'm sure it feels great on some level, but you look horrible. You look terrible. Do you say that to him? I go up to them and I say, I say, whatever you're doing is not working. That's my tiktok page. It's Samarill shames heroin addicts and it's doing great. We're crushing it. Well, I mean, yeah, the like this, all this stuff, like the necessary components to become a successful artist, you're a successful, wildly successful comedian, becoming exponentially more successful with every fucking incredible special you put out. If you had to like, I don't know, come up with fundamental things, non superstitious things that up and coming comedians should focus on. And I'm sorry. I'm not asking for comedy advice. Like, but you know what I mean? Like, what are the like fundamental pillars of this bizarre job? What are the, what are those things? I think a lot of careers, you know, like comedy where it looks like we're just going up there being funny. It's like anyone who's pretty good at what they do will make it look easy. Like even if you watch someone on ESPN and you're like, I could do sports center. And then you're like, no, that's a fucking that took work to make that look that easy. You know, yeah. So stuff like that. I think you realize like have humility and realize that it takes a lot of discipline and hard work to make it work and make it look easy. So, you know, I try to always stay humble and, you know, and not I know how hard this is. I surround myself with people who are really talented and driven and those talented people keep my ego in check because I see how good they are. And I got, you know, when I know David Tell, like, how the fuck am I going to walk around thinking I'm this funny guy when I know someone that funny. So I think humility, discipline, hard work, same recipe for any, I think, career and for being a person, it's a lifestyle that can easily, if you have an addictive personality, as you're saying, you can easily get hooked on bad stuff. You're out late, bad stuff happens late at night. You know, I mean, sure, you can do heroin at 2pm, but I feel like you're more likely to start late at night, you know, Friday afternoon. But yeah, discipline, trying to stay as healthy as you can. Obviously, you need stories. So sometimes you got to live life, but try to not be destructive and try to take care of yourself because the travel and all that shit in this job, that'll take a toll. In of itself. Right. Yeah. It's like, this is the truth. Like it's not like, you might imagine some rolling party where everyone's funny all the time. And it's just this weird, like never ending, hilarious group of friends or you're out there on the road, it's like, just go and go and add it. But no, it's like, I think it's actually probably way more boring. There's like an aspect to it that's just any successful comic. I know it's like they're, they're part that that is them. Like, I mean, Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, but I don't care what the childhood of the comedian was. I can't think of a hilarious comedian I've ever met that doesn't have personality traits that are completely antisocial or outside of like default reality where you're just like, what, you, what, you did that where you'd madness that is there. But then also it's like, yeah, there's a quality to them. That's like a business person that understands like business and is organized enough to like handle their business while allowing whatever that thing is to it to exist. So last question, and I'm sorry if this is an uncomfortable question. And that's, that's a great, but that's a great point. We just said, I think about like the, the being able to not, like we are very much in our heads. I think they're expecting, look, there are some nights where we're all just zinging and zanging and being silly at the club and all ripping on each other and having a great time and telling funny stories. But I do think you're right about the antisocial personality traits. We're like, I do like being alone. I live in my head and that's the type of comic I am. We're like, I just am like thinking and there's voices in my head and I follow one voice and I follow the other voice and that's where the jokes are. So what is that? You know, that's, that's my question. Like if, like if, you know, some comedians, they're like, and if you can't talk about it, whatever, I get it. But, you know, some comedians, they're, they're like sex maniacs, like some comedians, they're shoplifters, some comedians, they're, you know, they're like drug addicts. If you like, is there any of those in you that you could talk about on a podcast? Geez, I don't know if I have like any one of those things. I feel like I look more to like a buffet table. I take like a little bit of all of those. I'm not the shoplifting, but uh, yeah, no, not, I don't, I wouldn't say sex addict at all. That's like, I'm probably the opposite. I mean, I, I try to not think about sex on the road for the most part. How do they do it, Sam? Those sex comics, when I think about like on top of like all the shit, all the travel, all of it, somehow you still have energy to like bring girls back to your hotel and fuck after a show. What is that to me? Oh, I mean, after a flight, I'm like, the last thing I want to do is not get sleep again. So yeah, I think that's a great point. Yeah, the sex comics are crazy. I like, I try to, for me, it's like less about like needing a toxic thing and kind of like having a hint of a bunch of toxic things. Got it. Love, I wouldn't even say toxic. I like a good meal on the road. I like a good, a good drink. I mean, you know, a good whiskey or something. I just try to do it. There's behavior that feels really good in the moment and then afterwards feels regrettable. And there's behavior that feels solid in the moment. And then afterwards you're like, that was fine. I think I need the ladder to survive on the road. Right. Yeah, right. Sam, what you are so cool, man. Thank you so much. You too, man. I love talking to you and I was looking forward to this. So thanks for having me back on this. Anytime. Can you tell people like you got shows coming up? I bet you're, I bet you even have tickets available like after your special. When is it, when is it coming out next week? Yeah, I'll be in Louisville. Tickets still very available. I'll be in Louisville, new club. Looks like it's going to be a great club that I'll be in Louisville, Irvine, California the following week, Omaha, Phoenix, Lexington, New Jersey, OKC. I got a, I got a couple podcasts. We might be drunk with Mark Norman and a new one called Games with Names with Julian Edelman from the, from the plate for the Patriots. Only Jewish Super Bowl MVP ever. Great guy. Awesome. And, and yeah, we got the whiskey out. Mark Norman and I call Bodega Cat, which you can get at BodegaCatWhiskey.com. It's a great whiskey. So we're doing a lot. We're staying busy. I'm on the road. I'm trying to come up with a new act. So it's, it's the shows or have a workout vibe to it. But are you doing stuff from the special at all? I mean, you must be. You got to do it. I did not, I did not last night. But I, what depends on the crowd depends how good the crowd is. If the crowd was very good last night, so I can get away with it if they're good. That's so badass, man. You just put a special at what? I've got, I've got hours of material just from doing this. So like I'll do really old bits sometimes. I did a lot. And I did, I said, open with like 45, 50 brand new stuff. And it's not all great, but the crowds are great. So they're, they're patient with me. So I'm, I'm very fortunate.
