I'm about to head to the beach with my family. So I don't have time to do a long, beautiful intro with incredibly complex music that sometimes takes me months to compose, and my special studio here in the mountains. Rather, we're just going to jump right in to this episode. Ian Fidance is a brilliant comedian who I've been lucky enough to be friends with ever since my stint in New York City. He was one of the first comics that I made friends with, and it has been incredible to watch this brilliant comedian's incredible journey through the world of stand-up comedy. He is so funny. If you ever are lucky enough to have him perform in your area, you got to go see him. He goes on the road with me sometimes, and he is a true crusher when it comes to comedy. But not only that, he is a really deep, sweet, brilliant, mystical dude who I am really, really fortunate to be friends with. So why don't you please shout out with all kinds of love? He's IanAnimal69 on Instagram, Twitch, and Twitter. He's got a really funny podcast called Bye Guys. That's B-I, guys, on gas, digital, and he's gonna be at the Moontower Comedy Festival September 23rd to the 25th. Go to his website, IanFidance.com. He's got dates coming up on his own and with the great Dave Attel. And now, welcome back to the DTFH Ian Fidance. -♪ Welcome, welcome upon you, that you are with us. Shake hands, let me give you blue. Welcome to you. Say, wow, wow, wow! It's been done. Control, control. Control, control, control, control. Control, control, control. Yeah, man. You found an incredible hat. You know, that's just a, like, that will make my year. Bro, I am so excited about this hat. I set out two weeks ago to get a bucket hat, and I went to a store called World of Hats on the Lower East Side, and I face-timed my girlfriend to pick one out, and I'm, like, in the store, and the guy's, like, I would face-time her and go, what do you think? And then I faced, I looked at him, I go, do I have your approval? And he was, like, yes. And once they agreed, I was, like, that's it. That's the one, and I've been getting compliments. It feels so nice. You affirmed it. Thank you. It's a, no, it's a hat of glory. You find them maybe once a year. You know, it's a wild thing, the different paths people's lives take, but it's just interesting to think at some point, somebody was, like, you know what? I'm going to create World of Hats, and it's just going to be a fuck ton of hats. Well, how does, you know what I'm saying? It's like, we have weird jobs, but isn't it weirder to run a hat store than be a comedian? Well, I will say yes, and I will add to that. It's very weird to run a hat store called World of Hats that only sells hats that makes it through a global pandemic in New York City. That this place is getting so many customers. It's not only state and business, but it's thriving to the point where I tried to talk him down off me paying the full price for the hat, and he goes, I can't do it. We have, I taught him down 15 bucks. I tried to go 25, and I said to him, I go, you sure you don't want to go hit my price? It looks like I'm the only one in the store, trying to be like, this is the best you could get. And he goes, yesterday someone bought $3,000 worth of hats. And I was like, well, fair enough. You tried to hat-haggle someone who started a place called World of Hats, and you were fucking thwarted. Cause, well, what are you thinking, a New York hat store? You think that guy can't read your bluff? He knew you wanted that hat, and he knew it was a hat of glory. Well, I mean, I tried to haggle a hat, the World of Hats, and I was in for a world of hurt, because it didn't get down to the price I wanted. Yeah, you're right.

I mean, maybe I'm not quite as comfortable with getting old as I thought I was, because it's not just like, shit, it's my penis shrinking, but the gray hair is now really coming in, and I'm thinking, should I dye my hair?

I mean, maybe some subsidiary county of hats or something. You're not going to have a house of hats. Hat apartment. I got them down. I got them down 15, but I was trying to go 25. Like if you're not that confident, you start hat apartment. If you've got a lot of confidence, it's world of hat. What a pain in the ass, though, man, like just to run a hat store. And what is he always looking at hats? Like does he spend his time while he's when he's at work, ordering, finding like lines on cheap hats. And I mean, I wish you could have seen the store and the and and across the street was a store called Italian clothing. I'm like, if there was ever a nexus of the universe where I belong, it's a world of hats and Italian clothing. Yeah, that's like kind of like when you were I was like, oh, I died. I died. This is just the heaven. I'm oh, I'm in between. Well, congrats on the great hat. Congrats on the new love. I see you found a new a new love. Yeah, pretty awesome. I've noticed your Instagram is filling up with images of this beautiful woman. Can you tell us a little bit about how that transpired? Well, goodness gracious, great balls of fight ants. I am in love. It's very nice. She's so smart and fun and funny and obviously gorgeous. But every dude, I swear to God, we are 100 percent balls to the wall sober, falling down, tears in our eyes, laughing just at random parts of the day. And I really feel like I've, you know, we really compliment each other. Well, I ended up, she used to be a waitress at a comedy club years ago. And we kind of vaguely remember, like, you know, passing chips, you know, but she was at a show. What do you mean? Wait, what do you mean? Passing chips, like just to like we may have run. Oh, passing chips. I thought you said passing chips, like potato chips. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Passing chips. I met her years ago. I was giving her salt and vinegar chips, you know, like a drug meal. You know, club is this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, passing chips in the night. Yeah, she used to she used to wait tables at stress factory in Jersey. And then I ended up she was at a show at the stand. And when I saw her, I was like, this is the most beautiful creature I've ever seen. Yeah. From the stage, I like hit on her. I like commented how like I was going to marry her or something like that. You know, like I and I had a spot after that. So I gave the manager my Instagram on a sheet of paper and I go give it to that girl. I got a run and he did. And she followed me and DM me. And we've been like we were like talking for a while. And then we started hanging out. Ever since we started hanging out, we've seen each other almost every single day. She I did I did a week in Vegas. She came down for half the week. I was in Philly with a tell. She came down for a night. She's just the everyone that meets her is just like, dude, she's the truth, man. She's the coolest. I'm so lucky and fortunate, you know, especially because you and I spoke about, you know, where I was like a year ago with, yeah, you know, living in hell with a terrible relationship. So you are. No, you are in just you are in the kind of relationship where where like sometimes you don't it sounded like you might not get out of it. Like you were in one of those like pre dateline relationships. You know, I was I was, you know, one step away from being an episode of forensic files. Yeah, that that it's I mean, it's my wife and I, man. We fucking watch some dark shit and we love watching dateline. We love watching like we just love it. I don't know why it's so fucked up. I think we both acknowledge that it's fucked up. Yeah. But there's just something just so astounding about seeing like a relationship that has turned into the like like these people, they ostensibly, they met. They're in love. They think about each other. They were thinking about each other when they're apart and missing and longing after each other. And then one of them is like, you want to go on a hike and just shoving them down off a cliff into the sea to get insurance. She always was trying to get me to hike. And I'm so glad the weather got in the way. Don't fucking hike. If you're in a shitty relationship, do not go on a hike. That's what I've learned from Dateline, because they will. It's just, you know what I mean? That's to me kind of the astounding astounding quality of human intimate relationships is like how, you know, if friendships, they can go sour or you're just suddenly you're just annoyed with with one of your friends or whatever. But usually you just don't talk to them for a while and then you like make up and then your friends again, but it's crazy how with like intimate relationships. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, it's it's so funny. I was just speaking to a dear friend today about how like, you know, my life today is just filled with so much gratitude. And I really this. I mean, we all went through different levels of hell this past year. But for me personally, going through this relationship, which I knew at the time and I even said to you, like, it's not love. I mistook I mistaked mistook mistake mistake either one mistake. I had mistaken. Staking. Yes, we did it. We did it. World of hats. We I had mistaken chemistry for love. Yes. And there was very much the cycle of abuse that she was putting me through ticked off this relation to childhood trauma that I went through with the abuse and kind of things that I face as a child that almost made me feel comfortable in a way. And I really empathize with people that are in relationships and they can't get out. And everyone goes, why don't you just leave? It's so much deeper when you're trauma bonded and when this abuse cycle feels this childhood familiarity. And it's so funny because, you know, I really understand how people can give false confessions because she would talk in circular ways and gas light. And really, you know, and I have to say, she's an incredibly sick person with with borderline personality disorder. And I feel so hard for her. And yeah, I pray every dude, this this got me closer to God. I was doing so many different things to get better. And I pray for her and her wellness, you know, because she she is, you know, and incredibly sick and I wish nothing but her health for her. But I with when a lot of people with borderline personality disorder, they don't see it because it's always everyone else's fault. And, you know, getting into therapy is such a hard thing for them. And I really applaud and respect to anyone that has this personality that's ordered and does get therapy. But, you know, just the way I would get talked to and circular talked and gas lit. And I would just agree to things to stop the conversation, you know, to stop getting yelled at. And I would put my head down. And it reminded me of being that little kid that, you know, my mom was traumatized from my dad's death and she didn't know how to deal with it. So her brain was broken and she would just blow up at me for no reason. I just remember as a kid, putting my head down and going, yes, yes, OK. And it would be the same thing. And I felt this weird. It was like it was like a bridge to my childhood in a negative way. So I had a hard time getting out of that. And every time I did try to get out of the relationship, I was met with, you know, threats of suicide, self harm. And so then I stayed in it because I was so afraid of what would happen to her. And I'll say, you know, in relation to that abusive pattern that became so familiar to me because it was like a bridge to my childhood in a negative way with this relationship. Yes, you know, in my current relationship, there's a bridge to my childhood of absolute joy that she says to me, I love your smile and I love when you laugh because I can see little Ian. I can see the kid you were that had so much happiness inside of you. And that means so much to me because, you know, and and again, gratitude. This relationship that I went through that was complete hell and turmoil. I it got me into therapy twice a week. I started, you know, CBT therapy, which really helped, you know, I was reading all these books. I was doing these worksheets. I was like journaling. I was praying. I was, you know, I gave up dating women, porn, masturbation. I gave up everything and just sat in the uncomfortability and sludge of what it was. And I was just sobbing and crying for days. And because of that, I was really trying to access and talk to that inner child of mine. And it's so wildly serendipitous, I guess, that without even knowing that the person I'm with now, with whom I feel such a kinship and love at the top of nothing goes, I love your laugh and your smile. I see that child that you were. And I'm like, that's what I've been trying to access. That's what I've been working towards, you know, which was such a winking and nod from the universe. And it's like, you're you're good, buddy. Things are good, you know. Did you know 85% of people who play daily fantasy sports lose, they don't just lose their money, they lose their integrity, they lose their spirit, they lose their soul. It's not that surprising. The game is rigged against you. You're playing against thousands of other lineups, not to mention experts who have more tools and more time. These are people who work at Google and have access to their quantum computers, and they're using them to make their decisions. Introducing stat hero. It's the first ever daily fantasy sport book that puts the player in control and winning within reach. Here's how it works. Stat hero shows you their lineups and dares you to beat them. It's you versus the house and a head to head fantasy matchup. You name your stakes, winner, take all, you have the advantage. Stat hero is showing you their lineups ahead of time. No one else does that. Something happened over there. They shouldn't do that. You wouldn't want to do that because if you do that and you're trying to run some kind of fantasy sports service, then you're going to end up losing money. So this is probably somebody who's having some kind of midlife crisis. And you might as well take advantage of that. You're in total control. Stat hero is DFS the way it was meant to be one on one. Play stat hero now and change the odds. Go to stathero.com slash Duncan sign up for free. And right now you can get three times back on your first play. They're giving you a 300% match that's unheard of. Go to stathero.com slash Duncan stathero.com slash Duncan. Well, yeah, yeah, the greats that aspect of 12 step programs is the part that really mirrors like all the magical systems I've heard about or the manifestation systems people talk about. They have is this like fundamental like element gratitude. It's always like if you want to start manifesting, if you want to get your ship back on track, the first step is always gratitude. And you know, if you're in a shitty time in your life and you hear that, you're like, all right, well, and then you start faking gratitude. Maybe you're, you know what I mean? Like saying like, I'm so happy that I can do it really. You're just like, fuck this. I could not find anything I was grateful for. I was, I just felt so bitter and hurt and upset, no gratitude. So I had to start writing things down and it, dude, it got to the simplest thing of like, I'm glad I have, I'm grateful I have limbs that work. I'm grateful that my legs can take me somewhere, you know, and I had to start and like relay down a foundation of gratitude and like build from there. And, and dude, I got to say like, I'm just finding so much gratitude and everything. And also, you know, this past year has been a medication journey for me where before the pandemic, I was like, let me try before the pandemic. I was like, I'm having a hard time coming. So let me change my depression meds. And that started a chain of events of like, while I'm going through this and a global pandemic, I'm often on different meds trying to figure out. And, you know, I do have a biological, chemical thing inside of my brain that needs to be addressed. And I finally found the proper medication that works. It's really helped out. And it's, what is it? I'm on Zoloft, La Motrogen and Afexer. And it's like the depression is, is a fog that I can't get out of. And this just kind of squeegees it. And I can see and I'm like living the life that I wasn't motivated to live enough while I was in it, you know? And like this time last year, I mean, I told you, I ended up in the hospital going fucking nuts. And here I am catching up with you and living my best life. Yeah, you know, man, medication and finding that I was taking Adderall and then I tried taking another ADD medication because of fucking ADD, I like lose everything constantly. And I have to have a fucking fanny pack. I wear a fanny pack. It's the answer. If you have ADHD, it will fix. You will have, you will get an extra 30 minutes at least per day because you're not looking for your shit. You just have to find the big, stupid fanny pack. But yeah, man, I just, I can't, it's like, I just had to go off them completely because it was like making me into an asshole, man. I was like crashing, getting shitty and like just, I feel much better now, but it's such an interesting, like part of modern life is like, you know, number one, acknowledging that you need, that you like having the humility to admit that you need help, you know, because a lot of people just don't want to admit that they're like going to commit. To being out of, like out of balance neurologically. I've been on medication my entire life since I was like eight. And it's so funny because God bless my mom. But, you know, medication only works if you're on it for a period of time. It gets into your blood. And then after six weeks, you go, oh, this is making me a monster. Well, time to change it up. You know, so it takes a while to like be in your system. But God bless my mom. I mean, it really set me off on a bad track, but she would give me my meds. And then I'd be like, I don't feel good or I don't like it. She goes, ah, you don't have to take it today. And then like, so I was just like a rubber band being stretched back and forth. And then I have this thing inside me that the second, you know, if I'm working out and you're like, Hey, your bod looks hot, I go, I got what I wanted. Don't need to work out anymore. So the second I feel good, I go, I gotta take my meds anymore. I'm good, you know, yeah. Right. That's the problem, isn't it? That's the fucking problem. It's not just the feeling bad thing. It's that you once you get, because once you get balanced, you aren't going to. You're not, it's like, that is the problem with gratitude. It's like the stuff that's working. You're probably not thinking about it because it's working. It's like when your car is running smoothly, you're not thinking about your brakes, your brake pads or, you know, and so it's so it becomes so perfect. It's invisible. And so people, when they're at least me, when I'm like. Going down the path of gratitude or trying to find, like trying to do the gratitude exercise that everyone I know who is like spectacularly successful recommends. Um, I, that's what I have to pull those threads of like, OK, I can shit. I can piss my knees are working like right now I'm trying to lose weight. So it's like, instead of beating myself up because of the weight that I'm at, I think, you know what, just pretend you were 190 pounds yesterday and you just lost 10 pounds, you would be fucking over the moon. You know what I mean? Like so far, like I use tricks to induce the gratitude. But have you noticed that when, when you do start. Eliciting, like, like when you do start kind of unnaturally or doing like the forced gratitude exercises that all of a sudden your heart just starts opening naturally. It's like it reactivates something. And then, and then you do start getting those natural gratitude bursts that weren't there and it's it's also. A thing of like, you know, acting your way into better thinking, you know, and at the same time, it's it's really, really hard to admit this. And I see this in other people and I hate it in them because I see it in myself. But there's there's a very real part of me. And I think this occurs in a lot of people where I get a sick pleasure out of wallowing in the messy bog when everything is is bad. It's like this sick like, oh, poor me. And that's hard to get out of. So you have to kind of and and the answer is gratitude. You know, the answer is, you know, I was writing out affirmations and I still am, you know, where I like just stuff like I deserve love. I deserve happiness. I am worthy of loving myself. I am, you know, like again, like I'm grateful that I can, you know, that I have a bicycle that I get to ride. I'm grateful that my legs work, that I feeling in my hands, you know. And once you start to get that, I mean, it truly feels like your you know, when people get a head injury and they take them to the fake grocery store and they go, OK, so you need to get three apples. And if the apples cost two dollars, how much do you pay? Check out, you know, and you're like, for others. Like I feel that way when I'm retraining my brain to like yeah, act and think better. But you're right. When you open up that little bit of gratitude, you just have your foot in the door a little bit and then it just gets blown off the hinges. And you enter this room of just beauty and thankfulness that I can't help but just spread to other people. And that's what I've always, that's who I was when I was younger. I was I was, you know, such an energetic, happy, loving person. And I lost that for a while and I really feel like I have it back. And it's just emanating from me wherever I go. And I'm I'm grateful for that. And I know it won't always be there, but I'm grateful it's there right now. Yeah. Oh, you're right. Because that's the other that's the I think the other trick is then once you do start getting in that like flow where you are like spontaneously experiencing bouts of gratitude versus spontaneously experiencing bouts of like self pity or wallowing in the muck or just being some, you know, Jacob's ladder style fucking like demon rolling around in your own mental health and pretending there's something like courageous or even or interesting, you know, because that is that that's like when it really becomes the when you if you really want to break through the floor and really go down into the hell basement, what you do is you stop resisting the collapsed in state and then you start diluting yourself into thinking there's something like special or something, you know what I mean? Like so now it's not just that you're it's like, you know what I mean? It's like one thing to have a horrible bout of diarrhea and to be like, oh, my God, this horrible. I've diarrhea. This sucks. It's another thing to be like, yeah, but like I've got the most incredible fucking diarrhea, yeah, like my diarrhea. I'm not the kind of guy who changes his pants after he shits. I leave it on because I'm real. That's how you really like head down the tube into the base. Some basements about William S. Burroughs. Hero worship of heroin, you know, yeah, like thinking like I'm not. I'm not like other addicts. I'm artistic about. It's like, no, dude, you're a fucking heroin addict. You're shooting to open your veins. Like, let's not church it up. You know, yeah, yeah. And yeah, and that, well, that's the I mean, this is the disaster of disasters is what happens is you get these like profoundly brilliant poets and artists who then get on heroin and then they just do the they, they administer a kind of massive cruelty to the world, which is they, oh, they, they write and their genius comes through their addiction. But then in their description of their addiction, people who aren't poets and artists start getting this feeling of like, wow. Maybe if I start fucking mainlining like burrows, that'll push my career to the next level and then they're fucking just nodding out and fucking an alley in Philadelphia. Yeah, the delusion, the delusion of grandeur with addiction and everything. Like when I was drinking, I thought I was rust coal from True Detective. You know, I thought I was like this deep like, you know, every time I talked, I thought, you know, my soundtrack was a Marshall Tucker band song. Just, you know, like, but in reality, I'm waking up in piles of garbage on the street, like literally waking up in a gutter, like surrounded by glass because I couldn't open the beer bottle. I had to smash it. And it's like, buddy, what are you doing? You know, oh, God, dammit. And that's fucked up, man. That mean, but it, you know, that I do like that grant that thing you're talking about when I was addicted to ketamine. That was I was like making music. And I'm like, this has got to be the best fucking music. Anyone? Oh, yeah. And then you go back and you play it back and it sounds like a robot short circuiting, you're like, what am I doing? Yeah, you know, it's it's like, yeah, chemical narcissism is just embarrassing. And then, you know, when as comics and artists, we understand the rough draft, you know what I mean? We understand that the final thing that people are saying or seeing, it's a magic trick if you're good, if you're, if you're good enough to get up on stage and make it seem like, you know, it's just what coming flowing out of me. Naturally, I didn't spend a year, two years developing this fucking joke, eating fucking shit, trying to get this joke to work. No, I just off the cuff. It's, you know, it's here, this, these fucking addict poets, they do the same goddamn thing, which is it's like probably the initial scrawl that they write, you know, it's covered in their puke or like the blood dripping out their nose from doing blow is garbage. And then somehow they have the fucking discipline in the midst of their addiction to refine and refine and refine till you get this beautiful final product. And that is any idiot reads that and is like, wow, I could do that. I mean, we have something in common. We both love booze. So I mean, I'm halfway to being Charles Bacowski, right? I'm almost there. But it's just not the case. You don't need to get fucked up to make good art. I mean, it's, it's funny, man. I like I was home visiting my mom and I felt like an old journal I wrote in when I was living in a farmhouse in Delaware drinking my face off. You know, I was a carpenter and everything. And I found in this journal that I'd write in when I was drunk. I want to be a comedian in New York City. I want to be paid for writing. I want to be living off. I wish I could do stand up. You can if you just get sober. I can't drink, stop drinking, blah, blah. And I'm reading this and I'm like, oh my God, buddy, you're doing it. Like this was your dream actualized and, you know, what, what a way to be, you know, it's like my past self is meeting with my present self. And in a way, it's like I'm giving myself like a cosmic high five of like, dude, you're fucking doing it. You got sober, you know, your, your dream is actualized. And I have so many more things to do, but it's just a reminder. None of those things will be done if I'm not sober. It's like you found a message in a bottle to yourself that you threw out into the time ocean and just washed up onto your short. Totally. Wow. And I mean, we've talked about this before, but, you know, my dad wrote me letters before he left for work every morning and I found those and seeing them in hindsight and I never realized this. So sweet. Yeah, I mean, I'm so fortunate for that. You know, I never realized this until I reread them about maybe a year ago, but so many of his letters were like, just be yourself. You're such a wonderful person. We love when you're just Ian. Don't try to be anyone else but yourself. We love you no matter what. And it's like, I never knew that, never actualized it until I, I saw these like a year ago. I was like, wow, what, what a gift. What again, like a message in a bottle that I have received that's been floating in the ocean of my past for so many years, you know, how many letters? Oh my God. Duncan, I have stacks. I mean, I want to compile a book where I, you know, just transcribe them and because they're so beautiful and they're just, you know, they're like a recap from the day before just a reminder that I'm loved and, you know, things to look forward and he was such a like goofball, you know, there's like silly jokes on there and it's, it's just really beautiful that, that I have this, you know. Oh my God, you're so lucky. I like, you know, we're part of the generation that doesn't have our entire childhoods like digitized for us by our parents. Like my kids are going to like, there's not going to be a single day where there's some picture of like one of them covered in food and whatever. You know, it's like, like I, my, I was going through pictures the other day, like I have very few and except what's in my mind. And that's like supremely foggy, you know, I'm like, right now I'm working on a little writing project. And so it's part of that. I took a trip because I'm up here where I grew up. So I took a trip to, to like the city. I grew up and was like, you ever, do you ever do? Yeah. I mean, when I go back to Delaware, I always drive around my old haunts. I, dude, I, I drive back, I always drive back to the house I was born in, which was a couple blocks away from that farmhouse I was drinking myself to death in. Who's in that house now? I don't know. I stopped by years ago and, and you know, met the people that live there, but it's been turned over so many times. But yeah, I totally relate to that. So you went back to the city you grew up in? Well, yeah. And just tried to like make a little like, you know, there's just a, I just, having a kid now and like, you know, seeing the world through his eyes and, and then it's like teaching me a lot about, you know, like time and, and the way things change. And I don't know. It's just like, I went by this old house that like, it's old now, but when I was there, it was now it's all dilapidated and shit. It's like, you know, the, you know, when you're a kid, your driveway or what that little space that you were playing or whatever the thing was, it's, it's big. It's like, it's huge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it seems so like, I don't know, mystical or like, you know, but now I drove up there, this fucking house, man, it's spooky now. Like that it's completely dilapidated. The driveway is like overgrown. Like, like grass is just growing out of it. It's the whole place is fucking crumbling. And I was like, oh, cool. It's abandoned now. Like maybe I could like sneak in through a window or something like that and really go nuts and just, but so I pull my car up and some fucking big dogs in the window like, you can never go back. You can't return. But like, you know, to me, that's kind of the, when you're talking about your relationship and this, this desire to connect with yourself as a child. And you know what I mean? There, there's something so poignant in the impossibility of that endeavor in certain ways. In other ways, you definitely can, you still are that kid. It doesn't go anywhere. But I mean, the physical, the set, the stage that you grew up on and all the, all the, all the people who are on that stage, for me, they're all dead. Most of them are dead. They're all gone. So it's like, there's just something very incredibly poignant and intense about that quality, the continuum of self. I mean, and also not just the people that you knew were gone. You're gone. The you, you knew were gone. The drunk Ian in the fucking farmhouse. Who's that? What happened to that person? Like gone. Like that person is, is for all intents and purposes, right? Gone, gone, right? That, that might as well have been as a past incarnation. Totally. I mean, I could access him again. I could go back to that. But why would I ever want to go back to that? You know, I look at pictures of who I was and I'm like, who is that guy? Like, I can't believe that that guy like existed and, and I'm grateful he existed. I learned a lot from him, you know, years ago, me, I used to work at a sober living house and me and two of my buddies, the therapist there, we would, she was like our therapist and everything. And we did a group session where we were supposed to talk to our chat, our inner child. And, uh, dude, I froze up and stormed out of the session. For years, I, I could not access that kid that was so hurt and, you know, just completely shattered and traumatized from everything. I couldn't talk to him. I couldn't look at him and, uh, to be able to access him and go back and like comfort him and have him realized and, and let him be a part of me now is like such a gift, you know, um, because I did have so much joy as a kid and then it, you know, all went away. So anytime I experienced like just pure unfiltered joy, a part of me is like, hell, yeah, a little dude, that's for you, you know? Yeah. I want to thank Upstart for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Here's a sad story. Once when I was in college, uh, I applied for a credit card, uh, and I actually somehow got the credit card, which I thought was super funny. And then I started using the credit card for just dumb shit. Like calling my girlfriend from Washington, DC on a pay phone using the credit card. The whole thing seemed like a novel experience to me and because at the time I was fairly certain that I wouldn't live through college, I had no intention of paying it back. Sorry for the really long rambling story over. The point is I ended up with this like hellish toxic credit card debt. And it got to the point when I was in Los Angeles where this credit card company would call me like every four minutes asking for the, uh, money that I owed them. Also my credit score and my IQ ended up being the same number. The point is I wish that I'd had Upstart to deal with that rotten debt.

If you ever, do you ever think you'll have kids? You know, it's funny. For me, I really didn't want kids for a long time and this past year put a lot in perspective and in August of last year, it was a very real possibility and that ended up not happening. Yeah, I read your post about that, man. That took a lot of guts to post about going through that. I'm sorry. I don't know if it's okay to mention that on the podcast. I also think with everything that's happening in Texas, it is 100% a woman's issue, but I think it's important for men to also speak up because it does affect them in a way. I very much had this weird come to Jesus moment where it was kind of up in the air whether or not we were going to have an abortion and I came to a level of acceptance where I was like, okay, I'll be a dad. I felt this calm and then she said, we're not going to have it. I said, okay. Something shifted in me and I do think, I see you as a father and I'm like, that is the coolest thing in the world and especially looking at your age and everything you've accomplished and gone through, you didn't have kids young. Had children older and you have so much more to give them in your years that you've been on earth rather than you would have if you were younger. I would like to have kids in a family when I'm fully prepared and I would like to do that within the decade. No timeline. Maybe it won't happen. We've already talked about it and she definitely doesn't want to have kids until she's kind of into her 30s a bit and that for me is a sigh of relief because again in my past relationship it was, I want this by this time this, the clock is ticking and I'm like, oh, God, too much. Fuck that. That sucks, the ticking clock people. That sucks. That kind of pressure is so fucked up. You should never have a kid unless you really want to have a kid. That's when you have a kid. This thing of bringing a kid into the world when that's not what you want to do. And when you put a timeline on it, you are starting to paint yourself into a corner where if I don't have everything done by then, the last thing I want to do is to not be able to dedicate myself entirely to my family and I know right now I can't do that and I know that I have a lot more things I want to accomplish and at the same time I want to be able to take care of my family monetarily and right now I'm fortunate I'm in a position where I can very well take care of myself but I don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars that I'll have to put towards my child and their education and everything like that. Yeah, no, you need, it's fucking expensive, man. Having kids is fucking expensive and I don't care. Like you have to cross this abyss. It's truly like sometimes in magical circles they talk about this thing crossing the abyss and there's a lot of different definitions but one of the abysses you have to cross is the abyss of selfishness and you might not want to admit, people might not want to admit they're fucking selfish but when you have a kid, it's like you see it. The selfishness becomes as clear as mud on a spotlight and you just see it, it's like vivid and I don't know if I'll ever get rid of my fucking selfishness but the crossing the abyss part is you have to start letting go of all the self-centeredness that you can. You have to just really figure out a way to jettison that shit or you're going to be waking up at night, gritting your teeth, feeling regret and thinking like God, if I didn't have fucking kids I could be sitting on the couch blowing rails academy and playing God of War. It's this weird collision of worlds of letting go and acceptance at the same time and the balance between the two and I, last night we ordered soup dumplings and watched capturing the freedments and it's like I don't know if I could do that if I had a kid you know. No, no you can't. That's the thing like you can't like you are you're like we we've gone out to eat this week we went out to eat twice. The first time we went out to eat ended up in the emergency room because forest has allergies and my and like I ended up like making I got an ice cream maker made a big vat of ice cream but didn't cook the eggs enough he's allergic to egg whites and so like right before we leave to eat I'm like have some ice cream he eats the ice cream he's fine it's no but when you have a kid with allergies it's like it's not the emergency room becomes a little less intense they're used to it but you basically like you have to we've only had to do it twice in two years but you have to epi-pin the kid and then no matter what if you do that you have to take him to the hospital for observation just to be super oh yeah he's fine he's totally fine thank you for asking but I'm just saying that's that's that night and then the second night uh the baby sitter was just texting because the youngest one just we didn't like she came after he'd fallen asleep and so he's crying for milk and she goes in and picks him up and he's like who the fuck are you and it's just like screaming so then we thought oh god we're gonna have to go home twice in a row here which is no big deal but I'm just saying like the type of flex that you learn a kind of flexibility where it's like you have to just be in the moment moving with things as they're happening I think it's a great thing to learn and I'm really glad that I have learned it but yeah the whole dumpling fantasy and all that stuff it's gonna go on hiatus I mean bro I was just in Vegas for a week and when I came back my cat was like wildly vocal when he saw me and after a certain point I'm like okay is he excited to see me or does he have a UTI that I don't know about what's going on I could not imagine that happening with a child like I could not imagine you know my cat's like whining and I'm like oh god did he hurt his paw I couldn't imagine a baby crying and trying to decipher what is going on right yeah yeah right and like it's it's a it's a it's truly you know someone like me who has like some of the most profoundly selfish tendencies on earth it's a wonderful it's a wonderful gift because it like it's it's it's truly like rehabilitation for selfishness but but yeah don't don't I guess that one the essence of the thing is yeah you're totally right don't you when you have a kid when you're like ready to like step into a forge of the universe and get your fucking hair blazed off by like the primordial thrust of uh sentience into this dimension otherwise just fucking guilt-free dumplings movies of fucking non-stop we're going to the beach this weekend you know it's like I'm going to the beach this weekend I'm actually we're pulling this off because the mother or my mother-in-law's in town she's gonna be with the kids but let me tell you we might be oh no that's you know what I mean you're gonna go to the beach and you don't know nothing you're not gonna get a call it's like your fucking cat UTI has come back again yeah you know what I mean but yes that's the difference in our beach trips I'm at some point I'm gonna be consoling Erin who will probably be crying because she's missing being with the the kids because she's I mean that's what Olivia's gonna do to me about my cat you know because he is my son so you know I was well I years ago I was supposed to get a vasectomy I was like so dead sad no kids and I have chronic epididymitis and so my epidid it's the epididymis swells and becomes inflamed that's like the tube that connects your testicle to your urethra for the sperm to travel through okay so mine gets inflamed and actually recently I was like a last-ditch effort with my urologist he was like look I'm gonna give you these the you have to take these pain shots in your spine and if that doesn't eliminate the pain you have to get your epididymis removed which means you can't have kids pop up pop so I get these shots in my spine every six months to a year and it it fixed the pain which is great but I was I had my two consultations for the vasectomy and we had scheduled when it was going to be and then my epididymis my epididymitis cropped up and they were like oh we have to push it back and I was like maybe that's a sign from God I'm not gonna do it you know and thank God yeah yeah yeah don't I was I think after our second kid we were kind of talking about you know maybe maybe we'll just like maybe maybe but I didn't know so I think we're talking about if we have another one we'll do that but I don't want to do that ever like I don't I don't want to do that I think there is something really I mean it is insane that humans are able to even reproduce that it's the most to me it's the most ridiculous thing fucking to make a baby well the process is ridiculous you know you're just keeping yourself on someone just yeah but it sounds like you know when you think about God or if you want to believe in God or want to play around with like well we can kind of understand God from the way the universe works God is like a baby like it's like baby logic you know what I mean you push you push into you mash and then she will grow in her stomach another one will come she make your baby oh do you open the bell no you push out your pee pee oh okay yeah okay God I guess we'll do it whatever you say but you know I mean there's nothing it's the it's it's the most bizarre thing when when I'm like in forest we feel like he kind of understands it not the the fucking part but like he knows he was in my wife's stomach somehow and every once in a while he'll be like the other day he goes gonna go back in your vagina that'd be he goes gonna go back in your vagina that'd be cute oh my god he's putting on goggles what are you doing get ready to go back in the vagina you ain't going back yeah there's no there's there's no way I mean that that's the that's the other crazy thing about this flow of time that we're in right man there's it's just like we're you you you you don't there's no way other than like great therapy hypnosis to really go back man we're like atrophying you know what I mean if you let me ask you this if you started to contend maybe this is just me but if you started to contend with how quickly time is going by and if you if you started doing that math of like fuck man like based on how quickly I'm experiencing the flow of time like I'm gonna be 70 before I can blink twice you know if you started working with that or just time flow by to normal I feel like it it's this weird thing like when I look back on my life I it seems so long and all the lives I've lived are just so I can't believe I've gotten to experience so many different things in one lifetime and I have so much more of a lifetime to go and at the same time it seems as if it's been going by it's coming at me quickly but it's passing behind me so slowly if that makes sense and then I think in comparison to like I've been alive for 36 years and it it's felt yeah like a slog and just with so many different things that have happened and then I compare that to someone who's been imprisoned for that period of time where they have almost the same experience day in and day out yeah how long that must feel to them yeah like time is just so relative depending on your situation and whenever I think of someone that's been imprisoned for like 25 years I'm just like that I cannot imagine their concept of time as compared to ours oh oh it's a brutality I mean it's so weird that like there's a you know no cruel and unusual punishment but you're allowed to take a sentient creature put it in a lock them up for a lot and just say you'll never come out and somehow that's not cruel and unusual if you heard there's you know it's people like theorize about the future of psychoactive chemicals and the more we understand the human brain the more we can manipulate it have you heard the theory that they're going to be able to inject you with a prison sentence where instead of having to put you in prison for 50 years they can inject you with a drug that gives you the experience of 50 years but it only takes like an hour if you heard that yeah pharmaceutical like prison sentences saves a lot of money not such a but at the end of your like or like you know there's other ways is there is there a right to inject them with rehabilitative care you know to like to fix the synapses in the brain that makes them want to commit crime well isn't the idea though like part of the punishment is like you know whenever you're watching the court shows and shit it's like in the asshole finally gets the prison sentence it's the families are like finally justice has been served like it's a it's something that's supposed to bring balance to the families or right or wrong or something like that so no one really wants rehabilitation you know someone kills your fucking mom you you're like oh great did you get rehabilitated right i mean would justice not be uh you know reversing who this person is and and making them contribute a good to society wouldn't that be the true justice if they were rehabilitated to then do good within the world i think it depends on the culture it's like some people want them to hurt i mean you know this is like one of the weirdest theories of what we are or where we're at is like you know this is prison we're in a we're in and we committed some crime in in whatever we were before we were born we did some insanely horrific fucking thing and as punishment we've been sentenced to a human incarnation where there is the quality of rehabilitation that's happening i mean you look at your yourself in the in the in the barn getting fucking hammered are you on the street the old ian versus you now you can see there's a trend that's happening where you're you know evolving into a better and better person not just that part of you but career-wise and everything you're becoming sweeter your other people are like inspired by you any addict listening to this who's still in the fucking barn you know they take they're they're probably going to be a little inspired the point is yeah the idea is like yeah no we you did get injected we were in some futuristic society you probably who knows what the fuck you did man you like who knows maybe you like threw someone off a building or i don't know like jerked off onto a sleeping space emperor i don't know i don't know if that's a crime i don't even know if that's a crime in the future but the point better not be because if that's the case they're gonna lock me up i just love jerking off on sleeping emperors come on don't make me sorry your honor i never gotten to sports i mean i yeah it's i i have i am fortunate in that i have actively taken the reins of giving myself rehabilitative care and yeah i you know um i just like in in terms of of prisoners like nobody wants i mean look there there's this push to release nonviolent drug offenders nonviolent crimes and just release them which is like okay but at the same time these people have had to adjust and adapt themselves to a universe we couldn't even fathom as a means of survival right so yeah you may have gone to jail at 19 for a nonviolent drug crime but after 15 years you're coming out with a cosmic psychic change in your brain of how you deal with the world around you and to just release you into society without rehabilitative care without some sort of step down into the world in which is not the same that you've been living in is only going to create chaos in the world that we exist in with rules and laws and certain acceptable behaviors so it's like yes release these people but at the same time give them the care that they need so that they don't just act like the animals that they've had to adapt into being for survival in this prison world you know and and people i don't understand how that's not a full conversation that's at the forefront of this releasing prisoners into society you can't just release people and and say well they'll be fine it's like that's a that's a very traumatic change in their life you know yeah yeah yeah man i mean you you're running into the lobbyist you're running into the for-profit prison lobbyists who number one are like are you fucking kidding we can't release them that's like you know what i mean every prisoner that we have we're gonna make so much money every year you know you're making you're cutting you're making a great profit off of every non especially the nonviolent offenders because you know you get like a sociopath and there's some kind of violent brutal person then you're gonna have to pay for the medical care for everybody they fuck up and whatever good you get a nice nonviolent weed dealer oh my god that's a payday plop them down in the cell and just juice them for as long as you can those lobbyists man they don't want to release them and then the other part of it is like the the expense it would cost to rehabilitate them i mean this whole prison is a rehabilitation thing is insane in america like it's a total lie and what's happening now with the bail reform in new york city and other other cities is it's just a revolving door i mean you get arrested you get a death ticket you're out that night and they're finding that the more catcher and release they're doing each time the more and more violent the crime is that they're committing you know i mean this guy was uh in the subways punching women and they couldn't lock him up because it was a misdemeanor assault rather than because he didn't steal from them they couldn't arrest him on a felony so because it was misdemeanors they kept letting him out he just kept punching random women and you know it i don't understand how that is supposed to help society you know and would it not give more jobs for people to work in you know rehabilitation centers and and to give continuing care to these people that are hurting and sick mentally and emotionally that need help stepping back into society you know and and also at the same time you know like i don't know if i believe in the concept of of a physical heaven or hell i i think for me i believe in the concept of heaven and hell is how we spend our time on earth and if if you are locked in a cage for you know 35 years that is hell you're in hell you can make it heavenly in a way but you have to have a strong constitution you know and oh yeah i've been in hell i've lived in hell and now i am finding my own heaven that exists wherever i go you know and i i you know i i just feel for these people so much hell is density right like it's like the you know i do believe in hell and i do believe in heaven and and i the where i get that from is not some like faith-based thing but it's like rooted in this concept of as above so below or like like so so when you're like the idea is like you know you see the way of apple falls from the tree and from that you can understand the way planets move through the solar system similarly you look at these like qualities of like existence that happen to people and and you imagine like like i guess it's like what predicates the line of thought is like you have to imagine that we're not annihilated when we die but if we're not annihilated when we die we're living in an infinite universe then it's like oh i what would be worse than prison what's the next step down from prison and so in like buddhism you what you get is like really weirdly similar to the christian hell which you're essentially being like boiled in cauldrons for like hundreds of human lifespans but you're not it's not permanent like there you can all it's nothing's permanent so you you do you can eventually like yeah actually yeah yeah but the though if you look at it purely as just like a metaphor or whatever it to me it just represents increasing levels of density it's like you know you start off and you're scared as shit you're in your in or whatever the things going on with you that you're so scared that you numb down so once you're numb down you feel like it's okay to go around punching women or robbing people or doing whatever the fuck it is and so then that state gets mirrored by you in a dense ass fucking prison cell surrounded by other numb down people who are all feeding off of each other creating this kind of fucked up resonance which is then densifying things even more so just what you're saying you get the fuck out and it's not like you're rehabilitated you just become better at being dense and then that's why there's this incredible recidivism rate you know which is like of course they're gonna go back and that's what they want recidivism rate is a direct result of you the card stacked up against you where you can't work you can't exist without you know almost like leading yourself back into a life of crime so that you can't exist right yeah use harder to get a job you can't fucking vote you're like you know good luck getting a fucking job man like you know what i mean like people are hiring it's like oh really you were what you're in prison for fucking you're the dude who is punching women on the fucking subway fuck you no i've gotten better i don't do you have fuck you i don't care if you have gotten better so hard to get a job with a college degree right now let alone leaving prison yeah with like your go-to behavioral trait is punching women like good fucking luck yeah that's now you don't put that in your resume but like you but you know i'm great at punching women at mid-nurse subway if you need that but to me when you look at that quality of our society with all the advanced shit we've got and we're still doing medieval yeah we just throw you in a room with bars in front of it for a certain amount of time that's that's that's just what we do we do the same shit king george was fucking doing with maybe like maybe better accommodations you know you're not having to like compete with rats when you're eating or whatever but even essentially yes for long-term throwing people in a cage but also you know if you get arrested and you're locked up for 24 hours you're not making your job the next day you're not calling out you're just fucking no showing and then you lose your job you don't got money so it's like yeah let me come into crime real quick to fucking you know pay my rent get back on my feet and then boom you're back in jail it's a feedback loop i mean so what do you i mean what like i've looked at i've seen documentaries on some of like the like i think Norwegian prisons you know what i mean and they look more like dorm rooms they are it is based on rehabilitation i mean if you if you treat people like humans they're more prone to act in a human way like when i was teaching and i treated my kids like adults they acted in a mature adult way when you treat people yeah as if they are the bane of society well what do you expect they're gonna act like fucking jerk offs dude this is we have this right now we're working with like a pretty awesome nanny and she's like uh you know she's of the school of working with kids where you don't baby talk it doesn't matter if they eight months old you talk to them like a person because you know a lot of times when you're seeing like these kids who are um you know toddlers but they're still like kind of babbling sometimes sometimes that's happening because their parents have just been baby talking them and that's what they've been hearing so it's like it's a feedback loop of baby talk by the way i don't know how you don't fucking baby talk these things they're so god damn cute all you want to do is balance you know yeah there's a balance yeah but it's like the same situation if we're prison talking our inmates and via like all the other inmates who are like you know terrifying them or shaking them down or forcing them to like choose gangs or whatever the fuck happens based on my viewing of locked up you know i don't know anything about prison either i know i know right we're just talking about our ass dude one time i used to love locked up wrong one time i i had to check over and i put it on and we're like making out and while we're making out i hear like any keister stashed a nine inch blade and i'm like you know trying to undo her pants i'm like maybe i should turn this off yeah yeah you should i mean yeah my wife and i fucked a shan hanity and it's like i don't know it's fucked up you know like what are you gonna do stop and like turn the tv off no if you're in the passion of the moment you just you just deal with it but look i what would you do i mean if you let's say you and i get to design our own fucking prison the goal rehabilitation what what do we do when we get someone in there who just like was robbing a convenience store and just blew someone's face off to get $100 what do you what would you do what would you do i mean first of all like you just said the new regent system of like dorms when you set someone up in like an esteemable environment they start to act in esteemable in esteemable ways you know so set them up in a you know not like you know giving them a recliner in a fucking flat screen but just like you know not putting them on a steel bench you know and making them cook food over a toilet you know what i mean like giving them an environment that makes them feel human in a way i mean look there's a difference between like you can't excuse blowing someone's head off for a hundred bucks and being like let's rehabilitate you know that's going to take a lot but i think having like a strong uh what about a million bucks well then who wouldn't do that you know but but like uh you know having a therapeutic environment having good psychological care having you know um and you also at the same time have to incentivize people going to that field these people should be getting paid a lot more money you know like doctors and and psychiatrists and therapists and social workers should be getting paid a lot more to work in these environments to try to help rehabilitate these people through therapeutic care through workshops through exercising through different means of light and also not only should this be happening in prison this should be happening outside of prison you know okay all right listen your prison i don't like it my prison here's what we do you're fucking commish okay you you're okay look i'm i'm not putting my fucking you have your little like whatever it is dorm rooms and you can have your fucking saturday movie nights with your to your team of murders here's what i do my murderer what i do is i use my neuro downlink to scan the brain residue of the person they shot reassemble all of their memories and then i place my karma helmet on this person and i force them to live the person they murdered's life over and over and over again uh experiencing the person's terror and fear when they're dying for like a hundred straight incarnations and then i take the helmet off and i and i and and i don't know then then i send them to your prison you know what i mean but make them experience like you know that's the if we just don't have the fucking technology if we had the technology where you could induce in a person the experience not just the experience of getting murdered by themselves but all of the love and joy the person felt and at the same time experience the loss of their family and loved ones feel yes exactly they have to experience it and and and then like they have to experience it many many many times like a like an empathy neuralizer yeah man an empathy fucking neuralizer i send it to you to a hundred lifetimes of the person you murdered you're going to do everything they did think everything they thought and it's always going to end with you fucking murdering yourself but you won't know it's you because you're going to be in another person now it's i i now now court adjourn my name is professor mong now come lay down in ian's lazy boy prison recliner there's massage buttons and your feet get a pedicure or yeah you're fucking sharper image prison over there with your fucking prisoners getting like god damn heating blankets and fucking nice sips of chrysanthemum tea i'm sorry you yeah yeah yeah oh did you get beat as a little boy and because of your trauma you re-enacted that as an adult have some prosciutto wrapped melons but you look man i'm telling you i love playing around with like when when i am experiencing suffering especially suffering that is based on my past decisions which is most suffering i like to imagine that i'm like that in that suffering there's some redemptive quality happening there's like a purification happening you know what i mean instead of like going victim i whenever i look at i'm like i actively decided i made the choice i did the activity that brought me to this place and so any kind of horror or suffering i'm experiencing is really just the universe functioning perfectly it is a kind of prison sentence you know it is a kind of uh it is there is a true justice accepting the actions the consequences of your actions yeah yeah that's it i mean there's something so liberating about that the moment you do that instead of like you know imagining that like someone else is to blame right well it goes back to that thing we said about the balance between letting go and acceptance and also having the mental fortitude to look in the mirror and realize your role in the experience that occurred rather than just pushing blame like going oh that's me oh i did that oh i can now make a change based off what i did that was negative you know instead of just going oh it was them i always this always happens to me blah blah blah yeah man because yeah because like if we are in some kind of celestial cosmic hyperdimensional futuristic prison and i know i were here you know i were here jerked off on the space emperor's face and i'll do it again keep doing that you kind of don't say that sorry you're gonna give me the help at the helmet i'm just but you know if you were if like if you do play around with that idea that that is what human incarnation is a prison for the soul then and but if we were running a prison then and you and you and prisoners did start taking responsibility for their actions prison prisoners did start exhibiting traits of people who were no longer blaming the world for their behavior but taking responsibility becoming autonomous then you would you know you would feel like your prison was working and they would be one step closer to maybe being let out right you know so i'm just saying if that's what this is then working with no longer blaming other things for your shit and working with gratitude if there is some cosmic celestial jailkeeper out there watching everything you do then that's probably what they're looking for right i mean is the celestial jailkeeper watching what you do just our consciousness well yeah i mean i'd say use whatever model works i mean like if the you know in the the end of the oh god i hate it i'm gonna say that at the end of the fucking day and the older you goddamn get the more like when you the math simplifies the point where it's like well it seems like the more you can help people like it seems like basically just try to be try not to hurt it's like what the dialogue has said if you can help help if you can't help don't hurt you know what i mean it starts so so i love that you know whatever model gets you to that point whether you want to do like it's just my consciousness and that's all i need or whether you want to invent some kind of like weirdo hyperdimensional prison fucking guard or whatever you you i just say use your own model it whatever whatever works to like inspire you to become like a better part of whatever your community you know i don't know it could be your consciousness you could you could imagine it's a little slug that lives at the end of a rainbow i don't know what i mean like you you pick the fucking symbol but but the mail but what's what matters is not so much the symbol as much as like oh yeah this gets me this pushes me out of my patterns that inevitably result me hurting myself or other people right and recognizing those patterns and trying to you know when you put your head down on the pillow at night trying to have done everything you could today to make the mistakes of yesterday make you have a better tomorrow yeah yeah that's it that's it you know there's a buddhist teacher who says something like that uh something along the lines of like oh are you feeling guilty of some shit you did to someone or whatever whatever whatever whatever something in the past then that that guilt is pretty useless it's definitely not helping them uh if they're still alive uh they don't know that you're guilty and it's it's definitely not fucking helping you but if you really want to um if you if you really want to make something of the bad shit you did then going forward do the opposite of that like bring them into your you know bring them into your consciousness in your life not through like some residual guilt but through like no longer letting your anger right like self-readjust anger gets you nowhere you know like that's why the internet's so toxic which is just this fucking loop of anger and outrage that you know influence us and our behavior and when you unplug from that you realize things aren't as bad as they seem like the world is a pretty cool fucking place yeah no yeah man like god i think there is a i mean i i'm fantasizing there's a collective realization of like wait i don't have to look at twitter anymore like i don't have to like look at that i don't have to engage with that at all i don't need to get an into it with people out there who are you know who the fuck knows who they are anyway like 18 like 20 of them are thoughts total you know 40 of them are like 12 year olds you know 30 of them are like completely and 99 of them would be more forgiving to you know a violent offender than someone that said the wrong thing that they want to keep bringing up to bring them down over and over yeah yeah and and the and the energy behind it is weirdly similar to like the same energy of the people doing fucked up shit you know what i mean like like we make prisoners do community service but if you're actively outraged online all the time you should then have to do community you should only be allowed to be outraged if you have actively tried to physically help your community in some way you get an outrage yeah you can do one you just did 15 hours of service in your community going around giving masks to people who need them educating people about vaccines whatever the fucking thing is you just did 15 hours of service now you're allowed you know what you know who's allowed to fucking do it who's allowed to put people on blast goddamn doctors you know what i mean those if you want to fucking if you're a doctor out there you can put people on blast my well i my family's friends with a doctor and it's just like it's fucked it's they're just like well you know like we have and i you know i actually when i got covid recently i had been getting fed up with a goddamn perturbed nurse meme you know what i mean the stories from nurses being like you don't understand and i'm like this can't be real and and then the nurse who is coming in to give me my fucking IV drips of zinc and nad and all the all this like all this great shit that i think really helped me get over covid she worked in a maternity ward uh a covid maternity ward that's fun for pregnant women who are coming in with covid and you know these people as she's talking to me i'm looking at her listening to her recognizing like you are i didn't say it why would you but no one needs to say you are severely traumatized you are going to be traumatized probably for the rest of your life but like you're a war it's a war veteran but what she's saying casually is she's like stringing up my freaking illuminani fucking IV drip and vitamins and shit and she's like yeah we keep a kit in front of the rooms of the pregnant mothers who have covid because we have to go in there when they die and cut their stomach open to get the baby out you know like what you know like to me i think those people they are justified in putting people on blast because they're just like yeah they get an outrage token but unless you're doing that unless you're like in the covid wards cutting babies out of but even then maybe that's not the point though because it goes back to the rehabilitation idea it's like how much is the fucking outrage creating the change you want to see in the world right like is it effective that's the big question like does it work i know it doesn't work for me when i'm getting put on blast by somebody i just dig my heels hate and anger is never effective that's why like this whole narrative for the past four fucking years of like turn your back on your family tell your friends that they're racist do this and that it's like you get more flies with honey like why are we throwing vinegar on everything when we should be having loving conversations where we're understanding the other side because then you can inject some form of knowledge or understanding to make someone tweak their their view of how they weren't seeing it before dude this is what i love about my recovered attic friends is they are the least judgmental when they recognize that you're like drinking too much or when you tell them like man i'm fucking hooked on this thing you don't get the judgment you don't get the thing because they've all been there and they understand the dynamic of it and there's this like real deep compassion and empathy and love that isn't because like most recovered addicts every recovered addict i've met they've just you know they understand well i'm not i can't save you like there's nothing i can do you're gonna keep doing your thing until you what do they say until you die or go to jail right that's what they say and it is right you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it stop doing heroin but it's a great poet my god that fucking horse it's like you should read that horse's poetry beautiful beautiful heroin horse poetry i mean that's why they call it being on the horse yeah yeah man i but it's like i think like you know there there's something to be said for this like being pragmatic when it comes to you know your goals like it's like and i think a lot of folks out there are really afraid and i get you know fear turns into anger and that's the toxic shit that we're seeing online is just terrified very scared people who are like really going through it and so that you know the fear translates into like the shit that we're railing against right now but like it yeah i think like you know the there's something jack cornfield this buddhist teacher says that i really love which is which is if you're gonna save the planet save it because we love it save you know what i mean like if you're gonna save something do it because you love it if you want to save a person if you want like to love them first and then save lead with love you know but don't hate them yeah yeah or try even try to lead with love because like how do we try to and and that love starts with gratitude really yeah how can yeah it starts with love without gratitude you know and i know for me like in my experience anytime anyone was like stop drinking look what you're doing you got to stop it made me want to show up at their doorstep with a bottle of vodka and be like oh you want me to stop how's this i'll stop when i'm done this fucking bottle you know and and yes you know a saying in the recovery community is attraction not promotion you know like what does that mean attraction not promotion like make your life attractive rather than promoting what you've done like you know when when a a was founded by by bill wilson and dr bob dr bob was a hopeless drunk and everyone was telling him you know you need to stop you need to do this you need to do that and when bill wilson visited him in the hospital room he said i'm not here for you i'm here for me and he shared his experience and it was the first person that never he didn't tell him what to do he told him what he did and what worked for him and how he was and he made that attractive to dr bob and that they you know formed a way of recovery that was different than what was existing at the time that's brilliant man attraction instead of promotion yeah that's that you know a lot of people who get into spirituality they get they become these like it's very sweet and i get it they become these promoters of the thing so like they're always giving ear beatings i was one of them where they're blah blah anyone unsolicited fucking ear beatings left and right but but when you meet people who are you've really been like working on themselves for a long time that is gone in fact they barely ever talk they don't talk about like you there there isn't much of a conversation about it they're not promoting it but you look at them and you're like how are you like this how are you so full of love and how is it that whenever i'm around you like i feel like inspired and reminded of my own potential and like you know what what is that and then you ask them and then maybe they'll talk to you a little bit about it but they're no no one's ever been convinced by hearing you should you know you're more likely to convince someone by saying i did you know yeah man i may and maybe there's like you know yeah yeah maybe maybe there's something like someone in my family is is like struggling with a late turn like somebody's like deep in heroin and it's like there's no like i don't see how there's any hope at all and for her for her and like you like all that it's like it wrecks a fucking family and the spat of it is when you're going through it you think you're the only one that you're hurting you can't that the effects of it yeah man you don't realize you're like rippling out to people you don't even fucking know kids you don't even fucking know but that's still not gonna make you change that's the problem i you know even that it's like but i don't know maybe something about when you're around addicts is like some of them it's not like they pity you or it's not like but they do look at you like i don't know if you'll stay alive a lot of us don't like a lot of addicts they don't stay they don't you know that man a lot of people just don't make it out out of it but it's like you know going to someone who's that imploded or cratered and then grabbing them and shaking them sure as fuck isn't gonna do anything i guess that's the bottom line you gotta lead with love you know and and a lot of people are addicts and alcoholics because they feel no love you know and they feel no love with him himself yeah and and so they keep repeating the behavior because it's the escape from the fact that they have no love but how do you exhibit love towards someone who is like stolen from you hurt you fucked up your family multiple times lied to you how do you show love to that at a certain point you can love as best you can and then you need to learn to love from a distance and sometimes it gets to the point where the most loving thing you can do is to shut them shut them out you know like the most loving thing you can do is you know like with with my ex the most loving thing i can do because she refuses help and will never recognize that she has this issue the most loving thing i can do is to never contact her again you know and learning to love from a distance and and you know what sometimes people don't get it but love is a fluid the definition of love is fluid it takes on many different forms and you know you can love someone through a hug you can love someone through action or you can love someone from a distance and sometimes when people just don't get it you backing off is a form of love because it shows them just how you know dark and bleak things can get without having a support system yeah fuck well ian i'm gonna go jerk off on a space emperor's face i am so grateful i'm grateful to you i love these conversations i'm so happy for you we didn't get to talk about your stand up but god damn you are kicking ass right now man and it's like when we

Hello, Omote of Divine Consciousness, temporarily trapped in a super advanced bio computer. It's me, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Hello. What do you say we go really deep right away with a reading from Chogyam Trumper? The basic problem we seem to be facing is that we are too involved with trying to prove something which is connected with paranoia and the feeling of poverty. When you are trying to prove or get something, you are not open anymore. You have to check everything. You have to arrange it correctly. It is such a paranoid way to live and it really does not prove anything. One might set records in terms of numbers and quantities that we have built the greatest, the biggest, we've collected the most, the longest, the most gigantic. But who is going to remember the record when you are dead or in 100 years or in 10 years or in 10 minutes? The records that count are those of the given moment of now, whether or not communication and openness are actually taking place now. This is the open way, the Bodhisattva path. A Bodhisattva would not care even if he received a medal from all the Buddhas proclaiming him the bravest Bodhisattva in the entire universe. He would not care at all. He never read stories of the Bodhisattvas receiving medals and the sacred writings and quite rightly so because there is no need for them to prove anything. The Bodhisattvas action is spontaneous. It is the open life, open communication which does not involve struggle or speed at all. That's from the book cutting through spiritual materialism and it seems to be pointing in the direction of some insane state of consciousness that you could develop where you're no longer concerned in any way at all with anything other than the exact moment that is happening and that's where you live. Crazy idea. Whereas most of us are spending every single second completely worried over what this person is going to think about us, whether or not we are going to get the accolades we deserve, do our friends respect us? I remember hearing a comedian once say, the most important thing to me was the respect of my peers. Imagine that, that's the most important thing for a lot of people, naturally. The part of your brain that processes rejection is the same part of your brain that processes physical pain. The implication being that there's nothing worse if you're in a tribe than to get excommunicated from the tribe, to get kicked out. I mean, shit, have you seen that show on prairie dogs? I think it's prairie dogs, the cute little guys, the guys who sit in their strange burrows and look out and man, this documentary is so dramatic because one of these prairie dogs got kicked out. He didn't do the right thing, he wasn't being a good enough prairie dog. He failed as a prairie dog and was outcast and sort of sent into the wilderness without the protection of his friends, doomed to wander alone in the great wilderness and where a prairie dog is a sandwich on the legs. So for this prairie dog, it was a very dangerous situation he got in by being a failed prairie dog or maybe being too much of an individual. And I think that's why everybody secretly feels mortified at the concept of people you know talking about you behind your back or the negative opinions of people that you know. And many people struggle under this invisible and terrible gravity, the constant, never ending consideration of how you are perceived by your friends and your family. And if that's where you're at, you can't be in the present moment. You're existing in some kind of other strata of experience. You're existing in a strata of experience where it sort of sits above the present moment like a callus, that's where you're living. It's a more controllable place. It's terrifying to dabble in the present moment because the present moment is not the washed out, boring, yawn-inducing, mundane kind of peaceful bullshit that you might imagine it is based on contact you've come into with certain spiritual writings. It's easy to think the present moment is where you go when you get old. You sit and watch the birds and a little rivulet of drool runs down the side of your mouth and that's the present moment, a kind of numb, bored, yawning state. But the real present moment is something so catastrophic and terrifying and creative all at the same time that most people spend all of their energy desperately trying to avoid even the vaguest contact with it. We're dealing with the part of the universe that is in a constant state of destruction and creation, which is the present moment. Every single moment in time is instantaneously being evaporated, erased, wiped clean. Whatever happened to you two minutes ago is gone devoured by some unknown thing we call time. And the present moment is that point on the conveyor belt where that which is not becomes that which is and that which is becomes that which is not. It's that place where those two places meet. It's the transcendent place, Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, Brahmin, the creator and the destroyer hanging out together at a wonderful picnic and it's amazing, but it's really terrifying, it really is. When teachers like Jesus Christ are saying things like, you must die to this world to come to know me. Or when you hear the stories of your friends who had an ayahuasca trip and how they were tortured until the moment they allowed themselves to die, those are scary stories. If you're somebody who is clinging to the delusion that there's any kind of permanence, stability or non-changing aspect of the universe. If you've tricked yourself into thinking that whatever state that you're in right now is going to stay that way, then the concept of the state changing in the most dramatic way possible, which is death, is absolutely horrifying. I know, because I'm one of those people, I hate the idea of dying. It just doesn't appeal to me. It's something that I would like to not have happen. And I think that the movement into the present moment is a form of death. It's the death of all your preconceived notions. It's the death of all of your expectations. It's the death of every single way you thought things were going to be. You give it all up. There's nothing except the thing itself, which if you're something that's been existing outside the thing itself, pretending that you aren't some eternal, non-embodied singularity, a unitive consciousness that expresses itself temporarily in the form of all known phenomena, then it can be a little, it can be fucking spooky. So it's fun to live outside of that and to build a little nest and to pretend that you're a person with a social security number and a name and a job and a family and that this thing, this dance that you're doing in the physical material universe will go on forever, which it won't. So that's, I think, why teachers like Chogium Trumpa, and we talk about this idea a little later in the podcast, will say, if you don't have an already started down the path of what is known as awakening or whatever you wanna call it, don't go down it. It's better not. Enjoy the dream. It's a fine dream and there's nothing wrong with just being in that dream of permanence. Nothing wrong with it. It's beautiful and maybe that's why we're here. But if you're somebody who started waking up to the reality of the situation, which is that everything is a constant state of kaleidoscopic flux, then well, that's where people like Chogium Trumpa come in handy because they can sort of guide you through the process or at least give you something to read when you've eaten too much marijuana. Either way, I'm glad that he exists. Check out his documentary on Netflix. I think it's called Crazy Wisdom and I, you'll love it. Sorry for the sermon. Why did I do that? Too stoned. All right, we're gonna dive right into this episode with Emil Amos, but first, some quick business. In 1978, Wilmer Pettingham was discovered dead in his apartment. No one knew what had happened to Wilbur and it was a mystery that would last several weeks until Detective Courtney Ray of the Miami Police Department upon revisiting the scene of Wilbur's unexpected demise, discovered something terrible. Scanning the mattress, he realized that there were small footprints leading up the side of the mattress. A forensic examination later determined that these footprints were made of semen. What had happened to Wilbur that night shocked detectives and forensic psychologists and redefined crime history for years to come. This was the first time in the history of Miami that a man had been murdered by his own semen. As it turned out, Wilbur had not changed his mattress for over 11 years and as a habitual love maker and master-beater, his mattress had gathered so much residual semen that the bedbugs living in the mattress were taken over by the genetic information inside the semen and formed what is known as a cum baby. A cum baby is a dangerous and extremely rare being that can emerge from the congealed, crusty leavings of your love-making and orgasming throughout the years. A cum baby is angry. Its mind is driven by one thing and one thing alone to seek revenge on that which sprayed it into the void. And so Wilbur, in the dead of the night, after a furious session of masturbation, fell asleep. His stomach covered with a congealed, waxy ooze, a sock laying next to his mattress. He never knew what happened to him. But after much unraveling of the crime scene, it was determined that a cum baby had emerged. It risen from the mattress like a thing from a quicksand pit made of jizz and climbed up Wilbur's chest and covered his mouth and nose with a thick mucusy sheet of old reincarnated jizz. Wilbur died within a few minutes of having his main oxygen flow cut off by the quivering hand of the cum baby. Wilbur's cum baby was found in a nearby bar drinking my ties and watching the UFC. He was taken into custody and following is an audio excerpt of his interrogation. Um, where were you on the night of July 15th? Oh, I believe I was suffocating some bitch ass motherfucker with my hands. Okay, so you admit cum baby that you killed Wilbur petting him? Yes, and I would do it again. I want a butt! BOOM! The cum baby detonated over 17 pounds of plastic explosives that it had hidden in its tiny trench coat, destroying the Miami-Dade police department and killing Detective Loretta Lanue. If only Wilbur had changed his mattress, everything might have been different. This episode is brought to you by Casper.com.

You shouldn't, you should only be going to nudist parks. If you're not on the way to a nudist park or coming back from one, something's wrong. You definitely shouldn't be spending your time driving to warehouses to buy pieces of plastic that are not gonna take away the innate suffering that comes from the terrible delusion that you exist in a universe of permanence. So the next time you're about to go out to buy some silverware, rice steamer, an espresso machine, or a pocket knife, remember, you go to amazon.com and go through our portal located in the comment section of any of these episodes. And rather than getting trapped in hell traffic dealing with the undeniable fact that you are some kind of sentient filament sucked into the irresistible magnetic forces of modern day capitalism, you can spend your time making love to a beehive in a park, drinking wine out of a goblet and dancing with a hoofed being that has a thousand eyes. Doesn't that sound more fun? Go through the Amazon portal. It's in the comment section of any of these episodes. They will give us a very small percentage of anything that you buy and it costs you nothing. We've also got t-shirts, stickers, and brand new posters are on the way. And finally, I've got a big tour of the East Coast coming up. If you wanna come see me, do stand up. All those dates are gonna be located dunkintrustle.com and the tour starts in March. So I hope you'll come to a live show. All right, that's enough rambling on my part. You know, these are pot chocolates I have. They're, they will trick you. These seemingly innocent, sweet little squares are crafted in hell by professional demons. But they're my kind of demons. All right, we're gonna jump right into this episode. Today's guest is one of my best and longest friends. He's in a lot of great bands, including Grails, Holy Sons, and Ohm. And he's gonna be going on a tour of Europe soon. And all those dates will be located at dunkintrustle.com in the comment section. Now everybody, please open your hearts and send as much love as you can. In the direction of this super transcendent, never ending ultra identity that is temporarily manifesting as Emil Amos. Lap Cage. Welcome upon you, that you are with us. Shaken, going to be blue, welcome to you. It's the Dunkintrustle współ kilk It's been so long, how long's it been since we did a podcast together? I am not good with time, but I think maybe maybe a year. It's been too long. Where have you been? You've been, have you been gone? It was hard to get in touch with you for a while. I was, I traveled around the world a few times because I'm kind of doing this thing where experiment where I just say yes to everything. And I, and I do any, you know, I travel and promote myself as much as possible because I never did that before. So I'm trying to do that as much as possible. Maybe because my brain is telling me that, you know, I guess with David Bowie dying and my body getting older, it's just sort of like, I can see the next horizon where things start to slow down in, you know, 10, 15 years. So I'm just going for it now. You're doing sort of the same thing right now. Yeah. Well, I mean, I try not to think about the next horizon thing, you know, I mean, I don't want to like, you know, that thing, you know, I don't want to be fueled by some diminishing time. I don't want to be fueled by that idea of like, God damn it, I better fucking do something now or else because well, then not that you're doing that or anything. I mean, you've already, you're like one of the most prolific people I know on planet Earth. And you're out. I think it's like a, I think it's a, I don't know if the healthy is the right word, but it is a very, you know, like when someone dies, like for me, David Bowie, I would like realize in a good way, it makes you realize some really deep shit. Like when you were telling me the story about when you were coming back from the doctor and you'd gotten like a prognosis and you were like looking at the world and you were kind of happy to know that the world would just keep going on without you if you did die. That's one like positive kind of elating feeling of realizing mortality, but then it's just another constructive, optimistic, potentially realization that you come away and you're like now is all I've got and I've got to like harness this and you seize it and it's an exciting realization. It's not like necessarily morbid. No, no, I know. That's a, yeah, it doesn't have to be morbid. That was, I still remember that, you know, like your brain takes flash bulb moments. Yeah. And I still remember that, man. I remember this, there, I think there was a plane going through the sky. I was on La Brea and Sunset Boulevard, I think. I know it was, wait, no, it was Beverly and La Brea. Now that it matters, somewhere around there, somewhere in West Hollywood and yeah, I'm looking around at all the insane gears of the world and you realize, yeah, they just keep going. This thing just keeps going no matter what. And it is, there was something in it that was shockingly relaxing and that concept of like shit, man, I, you know, it's like depressing and exillating when you realize that really you don't have any impact in the world at all, no matter what you do. You'll just be forgotten. Classic example, Genghis Khan. I mean, people remember who he is, but barely. Nobody recognizes what that guy did and no one realizes he conquered more land mass than anybody else existing. A tribes person, a basically a wandering beggar at one point in his life conquered the fucking world. But these days, you don't hear people talking about Genghis Khan, you know, and if they do, it's very briefly and probably people are glad when they stop talking about him. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like Genghis Khan is now just like some nickname for like a Cleveland steamer or something. Give me that Genghis Khan, baby. Give me another Khan, honey. Oh, I love it when you do that, baby. Genghis Khan all over my face. You're sort of, it's so sweet when you have these touching sort of zen realizations. And then the most terrifying thing is that, you know, it's just a matter of time, maybe five minutes before you like just slide back into the kind of like, you know, what's the word disengaged kind of malaise, not to be totally depressing, but you know that it's just a matter of like hours or days before you sort of normalize and go back to your basic practical minded bullshit, you know? Yeah, well, yeah, your attention is habituated on that whatever that specific modality is. So you just, yeah, you always end up looking at the same thing again. Like a cat can't not look at a bird. Like it's always gonna get attracted to a bird and certain minds, certain minds, it's certain that people's attention is attracted to one very specific outlook. Is it, and it's a, God damn it. I mean, the more the older I get, the more I realize my outlook, even though I don't find it depressing at all, there are very few people I can talk with about it who aren't gonna be like, wow, man, that is just so dark. Oh my God, that's how you think, really? And I think, to me, it doesn't seem, it's like you are not in North Korea, you are not allowed to talk shit about Kim Jong-il. In Thailand, you cannot talk shit about the monarchy. You'll get arrested. In the United States, if you start talking about the truth, which is everybody's, you know, is gonna die and you're gonna die and you're gonna have to bury your mom and your dad and all your dogs are gonna die and nothing that you do long term is gonna be remembered. And there are many proofs, as just mentioned, Genghis Khan being the top, unless you think you're gonna top Genghis Khan, in which case you're gonna get some centuries of people talking about you, but more than likely you're not. So no one's really gonna remember anything you do. You have a very minimum impact on this world of so many people and not only is everyone you know gonna die and nothing you do ultimately really makes any impact at all. In the long term, most people don't remember you three minutes after you pass by and more than likely some of your dearest friends think about you maybe twice a week. So you're invisible and I find that to be one of the most, it's a kind of relief to really let yourself release that awful, awful problem of constantly performing for people in the future or for people in the present who you imagine are thinking about you. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it takes you full circle though somehow and routes you right back into the same sort of temporal petty concerns as you, the more you think about it, you're like, you come to these grand realizations, like I get it now that like being happy is the only thing that matters and it's all I have. It's my only chance to harness right now. And then so you're like, then you follow to the next thought and you're like, well, the way to be happy is to like, you know, do all the things that I want to do in life. And then you just go down the same old road, like you create a bunch of work for yourself to do and temporal chores and you start to get inundated and immersed within those things. And you're like, oh, the guy's gotta be here at three and then I've gotta go to this guy's house, you know, and you just become, it's just what life is, is that kind of, not necessarily the pendulum swinging, but it's what life is, is wrestling with these kind of temporal concerns, no matter how petty and stupid they are, nobody escapes the bullshit, you know? And this is definitely, if you wanna disparage modern life, it stinks, because like in the old days, they would say enlightenment, then chop wood, carry water. You know, because that's what people mostly did back then. You'd have to get water down by the river, there'd be a hike somewhere through a well, or you'd have to fucking chop your own goddamn firewood if you didn't wanna freeze. Those were the temporal concerns. These days, it's like send invoices, enlightenment, then send invoices. Stand in line for coffee. Yeah, yeah, try to reconcile, it's like there's something instantaneously embarrassing, or it's like, you know, like imagine Buddha sitting somewhere achieving the great awakening, descending from the Bodhi tree and walking to the nearest Starbucks to get a latte. You know, it's like the universe perfected itself to make it even more difficult to be that being, at least in the classic view, all this shit about caves, you know, like that's something I realized when it comes to meditation teachers, spiritual teachers, they all need it, you need a kind of story, and many of them have a story that involves some form of cave, right? So, and they make sure that you know they were in a cave. Like, you can't know, if a spiritual person has been in a fucking cave, they're gonna tell you about it, and it's important that you know, I spent three years in a cave, dude, so. Dude, it's exactly like hip-hop. If you're a new rapper, you get interviewed, and the first question they ask the rapper is, have you been in jail? Like, you have to prove that you've done something horrible if you're gonna get let through the gates. It's the same thing with anything, with spiritual, I mean, it's the same concept as a spiritual teacher or whatever, is like, Sid Barrett, you know, you have to, you have to be super damaged to make the story good, you know? What if he had just been at line at Starbucks, he wouldn't have been Sid Barrett, but there's this sense of those like commodifiable, like, you know, the guru has to have gone through some Hollywood tragedy or something, right? Right, he needs a story, and even though the story is irrelevant, and even though when you get around people who, some of the people I've been around, regardless of what fucking cave they went in, if somebody manages to hit that pitch, you really aren't thinking about the cave when you're around them, you're just thinking like, oh my God, wait, what, you can be like this? Are you really like that? You really are like that. Wait, what the fuck, you had a stroke, and you're like this? Yeah. Like Ram Dass, man, you realize like, whoa, that guy's just firing from the hip, there's no- There are so many lifetimes removed from be here now by now. Yeah, so many lifetimes, and yet still, I mean, again, I don't know, I guess when I see him, I'm seeing him in a performance aspect, so to speak, because he's surrounded by people who are his students, but I don't, he seems, that's not to say that Ram Dass doesn't like have shit days, as I'm sure he must, but like, you know what I mean? Like you do realize like, okay, this does work, but the cave, I don't care so much about Neem Karoli Baba, or his story, or his awakening, or the Alpert, or the acid, or the mushroom, or the whole thing. To me, it's just like, whoa, you did this, you're having a good day. I mean, like you're making, you're making, this day, you are the prism transforming all phenomena into something a little better than it was before it came through your sensory apparatus, whereas I, when things come through my sensory apparatus, I'm lucky if I keep it just the same level of shit, but more than likely, when I think of him zinging through me, it's gonna come out the other side a little less good. You know what I mean? Like I'm gonna, I'm going to habitually degrade experience instead of habitually transform every moment into something sweet, whereas, or even attempt to. I'm gonna diminish it, I'm gonna bitch in traffic, I'm gonna complain about TV, and I'm gonna fucking get unhappy about video games, and feel bad about not getting enough podcasts up habitually. You know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, nobody's gonna escape that cycle of, of samsara, or whatever, whatever you wanna call it. Just seems like, I guess you just keep getting drawn back to the point that, you know, these phrases like now is all you have. Yeah. You can hear them like every day, and they're extremely boring and watered down after a while, but when someone like, sort of, someone like Bowie leaves that for everybody in sort of like a message in a bottle or something, it does, it hits you in these moments where you're like, it's so hard to really, really grasp that in a completely like fully aware way. And I don't think, I just feel so stupid a lot of the time, because, you know, you, in a weird way, there's like an old Townsend song called Waiting Around to Die, that was like on in the coffee shop today, and you know, when you hear a country song, it's like Waiting Around to Die, it just sounds like this depressing thing, but in a strange way, that's what makes me feel so stupid, is that no matter how busy I am, there's a part of myself kind of looking out the window of the plane, just in a weird way, feeling like I am actually just biding my time, just waiting, you know? Yes. Well, I mean, that is a good way to put it, man. Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. It's like, you know, man, I'll tell you this, dude, we are waiting in an incredible interdimensional train station, and there is a train that is a coming, and it comes for everybody, and as we're in the train station, we do tricks for some of us, or we'll try to control the train station. It's very funny, like humans come into the train station, they look around, and they think, oh, man, I wanna have the nicest bench in this fucking train station. I'm gonna have a beautiful bench, and I'm gonna have everything, everything, in this train station that you can have, I'm gonna have it. And then, you know, in the train station, you get these, it's just no different, you get buskers, you know? Buskers, like people like Justin Bieber or Taylor Swift, who have like managed to gather around them this temporary vortex of other people in the train station, who are getting to play the part of being inspired and filled with awe, and Justin Bieber is getting to experience what it's like to have a good day at the train station, but that's all it is. It's just a day at the train station, and at the end of the day, everybody gets picked up at different times, that's the problem, unless there's an apocalypse, in which case the train comes from all of us at once, but in general, everyone's getting picked up at different times, and it's really funny, because when the train picks up David Bowie, everyone's like, oh no, oh wait, what, oh fuck, oh fuck, wait, oh fuck, the train, wait, trains come here, like we've picked up like fucking trains, you know? And everyone remembers for a second, you know? Oh yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right, he got picked, he was not here forever, and then you feel like, oh shit, it's, well, I didn't do, God damn it, I took him for granted, I took for granted a person like this existed, and it's tragic in that level, I guess, but that is all it is, a train station, Bowie, oh my God, I mean, shit, that last, did you see that last video he left? Yeah. And what are your thoughts on that video? Well, I mean, I don't, If you guys haven't seen this press pause, go and watch David Bowie's last video, he knew he was dying, he knew that he would die some very soon after the release of the thing, and it's intense, what do you think about it? I just, I think he was so, in a weird way, I think like, he was a picture of what it means to be supremely intelligent, because first of all, he was a super, super kind person, like everybody who's ever met him felt like he was paying complete attention to them, it was entirely like gracious and fair as just a human being on the sidewalk, you know, he has a reputation that is like totally unscathed, you know, he practiced Buddhism and shit, but he basically, he's always, always understood his place in the world, and I don't think that he, you know, suffered from much ego inflation, I think he really did his job, and he felt that he was drawn naturally to create art, and I don't think he thought that was a higher position at all, I think that was just his daily need to do it, and when he was a kid, his brother got locked away, became schizophrenic, and he was super afraid it was happening to him, and his family was pretty fucked up, and he felt like he was like this hardcore outsider, and he ended up flipping the outsider in the feeling of affliction of being an outsider, he flipped the outsider into a character that he could explain art through, and that was a massive contribution to all sorts of people, and the dialectic of art and expression over the past century in a way that a lot of people don't ever come close to contributing, I mean, there's like, you know, the Rolling Stones, I don't think ever liberated people in that way, that it's just such a profound level of creating art that he was able to get to out of just hard work and elbow grease, it's not something he was just born with, he failed for over a decade before he even really became the thing he became, so I just think that no matter if it's the new video or whatever, it's really kind of a beautiful testament to what intelligence can bring human life, in terms of you being a kind person and you actually living a good life where you're helpful to other people, and I really think he embodied a benevolent spirit like that. Wow, yeah, that's beautiful, that's so well said. Yeah, man, I mean, that is the, if you wanna talk about impact, if that's what your brain is telling you is important, it really is that thing, which is maybe that's why everyone's mind got so blown by him is because the intention behind it was that he wanted to save people from feeling like an outsider, show people that you really don't have to confine yourself to the whatever the fuck the societal norm happens to be at the time, and that's maybe why he gets described all the time is like alien, he gets described, because when, god damn man, I was just thinking about one of his songs today, I love David Bowie, but I've never considered myself like a huge David Bowie fan, but I gotta tell you, ever since he died, man, I've been thinking about him every single day, and today I was thinking about, what's it called, so we are ground-controlled, a major Tom, so I was thinking about the lyrics, and I was thinking, that just seems like something I would say if I was a kid, you know, like this sounds like a game of make-believe or something that I would be playing as a kid, and why is it so incredibly powerful and special, because it means a lot more than that, I know that, but it seems like these great artists, they've reduced themselves to a level of childish make-believe, and then whereas most of us, that little thing that wants to come out, when that thing wants to come out, we try to refine it and sophisticated, people like Bowie, they just let it come out just like that, and when that, it's beautiful when that happens, and it seems so simple, like Daniel Johnston, outrageously simple, yet somehow insanely powerful. That was his legacy, I mean, you have to remember that David Bowie's ultimate jumping off point was Sid Barrett, and he wanted, as a young boy, I mean, he basically wanted to be Sid Barrett, and so he learned from the outset that imagination is king, skill and all the other various like perfect pitch or whatever, all those things can get you so far, but the imagination rules the entire game, and so Sid Barrett taught that to a young British kid like Bowie, and so he already understood, he already had this really great value system when he was going into the game, and so his legacy always is identified by people as art being first, that commerce came later, but that he always preached that you should make yourself feel uncomfortable as an artist by trying things that made you feel uneasy and then go in that direction further, you know? Wow, yeah, right, wow. So he left a trail, you know, that kind of, you know, whether or not we're talking about David Bowie or not, this is just as a footprint, a really, really unique footprint because how many people in the history of humanity are known primarily for constantly looking to challenge themselves in ways that abandon their entire template that they've just found? You know, that modality is totally insanely rare where someone is brave enough to risk their audience or whatever their economic wellbeing to just pursue something that they alone are feeling in their gut. The engineer in the studio and the guitarist, they don't know where they're going, only he knows where this is gonna end up in theory when he comes in there and he's like, okay, this is what I'm feeling like we should do, this is where we should go, I've never heard it before. How many people do that? Well, not everybody wants to pay the ticket, man. You know what I mean? Like, not everybody wants to pay for that ticket because it is, you know, this is the classic archetype, this is the gate between you and heaven, isn't it? It's the gate of paradise and standing at the gate of paradise is a guy selling tickets and the price of the ticket is everything. He's just says, well, you gotta pay everything. Well, what's in there? Well, I can't say until you pay everything. Well, what do you mean everything? My money? Well, yeah, your money, not just your money, your security, your identity, your thought process, you have to come through this thing. It's like, you know the Star Trek teleportation machines, theoretically disassemble you at an atomic level and then reassemble you and you're the exact same on the other end? Well, this thing that you're talking about is a very similar thing that you do to yourself, a pure disassembly or I guess alchemically, you're reducing yourself to some form of, some liquid form or some less condensed state and then re-cooling yourself and at the other end, you aren't gonna be yourself anymore. You might be a little bit like what you were, but you won't and that's why they call it conversion because you're converting to another substance and to do that, you have to give up everything and to give up everything, fuck that. That's, because you know why, man? It's not just what David Bowie people do, it's what crazy people do, right? It's what- Yeah, I love this concept. It's what insane people, an insane person will do that. It's called a nervous fucking breakdown, you know? You freak the fuck out. You suddenly are now your name's Gabriel Lightwing. You start going to fucking outdoor music festivals, wearing no shirt with a tattoo of an angel on your chest and you sell oils and everyone feels like weird when you tell them how while you're on an acid trip, you recognize that you are the true messenger of the light and these oils are infused with the light of God and you used to be an accountant. People are like, what the fuck? You've lost your fucking shit, man. But, and so it's like the people like Bowie, they made it work and there's this kind of like economic societal embrace after the fact, but not everyone makes it work. Not everyone, it turns out okay when you decide to fully disassemble and reassemble. There's no promise, that's the problem. There's no promise of this. Like when you take this leap, when you're like, you know what, this is not my life. This is not my life. This is some other person's life that I used to be and this is what would happen if that other person got on autopilot long enough and here's what it would look like. You know, wow, look, this is definitely not my life though. The shell I've constructed around me is not the right shape for who I truly am. But I got a fucking life. I got a job. I've got a wife or a husband. I've got dogs, cats, a baby. I've got a fucking shell, thick, thick shell that I've gotta maintain. And even though I know that this isn't me, I cannot do the conversion. I cannot give it all up. And that is why when the rich man came to Jesus and said, I wanna be your follower, Jesus said, okay, just give everything that you have to the poor and then come follow me. And the rich guy was like, no, I can't. That's the one thing I can't do. And it always will want the one thing you can't give, right? That's the thing. It will want the one thing you can't give. The one thing where you're like, no fucking way, take it all. You sure my money, who fucking cares? Take my money, take my hair, take my car, take my clothes. Take it all, take it all. Fuck me if you want, take my dignity. But there'll always be some thing, some little fucking thing that you're like, no, that's the thing I'm not giving up. And that's the price right there, that thing. The moment you give up that thing, it's very similar to an elephant giving up the thorn in its paw. It's very, you know what I mean? The moment you're like, here, just take it. Fine, fuck it, you can have it. Freedom, you're no longer defined by that pain. It's scary though, man. I mean, shit, it's scary. What do you, do you find yourself, your music evolves every time I listen to it. It's gotten so much deeper and better and more astounding to me. Do you find yourself, do you think that you've reinvented yourself? Do you think that the emul in college who is playing that beautiful music versus the emul now who continues to play mind blowing beautiful music, has there been that death and resurrection for you? Or has that happened multiple times or at all? Well, I think that, I think that to answer two different things at once, like I think the beauty of Bowie hearing Sid Barrett early is he hears it and he gets it into his bloodstream so early that he becomes addicted to self-examination, transforming the self-examination into art and flipping it into a form of therapy so that as time goes on, his value system is already set. But then he just gets, so the opening game is about courage in the Faustian trade and going deeper and deeper into himself. That's already established at the beginning. So then from there, he just gets better at it. So I think that if you've already got your direction pretty much fully formed as a young kid, like if you're talking about the recordings I was doing in college with you, I think the whole thing was already done and set up. There were things about maybe myself that I was embarrassed of or scared to go further into maybe or maybe I was still burning off the impurities, maybe I was still burning off the constructs in myself of learned behavior and maybe a lot of those recordings were the attempt to get down to the true base, like you're saying, melting yourself down. Maybe that was the active process of it. And so then now I feel like my job is slightly more to kind of show what I've learned as I see new, more complex versions of the same problems. So I mean, the issue that we started talking about in the beginning of basic mortality as you get to be a little older, new things are kind of coming into sight. Like I can definitely confirm as you're saying that this whole idea of realizing that you'll never mean anything to anyone ever in the bigger picture as your mortality comes towards me. It's definitely something that's been occurring to me at this point, I'm kind of meditating on it as I'm hurrying somewhere to go do something that I'm going through so much physical stress just because I might be late to one thing and I've got all these other things in my mind. But at the same time underneath all of it, I'm just like, this is fucking ridiculous. Like what will this really bring me in the God's eye view? Nothing, it'll bring me absolutely nothing. So how can I not be intelligent enough to just sit back and relax and watch all this stuff just go by? So I've definitely been grappling with those newer versions of the same old problem. Isn't that fun when the mind, so the mind number one creates this temporal crucifixion device where one arm is based on where you are now, the other arm is based on where you're supposed to be. And you're just hanging there feeling like shit because you're always rushing thinking that once I get to this other point, I'm gonna feel better. So there you are rushing. Like, and then if you have any kind of intelligence, you realize like, why am I rushing? Right now I'm in a deep state of anxiety over the illusion that when I get to this point or that point, the anxiety will resolve. When now after my entire life, I seem to never have any true resolution of this anxiety. And when I do, I don't even notice it. So I know that when I get to this place, it's not the cure to this problem. So then you realize, oh yeah, okay, well now I see what I'm doing here. I'm running for a cure at the wrong pharmacy because I keep going back to this pharmacy and it doesn't really seem to do much to cure the problem. So then your mind recognizing the futility of the situation adds another level of complication. So now you're not only feeling bad because you're in a hurry, you're feeling bad because you realize that it's retarded to be in a hurry. So now the mind's, you know what I mean? It just keeps scooping on new dimensions of like, yes. And here's another reason you're wrong. And here, let me show you why. And here's another reason. And so it's just all the same, it's all little pieces of the same fractal. So when you imagine, okay, do you ever do this? Do you ever imagine what your life would be like minus the anxiety, minus the rushing, minus the stress? Do you ever imagine what you would be like? In ways, do you actually picture your waking reality as a stressless entity? Yeah, just as a thought experiment. It's a fun thought experiment. Just imagine what you would be like. So whatever the aching, gnawing anxiety is inside of you. The thing where you know you have 9,000 things to do this week, you got a show to do tonight, you got a show to do in two days, you got this other shit you got to do, you got to do this podcast, some other thing, and this thing, whatever's going on in your relationship and all this stuff. So that thing, okay, imagine if that was all gone. So you wake up in the morning and you just feel the bed and you take a deep breath. Alive. And that's it. Do you ever do that? Like imagine that life. Like there's all this shit you still do, you still do all this stuff that you're doing right now, but no more of that shitty anxiety. Yeah. I feel like I feel like I feel like that today. And I don't know why and I feel like I almost don't deserve it, because it's almost like so irregular, but it's like, I think the valley kind of opens up and you're sort of, all the things that you had on your plate seem like they're basically caught up. It's like this moment where you're proud of what you've been doing and you feel fulfilled, but I mean, all that stuff is pretty arbitrary, but I think it does contribute to the feeling of like a deep breath and being like, I actually like my life, you know? Well, you're right. And this is the, my dog jumps up on the bed and does this hilarious six minute ritual where it runs in like circle, circle, circle, dig, dig, dig, circle, circle, dig, dig, circle, dig. And I, you know, you watch the sheets to see like, what is the thing you're going for here, man? You know, like, it's just sheets. Like you're not get, you never, it's not the same form you're making around you. But then finally, after doing this, the dog falls down and is like, oh, we did it. Now I can relax. You know? And like when I'm doing that, I know what you're talking about, man, that moment where like, for me, it's like, okay, I've done, I've got, you know, I've got my spots lined up for the week or it's usually like Sunday after I've done, I've had good sets in night, good standup. I've gotten a podcast recorded, gotten a podcast uploaded, taking care of all the minutiae of daily life, been exercising, planning the tour, writing, you know, been having good days every day, very productive days. And at the end of that, there is this temporary moment of like, yes. Yeah. Oh yeah. We are doing it, man. Oh, we are doing it. But then those moments are very few and far between. And they are, of course, just you've concocted a specific amount of dopamine, a specific amount of, I don't know, whatever the neurochemicals are responsible for giving you the sense of like, yes, you're doing something. And the dream, which I subscribe to, is that you can have that feeling all the time, no matter what. And that if you have that feeling all the time, no matter what, it will not diminish your productivity, but actually increase it, amplify it and make it better. And that you, not only do you deserve that feeling all the time, but you are that feeling all the time. And that thing you were saying, I feel like I don't really deserve it. That thing, that's the, right there, that's the number one reaction that people have to the guru. That's the number one reaction that people have to love. That's the number one reaction that people have to the really good stuff, is they always think, I don't deserve this. I don't deserve it. Me, filthy me, disgusting me and pure mind, you know? But man, I'm telling you, brother, I don't think you, I think you, I don't know though. I mean, fuck, who am I to say? But I really think it's accessible all the fucking time. I don't think there needs to be the goddamn shit feeling to go along with all the stuff that we're doing in this ridiculous train station. I think we can just do the stuff minus the shit feeling, but maybe not. I think there, maybe there's a side effect to growing and learning. It's like a form of growing and learning where you're in the train station or whatever and maybe you feel slightly wiser than you did before. And you know that it's like a tendency to judge yourself and be like, what was I doing before? This is ridiculous, you know? Like I was an idiot or something. I think there's some haunting sense or annoying feeling that you were previously probably wasting your time because you didn't get it or something. And obviously that's kind of an ego illusion or something that, oh, well now I see things correctly. That's kind of a ridiculous thing where you're just feeling the elation of being in sync with things. Maybe you felt like that before. There's a lot of times in life where you identify that you're not in sync with things, but I think in that train station, there's levels of regret and confusion where you're just doubting yourself. You're like, I don't think I got it before, which is a ridiculous state of mind, but I think as you grow, you judge the past in a way. Have you heard the phrase, the diagnosis, I guess, the term imposter syndrome? Yeah, I think, is this kind of the genuine fake Alan Watts thing a little bit, right? What do you mean? Oh, just the whole thing where he kind of like, and Bowie is very much this thing too, just admitted that he like wasn't the real thing, that he was just like everybody just attempting to feel real or something. Yeah, this is a syndrome identified that seems to happen more often, according to the Wikipedia entry, more often for women who are in competitive industries than men, but it does happen for men too. Yeah, and it seems to be related to IQ, but basically it's people who regardless of their accomplishments in the past feel that they've done nothing, and the accomplishments in the past are viewed as a form of accident or luck. Yeah. And ultimately they just think, well, I'm a fraud, and I got lucky, but pretty soon my gigs up because people are gonna catch on that this is all bullshit. That's called imposter syndrome. Isn't that cool? And it's kind of based on the concept of existence preceding essence, isn't it? Which is that if you get to some certain level of realization, then you know that you aren't any coherent, inherent form. Right. And so once you know that, then you realize that anything you're putting out there is at the very best a well-crafted and consistent act that you're putting out there. You consistently act like you're nice to people. You consistently act like you're a loving person. You consistently act like you care, yet at the core we're dealing with emptiness, and you're dealing with the problem of realizing that you're just acting and that you can't stop acting, you know? And so that's imposter syndrome, which is I think what we all have really. Because we, so again, it goes back to whenever our jobs are in the world, it's a thing that we have decided to do repetitively as a form of action to pass the time in the train station of life. And because of the innate emptiness of all things, whatever the particular repetitive pattern that we're engaging in, that we're calling our life's work may be, whether it's video games, shooting heroin, conquering empires, putting out fucking incredible albums, whatever that thing may be, at the core there's only emptiness. At the core there's only an undefinable place that we keep adding, we keep putting stuff around it for some reason or another. And this has gotta be why ultimately so many people are like, you know what, I'm just gonna fucking meditate. You know, like the monk goes to the temple and just sits, zazen, just sit. I'm like, oh, I get it, I'm just emptiness, so I'm just gonna just do this for now. And then you start doing that a little bit at a time. And then all of a sudden that's where you start god damn feeling the thing that isn't based on accomplishment, that isn't based on energy expenditure, that isn't based on getting the fucking bed sheet in the right pattern, that isn't based on the ant's nest being built in just the right way, you know? Man, I gotta tell you, I had the most disturbing thing happen to me the other day and forgive this rant. I have a fucking hammock. You know that hammock I'm talking about? Yeah, by the pool. Yes, and I have a fucking pool. I could not balance on that fucking hammock without dropping my phone or my guitar. Well, just try, I mean, it's a, you know, you gotta try laying down on the damn thing. Right, but isn't that kind of an odd metaphor that you couldn't even get comfortable on the comfort device? Dude, this is what I wanted to say! That's it! Maybe the hammock's cursed, but I'll tell you this. It's broken. It's not broken. I went out there to lay on the fucking hammock, right? Beautiful day. I never lay on that fucking hammock. I'll look out the window at it, but I'll never lay on the fucking thing. It's just out there pretending to be something I use all the time. The fucking pool, I never get in the pool. The idyllic surrounding that I feel so lucky to be in. Nothing, right? But the other day, I'm like, you know what, I'm gonna go lay on the hammock. It's a nice day, nothing's going on. I just finished a bunch of stuff in my life. I'm gonna relax today. Old school dad style. So I go out on the hammock, and I lay down on that hammock, and nothing changes. That fucking anxiety, it's there. There's nothing there. There's no relaxation. There's no moment of fucking goddamn unwinding. Are you kidding me? You're gonna just unwind after you've tortured yourself for decades? Give me a break. There is no fucking balm in this hammock, friend, until you overcome the ridiculous delusion that there is something you can do in this world that's gonna make you happy. The moment you give that bullshit up is the moment I like to believe that everything becomes the goddamn award ceremony. I've seen the way my cat stares at berries, fully entranced, 100% locked on to some berry, laying in front of the window, or a bird, or the way my dogs smell grass. I know it's possible to be fully immersed in this beautiful universe, and I know that anything I'm doing that I think is my job is really just a cat. There's no balance around that experience, a desperate maneuver to attempt to avoid unification. That's what I like to believe, man. So this is the problem, right? This is the fucking problem here. This is the problem of this concept of goddamn achievement. I never want you to stop making albums. Thank God David Bowie makes albums. What a sad world if everybody just stared at fucking berries and didn't make pretty songs. Yeah, I'm never ever gonna stop. That's why I probably worry about my ears and things like that, but I think one thing, people look at Bowie like it's this shining beacon of courage, and what I think he was doing is that he really just identified the inherent experimentalism of life, like the inherent formlessness of it, and how you, it is a bit of a sham that you can actually pull away from the basic societal construct and be completely autonomous internally. I think he identified that inherent form of experimentalism as a version of sanity, you know? It's a lot of what you're kind of talking about is that when you see this world that you inhabit apart from the bullshit of sort of restrictive societal construct, if you see it clearly and you have the whatever courage or leap of faith to grab that and be like, my world exists outside of complete idiocy, of complete, you know, the lies that are bought in soul that we are all kind of propagating, that's what he saw early on and he was just like, no, there's sanity in this faith, there's sanity in this version of being impossibly loyal to myself and to my gut. That's not insanity, that's where my health will be born of, you know? And so they just fucking stomped the pedal into 100 miles per hour into that direction because that was salvation. And that's what people I think are really championing. They're like, you know, that's a picture of health. That was a happy fucking man. That was a happy dude. As far as these things go, you know, that's where the great humanity, that's where the great intelligence comes from is not only being like seizing what happiness is and how to go towards it, but then spreading it to other people and being a fucking gracious, beautiful, you know, kind person to other people. Yeah, I think that the hope is, this is the hope. The, okay, Bowie, when I saw his last video, that's when for the only time in my life, because again, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about him, but he had a huge impact. I'll never forget Ziggy Stardust. I remember the tape, we'd gotten it from a flea market. I remember hearing it for the first time and then playing it over and over and then losing the tape and not being able to find another one for a long time. Still remember it, man. But when I watched that last video and I saw what he's doing in that video, because this is a man who's dying of cancer, right? And so in the video, for those of you who haven't seen it, he's laying in bed, almost like in a shroud, like he's already died, buttons on his eyes. And then the video kind of switches to him writing what I imagined to be infrantically attempting to write something. Yeah, that's a great scene. That's like, that's the best scene that sticks with me. That's the scene. That's it. Because you know, you're seeing like, oh, fuck, I'm gonna die. Shit, shit, shit. I gotta get all this fucking out. I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out. That's all I saw. I gotta get out. And then the reminiscing moment. It's like a metaphor for like a battlefield. This is a war that you will never win. And it's like the scenes of Mozart and Amadeus when he's basically just trying to rattle off from his deathbed, you know? It's like, you can't win this, but the brain thinks like, well, I'm just gonna try. And in a strange way, I think even with the video, he did kind of win it because he up to the final moments of his life, he did things that he himself could be proud of, you know? He never stopped trying, you know? To me, when I saw that, right, he was perfectly reflecting what he was going through. That's what I saw there, man. He was perfectly reflecting what he was going through. And that, so that thing, that, when you start doing that, perfectly reflecting what you're going through, just saying it like it is. This is how it is. This is what I'm feeling. Here's where I'm at. True honesty, pure honesty through whatever your art is. And even if what your art is, is the opposite, if it's fueled by that honesty, the idea is, yeah, it's gonna be perfect. It has to be perfect. Because when I look at the sky, that's honesty, right? No one looks at the sky and says, that's the sky is lying today. The sky is not being itself today. Have you looked up there today at that old fraudulent sky? That's the fucking worst version of a sky I've seen. What a poser. No one looks at nature and thinks that. It's only the human that becomes the fraud. So, and why the fraud? Well, the fraudulence is really just when your articulation of your experience gets muddied by your desire to be something else, or your confusion, or your fear. And then it comes out of some malformed, little mutant thing that used to be a you. And you start letting the thing out just the way it is, then the dream is, everyone's gonna be like, God, that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my fucking life. Like when I see my nephew do anything, it's always the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. He doesn't fake smile yet, you know? That kid doesn't fake smile. He doesn't fake cry. He cries on purpose, smiles on purpose, loves on purpose. So that's, to me, when I saw Bowie, it's like, oh, this is what I guess he's been doing all along. Is that in the, he knows this reality that we're in, and all the stuff surrounding us, and all the tidal forces of society are constantly changing, making him part of a kaleidoscope of ever mutating ideas and forms. And instead of clinging to the way the kaleidoscope used to be in a few moments before, years before, he's just changing with it and reflecting that change. And that's beautiful. It has to be, it has to be. You don't have to be an artist to do that. You just do that any time you just say I actually feel, you know what I'm talking about, man? That relief that comes when you just completely tell the truth. Oh my God, I think the problem is that because of the, the dynamic of the absence makes the heart grow fonder because we go through these long lengths of complete bullshit where we're inundated with shit we don't care about. Once we finally get to see a piece of art that is pure, whatever, you just like break down. You're like, holy shit, but yeah, what's stopping you from going to that place every single day? Nothing, in every single moment. I agree. What is stopping you is because that, see that moment, like, okay, you look at the baby and the baby is, I don't know, you know, going is like frenetically moving from one state of consciousness to the next. It's not resisting these changes. It's happy, then it's sobbing, then it's hugging you, then it's laughing, then it's poking the dog, then the dog is like growling at it, then it's crying again. It's not resisting this, the sort of magnetic flow of its essential self, the way that it's just a flowing river of experience and emotion, but you look at the adult and the adult is always fighting against the, oh God, damn it, a day I feel like fucking shit, I can't believe the world. I don't want to cry today, man, I just want to fucking cry, I'm going to start, this traffic, this fucking traffic! A baby will do that and no one will call the cops, right? No one's calling 911 because the baby's screaming about how awful the fucking traffic is, but a man, if you passed a man in traffic, bawling and screaming, they would call the cops, you'd get arrested, it's illegal, and yet that man is fully just allowing the flow of himself to emerge, so the great North Korean conspiracy here, man, is that we aren't allowed to be our true and essential self, which is why there always seems to be something criminal attached to an artist who starts doing that. I mean, it's never an artist who starts really being themselves that doesn't garner some kind of negative criticism about being blasphemous, you know, or like, look at him, dressing like a lady and prancing around up there. How many people probably said that about Bowie? Fucking faggots. This is just what we need, another fucking faggot on this thing. You know? Like, guaranteed, people will say that, which, and you know that, see, this is the problem, this is, again, we get to the gatekeeper, because the gatekeeper says to you, listen, you know how you're supposed to be, you know what this is, but you've been lying so long, haven't you, and you've been lying so long that you're surrounded by liars, and not only that, you've been lying so long about who you are and every little action that you do where you haven't been authentically reflecting the inner truth that is you, if you've been putting on this show that is distant from the way you actually feel that all these people around you think you're completely different than what you are, and you know what I mean? Like, that's the other problem, is the moment you start acting like yourself, if you're surrounded yourself with fellow liars, they're all gonna be like, wait, I thought we were playing make-believe till the end. You're supposed to pretend to be this other thing, why are you being this thing now? It doesn't make any sense. Stop it, you're losing your mind. Are you all right? How about this classic one? You just hadn't really been acting like yourself lately. That's the funniest thing someone could say to you. You haven't really been acting like the character you've been playing in this incarnation lately. Could you just go back to acting like that character again, please, because it makes us all comfortable, because the character I'm playing is friends with the character you're playing, but the character I'm playing can't be friends with the new character you're playing. That's not how it works in the script. You know? It's really fucking annoying, man. It really is. There's a grand conspiracy to keep human beings from fully articulating their essential nature into this dimension, and that's why people like David Bowie are heroes, man. I guess you're right, and to bring it all around, you really can do something in the world, actually, you know? Yeah, that's the disturbing truth of it, is that when you're like 10 years old and you got your first Jimi Hendrix cassette in your little Walkman and you're bopping around town, and you, you know, to you, the word music, you know, to this naive soul, music is this super profound, beautiful thing, you know, that is embodied by Neil Young, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, you know, whatever. Bob Marley, you know, whatever. It's this, you know, unfortunately, rebellious, you know, wildly rare, beautiful thing, but to your 10-year-old mind, you're just like, oh, there's this thing. It's like a spiritual field, right? Fast forward to like 20 years later when you're just like inundated with billions and billions of songs and bands and things that are just like crowding your vision. You're like, what the fuck is all this shit? Why is there only one Neil Young? Why is there only one John Lennon? They embody the thing that you're talking about, this like, this transparent honesty that radicalizes people. Why is there only like fucking five of those people? You know, like, why is the field of music made up of so much time-wasting shit? Because it's not being identified as a spiritual field. It's not being identified for, I mean, and that's just a metaphor for life. You got people, billions of people fucking walking around the sidewalk, not identifying the spiritual field that it is, you know? That's it. So it's a, in a way, in a weird way, it is an accurate reflection of the general confused miasma that is popular culture, just a general sense of like, hey, let's just not get too deep. We're going to keep it out here. What's going on with sports or the new Deadpool movie? It's just kind of like, you know, you either talk about the train station or you don't. A lot of people in the train station, they're singing about, you know, a whole different place. They are singing about a whole different place. And it's not a real place. But it's a place that most people in the train station would prefer to be, which is heaven, eternity, a place where there is no death, doom, despair, demise, and all the awful other D words I could think of, a place where there's just a kind of, it's not going to happen, not this, we're going to get the, there's some pill, I guess, we're all going to take or whatever this thing that is coming, what's the point? Let's not think about that. Let's start to distract ourselves with these beautiful, phantasmal images that are created in these vapid songs about money or whatever transient bullshit that so many people are singing about. So, and I, you know, I get it, man, I get it. Like, how can you, like if somebody's in a concentration camp singing about sunset, or not sunset, but you know what I mean? If someone's in some kind of like, some kind of like prison colony singing about like, you know, a boat, a nice boat and other people for a little while feel like they've got a nice boat, I guess that's okay. You know, why not? Fuck it. If you were want to like dress like a goddamn, well, you know, if you want to dress like in whatever you want to dress in, in this fucking train station wherein you get to do it, and I get it. It's not fair to like, you know, it's just you and I are more drawn to like different types of shit, but I get it. I understand why so many people wouldn't be. I get it. You know, fuck. These things are like, these are the unspeakable things. Cholgyum Trump has said, if you can avoid going down this path, don't go down it. Just don't. It's better not to stay out. It'll be better for you. Cause if you start going down this path, you can't stop. You can't stop waking up, man. It's too late. It's too late. You're gonna, you're gonna wake up. So if you somehow can stay asleep in there, there's no, people who attach derogatory, like you make sleep a derogatory, you're asleep. Wake up, Shapo. How about you let us fucking sleep, asshole? How about that? Instead of, yeah. Okay, fine. We'll wake up. So what? Let's sleep. If you can sleep, sleep. Sleep. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. That's nice. It's nice. It's just when you get in that in-between period phase of sleeping and waking, that's where the torture is. A little fucking the insomnia of the human spirit. Tossing and turning in the bed of your life, going in and out of delusion, going from delusion to despair. That sucks. Delusion or despair. I think that's where, I think that's where Bowie like woke up as the, he woke up as the outsider and he was sort of, apologies to anybody who is not a Bowie fan, but this isn't really about Bowie, it's about all of us. So it's just like waking up as the outsider and then realizing that, not only is that a righteous path, but that there's a happiness and there's a sanity in acknowledging your true calling or your true feelings, that you're not betraying anybody or anything that you are actually, it's sort of doing what you're called to do, your actual job by being your fucking self. Yeah, and such a sweet thing really. That's such a sweet, it's such a sweet thing that the universe is saying, look, just be yourself. That's all I want you to do. Yeah, exactly. I'm not asking you to conquer the planet. I don't expect you to put out 1,000 incredible books or even one good book or even one good sentence, but just be yourself. Let's fucking hang out together, me, the universe and you, yourself and see what happens. And the other thing is you don't have to, like the other thing is like when you start thinking like, I'm gonna permanently be myself. No, you don't even have to think like that. You can do these, if you allow yourself the beautiful and ridiculous idea, just for a time being as a thought experiment of this dimension that we're in and this society that we're in being as repressive as North Korea, as repressive, only the way that it's repressive is far more insidious and that instead of there being this overt repression, telling you not to be yourself, it's a kind of subliminal secret repression that is demanding you to act a certain way, but the way they're demanding you to act a certain way is by making you pretend that you've just decided to be that way. And this is something that is so beautifully summed up by Zizak or how do you sell the fucking weirdo's name, Zizak, who says, if a father says to you, you know, whenever I start talking about him, I always start rubbing my nose because that's what he does whenever he's talking. He's got this weird twitch, but he says, if a father asks a son, there tells a son, you're going to your grandmother's house and you're gonna act nice when we get there. And that's just the way it is. That that form of oppression is way better than the form of oppression that comes from the father who's like, tomorrow we are going to your grandmother's house and I want you to decide whether or not you want to come. She would really like to see you, but it's up to you to decide whether or not you will come to your grandmother's house. And when we're there, it's up to you to decide if you're going to be a good, sweet grandson to someone who has not been feeling well lately, but I want you to decide. It's the same form of totalitarianism. The difference is the poor little bastard with the second dad, he's got to lie. Whereas at least the first one can be like, yeah, fine, dad, I'll fucking go and act like I fucking love my grandmother, even though I'd rather do a million other things, but if I resist, you're gonna fucking kill me, right? Because at least that one, there's a place for rebellion, you know? Whereas, so you lie yourself to fantasy that we are in this incredible totalitarian regime where you are being given the illusion of choice. You're being given the illusion of how to act. It just happens to be that all the decisions that you make about how you should be, have to coincide with all of reality. And if they don't, there's a massive amount of punishment that will instantaneously come to you in the form of every single person you know, thinking you're losing your goddamn mind. So you allow yourself this fantasy of like, oh shit, I'm in an internment camp, but no one knows they're in an internment camp. And then you can start doing these many rebellions, many thought crimes, where you just in the privacy of your own isolation away from anyone else, you just start being yourself there, whatever that may be. You know what I mean? You create these little bubbles of like, okay, okay, I'm gonna just admit the way I'm really been thinking, the way I really been feeling for the last however long. Oh wow, wow, wow, I'm miserable. I'm fucking miserable, wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay, okay, okay, we're miserable, we're miserable. I'm not really happy, I've just been pretending that way. And then you start doing that, and that's when I start getting the butterflies, you know? That's where you start getting that like bouncy feeling of like, oh, fuck this, I'm gonna get the fuck out of here. And maybe there's where you find the liberation that you're talking about, you know? That's where you find the fucking goddamn stuff of life. Finally, there's something to fight against, something to rebel against, and something big and real. And the moment you fucking really, if you really pull off being yourself, you've given a true gift to the world. Everyone will be so happy after they've made fun of you for a few years. Yeah, maybe misery is really just a notification on the Facebook of your brain. It's just a notification that you need to change something just like your point of vision. Maybe as a constructive notification, instead of it being a state that you just have to wallow in, it's really just a signifier, your body saying, change your diet, just change something, and you'll be okay, you'll be happy. Yeah, or you can start engaging in this incredible project that is a project that transcends all projects, which is the rebellion, the rebellion, revolution. That's what it is. You become a little mini-revolutionary. You start just by allowing yourself to pretend for a second that you are being constricted or held back, guaranteed you are, guaranteed you are. If you exist in any kind of community, you're more than likely the way that you're acting doesn't fully reflect who you truly are. And the reason that you're not reflecting who you truly are is the fear of what will happen, the repercussions that will come from your friends, family, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, cops, the government. So many things don't want you to act the way you are. It's for real, man. Wake up, sheeple! You are being fucking repressed, man. But the problem is, the thing has evolved so much to the point where we don't even recognize the repression. That's where it gets weird. Most of us, I mean, God damn it, that's not fair to say. I certainly don't, I'm a white dude. You know what, I mean, God forgive me, like I'm thinking like so many other people listening are like, what the fuck are you talking about? I got pulled over three times last week because I'm black. I know I'm being repressed, bitch. Shut the fuck up, go have another scoop of rice out of your rice cooker, a repressed one. But it's true, even us poor white dudes, we're getting repressed too, we all are, man. We're repressing each other in every single fucking moment. Every time you have any expectation of the way someone around you should act. And when they don't act like that, if you're a dick, boom. Congratulations, you're the tyrant emperor of whatever fucking awful little city state you've decided to rule in your social structure. So it's like we're repressing and we're repressed. And people like David Bowie, they make it over the fence. And then once they get over the fence, they start putting on shows. And everyone's like, wow, he's amazing. That's cool, I'm glad we talked about David Bowie, Emil. Yeah, I was actually missing, I was actually, I'd never like cried about my dad dying, but I cried like freaking three times about David Bowie. So that was kind of a mile marker. I don't think I'd ever experienced, you know, if that's cheesy or not. Like I'd never experienced a JFK or a John Lennon dying when I was like old enough to realize that it really was kind of a loss for the world. I mean, usually I'm exist in such a cold state, you know? I'm just like, oh, great, death isn't even fucking real. So I was actually glad that I was able to absorb it and feel sad, you know? I felt good to feel sad for once, but anyways. I think you felt his spirit. This is what I think. It's so hip, this is so, so like woo woo. But this is really what I think. You know that concept of how it's like everything, there's a limited supply of it. It's a really ridiculous idea, but like, there's only a certain amount of intelligence in the world. So the more people there are, the dumber we'll get because the intelligence gets diffused through the increased population. And so in that same way, I was thinking like, oh, David Bowie was a son and death was the release of all that energy into the biosphere. And the reason I've been thinking about him so much and the reason right after he died, I had some great days. Like what you're saying, well, I don't deserve this, but I feel great. And I was thinking that's cause his soul has exploded out and is surrounding the whole planet. And every single person is getting to experience the residual energy of this great being who is departed from this incarnation. And that's what we're all feeling. So the reason you were crying is cause you really were feeling his soul. And the reason he left that video behind was because it was his way of saying, yeah, I'm still here a little bit. Don't worry, I'm still here. And I like to believe that, man. I like to believe that like when a person dies, their spirit remains and in fact is more free and able to do more work. And that David Bowie has not stopped his great performance, but his performance continues in conversations like this and all the myriad of ways people are expressing their feelings of grief or confusion or whatever it may be about his passing. Yeah, I mean, certainly, usually when you see the pictures of black and white pictures of ladies like clutching a baby, crying, hearing about JFK, you don't think of it as like a electric state of love, but isn't that kind of what it is? You're being touched by how much you really care about something. When the wind blows, the trees sway. When a great being leaves the planet, the way you can see the soul blow through society is the weeping and tears. It's just the way you see the energy being moving through the biosphere. It's beautiful. It really is beautiful. And yeah, so I, man, but shit, it also sucks. This is why we gotta start downloading our consciousness. You know, if we'd gotten to that place where we could have downloaded David Bowie's consciousness, then every single person could have a little David Bowie living in their computer. What a lame way to wrap up this show. Yeah, totally. It's like for $9.99. Anyway, there's a couple of things I thought of. One of them is I think I wrote us a new song for our record. Great. And I'm really excited about it, but I need to shift back to that and we need to plan me coming down there to work with you one more time. Well, it needs to be before March or April or after that because I'm going away for the tour for a few months, so. Sure, yeah. That might be smart to kind of wrap up some of it. And then the other one is you've inspired me to experiment with starting a podcast, but not like a normal podcast. Nice. A little bit more like a audio book, like a story that's being told in chapters over the course of a year or something. Cool. So I wanna see how that goes. That's fucking cool. Are you gonna release it weekly or how's that gonna work? Are you releasing it at the end of a year? I was thinking like on the first of every month, it's like I want it to be like different than most podcasts in the sense that it's like each episode is like very, very succinct and kind of like up chapter of a story. It's not like necessarily that free form, although it breaks away. Well, I mean, my initial idea was I was gonna write this book for Drag City. The label has like, they publish books too. They do like Bill Callahan books and I think maybe Waldo's done something. But I was gonna do this thing that was springing off of the story about my dad and Johnny Mitchell and the fake Tim Buckley, this thing that Dangerous Minds posted this really strange family story about the FBI like confronting my dad. Long story. What? Yeah, I was gonna write this book about it and then- Why did the FBI confront? Oh, right, tell me the book. Well, on his deathbed, I think I told him I was really into the CIA stuff. I was reading a lot about the CIA and I think he said he had told me that he had encountered the FBI or CIA like, I guess it was the FBI three different times and so he told me the different stories of situations he was in with the FBI, which would have been much more fascinating if we had more time to talk about it than if he found it more interesting. But anyway, so that's springing into this long story that you can read on Dangerous Minds that I wrote about, I'm sure you can Google it. Cool. It's really, it's a fucked up crazy story but I was talking about- Send me the link and I'll put it in the comments of this. Yeah, yeah, I'll send it over to you. There's a lot about my dad I didn't really know because it's a very, very cloudy time. Whoa, was he smuggling dope or something? Well, I was talking to a family friend on the phone yesterday that's 77 and was really close friends with him and he was telling me all sorts of shit that my dad was the one that found David Crosby's boat for him and the one of the monkeys lent David Crosby $20,000 to buy it. This is a very famous boat that's on the cover of those Crosby Stills and Ash records. He was like telling me all this stuff and so I'm thinking that after I start this podcast and really get a lot of the opening chapters out of the way then I'll switch over to more interview based stuff where people can kind of shed light on some of the characters that are involved in it. But the way the podcast will start out will be largely for the first year if I can make it through a full year of these kind of chapters. It's pretty much just gonna be about being a teenager and so you'll be in probably every chapter in some way because it'll weave in with stuff we went through. I haven't quite got to when we went to Boston on that spring break and we would like took acid in the car, remember that? Yep. That was so stupid. I mean, there's just like such a hilarious thing. It wasn't like whoever we were with, I remember like they didn't want us to take acid, right? Wasn't there some element of having to sneak the acid? Maybe, that's the only time in my life I've ever just taken acid in a car, like for a car ride. For some reason, I kind of recall that that trip but also like I recall someone didn't, I remember like more part of what I wanted to do. I remember there was just some element in the car of someone being like, no, did you guys take acid? Something was stupid like that. There's always somebody who's like, not now. I can barely remember that part of it. That's actually like that trip is gonna be one of the climaxes and it's hard because these stories are really complex. So you have to really think about all the details because if you miss some major detail, it's really unfortunate. Cause you know, say you say somebody told the future and then you went through this experience and then you tell somebody the story and you forget that your friend told the future. You know, you just, it's like, it's very hard to like keep it all in your mind. But anyway, as we keep going, maybe I could have you like help me iron out like your version of something. You know, I've never really got into, there's so many different things. Although we've done so many of these things. There's so many different things we never have even talked about. Dude, I would love to help. This sounds incredible. I'm so glad that you're doing this, man. That's so cool. If you want to like, if you want me to like email Dustin at Farrell Audio, or if you want to do it through like a collective like that, let me know, man. It's such a cool idea. Yeah, that's the next step. I'm on episode three or four. I'm about to do number four. So, and I'm heavily, heavily editing them. It's taking me hundreds of hours. Oh, sure. Oh God. It's gonna take a long time, but I'd like to get, you know, a bunch. So I really know what I'm looking at before I think about it. Man, editing fucking podcasts. It's so weird how long it can take to edit something. And it can be so time consuming. Are you putting music in it in any way? Well, then that'll be like maybe then, yeah, I actually am editing a lot of shit into it. But that'll be the next step is that I'd really like to have a sub chapter of it where I can just talk about the records. When I get back from Europe, you know, talk about the records that I bought. No, I mean, that sounds a little bit academic, but like it would be much more entertaining than that. Like a really kind of colorful style of a radio show. But yeah, I'm like editing in like episode one right now is me moving in with you and LA and getting stocked. Who wait, who is stalking you? Well, we don't say his name. That's the thing. Oh, oh yeah. That is one of the funniest talkers to have. No, I know, it is pretty funny actually, yeah. Oh my God. That's episode one because what happens is like I'm able, I thought that would be an easy way to start out because I can kind of very casually just start with you and I and LA and being really pretty naive at the time in our way, you know. We were so naive. I know so many people have been stalked by that dude. Oh wow. So you could actually come on say after like four episodes and actually clear up from your perspective tons of the stories that I've told. That would be interesting. Well, I mean, that's kind of like, it's so funny because that thing you're talking about who we can't say that it's so funny because that people don't recognize that that's a kind of like sport in LA. That's like falcon hunting. There's a whole group of these dudes who like pray on like young, cute boys who come into Los Angeles and like they will get you and they have, they will get their claws in you if you don't watch out. It does, it's so spocked when it does happen. I've seen them. I've seen them. I've seen, you know, the guy walk by at the, when you're eating brunch outside dragging along with him like a cat with a broken squirrel carcass. Some young, doped up, fresh to Hollywood kid who's just accidentally gotten yanked into a quicksand pit composed of Xanax and psychic manipulation at the highest level. It's wild. Well, that's one major aspect of the podcast. It'll just be like sort of a pure storytelling podcast so that if you did have a specific tale that was composed of like one of the darkest moments of your life meeting up with one of the most like humorous situations you've ever been in, that's kind of gonna be a lot of the heart of it. So it would be awesome if you told, right now I'm really just focusing on when you're like basically 16 and taking acid for the first time. And of course I'd tell the story about getting kidnapped and all there's like, there's like, there's so many things that happen right when you're being molded that I find scientifically super interesting because you're not really you yet, but you're sort of like, there's a lot of predictions that come out of these situations that mold you, you know? And so I'm sure you have some hilarious battle stories. Is that good? What's the name of the podcast? Well, I didn't totally decide yet, but I think maybe for now, I'm thinking it'll be Drifter's Sympathy because that's like a Holy Son's concept that really came from, it came from a, from coming home after school, I used to watch like Unsolved Mysteries and shit like that. You know, when you're like 14 years old, I was like addicted to that stuff. And I think it was like one of those shows like real stories of the highway patrol or something about, it was like, began with this kid, this guy in a creek and he's just throwing stones. And it's like, Gary Leakley was a Drifter and he was pondering the state of his life one day. And it's like this really sad autumnal scene and he climbs up out of the ditch and an old couple are driving a minivan towards him and he just picks up a rock and throws it at their windshield just out of some sort of Raskolnikov kind of absurd moment where he just doesn't know why he's alive. And like they pull over at a gas station and they like tell him, this is just my memory of getting home at age 14 and watching the show. And then like they pull over and tell a cop that he's down the street. The cop turns around, goes back and pulls up to him on the side of the road and the Drifter just like takes out a pocket knife and just starts walking lazily towards the cop, like kind of like Jason and Friday the 13th. And the cop just pulls out his gun and shoots him dead. And then it went to like a Clorox bleach commercial or something. And I just remember that moments like that where I just couldn't really cope with the reality of what I'd just seen and Drifter's sympathy as a phrase always like stayed with me as I, maybe as I worked in the homeless shelter for 13 years or something. But anyway, so it seems to be some sort of mile marker for my records and my life. So I'm right now, I'm sticking with that. Man, this sounds so cool. Any way that I can help, just let me know. I can't wait to hear these, it sounds so cool. Awesome, cool. Okay, well, let's do more. And you're going to Europe real quick. You're going to Europe when? Holy suns goes for their first full band European tour on January 26th. So it's like in like eight days. And we hit every country over there until about mid-February. And then when I get back, I'm actually like totally free for the rest of the year in terms of my physical responsibilities. So I bet we, maybe we should just like, we should plan something now while we're talking about it. Well, let's just do it in, I don't know, February sometime. I'm around all February. Okay, well, let's wrap this up and let's start planning. And where can people find your tour dates, man? You'd have to go to Holy Sons on Facebook and you'll see it's like, you know, couple shows in Italy, couple in France, Switzerland, all over the place over there. I'll have links at dunkatrustle.com. Anything else, Emil? Where can people find your music? Can I play one of your songs at the end of this podcast? Yeah, yeah.

182^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 557: Teijo Munnich Transcript and Discussion^2023-03-19^Greetings friends! We have a very special podcast for you today. Today's guest is Tejo Munich. She is the first person to really introduce me to Buddhism. When I was in college, I did an internship at a Zen temple and it was her temple and it was amazing. She is an incredible person. If you live in Asheville, check out the Great Tree Temple. If you don't live in Asheville, I would highly recommend going to their website. You can find all those links at dunkintrustle.com. They have weekly meditations, among other things, and of course they do retreats there. So that's Great Tree Temple in Asheville, North Carolina. Okay everybody, strap in. Here we go. Welcome back to the DTFH, Tejo Munich. Welcome! One of my favorite moments in my, I hate to say this word, spiritual life, big moment for me, happened when I was doing this internship at your Zen temple and my preconceived notions about Buddhism were based, I think, mostly on movies and a fantasy that I would meet someone like you and you would impart to me some kind of data that then I could use to, I mean I don't think I would have used these words back then, but gain power or something, you know, like I would become wise and I would become interesting, I would become more attractive, maybe, you know, like cool, he's a Buddhist, he meant. So when I met you to start this internship, the internship involved cleaning the floors of your temple. You had me clean and you taught me a way of cleaning floors that I've used throughout my entire life. You said this is the way that they clean floors in the temples in Japan. You explained to me that they have these rice walls that are very delicate. If you hit them too hard, you could break through them potentially. I thought that was so cool and weird and like inconvenient, knowing me, if I lived in one of those, I would have torn many of them down, but this method of cleaning the floors is you take, and I'm sorry if many of you already know this, but you take these cloths, dip them in water, and push them across the floor with your body weight. Basically, you turn yourself into human swiffer and oh my goodness, it just, the floors are sparkling after this and it's one of the most pragmatic things that I've taken from Buddhism is like, I can polish a floor. But then I remember becoming frustrated after a few of these meetings. Also, of course, you were having to meditate and you had to sit in the lotus position, which back then was hard for me, but I could still do it. It's a little more painful these days than it was then, but at some point, I remember becoming very frustrated because you were not giving me what I wanted, no books. Where is the data? And I finally said to you, aren't you going to give me a book or something? Like, isn't there something I should read or study here? And you said, what was the Buddha doing when he gained realization? And I thought about it for a second. I was like, right, he was meditating. And I've carried that with me through my whole life anytime I get that ferocious hunger for more information. How, you know, down the road, I've read things about a practice, a balanced practice. I've read that I've heard the comparison between two wings of a bird, one wing of the bird, contemplation, study, the other wing of the bird practice that you need these two together, that you just won by itself is an imbalance. But if I was that weird bird right now, I would be like flapping around with one wing, which is, I can parrot so many things. I think that's one of my talents. I can hear a thing, I can parrot it out. But the sitting part, the meditation part, Tejo, that's very difficult for me, very difficult. And I would love to talk to you a little bit about that, the resistance that why is it hard? Why is why? Why, why isn't this a thing that you would think it would be so easy? You know, sitting down, I mean, I could sit down and watch TV for hours. Why can I sit down and watch my own mind? Did she hang up? No, I'm here. I just don't have an answer. Sorry. Here we go again. You know, I still have resistance. I talk about that all the time. And why? I don't know why. Yeah. Just like, you know, I mean, I do ask that question. I ask that question of myself all the time. It's like, why is human life the way it is? You know, I sort of agree with the way Buddhism talks about it. But just recently, I was saying, you know, but why? You know, but it's just an unanswerable question. And I don't know why, you know, people ask me sometimes, well, do you think you can, you can kind of get addicted to meditation? Like, not me personally, because I have too much precepts to say, you know. So yeah, I don't know why the resistance, but I do know that one thing that I have discovered is that when we take one step beyond the resistance, that's awakening. Yeah. Because letting go is awakening. Right? Do you have anything to add? The term awakening. You know, I'm sure you know how it is. Over time, you know, you hear these words over and over again. And when you hear them initially, and they somehow make sense, awakening, that sounds good. But what are we awakening from? What is the thing we're waking up from? Our own delusion.

Yeah, and that delusion is, you know, this is another thing. My teacher, David Nickturn, you know, he choked him trumpet rights about this, but sort of this, he talks about, you know, finer grades of sandpaper. When you're sanding something, you use finer and finer grades of it. Again, initially, you hear something like that, and you think, oh, yeah, of course, my delusion. I'm deluded in the sense that I think ignoring my own suffering is a solution that this is somehow alleviating the problem or that by distracting myself from the suffering, or by blaming other people for the suffering, whatever the game is. But then, at least, and again, any correction would be very grateful for, but then suddenly, you start realizing, well, this delusion, it seems to go deeper than that. I'm not just dealing with some kind of like surface level obvious sort of delusion, but it appears that something about my idea of who I am in relation to everything else might be fundamentally incorrect or something. And then, at some point, it becomes almost unbearable to imagine this letting go of this thing. It becomes almost unbearable. You know, you hear, look, there is suffering, the cause of suffering is attachment. You think, oh, well, that's easy. I'll just let go. But this seems more like an electric fence situation, you know, or grabbing something that letting go of feels almost suicidal. Can you talk about that? Yeah, I know exactly. I was talking about Tsunyata, which is the teaching about, it's usually called emptiness. I sometimes I call it everythingness because really, what we experience is not lack of something, but rather the completeness of life, you know, a lot of life working together. And which is really what Tsunyata is, but actually the actual experience of Tsunyata is it feels like, you know, we don't have anything to hold on to. It feels like we're suspended in space or in free fall or something like that. And I was talking about, well, actually I was teaching a class at Warren Wilson on it, on emptiness for a while. And so I was talking about the Zen Center. And we were discussing the Garjuna and the various teachers about emptiness. And somebody came to talk to me and she said, I think I've had an experience of emptiness. And, you know, it sort of feels like the bottom falls out. And she described it to me. And I said, yeah, that's an experience. And she said, well, I don't like it. And I said, okay, so why do you hate it? She says, because I don't, I don't know what's coming next. And she never came back. But you know, there's a guy by the name of Shenzhen Yang who's studied various kinds of Buddhism. And right now, I think he identifies as a Zen teacher, while I don't even know if he's still alive. But I heard him speak years ago. And he said that experience of Shunyata is what John of the Cross describes as the dark night of the soul. And when you experience it, what you need to do is just walk into it or just step into it. And I mean, I was thinking as you were talking that actually to say, to step one, take one step beyond the resistance, actually, I think it should be to take one step into the resistance. And I think when we experience that emptiness, that sort of free fall, like, what the hell, you know, even asking a question like, yeah, but why do we suffer? Why do we suffer in this way? Why do we have this sense of dissatisfaction? Do you know, I ask that question is to want to have something to respond to again, it's Yuka itself. Yeah, because who can answer this question? All we can talk about is what the experience is, you know? Yes. Yeah, you know, the experience of emptiness, I like to imagine I've had that. But now these days, anytime I have some kind of epiphanous moment, when I'm meditating, I get worried, because I'm an addict, I get attached to that moment. I found there to be like the sort of resonance with the descriptions of emptiness that I've read about, heard about. But then what I found to be difficult was not the emptiness as much as sort of returning or forgetting or sort of having like, not just a moment of it, but, you know, a month, you know, enough of a sense of, wow, I don't just don't feel as compressed into my identity as I did before. I don't feel, I think I understand what they mean when they say there is a compassion and emptiness that are kind of the same thing. I can see how there would be a sense of wanting to not just alleviate yourself of the, of all the things that go along with being self-identified, but other people too, how you could see this as some kind of, I don't know, seed of neurosis or disorders, and an antidote to that. So I did not feel, I did feel a, not in a sense of freefall, but just more of a sense of, I don't know, liberation or something, went away. I, and I blabbered about it. It was so embarrassing. I talked to my teacher about it. Over the years of meditating, I've like gotten better at not like trumpeting out some fleeting experience that seems mystical, but this one, wow, this really seemed to be it. And I told my wife about it, then the next fight that we got in, she's like, wow, huh? You really had an awakening. I'm like, I didn't. All right, I didn't. I clearly didn't. So yeah, I think what about that suffering? The suffering of having these fleeting or false glimpses of something that you've imagined to be this or that, but when in fact, it's just another delusion, another passing, whatever. Yeah, great. You had some sense of emptiness, but look at you now. Look at you now. Your ego is back at the wheel, driving your car, you're defending everything all over again. What about that? That seems to be so painful, Tejo, you know, those moments of not the emptiness, but returning to the stuff. Well, the problem isn't that the experience wasn't authentic, I don't think. I think the problem is that we somehow think we can hold on to that. Yes. That's the heartbreak. That's it right there. You know, that's the heartbreak. This is the unbearable thing for me. I mean, I have kids and talk about wanting to hold on to something. I mean, you know, it's like they're so beautiful, but they're growing up. It's all the cliches that parents say. Look how quickly this situation is changing. Look how quickly time is going by, and that is so, that pisses me off. I'll be honest, that really does make me angry. I don't know who I'm angry at, but that situation is so, I know this sounds childish. It just doesn't seem fair. I mean, it wouldn't be fair to crystallize my children either as some kind of horrific infinite babies. That would make anyone who did that would be a monster. I mean, the idea that you would want to trap anyone in any kind of condition, especially as like an infinite kid because it pleases you is, oh, I mean, that's monstrous, but yet it's there. And I guess it's the identical mistake when you're experiencing this moment of suddenly waking up from a nightmare or something. You know, it's like that. I mean, I would say my experience of the emptiness, I'm not saying my life is necessarily a nightmare, but you know, when you're in the nightmare and getting chased by the lion or whatever, and you really remember, oh, I'm dreaming. Oh, it's no longer a nightmare. Now it's a really great dream. And I think those moments of emptiness, that's what it was like. That's the experience for me, that kind of relief of like, oh, right. Like a little bubble, a bubble of our ideas pops. Yes. But remembering, I didn't remember it once we had that experience. I mean, I had some experiences like that in the monastery where I was just like, one was everything, you know? Yeah. And then I found myself for the next two or three days, this was like during a session, trying to get that feeling back or trying to hold onto that experience. So it wasn't that it wasn't an authentic experience, but it was that I wanted to hold on to it, you know? And so you go down the line and say, yeah, where is that emptiness now? It's way back there because it's past experience, you know? Yeah. And we have to, what we learned, what Zazen can teach us, I think, is to just recognize delusion and by recognizing it, it dissolves, it starts to go away. It doesn't have a, you know, because delusion is something like it's how to hold on us until we see it. And then when we see it, we're in charge of what we can do. Well, let's talk about that. You know, I, I mean, I believe you, but and right now things are really great in my life, like there's harmony, everything's nice and there's good luck and feel inspired. But, you know, in and I recognize, oh, great, great. Now I'm attaching to this, you know, in the same way, you know, the winter was not great for me. Like I have, I think I probably have seasonal effectiveness where every winter I get kind of depressed and gloomy and just awful to be around. And then the spring starts coming and I get like, I start like waking up early again, making my bed. It's great. But I recognize, oh, well, now I'm, now I'm attaching to this. Now I'm like allowing my conditions to be the progenitor of my great mood. And I know that this one is fleeting as well. And also I recognize whatever this, you know, temporary condition might be, it's not the same. What's the kind of like happiness I'm feeling now it's not the same as that waking up from a nightmare feeling became when I was meditating. It's not the same. It's more, I don't know, matter based. There's a component of greediness in it or something. I don't know. All the, you know, ambitious and ego gratifying. So even though intellectually, I can look back to that moment and think, well, there was that. It's very similar to remembering a dream. It's all foggy now. It's kind of like, I don't know if that was anything at all. And so I can't, when I place, even when I place my attention on the fleeting nature of gain or loss or whatever, it doesn't seem to do what you're saying. I don't feel a dissolution. I don't feel a return to that emptiness. I just feel like a sense of kind of failure or like running my head against a wall or something or throw, you know, like that. The kind of like, well, and I don't mind that necessarily. It's just, yeah, I'm very attached to those moments of bliss that derive from a practice. So I think though, from my experience that, yeah, when we have that kind of experience, it's like a surprise, but then it becomes, you know, it sort of integrates itself into our lives. And so it's not, it's not such a big deal anymore. It's a little more familiar. Thank you, HelloFresh for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

You know, it sort of integrates itself into our lives. And so it's not it's not such a big deal anymore. It's a little more familiar. You know, and so yeah, you don't feel it. But it doesn't mean that the very fact that you're recognizing all these things that you're doing that you just described to me, that's that's part of the awakening process is to just keep recognizing these things and recognizing how our mind is deceiving us. Yeah, I think I see what you're saying now. That's really awesome. Yeah, it's kind of like it's a very that's very sweet. It's um, okay grief. When my mom died, I went through the grief process. I mean, I don't know if you ever stop going through that process. But you know, the initial experience of grief is it's wild, you know, like sobbing fits just brokenheartedness just devastated. And I remember I I was lucky enough to get to chat with Joan Halifax, Rosie Joan Halifax, and I was all busted up. And she said, well, you know, just recognize a window is open in this grief that won't it won't stay open forever, the window closes. And I, you know, you know, when I was in though, when I heard her say that I always think it was like, well, can I close it now? Like, it's close. I don't want this window open. This is terrible. But then yeah, sure enough, the grief starts dissipating or, you know, becomes more bearable, softer. And then I found myself grieving for the grief. I wanted the grief back. It was the grief was making me feel connected to my mom. You know, it was it was like as close as I could get to her with in and when it started going away, it was like, Oh, great. So now I won't even have that anymore. Now that's gone too. So I don't even get the grief. I don't even get to feel this anymore. Though it still comes back sometimes. And I when it comes back now, I welcome it. But I think this is what we're talking about here is like, like that, that maybe the grief isn't really gone. It's just inundated everything. It's just become a part of your life. It's this is just life now. And yeah, and this emptiness or this these experiences, it's not that they go anywhere. It's just that how long can you be astounded by anything? How long can you be astounded and and high intoxicated? It just becomes part of who you are. That's really cool. Thank you. Thank you. And you know, I was thinking about my experience of grief, as you were talking about it, and I think it's, it's, it's not just that we're grieving the loss of that person, which we are, but I think we're also grieving our own demise. You know, our fear of death, because it puts us like, it puts impermanence right in front of us, or I remember when my sister died suddenly, I remember coming back after her funeral, and just allowing myself the time to kind of process that he not engaging me too much. And what kept coming up for me was, oh, yes, this is a great opportunity to experience the impermanence of life, because like you say, it's a window. It's just a window of time that we shut down after a while, when we sort of lost our connection with this person because of their own, you know, they're biodegradable, and they can't be sickled, right? So you don't have that same presence as when you're alive. So that, that dissipates. So we do, and I remember after kind of your Roshi died, you know, there's that period that is identified as anger in the grieving process. And I, how it manifested for me was that I just wouldn't bullshit anybody, anybody that would say anything. I just like, I was just like, you know, everything just came blubbering out, however, however I thought of it, you know, and I really, really liked it. And I thought, oh, this is, this is something I really had to embrace. And I think that, you know, there's two ways of approaching emptiness, which is really what you experience when you, when you're grieving, you're experiencing the impermanence of life, which is what emptiness is about. You know, the things that are always changing in that we just kind of let ourselves be with it, even though we have to have some direction in our lives in order to survive. Otherwise we wouldn't be, we wouldn't cook, you know, but to be able to experience that impermanence is actually a great thing, but it's also a very scary thing. And so we want to run away with it, run away from it. Like you described, can I just close this window? Yeah. But then we lose our connection. And then we say, oh, that's right. I mean, oh, that was something good. And then we, we can't go back because we've already kind of walked away from it and entered back into that delusionary, delusionary world, which says there is something I can hold on to. I had this experience when I was reading this book called The Externation of No Self by Bernadette Roberts, who was a, she was a Catholic nun that left the convent and got married and had children. And then she yearned for the, the, the contemplation of life. And so she would go off, you know, when the kids got to the point where she could leave them. And she would go off and she had this one experience that she lost her whole sense of who she was, and it really scared her. And so she wrote three books about it. The first book she talked about right away after she had this experience. And it was so, I was so taken with her description of it. And I kept, and she kept going round and round like, how do I understand this? How do I understand this? And then she'd spit it all out. I don't be like, Oh my gosh, you got it. You understand it. But then she was, she kept going around and around and around. And I kept telling her, don't you understand? Don't you understand? You're talking to the book. Every time I close the book, I was myself in a transition place. I had just come back from the Sahara, and I was getting ready to go to practice period at our monastery in Minnesota. And so I didn't really have, I couldn't really, I didn't have time to get a job. There was only about a month. And then, you know, but I was sort of working for a friend and she was paying for paying me and I paid my rent. And I realized that I had for a sense of exactly what, what Bernadette Roberts was talking about, of, you know, feeling like, Oh, I need something to hold on to. I mean, I need, maybe I need a real life and not this stuff that just kept me floating around from one monastery to another. You know, maybe I need a job and a car and, you know, be a real person and like everybody else, you know. And I realized that there were two options here. One was to think that I was a failure and I had grasped onto something. And the other was to recognize that this was an opportunity for infinite possibility. Right. A real creative moment because I wasn't attaching to anything. And I think this is what we have to navigate in life is this relative world that we live in, which does require some level of kind of holding onto stuff and making some kind of structure and the ultimate reality, which is also a part of the reality in which we live. How do we bring those two together and find that mental path? Yeah. So and, and we can't hold on to absolute reality. And we really can't hold on to relative reality either. But that recognition, those moments of recognition are those moments where they come together. But how do we see it? Do we see it as failure or do we see it as infinite possibility? That's the thing. Yeah, that's where it comes back to the remembering that you imagined. Yeah. Well, you know, I am. So yeah, I'm sure you're aware of like Carol Act, the beat poets. And I can remember reading because I always thought they were called the beat poets because like, you know, the beat drums, I don't know, some beatnik jazz, whatever. I read that and maybe it meant that, but it also meant no, we're defeated. We're beat, beat. And yeah, it's cool. It's cool. You know, Carol Act was very, it really ended Buddhism. So many great poems about it. But so as far as the failure thing goes, I think on one level, I do align myself with that idea. I mean, if you do catch a glimpse of that thing, aren't you beat then in the sense that if you haven't caught a glimpse of that, and if you have been entertaining the idea that maybe you're actually immortal, I entertain that idea. When I was younger, before I got testicular cancer, I would kick around the idea. Well, I'm the only one who knows I have sin. I'm aware. I don't know everyone else. Maybe they're not aware, like true solipsism, you know, didn't really believe it all the way, but it's a way to delude yourself into thinking you're not going to die. Kick around the idea that just maybe this is a dream. You're not going to die. Or even worse, subscribe to some transhumanist prophecy. Well, we're going to be able to extend our lifespans, put our consciousness into a chip. Whatever the thing is, all these, you know, are mechanisms to amplify confusion surrounding mortality, probably. But so you catch a glimpse of this thing that you are mentioning, this oneness or whatever the zillions of ways it's been described. And you're beat because you lose your, you lose death. You don't lose the physical death. You know, you're still going to die. It's not like you have that glimpse and you're now an idiot and think you're not going to die. But more along the lines of the earth stuff, it does pale in comparison to that. And that is a kind of remembering more than a discovery or something. It's not like when you encounter it, there isn't some sense of like, oh, right, like in a dream, it's not like suddenly you freak out in the dream. You're like, wait a minute, I'm dreaming, like, oh, right, it's a dream. So in that moment, it's defeat in a certain way. If your goal was to succeed at living forever or getting high on the earth as much as you are getting high on the imaginary finish lines that you'd set up for yourself and you're going across that line, that's when I'll be happy. So that is a form of defeat, I think, or failure or something. I mean, not in the negative sense, but just. Yeah, I think there's a difference between being beat and beat down though. Yes, there is. Absolutely. So anyway, I want to say thank you, Duncan, because we're daddy loving a pot. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you for allowing me to do this.

Enjoy this incarnation and remember your former memories, abituations, fears, anger and anxiety are merely an illusion, a kind of temporal displacement that comes from being inserted into this simulation via a human vagina. Now enjoy human incarnation and remember no matter what happens you're going to be fine. Boy what a great podcast we have for you today friends. Shane Moss is here and we're going to dive right into it but first some very quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Casper.com. Go to Casper.com. Ford slash Family Hour and use offer code Family Hour and you'll get $50 off a brand new mattress. Friends there's no need for you to be sleeping on that terrible massive old mouse skulls and broken twigs, leaves that you gathered up from a nearby forest and pelts of half rotting rabbit hair. You can replace that shitty old mattress with a brand new mattress without having to go through the hell of wandering through some never ending maze of mattresses in a dastardly mattress store being run with some hypnotic mattress minotaur who gallops within the maze of mattresses and tries to trick you into paying way more money than you need to for that delightful pad that you're going to be sleeping, making love upon and who knows what else you may do upon that very important boat of sleep that we call a mattress. Casper saves us from the terrors of a mattress store where you can end up paying way too much, well over 1500 bucks for a mattress. Here's what I got to say about Casper is in these are the required talking points. Casper is an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. It combines springy latex and supportive memory foams to create an award winning sleep service with just the right sink and just the right bounce. Time Magazine named it one of the best inventions of 2015. In fact, it's now the most awarded mattress of the decade and I'm going to give them an award right now. Casper, I hereby award you with the best mattress in the universe award, so you just got another award. Free shipping and returns to U.S. and Canada. You can try it for 100 nights risk-free in your own home. If you don't love it, they'll pick it up and refund you everything. And it's made in America, not some awful warehouse in a terrible part of the world where people are physically being restrained from jumping out of windows because they're so depressed. This is being created in a nice American company somewhere. So that's what I got to say, but I sleep on a mattress. That's what I sleep on. I actually sleep on a Casper mattress. When I lay my hairy sweaty body down at night, that hairy sweaty body lays upon a Casper. And it's a wonderful mattress. So if you don't want to deal with having to go shop for a mattress, which can be a really traumatic experience, then just give them a shot. Go to casper.com, forward slash family hour, use offer code family hour, store your old stinky blood soaked forensic file style mattress in some part of the house. And if you don't like your Casper, send it back and put that old stinky yellowing awful thing that you've been sleeping on right back on your bed. Cover it with a blanket and forget that this ever happened. But you won't do that because you're going to love your mattress. They somehow managed to fit it into a box. You open the box and the damn thing just jumps right out of the box and into your life. And you can start humping on that thing right away. Casper.com, forward slash family hour, use offer code family hour, you're going to love it. A tremendous thank you to all of you who have heard my call and have been using my Amazon portal.

Okay, pals, I hope your pineal glands are ready to be decalcified because Shane Moss is about to blast them with rays of pure knowledge and love. Everybody, please welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast Shane Moss. Shane, man, thank you so much for coming up here to do this show. Thanks for having me. I hope it wasn't a wretched drive. No, it was fine. It took me about 40 minutes from Culver City. Oh my God, thank you. You came from Culver City. Oh, no, it was so easy. That's a true act of love. With you, it's cool, man, because I have to keep saying, well, let's not talk before the podcast. We were starting to have this really cool conversation about stand-up comedy and overcoming whatever the boundary is between doing what you think comedy should look like and doing what you want to do as comedy. And it seems like you have this interesting, and I get to say a word I love to say, bifurcation happening in your craft. I do, yeah. I mean, I've been, so the last 10 years of my life, I've been a full-time comic making my living in comedy clubs. Just, you know, entertaining groups of strangers, you know, maybe 10, 20 people a show. If I'm lucky, like, know who I am and familiar with my stuff and whatnot and trying to figure all of that out. And now I started a year ago with this, a good trip show that I've been doing about psychedelics doing indie venues for, I always did a few indie venues here and there. What is the show called? A Good Trip. A Good Trip. Yeah. It used to be called This Is Your Shane On Drugs, which was way better. And, but everyone thought I was going to be on drugs and I thought I was going to be like glamorizing like heroin and stuff like that. So, so I, so I started doing this like a year ago, just doing some small indie venues and it went really well right away. And then I, I still have trouble getting people in and then I kind of figured out some of the marketing for it, made some tweaks and have been filling rooms. So now I'm doing a 65 city tour with it. 65. Yeah. That is so, are you just, are you driving in your car? Yeah, yeah. Now, why not an RV? Why not rent an RV? I wanted to. I just don't have the money for it right now, to be honest. But if you, you don't, you think that the hotel fee costs are going to be comparable to, are going to be less than renting an RV. I mean, I think maybe if I could rent an RV like halfway through the tour or something like that and finish the rest of it out, maybe something like that would work for me. Cause I'll tell you, man, we, you know, when we went to Burning Man, we rented an RV first experience with an RV and it's the coolest. Yeah. It's the coolest thing ever. What was it like 200 bucks a day or something like that? Well, it's for Burning Man. So they like really ratchet up the price because they know you're, you're taking their fucking sweet precious baby into the middle of a drug, fuel, desert pagan festival where it's going to get whipped by hot sands, potential for all kinds of puke and jizz that's spreading all over it. So they like rightfully ratchet up the price. But I think you can get RVs, you can rent them for pretty cheap, man. I'll give you the, you don't want to use RV America. There's like, or rent America. Anyway, we don't have to have an RV talk, but I'm telling you, man. Just get a monthly rate or something like that. I bet you could get a monthly rate. And what I would do is I'd calculate 65 shows, however much it's going to cost for hotels. Airbnb's and stuff like that. Because what are you looking at? I'm going to do a little bit of couch surfing here and there. I mean, I mean, basically I'm looking at probably about a hundred bucks a day for accommodations. But I want to, if I could just buy an RV right now, I would. I just don't have the funds for it. It's surprisingly cheap depending on the ones you get, you know. Less than you would expect for a rolling pleasure house. It's like 30 K something like that. When you call it a rolling pleasure house, I'm like, what am I doing without a rolling pleasure house? You're really selling this idea. I mean, it just makes sense logically for what I'm doing. I'm hoping to do the same kind of show next year. I mean, it'll be different, but the same sort of like a big tour like this. And I'm hoping that I'll just own an RV at that time. God, the dream. Now, this is a 60, this is 65. 65. It was going to be like 30 or 40 cities to start and then everything kept on going well. And the booking, it was really way easier than I thought it would be. And everything lined up really quickly. I just did a, like, I don't know, 28 shows in a row and I'm still recovering. What was it like? It was the best. Yeah. See, I've never done anything like this before. I'm a hair nervous, but most gigs are only like three hours apart. And I loved just like three hours of driving. That's when I get all of my best thinking done and voice notes. I just, I was in a, you know, bus, man. So I was in like another rolling pleasure house. So from my experience was not, I didn't have to drive myself. That's awesome. So if you got to do these three hour trucks in between shows, you just need to make sure that you've scheduled some nice breaks in between. You got to have these breaks, man. If you haven't put breaks in, I would go back and look at the schedule and put some breaks in because after seven shows of driving, I have like Monday, like a Monday off here or there or a Sunday off here and there. It's during football season, which I mean, it's a psychedelic tour. So I don't, I don't anticipate football interfering with that as much as other shows. But, but yeah, I have, I have probably like one day off a week until Christmas. And then, and then, yeah. And then after Christmas, I have a big Christmas break. I also have a small Thanksgiving break. So I do have a couple of breaks in there. I have a break around Halloween for, I'm going to spend a couple of days in New York. So I'm breaking it up a little bit. Now, when I was just at Burning Man and I saw Rick Doblin give this amazing talk on, are you familiar with Rick Doblin? Yeah, Maps is actually the honorary sponsor of my tour. Oh, beautiful. Yeah, yeah. We're doing cross promotion. They're going to promote my show to all their people and I'm going to have information and stuff at all my shows for them. Stuff about the Zendo project. Yeah, yeah. So they're doing incredible work. And one of the things that Rick Doblin said during this talk, and I've heard him mention it before, but it really stuck with me in this particular talk because, you know, he started off by talking about how the Nixon administration intentionally made psychedelics illegal because they wanted to figure out a way to destabilize and destroy the hippie subculture that was springing. Yeah. The smartest way to do it was to make the sacramental substances that the leaders of the movement were taking illegal. Yeah. You could destroy the whole thing. And so then he said, he talked about how because of that, all this misinformation has been distributed about psychedelics and then how now one activist move that every person should be doing who has experienced any kind of realizations or improvement in their life conditions from psychedelics is coming out of the psychedelic closet. And I really love that terminology for it because I know a lot of people who can't talk about the psychedelics that they do. That was me. I mean, I only, I did how this tour came about originally. I mean, I didn't want to tell, I would do some jokes in my material a few minutes here and there, usually like really silly stories, you know, it wouldn't be like super informational or whatever like it is now. And I was on, you made it weird a while back and we weren't even going to, weren't planning on talking about this. Just happened. DMT happened to be brought up, which is something I'm a fan of and I've done a lot of and we started talking about it. And then all of a sudden, like my agent happened to listen to it actually and my agent was cool enough rather than to be like, Hey, are you on some crazy drugs? She was like, what the hell was that? I want to know more about that DMT. And I was like, well, I do have an hour of material about this stuff. I'm just not ready to like come out of the closet about it. And she's like, no, you got to do it. Right. And yeah, I think, I think a lot of people are coming out now. I mean, I interview scientists for my podcast. Here we are. And I talk with some people afterwards and they're like, you'd be surprised how many people in academia have, you know, dabbled a bit. I think that it's a pretty, it's, it's a very intense thing to like, because, you know, you hear about like the varieties of closets out there, right? And to suddenly realize like, I mean, I haven't been in the psychedelic closet for much at all in this podcast, but still I hesitate to talk about it with my dad. Oh yeah. I don't want to make him uncomfortable. I don't want to tell him, you know, when I was a burning man, I had one of the most powerfully beautiful LSD experiences of my life or that are all the benefit that came from it, you know, and then you sound like you're raving like a mad person to like that from their point of view, you know, and they're worried you have schizophrenia or something like that. I had, I mean, I wasn't going to do my hometown on my tour and I was like, you know what, screw it. Like I, I've, my parents have already heard me like talk, do like fisting jokes and they're like, whatever else. No problem. Like why, why can't I do the most intelligent material that I've ever written in my career, you know, and, and I told my mom, I was like, this is the show that I'm doing. And you'll understand when you see it better. And, and she's still like so nervous about it. Well, they feel protective because they've been programmed to believe that these substances have some long-term neurological impact. And most of that research, if not all of it has been skewed, slanted, fucked up intentionally or just, I guess, through mishandling of the substances in a way that is painted a picture of these relatively harmless substances as being like just disastrous for humans life. And, you know, I was talking to a friend of mine and she said that she was talking to this guy about LSD, about taking LSD. And he said to her, you know, just be careful with it because, you know, a lot of people who take LSD, they end up starting farms. I hope that's what like the after school specials of the future will be like. Everything was going great. He was moving up in his cubicle job. He had just got from the mail room into an assistant position. Yeah. And then everything fell apart. Now look at him. He's making his own soaps. He's out in nature. He's he bought a fucking RV and he just drives around and experiences the beauty of the plan that he happens to be living on and destroyed his mind. It's a crazy person. It wrecked his brain. Well, you know, that's it's intro time together. Everything we've already talked about, I have I have kind of a take on what happened during that the civil rights movement, the Nixon era a little bit. And so one of one of the testable kind of long term effects of psychedelics is so I've been talking on my podcast a bit about this big five personality indicator test. It's sort of like Myers-Briggs or something like that. But Myers-Briggs is kind of no one really uses that anymore in academia, but and it's not perfect. I'm sorry. Is this the is this the personality test that they used to like in conjunction with the DSM for whatever? Yeah. You know, I'm talking about. I think I think so. That sounds very familiar. It's like the big manual of like mental illnesses that if you look through it, you've got every single one of them. Oh, yeah. I don't think those two are connected exactly. But okay. So actually, if you want, if you want to get an idea of what it is put on, are you online right now? Yes, I am. Are you like logged into Facebook? I can get to Facebook. So instead, go to apply magic sauce dot com. Okay. Got it. I'm going. Is this your website? No, this is this is a scientist at Stanford. Okay. This and then give give it access to your Facebook and it will tell you your personality based on your Facebook likes. Wow. That's so cool. I can't wait to do that. Let me see. Let's see if we could do it. That's genius. It happens in like. Two seconds. Crazy. Okay. I just did it. Wow. It's actually, huh? Cambridge is inviting me to come and be a professor there from this analysis. Is it? Did that happen to you? This is amazing. It's like, huh? I don't know. It's saying I'm so kind of super genius. Okay. I'm logging in right now. Let's see what this does. Let's see. So it's guessing your age and your gender and sexuality. Totally off of my age. Yeah. It said younger, right? Yeah. Because most of the things that you liked on Facebook were years ago. Yeah. When you did it. It says I'm 49%. I'm an androgynous. You know what though? I don't really use faith. I guess I'm kind of androgynous. I don't use Facebook a lot. That's the, that's what's not perfect about it. Yeah. I barely go on there. So, but it does say let's see. Neuroticism. 39%. Agreeableness. Agreeableness. Agreeableness. Agreeableness. 49%. Agreeableness. 43%. I'm more competitive than I am team working and trusting. Unfortunately, that's probably true. I'm contemplative. Yeah. I'm impulsive and spontaneous. Yeah. And then I'm right in the fucking middle of conservative and traditional. Really? Weird. Well, I don't go on Facebook enough. Right. Yeah. Muscular. It says I'm beautiful. Beautiful. Just a beauty. It says I'm 100% a beautiful man. See it nailed it. It's a perfect test. It's a perfect test. So, so these things are very flawed for many reasons, but the point is, is that so, so the big five are conscientiousness, which I'm very low in. Like I'm a very messy, disorganized person. Agreeableness, which I'm low in. I like to argue with people and I'm skeptical and stability, neuroticism. I'm in the middle. So I'm not unstable, but I'm not terribly stable either. Extraversion. I'm kind of in the middle and then openness, which is the one that psychedelics do have a testable long-term effect on. So if you're very high in openness, which is people like you and I, like you can't get enough novelty in your life, not enough stimulation, you need new information all the time, highly inquisitive. And the downside is, is that you tend to like question authority too much. You get yourself in a bit of trouble. Maybe you're too spontaneous sometimes. And the, but then the people that are really low in openness and people have evolved to have these spectrums of things for lots of reasons. They're very safe people. Like they're, their hometown is the best by travel outside of it. You know, your, your local sports are the best. Your country is the best. You haven't been to another country because that's terrifying, but you definitely know yours are because your founding fathers weren't humans. They're infallible deities all knowing. And like your church that you were raised in is absolutely the right church. The other ones sound kind of wacky and scary to you. And, and so, and the benefit is, is a lot of these people are like really pillars of the community because they really follow the playbook that kind of life gives you, you know, so these people like love laws, like wish they were a little stricter, but laws are the best. So if you're a lawmaker, these are your absolute favorite people. And one thing that psychedelics have proven to do in most cases is a single dose will, will have a long term effect of, of you will rate higher in openness for the foreseeable future for like a year or so. Usually. And so all of a sudden on top of everything else that was going on with the civil rights movement, you were starting to lose all of these nice little rule followers. And then all of a sudden women wanted rights out of nowhere and these colored people and no one wanted to go to war anymore. And it's just a nightmare. And, and so that's, that's my take on why it was because Nixon actually hired a team of people to inform him on what to do, like scientists, doctors and stuff like that. And they told them that therapy and, and de-scheduling was, was the right way to go with it. And he's like, nah, screw all that. And then, and he set up all the scheduling system initially made a schedule one. It's sinister. I mean, when you realize just how absolutely fucking sinister the, the entire, your most of your conceptualization of psychedelics is been placed there, not by the truth, but by an organized superstructure that wanted to infiltrate and destroy the power structures of groups of people who wanted to make the planet a non-warring, non-authoritarian sort of place. It's mind bending. And, and a lot of these people that weren't even smart enough to put together these conspiracies were just, were just fearful people that are, were also misinformed and also just happily bought into any of this hysteria as well. So you take all of those things and put them together and it's pretty, it's a pretty sad situation. I've been doing psychedelics more often since putting together this tour for, you know, material quote unquote. Yeah, sure. And, and I've, so I've had lifelong chronic depression since I was like nine years old or so. I remember it's like right around fourth, fifth grade. And, and it's pretty much gone away just, just in the last year. I thought it was just going to be this is what I'm going to live with with the rest of my life. That's fine. I can handle it. And, and it's, I mean, I still get depressed, but I don't have chronic depression. I don't have debilitating depression, depression anymore. Like I don't have to sit in my room for three weeks straight, not being able to talk to anybody. Yeah. You know, that's, you hear this again and again and again. Here are so many people who are having these, you know, and a massive transformations in their identity and their perception of what, what's important and what's not important. Yeah. Just their outlook, how they treat others, their sense of empathy. And so do you, I mean, do you kind of feel like you're a missionary or something when you do this show? Do you feel like you're proselytizing a little bit? I, I, I'm worried that that's what I'm doing because that's not, that wasn't my intention, certainly. I like doing theme shows. My, my first, when I started working internationally, you know, all these international acts and like Australia and around Europe, they're, they're always putting together like these kind of solo shows to do in like Edinburgh fringe festivals. And I was like, well, I want to be a part of that. And so I was trying to just put together themed things and I knew I wanted some science themed stuff. So I had my first, my first whack at it was I did a Netflix special mating season, which I'm ultimately not that happy with because I was still trying to cater to strangers way too much. Right. And I dumped it down way too much. And then my last one was about breaking my feet and about negative emotions. And then it was like, that's when I got it. That's when I figured out how to make a solo show and like a themed show. And then I just happened to have this folder full of psychedelic jokes and just thought it would be fun to put together. And next thing I know, like, I mean, the reaction from people was like kind of overwhelming. So I've been able to add more information into it because they're such patient audiences. And so it all just kind of happened, felt together by accident. This wasn't like, I didn't really plan it out that much. Do you feel like what you're doing is kind of cathartic for the audience? Like if you're somebody who's in a small town and you, you have in your own, you know, private life and experimenting with psychedelics. Yeah. Don't you feel that way with everything that you do? I mean, you'll go to places in, you know, very, very conservative areas that I'm sure you probably before you actually did them were probably a little nervous about how your stuff would be received. And you, there are these pockets of people that are so hungry for it. And like when you start talking about, when I start talking about LSD, you know, just recently on this tour, I wasn't even doing it at one point because it was just bicycle day. So I was just telling the story of LSD and one part in the, in the people loved it, man. And like the, the kind of cheers you get from people who are finally, I guess, getting to be in a community of people who've maybe all experienced it, but you're not supposed to talk about it. It's really, it seems to be a, I think you should proselytize. I don't think that's anything you should be, feel worried about. I don't want to be too preachy. Yeah. But you know, when you bring a group of people, I don't know what you mean, but, and it is a, it's a, it's a, it's a tough, it's a fun line. Well, here's, here's my problem with it. Sometimes, sometimes I have to ask myself like, okay, is this still entertaining or am I just being self-indulgent right now? And that, and that's the, I don't mind if it's preachy, if it's still like funny or interesting and entertaining, but if it's, if it feels, if it starts feeling self-indulgent, that's when I get a little nervous. That's when you've fallen off the line. And it's okay. You're not going to stay on, sometimes, man, you're going to get self-indulgent up there. And then when you do, usually it just means you need to work a little bit more on the material, right? That's all. It just needs to be refined a little bit more. I think it's the intention behind it. Yeah. That's what matters. Like if you're getting up there with at least an inkling of wanting to help people, not in a sanctimonious way, but an actual sense of like, shit, man. I mean, think of the times when you were introduced to psychedelics and the way that you were introduced to psychedelics and how lucky you were to come into contact with them. And so if you're doing that for people, like that would be an amazing thing if from your show, people, some people who've maybe haven't crossed the boundary. It happens all the time. What are some stories you've heard from your audience about being inspired to take psychedelics after a couple? A lot of times it'll be like a couple where one of them has done it, the other one hasn't. And then they haven't been able to like explain or make a convincing argument to the person. And that other person that has been nervous about it or whatever is like, you've given me a lot to think about and I think that it is something that I'm interested in. And by the way, I don't necessarily think psychedelics are for everybody, but it's also silly that we feel the need to do this dumb disclaimer. Like if I did a disclaimer about alcohol, I'd be fired from everywhere that I went. You know? That's crazy. I just started saying... You mean like maybe alcohol isn't for everybody? Yeah, yeah. I would be fired immediately. That club would not have me back. Like starting a show? I'd be like, you guys, you know... Just a little warning. It can get you in a bit of trouble. It's considered as almost as deadly as heroin and probably has done more damage to our society than any other drug. You'd be fired. You couldn't do it. No. And my silly little joke that I just introduced into my act about it is how I'm an advocate for psychedelic rights and psychedelic research doesn't mean that I think it's for everybody. Like I'm for gay marriage. I don't think everyone should be gay or married. Right, right, right. So it's so silly that we have to do all these little disclaimers too and you still feel the need. And I mean, I definitely want people to be safe and don't want to be responsible for someone getting themselves in a bad situation. Does that... If I were you and even if I'm me, sometimes that's a real concern for me because I just, you know, imagine... I don't know how I would react if I, you know, to hear about some disaster. You know, I was just... When I was a burning man, I was having this conversation with somebody and we were discussing like what's the worst trip you've ever seen? Like what's the worst bad trip you've ever witnessed? And his description of this was just so terrifying. Like it was like he saw somebody trying to rip their teeth out of their head. Have you ever seen anyone have a terrible trip? Yes. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was very... It was a long time ago. It was a guy who had lots and lots and lots of problems already. Like this guy, this guy was already like schizophrenic clearly and he was right around that age too. So he was still managing it but clearly had schizophrenia. You know, he would have been around 23 at the time and has been in trouble with the law his whole life and for every drug under the sun. So just to give you an idea of how fucked up this guy, he once escaped from a jail that he was in. Wow. And then he stole a car and somehow like then got his hands on some acid with like a friend of his that was nearby and then drove the stolen car from point A to point B like in a straight line. Like not using roads or anything like in a straight line. And then like navigating by the North Star or whatever. Wow. But that guy, I remember him getting institutionalized. He ate a bunch of mushrooms and he ended up... He cut his wrists and then he was writing all over his bedroom walls messages in his blood. Wow. I hate sharing stories like that because that's the... People hear one story like that and they think like that's what fucking psychedelics are. And so yeah, you definitely don't want to be responsible for something like that. But I mean... I mean how many people die climbing Everest? Like look at the dead body scattered around that place. No one's making mountain climbing illegal. It's like just... If you're going to like experiment in these ways with these things, then yeah, of course there's some danger. I know what you mean though. You don't want to like somebody to start like tripping and then think about this shit and talking about the dude. But for me, when the psychedelic begins to kick in and you feel the initial energetic surge moving through your body and then there's that contact or something with yourself or whatever you want to call it and then you realize man, this is an amazing universe where existing and then if like in the midst of that the light is shined upon some petroglyphs in the cavern of yourself that maybe you didn't know or down there I think as long as you look at it is like when the weird shit starts coming up. As long as you look at that as even more of a gift than seeing the beautiful stuff. You have to be able to look at it that way. I mean I say that psychedelics are an adult drug. I would say that if they were legal that I would hope that the age restriction would be anyone under like 25 years old because that's when like the prefrontal cortex is fully formed and your decision making skills are more operational. Right. And then you have a better understanding plus you're kind of past the age where you're susceptible to schizophrenia. I gotta tell you though man, I had some beautiful trips when I was in my teens. I know, I know. It's kind of like kind of sad because I mean it's not sad. I'm glad it happened. But when I look back it's a little bit like being given access to the Library of Congress before you can read. Right. You're just sort of staring at this amazing shit and you don't have anything to connect it to. You don't have any way to like oh shit. You know that writing I'm seeing in my friend's car seat appears to be some form of Tibetan. Or is this like a universal language? Am I witnessing like the precursor language and the depth of the human psyche? You know that kind of stuff. You don't have that when you're in West Henderson High School. You're just like dude, do you see letters everywhere? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well and I mean to go back to what you were saying with it pulling out some kind of dark stuff that you didn't know was in there. I mean when you're college aged and like so uncertain about yourself and you're already confused and psychedelics tend to kind of exaggerate and bring out who you are already. Like you don't necessarily, you might not be ready for all that you know. Especially, I mean the first step of this stuff will be and there will be trained therapists administering it. And I do believe that that would be a very safe environment for anybody. Oh man. I mean I got, you know, at Burning Man I got lucky enough to be in a camp with this psychiatrist who volunteers at the Zendo. So I think he's the director of it. So just talking to him, you know, sober, non-sober. Just talking to, you know, somebody who's been trained to like to allow a person to be themselves and to not judge them and to just let you sort of relate your subjective experience without being like somebody being like what? Yeah. And just when you see how, what training can do for a person. It was amazing. Like how it's just a, you know, we need these, of course the word for it is shaman, right? That's what, that was the idea. We had a, you have a person who was trained at being around a person who's been completely opened up psychologically and allowing all those whatever bats to fly out of the cave without looking at them and drawing back. Yeah. I think, I think that if you're someone that's never meditated and you're interested in it, or I mean psych, never done psychedelics and are interested, but are nervous, definitely start with meditation first. Right. You'll be able to handle your trip so much better. Yeah, or practice. You're right. Practice like, I mean the trick is the next time the thing pops up in you that you don't like about yourself, like whatever it may be, some physical thing you don't like. For example, like right now, my abs, they're too developed. Like I look at my abs. Like, I look at- Yeah, it's embarrassing, right? It's embarrassing. Yeah. Cause I go to the beach, you know, and people see me, they prejudge me. Yeah, right. Like, here comes the jock with a fucking massive developed grip deck. And you know, like- It's every day of my life. It's, I know man, we both, that's I think where we connect. Like that combination of abs with like a noticeably gigantic phallus mixed in with like both of us. It's distracting. But you smell great. I always have a natural kind of like pheromonal odor that comes out of me. Right. It's just like- Yeah, yeah. It's been described as like a combination of temple incense and lotus petals. You get that too, right? I smell it on you. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, for me like- It's been described many times. I would say many, many times. So, to walk among people and then like- Right, right. And then you know you're at the beach and someone comes up to you and they say, are you a god? And you're like- And just stay humble for all of that too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But meditation, it teaches me. It teaches me when I gaze upon my asymmetrical love handles. You know, like the next time you find yourself gazing at whatever the particular aspect of your meat body that maybe you're dismayed about, or maybe there's some aspect of your life you're dismayed about. If you can catch that moment of dismay and just even make the attempt to embrace it, to convert it, to do exactly for that moment of dismay, what it seems like these trained psychedelic counselors do with people who are pouring their heart out to them, which is just to let it be, to not judge it, to let it come out and to trust that this is like- You can love every single moment. I think that's what a practice, a meditation practice, or mindfulness gives you. So that when you do take the psychedelic and you are faced with a goddamn demigorgan, or whatever the fucking thing is that you're just so scared of confronting, you can practice the same thing with it. Yeah. And that's a cool moment. I think that that is one of the kind of biggest, or slight variation on that anyways. One of the biggest takeaways for me with psychedelics is just the idea of, when psychedelics do take you on that roller coaster ride, and you're aesthetically blissful one minute, and then the next minute you just couldn't be more down on yourself, and then just knowing like, oh, that was nothing actually changed just now, other than some chemicals in my brain, and that's all that's affecting my mood most of the time. Right. And you can choose to encourage more of the positive ones in your life if you want to. And it's not a bunch of bullshit either. Actually, our brains are set up to have a negativity bias because it evolved to keep us safe. Right. We focus on the negative so much more because this idea in psychology of negativity bias came from engineering actually, the engineer smoke alarms to, you can't make a perfect smoke alarm. Right. So it can err in two ways. It can either go off when you don't need it to, and that's super annoying. But it cannot go off when you need it to and people die. So there's a huge cost there. So they intentionally buy us smoke alarms to go off more often than they need to because the cost involved. And so our brains have developed, have evolved the same biases. So the rustling in the brush is often just rustling. Oh my God. The next time you're having a paranoid trip, if you just realize it's a shitty smoke alarm and your brain is going off, detecting a thing that ain't there. That's genius. Oh, that's so comforting. And this actually even just someone who's as experienced as I am, and there's plenty of people way more experienced than me, I've tripped many, many times in my life. And I, the last acid trip that I had was just a few weeks ago. And I still, and I knew it was going on and I still fell victim to it. What happened was I was out at the lake with my girlfriend. She had never done acid before. And so I was already like kind of in protective mode, which I always am when I'm around people. And then, and we're out and it's like 110 degree day. It was great, but it was midday and we really shouldn't, we put sunscreen on and everything, but we really shouldn't have been out just right in midday. Right. And we're out there and I got a sun rash on my, on my thighs. And I'd never had a sun rash before and, and I didn't know. And she's like, what is that? I'm like, I think it's a sun rash. And she's like, no, that's not normal. And I was like, I think it's okay. I think like we should just go and get in the shade. I think it's just my skin telling me to get in the shade. She's like, no, no, that's not normal. And then all of a sudden I'm like, maybe she's right. I mean, it does look weird. Like maybe I'm having, maybe this is like bad acid that I'm somehow having some weird reaction to is the rest of my body going to start looking like this. Is it going to look like this permanently? Do I need to get to a hospital? How do I get to the hospital? I don't have phone reception right now. And I don't think I should drive right now. And, and then all of a sudden, and I'm like, okay, I know what's happening. And I know this panic isn't real, but I'm still having it. And I was telling her and I was like, I'm sorry right now because usually when someone's going through something like this, there's usually like someone like me around to help them out. And now I'm that person. And so it, I mean, it can still grab you. Oh my God, you became a grateful dead lyric. You who choose to lead must follow. But if you fall, you fall alone. And it's true. If you put yourself in the position of being a caretaker and you take an equal amount of LSD as somebody else, then you have to be ready to like when the demon comes into you, you got to like, and it's kind of cool if you're caretaking you can maybe avoid it or something like that. But man, that's crazy. So how did you overcome it? It was about 30 minutes of just like, I mean, I told her, I'm like, I am panicking right now, but I know consciously that everything's going to be fine. And consciously I'm not worried about it. I just need like 20 minutes for these hormones to dial down. And so you just got to sit here and watch me just freak out for like 30 minutes. Cool. And then everything will be all right. Yeah. And, and it was, it was great. Yeah, it's a that those opportunities are so cool. You, it's like, you, how often do you really get an opportunity to experience a kind of illusionary panic attack as opposed to like, you know, like sometimes and unfortunately hopefully it won't happen for any of us again, but we end up in situations where you need those chemicals to be blasting because there's some weird motherfucker who's coming at you in the middle of the city or maybe your car's brakes aren't working the way they should as you go downhill. Or maybe you need to get out of a house that's on fire. You need that burst. Yes. But to have that minus the impending doom and to get a chance to experience these ecstatic yet horrifying states. It's a, it's amazing. Yeah. The work you can do in that heightened, like the way you did was work there just to be able to like recognize not real temporary. Yeah. Oh, that in its own right. It's so, it's so powerful. Yeah. I mean, if you, when you, when you say, you know, are you feel like you're, you're trying to lead something or, you know, preaching or whatever it might be. I would say that more than like, Hey, everyone go and do psychedelics. I would say that a more important message for me would just be like, Hey, let's all just calm down. Let's just everybody calm down a little bit. Right. And there's, there's this fantastic book, Why Zebras Don't Get Alsers by probably my favorite scientist, Robert Sapolsky. He's a genius and a really smart guy. And, and it's basically the gist of it is, is that every basically every, every animal, every mammal has about the exact same stress response system. So, so a zebra sees a lion and it releases these glucocortozoids and, and then this cortisol and everything. And what it does is it delegates energy to the parts that need it. So it goes, let's shut down, let's shut down the digestion. Don't need it. Don't really need the immune system right now. Don't need that. Don't need the sex drive. There's no time for a boner. Let's just get all the energy to our legs. Let's get the hell out of here. And, and then the zebras get away and then they go back and then these hormones dial everything back down and they go back to like eating grass and relaxing. And, and that, and that was necessary for them to have that the problem with humans is that we can think so subjectively and about all of these big kind of subjective ideas. And we can see so far into the future that we're setting off this stress response about our 401k. Wow. And it's never dialing down. That's so fucked up. So, so our dicks aren't working. Where our digestion system isn't working. Our immune systems are falling apart. Fuck you, buddy. I do need a boner right now. And it's fucking everyone up and people just don't know it. They don't know why that's happening. I love that man. That's such a beautiful, that is so beautiful. I think there's something. So in the old days, you know, you would get terrified by this kind of, I don't know what you'd call it. It feels like there's a little bit of like, it can seem a little cynical to imagine that really, you know, all you are is the, you know, various secretions that are being released from your brain. Yeah. Yeah. And then the activity happening in the synaptic cleft, a word I just learned in the last podcast. But, but then from another POV, it's really quite beautiful and comforting to know that like, yeah, you just have, you know, your, your operating systems, maybe it's got a few bugs in it. And that's not a big deal. And there's, it's something that you can, it's interesting how the human brain by understanding the way it works can, from some meta perspective, heal itself just by understanding it, it's own principles that mindfulness, man. Yeah. It can change so much. I think, I think that our, our non-conscious and our conscious brain are, are these different tools that are trying to communicate to one another. But the non-conscious is using this totally different language of like hormones and feelings and stuff to navigate behavior. And our consciousness is using this weird English stuff being like, why were you so stupid? Why didn't you pay that bill on time or whatever? And nothing's getting through. And it seems like there's something with psychedelics, with mindfulness, with meditation, with therapy, where there's that connection starting to open up a little more. And they're kind of teaching each other a little bit, you know? Yeah. And when I, the last trip I took at the peak of the thing, there was just this like realization of just how much suffering is caused by identifying as a self. It seems to be like the nexus point of all suffering. And I certainly have heard that before in Buddhism, but I never really, at least it reminded me of like, whoa, it just seems like there's just a bundle of shit. I'm clinging onto that. I've been calling who this is who I am when the reality is, you know, those, it's hard to explain, but you know, those moments on a powerful LSD trip where you managed to let go of that thing, trying to hold on to a sense of self. And there's that release and the kind of unitive consciousness. Have you ever had that before? I've done it more on DMT and on mushrooms. Now I can get myself into like a DMT space if I'm by myself meditating or I did them in a float tank recently and, um, and was able to get myself there where I just completely like lose myself and it seems as if I'm in these different worlds and that you're kind of kaleidoscoped, if that's a word kaleidoscoped, you're kaleidoscoped if it's not a word, it's now a T shirt kaleidoscoped some kind of cyclops of the kaleidoscoped, but you're drifted. You're like pulled out to the point where whatever the boundary is that you identify as well. This is me shifts to wait, I think I'm the walls and the floor and the bathroom of this RV. Like I don't know where my where I start and the rest of this where I stop and the rest of this starts. I've been on DMT many times where I've been like, wait, okay, you're, you're, you're just, you're a Shane that's on a couch right now, like you just smoked DMT, like I'm able to like eventually remind myself of that, but there's, but I, it's because I had completely lost sense of that entirely. Yeah. That to me is the, I mean, I just can't think of a more blissful state and, you know, with this last trip I wasn't able to, or I was, I got it for milliseconds, but even those milliseconds were just so incredible. Those moments of just letting go and that to me is where my hope is for what happens when you die because, you know, sure, maybe you die hit, hit that wall of oblivion. No perceptual mechanisms. You go into what Richard Dawkins, have you ever heard what Richard Dawkins says death is? Hmm. He probably. He says death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of infinity. I kind of enjoy that actually, but Dawkins can be a bit of a prick. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I very much enjoyed that. I love that a lot. I haven't heard that. But, but again, I don't subscribe to a lot of what Dawkins says. He does some amazing work though. It's just his delivery methods are not very engaging. He feels frustrated. I mean, I think when people feel like they've like found at least something that resembles a concrete inarguable truth and then lots of people are attacking you all of the time. They have no idea what they're talking about. And the way they're attacking you is kind of illogical. I think, I think over time, especially if you're Richard Dawkins and maybe you already are a bit of a sour puss who knows. Over time, you're going to be like, fuck off. I don't feel like going through this again or maybe he likes it. I don't know. But, but the, uh, the, to me, the idea that, all right, well, maybe in the last moments of a human's existence, you get to experience this kind of systemic shutdown where the thing that you had thought was you, the thing you were focused on, the thing that all of your attention was always on, which is whatever the nexus point of the self is suddenly that releases. And then you actually have maybe what is only a few moments or a millisecond of experiencing the reality of your situation as a being made of matter, which is that you really, there is no place where you stop and everything starts. There's just an everythingness of which you're populating it is this cluster of atoms and neurons and pheromones or whatever the fuck it is. And, and it's like you're a cloud and death is just that simple release into the everythingness again. But I bet this is where we disagree, Shane, which is that I believe that consciousness is not a product of the body. Right. Yeah. And you do. I do. Um, I mean, I'm, I'm trying to be more open about it for sure. I just did DMT last night and, and there was a voice. I don't normally, sometimes I get like straight on because usually it's just very confusing, but sometimes I get like little voices, um, that will just say something. And the voice kept on saying like, just be more open minded, just be more open minded, just be more open minded over and over again, because I was seeing all these different worlds and stuff like that. And I thought, I saw, like I, I was seeing like exactly what you're describing. No doubt about it. I mean, my, my take on it is, I wonder if there is some neurologic basis for that, that, that you can kind of reason, uh, reason it down to, but, but, um, I mean, I've seen, I've seen exactly, and I'm less of a skeptic now than, than I probably ever have been in my life, but I also regarding death, I think something similar could happen, even if it is just within your head. We were talking about last time we talked about, um, your brain running simulations within a matter of seconds. You can project like in these highly salient moments, say like you, uh, uh, you get shot or, or you do DMT and your brain tricks itself into thinking it's dying or ayahuasca or whatever. Yeah. And you can, you can, I've seen it. I've seen my life in like eight different variations, like flash, like the, my future in eight different variations. And then at the same time, everything backwards from my life too, and then also imagining what happened before my life and, and then all of these different paths, all in like these seconds. So maybe when you die, you're able to see like all of the information or what would look like all of the information in your head just right before. And, and when you're like that, like I've had DMT trips that have felt like I was gone for like a hundred years or something like that. Right. Um, and so maybe when you die, you, what you do is experience is the full on amount of that. And maybe it would feel like infinity and unfortunately, so maybe you can experience it. I got some backup for what you're saying from a much more intelligent, less woo wooey person than me. Nick Bostrom. You know what this is? Oh no. He is, you would love it. He wrote a book called super intelligence, which is like the pathways that we might get to an AI or a biological super intelligence appearing on the planet. And so they know how quickly you probably even know this, how quickly, uh, I guess whatever we call the God, I just, someone's just describing this to me and I always forget it. What's happened because there's a shift in the electrical activity between two points and two neuronal points or something, right? There's like a shift in like sodium something or I don't look, man, I'm not a neurologist. All right. No one thinks I am. Sorry guys. I'll never talk about neurology. Yeah. It's so hard. It's so, it's so hard, but so, but they know basically, and I'm going to turn this into something a little more, um, I'm going to have to dumb this down because I'm dumb when it comes to this stuff, but basically they know how quickly thoughts move through the mind. So for lack of, cause I can't remember what he said it was. It's like 200 meters per second or something like that. That's how quickly we process information. So theoretically, if you could do full brain emulation and figure out a way to digitize the human brain and then animate that digitized, perfectly digitized human brain using some as of yet non-existing technology, then if you could speed that brain up so that thoughts don't move at 200 meters per second, now they move at 400 meters per second, then that being sense of time would be half would slow down in half. It would be cut in half. And if you sped that up again, and then again, and then again, and then again, eventually that being sensation of time would be the way Boston puts it is, you could be sitting with this being and drop your teacup and that being could write a thesis, you know, read a couple of books, go like do a million things and then pick your teacup up and give it to you because time would be moving so slowly because our sense of time is based on how quickly thoughts or our brain processes information. So who knows, maybe in an extinction event, that final thought or that speeds up so much. We just can't get past the speed of light. Our thoughts can't move faster. If we could speed up a human brain, the wall would be the speed of light, which means that if the dream is extinction, there's some last moment of self that is a result of some shifting of the thought process and the human mind that appears to last for infinity, it's still not going to last forever because. Yeah, you can experience infinity, but only for about a second. That's weird, right? That's so weird, yeah. But yeah, I mean, that's what needs to be on a shirt. I think that, to me, one thing I think about all the time is just how subjective any perception of time is and time is so relative. So like a second to us seems like nothing, like what could you possibly get done in a second to our reflexes and instinct is way too long. If you just stubbed your toe or put your hand on something burning or something like that, it doesn't have a whole second to sit around waiting to take action, you know, and think about just different species that interpret time differently or I like to think about like mayflies that last for like two, four days or whatever and like their perception of like it's still a full lifespan. We measure things in like terms of lifespan kind of because if you told a mayfly like, hey, I'll give you 30 more days. They'd be like, what in the world? What would I have 30 more days? What would I do with that? There's no thank you. Can I opt out of that? I can't handle all that life. Yeah, I guess, you know, it does seem like consciousness and time are kind of interwoven in some strange way, but I also think that if you were to like be able to DVR kind of the brain, like what you're talking about, all that happens in a second and then you were kind of able to make a make a TV show of it, like show the recording to us, I think it would take you like a hundred years to see what the brain's doing in like a couple of that was actually one of the interesting things. Boston was saying is like, you know, there's the idea of like, can we would there be a way to take the knowledge of a master pianist and transfer that into another person's brain and then they could play the piano and he said the problem with that is everybody's brain is this fluctuation of energetic systems and it's all fluctuating differently. So for that to even work, you would need some kind of intermediary translator that could look at the way these like weird brainstorms are happening and that one person's brain convert that into the way your brain understands energetic shifts and for that to happen for that intermediary thing to exist, you might as well just create an AI and AI is going to exist before that because you'll understand and then maybe after that you'll be able to like shift information between brains. But the one thing that he like, well, I haven't finished the book yet, but it seems like the one thing he's this is why I've been thinking lately and easily it's easy to shoot down. You're right. Right now, you're right. Anyone who like is have comes from a scientific perspective on this shit is right because what I'm talking about is not quantifiable yet, but I feel like they're going to figure out that consciousness is to human experience what wind is to the sails of a boat and that something about having this like specific type of consciousness is a signal and we have these antennas and we're receivers and that the moment that which if that were the case and God knows it's the ultimate hippie dream and if that is the case, then we do have functional and we're immortal if that's the case or what or and we're not individuals were some energetic system that's being sort of temporarily captured through our own biomechanics or something like that. But what's curious about the idea to me is if they could quantify consciousness at being as being outside the body, then the quantification of consciousness and the invention of an AI would be the identical thing. You know, the two things would happen exactly at the same time because if that's the case then building an AI was just really building a sale that can capture the energetic flow of the stuff. I was rambling about this to somebody and they were like, Oh, it's a Ouija board. You're talking about a Ouija board or some kind of digital technological Ouija board that like picks up on this system that we haven't identified yet. Who knows? What do you think? Well, I mean, I think that even if say there were this like consciousness going through some like plane of existence or something like that that we are tapping into, then we're still having like a different perception of what that consciousness is. We're all interpreting it differently and that interpretation is in and of itself a different kind of consciousness that only belongs to us. So maybe we would just need a different word for it. Okay. Yeah, right. Don't call it, you're right, right, right. It's like, yeah, because if it's the, you need the combination of the two things, right? You can't just have one. Like the two things have to meet. And there, there is, as you were talking about, you know, putting someone else's personality kind of or skills into your brain, it just kind of made me think of, they've done these studies that I'm going to butcher, but a lot of it's about the brain, the brain actually limiting resources to, to specific areas like, um, right, like MDMA shuts down blood flow in, in the amygdala and then delegates a lot of it to the prefrontal cortex for your higher decision-making functions and stuff. And that's why it's good for PTSD. So because PTSD normally, this amygdala is like lighting up way too much and people are going panicking and they can't even think about it without, you know, sending themselves down this hole. So it shuts that down. And so they're able to like put themselves in kind of a little bit of a different personality. There's these weird electromagnetic, uh, I forget what they're called, but you can basically put them on the surface of people's brains and, and this is going to sound a little scary and you can kind of zap them a little bit and it, it will just paralyze this little region of the brain for a little while and they've done all these experiments with them where I guess there's this part of the brain where if you shut it down, it inhibits more blood flow to this creative area of your brain and you can shut down this part of the brain and all of a sudden people can like draw better and like paint better. So sign me up. Maybe in the future you would be able to have some sort of thing that's like, I want like measure, measure the kind of signals that that brain, how, how that, how that guy's brain is delegating his glucose and everything like that. And then just alter a few things just temporarily for five minutes. So I can get, it wouldn't be perfect. It wouldn't be anywhere near perfect, especially in the early stages of course, but maybe I could get like some rudimentary sense of, of, of how this person experiences like joy or sees, sees colors or, you know, something like that. I'm not sure. It seems like Bostrom in this book, you gotta, it's a great Audible book too, because it feels like the narrator is a goddamn AI or something. Like it feels like some droning like AI is like, has written the book about itself. But I love audio books. They're the best. But he, the, like he, it seems like what he's saying is, you know, before we get to the point where we can do that kind of stuff, we're going to have an AI. So like preceding any kind of biological improvements that allow a person to be a, a, a supreme intelligence, we may, for, for example, maybe we figure out just enough of that to make a person adept enough to understand how to create an artificial intelligence. So a precursor to a machine intelligence, it's going to be a little evolution in human intelligence, just enough to be able to admit, to look at the human brain and be like, oh, here's how it's working or get the inspiration or intuition or whatever to make the thing. But prior to a human mind being a super intelligence, a human will create a super intelligence and what Bostrom is saying and what, you know, many people are saying Elon Musk being one of them, uh, uh, is like, we better look the fuck out, man, because we don't know what it's going to do. Right. And, and, and that's what the whole book is about. It's like, here are the pathways to it happening. Here's a timeline when it theoretically would happen, which for Bostrom, it seems like he's being very conservative in his estimates. It's like the last part of the century, but it's not like he's saying it's not going to happen. He's just saying it's going to be 50 to 100 years from now. And more than likely it happens, uh, through machine intelligence, which anyway, that is very exciting to me. Um, but I wish it would happen sooner. Yeah, I, I want, I mean, I'm a transhumanist. I want to be a robot now. Um, oh, you mean you've become part of the satanic globalist agenda. Yeah. Um, I, uh, I want to, so, um, I have, I have a more optimistic view of, of that when I hear people like, well, what if aliens come down this super intelligent species, they would have like Machiavecacu, um, talks about how, how they would just like pave right over us, suck us up for our son's energy or whatever, be on our way and just leave us, uh, uh, leave us to, uh, you know, die very quickly without a son. And, um, but I, I think that if you look at the history of life on earth as life becomes more intelligent as these brains get a little larger, as they seem to be doing more complicated things as humans tend to inform themselves more, it seems like we actually expand our empathy. It seems like we expand our interests as well. Like even if you're diabolical about it, um, it's now, now we care about like what little insects are doing and, you know, people, people want to research. There's, there's, you know, animal rights people all over. There wasn't animal rights people 10,000 years ago. You know, I mean, we're not even a type one civilization according to that cartage of scale, and we already are scared about what we're going to do if we infect Mars or some other planet with a disease from this planet. Like we are already having empathy for planets that don't even appear to have life on them. So what if that is the natural path of intelligence is that empathy also because empathy is just understanding. And so if it's more intelligent and it's seeking more and more inner understanding than why, I mean, I would say at the very, very least, um, aliens or robots or whatever would want to study us. And the best way to study things is to do it in the least invasive way possible. I mean, scientists know that studying an animal in a lab is, is there's all sorts of problems with it. Ideally you're in the field watching how they actually normally behave. So maybe, maybe robots would just be taking a backseat and kind of enjoying the show a little bit. Maybe we, you know, the Douglas Adams thing about mice. No, he says they're the end part of the tentacles of interdimensional creatures that like to study scientists that the mice are like entered into the tentacles of these beings. They're studying science. Yeah, they're like tentacles poking in the study. I love that. Yeah, he's cool, man. But that's fun. This idea of benevolent, the idea of intelligence being ultimately benevolent. I love it, man. And, and, and, you know, the, uh, you know, like, or, or the idea that the way that the intelligent, we think we know the way that we believe a supreme intelligence or a super advanced intelligence alien, interdimensional, whatever you want to call it, as of yet undiscovered will reveal itself to us is hilarious because it's completely based on our own theoretically limited intelligence in comparison to that intelligence. So we have like basically the things going to pull up and on some cosmic driveway in the form of these crafts or something. That's what many, many people think we, everything's mechanical. Even the, the, um, the idea of like a type two civilization using a Dyson sphere to control. Have you ever heard this before? Like, so it's like, uh, um, there's these different types that there's the cartage of came up with these different types of civilizations. Type one, type two, type three. I think it ends at type three. Yeah. Type one is we're not even there yet. It's a planetary civilization fully using the energy of, of there. I, I've heard of, I've heard of that. So the Dyson sphere, I think it's a type two civilization, which is they've actually figured out a way to surround a star with these insane solar panels that then like take the energy of the star and then fuel everyone has unlimited resources. Did you hear about that star that they found that they think might? It's got the most boring name too. It's like Ann's star or something, right? It's like, it's like fucking got alien machines around it. Like Judy star, really boring, but, uh, the, uh, but again, this is such a human idea, right? We'll build machines around the thing and it still involves like something pulling up and basically like a super advanced tractor trailer truck that flies through the sky. And this is why one of the questions I wanted to ask you is as someone who do frequently consumes DMT and someone, even during this podcast, you talk about people give things, give a message coming in. Yeah. Who's it coming from? Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. I, I think, I think when I was talking about before that are, that are non-conscious and our consciousness speak all of these different languages and seem like very foreign to one another. I think that, um, I think that there's, there's worlds and universes built inside of our own mind. And I think that the, that the, that the world that the world of our, our brains, this perception is, I think it's to simplify things. I think it's very much like the movie inside out, inside of our brains. I think that's a nice little children's representation of, of exactly what's going on. Do you, but do you use the term, is there a reason you say non-conscious instead of subconscious? Subconscious kind of makes it sound like a lesser, um, and, and consciousness is, is like such a small amount of what is going on in the brain. Um, probably, probably like 0.0001% of, of what the brain's actually doing is, is consciousness. So the non, so, so when you smoke DMT, you think that you are gaining access to these kind of compartmentalized personalities that exist within your non-conscious self. Yeah. And I think it would seem like alien, like imagine that were true. Imagine if they did a follow-up to the movie inside out where the girl's an adult smokes DMT, goes down and meets, like it would, she'd come back and be saying the same, she'd be like, I saw these gods down there. And there's weird, like one of them was really sad and one of them was joyful and one of them was angry. And there was all these weird worlds and, and all these different places in there. And, and I think that it would, um, I mean, it would sound very, very much like that. I think that, I mean, if you think about dreaming when I can have a dream tonight and, and you and 30 other people and, and some people I passed by on the interstate might all be sitting in a room that I constructed in my mind. And I'm writing the script for you, doing an impersonation of you. That's perfect. That's tricking myself. And I don't even know that it's happening. And you're doing that in your sleep, like literally in your sleep. Yeah. And you wake up well rested, like your brain hasn't used that much energy to pull off all of that. I've had it happen a few times in a dream where I've been talking to someone in the dream and it thought, wait, this is a fucking dream. Like, what, who am I talking to here? And then the next question is, well, okay, if you think that these, and, and again, I'm, I don't know. I don't, I don't know anyone can know yet, but the, uh, I'm curious what you think about it. When I smoked DMT last night and, and it's been like a few months and I did it. The last two times I've done it, I've smoked DMT and I've been like, I just saw God, like no doubt about it. I'm a skeptical asshole and I just saw God. You know, it's a pragmatic term. But so a being says to you, be more open minded, right? And this being appears to have some personality. Did you see this being? I saw a bunch of different parallel universes all at once. I saw like this kind of reality, uh, and they all had all of these different rules and laws and like there was one that was just like this weird collection of cylinders that was like building itself. And, and then I saw within all of that, I also saw like a dream, like a man just like going to work, getting home from, from work or whatever. And then all of a sudden it would, it would also just like flash. And then all of a sudden it would be that same man in a completely different reality, like showing me that there's just like these infinite amounts of realities that are all happening at the exact same time. The man was showing you this. The thing, the thing was showing you that thing, that thing. You know, uh, I mean, I think it ultimately, it does matter if it's inside or outside, because if it, it's a different method of quantification. If it's outside, then if it's inside, if it's inside, we might look for it in some kind of fluctuation of energy and somewhat deep level. If it's outside, then the, the approach maybe is going to be different to trying to quantify either way. It's a thing that should be a quantified. We should attempt to figure it out. I don't know how it's like that my mind keeps going back to it. Cause it's like, how do we quantify consciousness? And, and, and it's, you know, I know this is not, I'm not, I'm definitely not the first person to think that, but the benefit to, to the world would be so great if there was some way to actually like, if this is happening inside of your mind, that you are coming into contact with a thing that is you, but isn't you, then you have to ask, all right, well, what is this thing? Does it have a mind? Does it have pieces of itself? Does it have a subconscious? Does my, do the beings in my subconscious have a subconscious? And do those beings have a subconscious? And does this create a kind of recursive Rick and Morty? You had a wonderful episode about this, by the way. Does this create a recursive, never ending infinite? Oh God, those guys are so smart. But if you're, you know, it's, did you see the one I'm talking about where it's like, I saw them all, they go into Freddy Krueger's. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's so good. Yeah, but if the, if the beings in your dreams have their own dreams and the beings in those dreams have their own dreams and you get this, it's weird because it's like, it's kind of like turtles all the way down. It's also the problem. It goes the opposite way too. Like let's say we're simulations. Well, then what's simulating us, even if we were to prove that something was simulating us, there'd be nothing that we could prove that that thing wasn't itself being simulated by something else. So it goes in all directions. All directions. Yeah. And that to me is that's where it's like, man, somebody out there, I don't give a fuck if we're just talking about shifts and glucose and amino acids and blood flow through the human brain or if we're talking about angels, either way, let's figure out what this is. And this is to me, one of the most, I mean, from a more intellectual, rather selfish perspective. And I'm thrilled that people like Doblin are using MDMA to heal PTSD and they have a real logical pathway to use it to heal other things too. But I think another aspect of psychedelic research and the end of the prohibition on psychedelics is this thing here. Because man, if we can induce these states and people and try to figure out where the fuck is this coming from? Where is it in the mind? And what is it? Like is it, it must be the quantum level, right? For something to be so detailed, accurate and infinite in a millisecond. It's got to be something happening in like as an as of yet undiscovered aspect of the human mind. Like what is doing that? Like what machine is running in there? Is there some processor we haven't found yet that exists in some quantum flux state? I don't even know what quantum flux state means. Let's get in there, man. I mean, this is why all of this stuff is so very important, I think. And also we might, things might be easier than we realize. It might just be this little shift in perception of seeing just like the cliche with Galileo and understanding that the earth is revolving around. But so this guy, Daniel Tennant, talks about how Daniel Tennant, rather. Daniel Tennant is, he talks about how, so if you have a computer, this interface looks as if there's lots of things going on at the exact same time. Like you're downloading this, you're watching this, you're changing the volume. You're double clicking, opening this folder. You're writing and playing music and all of these things are happening at the exact same time in the processor, but that's an illusion that computers do. It's actually taking things, it's like, we'll do the little bit of this, a little bit of this, a little bit of this, and then put it all together. So it looks like all of these things are happening at the same time, rather than linearly. He thinks that our brains are doing the exact opposite things. He thinks all of these things in the brain are happening all at the same time and that consciousness is the illusion that makes us think that all of the stuff happening in the brain is happening in this very kind of logical, like one thought is happening in our brain at a time. And how could that be the case? As I'm saying these words, I'm thinking of a whole bunch of other words and other directions I can go with this conversation. And I'm not even realizing I'm moving my hands all about for no reason. I don't even know why I'm not even thinking about it. It's like it's a sandwich, right? It's like it's not, it's stacked on top of itself and it's all happening at once. Yeah. Now I, when I interviewed Ram Das once and I was talking about how like people like him seemed to, by the way, it's 431. Do you have a little bit of time? Yeah, I'm in no hurry. I was talking to him about how people like him seem to have jumped off this diving board, right? They've just gone right into whatever you want to call that state. You know, they have gone fully in and I don't know if he would even describe himself as being fully in, but man, he's like, he's definitely done a lot of practice. And when you're around him, this is a different type of human. No question about it. So I was interviewing him and I said, you know, people like me, it feels like we, you know, we build little homes at the edge of the diving board and they're always looking over at where you're at and people like you are at, but never quite go there. I'm not wearing robes, man. I'm, you know, maybe now that I've been, now that I've been a burner, I will, but like, like, uh, but, um, they're out and about though. I'm not sure if only to live in a world where I was acceptable wear robes, but I guess that's what it dresses. But that's a whole different podcast. The, uh, the, uh, and carry purses too. I'm a man. I want to carry a purse and put on makeup. That's what we get to at the end of all this. We just realized we want to dress like women, but the point of everything we just talked about, dude, we're just ladies, we're just ladies trapped in these dumb man costume. I'm a lady. I like that. Oh my God. You know what? Let's go. Core is here. Let's see if she'll let us wear her clothes. My girlfriend's here. Let's wrap it up. Shane, um, uh, but actually to, to, to finish my point, what he said was, uh, he's like, there's no diving board. He's like, you, you, you are creating the illusion of these different like things that happen to a person like pre, whatever you want to call it, pre woke and then woke, pre realized and realized. He said, actually it's all happening at the exact same time. There is no, there, the whole, we're, we're looking at an entire like spectrum of self and you've sort of made a decision where you want to land on that self. Right now we have identified with our bodies, we have identified with our minds, our names, our social security numbers, but underneath that is this thing you're calling the non-conscious, right? But it's still cooking down there. It's just for this particular period in human evolution, we don't get to hang out down there because, you know, it, there's too many smoke alarms that get set off down there. Right. Yeah. And I mean, I think, I think we figure out exactly. I mean, that's another problem with calling it sub is that it makes it seem like lower, it's like another basement or something. I think that, I think that consciousness resides like in the middle of all of this stuff coming in from all around. The non-conscious is the meat of it, just pumping in and gaining information from the center. That is, well, even that's conscious consciousness is like the nucleus of this like, I don't even know. I mean, it's just consciousness is like some sort of part of a tool for it. I just like the idea that consciousness is the core of the thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's my thinking. But then it's like, well, then you're thinking of consciousness as the center of everything, which is classic egocentrism, which we can't escape from. Well, not if there's a center of consciousness that is some connected, super conscious. This could go on forever. Why are we not wearing lipstick? I mean, I think the point of this and with different levels is we should all try on like different levels of perception and try it. Like nicer shoes. Like maybe some high heels. I mean, I just started wearing boots. It's basically high heels. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, maybe a little eye shadow. Some this kind of some like classy jewelry. Like, yeah, maybe some pantyhose, you know, just try on different things. Be comfortable. And that is truly the seat of the soul. My soul's in pantyhose. Shane, you should tell me about this tour and tell people how they can come see this show. It's around a 65 city tour. I have a feeling it's going to be more like 70 when the dust clears at the time of this recording, we're still putting together a few of the dates, but they should mostly be up if you see any gaps in dates, there are probably ones that I'm filling in, but they should mostly be up by the time you're hearing this. If you go to Shane Moss, M-A-U-S-S dot com and and check it out. It'll be all pretty self-explanatory from my website that my friend Ramin Nasir made for me and made my, he made me adult coloring books based on my show. But anyway, 65 city tour. I, it would mean a lot to me if he came out and checked it out. I think it's, it's the best work I've done in my career so far. So I'm quite proud of it. I can't wait to see it. Is it going to be in LA? I've done it in LA a couple of times. Maybe on the backside of it, I'll come back and do it. Okay, cool. I'm definitely coming to that. It's so funding out with you, man. It's fun to hang out with you. I wish we did this more often. Now I'm going to miss you. You're going away forever, but thank you so much. Thank you. We'll do this again soon.

It is I, Detrusel, a hyper-compressed amalgam of a variety of metals, meats, and scents that have all been brewed together in one of those new Muskean centrifuges on Mars. I'm transmitting this podcast backwards through time, and I'm excited about this one because it was recorded in the year 2022 in Los Angeles at the Netflix is a joke special with someone that I consider to be one of my best friends on the planet, as well as a super genius. His name, of course, Dan Harmon. He's the co-creator of Rick and Morty community. I'm going to be on one of his shows called Crap Populous. Most importantly, he joined me for a live DTFH. And that's what this is. Also, if you are listening to this on the week of June 6th, 2022, come and see me. I'm going to be at the Helium Comedy Club with Johnny Pemberton in Philadelphia. And then I'm going to be at Rosemont, Illinois at Zanies. I hope you'll come and see me do stand-up comedy. Also, if you're listening to this June of 2022, can I recommend wrapping your feet in tinfoil on the night of the 21st? And now, everybody, welcome to the DTFH, Dan Harmon. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the DTFH. DTFH. Our guest for tonight is one of the funniest people that I've ever met in my life. And he's one of my best friends. Everybody, a round of applause for Dan Harmon, everybody. Let him hear it. Dan Harmon! You didn't say anything in the last 15 minutes that I need to know in order to. No. OK. I mean, I was talking about the new documentary on John Wayne Gacy on Netflix. Oh, I've been watching that. Oh, my god. Can you fucking imagine? The tapes? I didn't get. I'm in the first episode. And I just got to the part where the guy who survived, the guy who was down in the basement with him. Oh, my god. Oh, there was a funny moment. I was watching it with Cody and the guy who, the billiard guy, who was like, and then he says, how about we raise the stakes? I'll perform a sex act on you if you win. But if you lose, you perform a sex act on me. And Cody was paying half attention. Cody's my partner who was in bed. She was like, why is he bragging about that? She thought he. I was like, no, John Wayne Gacy made that offer. She thought the guy, she thought this random guy's claim to fame was this one time I cornered John Wayne Gacy. I was going to fuck the hell out of him. What an amazing hero that guy would be if he was, not because of the actor of doing that, but because of the pride he would have retained, like a Teflon tile through all of that atmosphere. 40 years of fucking true crimes. Yeah, so then I said to him, tell you what, I eight ball cornered pocket. I suck your dick, eight ball other pocket. You suck my dick. I said it, and Cody was like, why is he so proud of that? What, okay, what? I know that's not how pool works. I know you don't just put the eight ball in different pockets. What do you think? Young, okay, young Dan Harmon. Thank you. Yeah, well, no, I think you don't have any internal soul. Shit, that's so embarrassing. I thought you were addressing me. No, you're young now, but an even younger version of you ends up like somehow you end up at John Wayne Gacy's house and you're in the basement. You're younger though. You're like, I don't know, 1918. You're in the basement with John Wayne Gacy. He's somehow charismatic. He was into politics. He's running this weird serial killer game on you. He's telling you he's like good friends. The JCs were the Dungeons and Dragons of the early 70s. Yeah, I mean, it was, he had barbecues and he was in the Democratic, I don't know. He was a clown. This stuff was huge in the early 70s. Yeah, no matter what anybody says about John Wayne Gacy, he was a great clown. If you were a fat white man that was a clown and was in the JCs. People loved you. Like initially, it wasn't going to be a horror story. It was going to be like this cool family story. It was the Camaro of not having a car. Being a clown. And just owning a van that said concrete on it. And clown paint used to be way more expensive. So it's like status. So you're, yeah, I've got to get back to this. I met John Wayne Gacy's house. Yeah. And, but you're, it's not like you're, like you're not unnerved. Somehow you look around, you see the Tiki bar and you're kind of like, this guy's kind of cool. You end up in the basement with him. He's got a certificate that he studies homosexuality and he offers you that bet. What do you say? I don't know, I don't want, because I think I would be like, okay. But there's no, did you hear the nature of the bet? No, I think I'm enough of a coward and I'm a people pleaser. So I think I would be like, okay, we'll do the bet. Well, I think I'm so sexually inexperienced that I fail to see the difference between me performing sex on you and you performing it on me. So I feel like I would be all caught up in that, wait a minute. I think, it sounds like no matter what, we're fucking. I'm not sophisticated enough that I understand, like, well, if your pinky's out, you're getting fucked. I would just be like, if I'm sucking your dick and then the next day you tell everyone you fucked me, I'm not gonna be like, you liar, I blew you. I'd be like, yeah, it's fair enough, we've had mostly sex. We touched more than a zookeeper, touches penguins. That would be the best part of the documentary, someone being like, look, I touched John Wayne Gacy more than a zookeeper touches penguins and everyone's like, what does that mean? But wait, are you saying, can you be serious though? Would you or would you not, would you say yes to that bet? Yes, I'm a people pleaser. I would want him to like me and I'm not good at pool. So I would just be like, I guess I'm gonna be fucking you, man or whatever. I don't know, again, I agree. And also I think the sex act part, I think that guy was saying sex act to replace whatever the real deal was. Like, I think John Wayne Gacy. Oh, do you think he was like, you blow, okay. I think he was like, you let me rub my comment to your face. Like you think he got maybe specific. Very specific. And that's the guy said sex act. He made it like truth or dare, like you lick an ashtray versus I'll put my finger in a pine cone, he made it interesting. Yeah, cause this is a clown serial killer. It's not like he's gonna be like, I will perform a sex act on you or you will perform a sex act on me. He was being specific. I didn't even realize that. I was like, God, what an innocent decade. Even murderers that are going to bury you after fucking you in their cross place, they just refer to it as a sex act. But I never even occurred to me that he was censoring it. He was censoring it. And it's probably why he's alive to censor it is because of his inherently, inherent decorum. Yeah, I think that's, I do think that's why I survived. Like I, and I under, like the people who didn't make it, I relate to them. It makes me wanna now ask that guy, what did he say? Yeah, I would love to know. Like what did he offer? Because I wanna know, because I fear what you're saying. Like I think I'm a very manipulatable, pressurable person. Yeah. And I'm confident that I'm not so manipulatable and pressurable that if another grown man offered to do a sex act on me, that I would be like swept up in the moment. Right. But no one ever says that. You never know. People say different stuff. Yeah, you never know. And, and you know, people like that are good at it. He would have said like, have you ever had a rising pony? No, what's that? You've, you, you haven't had a rising pony? No, what is it? I don't know. Maybe I have. Well, let's make this interesting. All right. Stars and stripes. Yeah. Out tonight. Lucky Lou. Yeah. Left versus right. Yeah. I sink a three ball, a rising pony. You sink the two ball, bling, bling, bony. You don't know what these things mean? Can I have another drink? And you work in, what did you say you do? I'm a camp counselor. You work in camp counseling and you don't know what to write? I'll do anything you want. Sorry. I got to call my cool camp counseling friends. No, no, no, no. I'm really lonely. No, you don't want me to? No. I mean, I like you. Remind me of my dad a little bit. I don't know. Can we just play pool? I just, I had this hotline installed to all the top camp counselors in the nation. Wow. I'm in the JC's. That's. So you have an all hang it up. What do you do? I mean, just based on your understanding of me. Well, a rising pony is when the man takes his rightful position across another man's breast. Yeah. Embraces both of their equal masculinity. Oh, you ride me like a rising pony. I raise you like a pony. We rise together. Gotham's Reckoning. Let's play pool. That's what he's praying as guys that are just like, I just want to play pool. OK, I'm fine. Whatever, man, we'll play. I'll give you a triple sand chest and clip the thing. All right, I'm so bored. I want to play pool as a Tiki bar. OK, so. The flame also rises. People like John Wayne Gacy, I think they exist, or they get to exist because people like us don't believe that it can go that bad, that it can go that far south, that someone goes from being just a typical douchebag to being a kind of praying mantis that is like strangling people and burying them in their basement. So all the people you've met and all of your experience is like one of the great comedy writers alive today. Have you ever found yourself in the presence of someone where you realize this person is legitimately evil? I mean, it's probably been like airport shuttles. Right. That's where they all are. Yeah, yeah, not like, I don't know, I'm sorry. It's a disappointing answer, but the answer is probably yeah, but I'm so old, I don't remember. Yeah, no, I mean, I would have the same answer. I mean, I just think like the shit that's going on in the world right now, it's like we just got it. Fauci is saying we're out of the pandemic phase and almost on schedule. To add a new worry to our list of worries, every single one of us now has to slightly, in the back of our heads, worry about a nuclear war. And I think about how wild that is. And I try to think about like Vladimir Putin. And I try to think like, how do you get to that? What is he like? Like, who is that person? Who's someone who's like just launching missiles? Who's someone who's like, let's do a kind of World War II thing again, see what happens. And to me, I think, oh my god, is it the reason that's surprising to me? Because I'm sort of brainwashed into believing that that's not out there when it's so out there, like so many different John Wayne Gacy, so many different murderous people, so many different people who are like, your whole ethical, humanist, bullshit system is so dumb. It's so dumb. We're here to get power and destroy. Wish I had a question to follow that up. I don't even know why I did that. I remembered somebody that I was like, oh shit, this guy's evil, but he's definitely my friend's manager. So I was like, oh my god, really? I assume since he's evil, he'd sue me if I mentioned his name. That's what they do. That's the greatest trial ever. He has to prove he's not evil. That's a great trial. No, you know, I, OK, Carl, did you ever get into the Carlos Castaneda books? No. Don Juan. Basically, it's a sorcerer who, an anthropologist meets a sorcerer, and the sorcerer does really strange things. I like the books, but at some point it gets to this place where the sorcerer, as part of one of the rituals, is sewing lizard eyes shut. That's part of the ritual. And I've talked to people about it who liked those books. They were offended. The lizards asked to have their eyes sewn shut. It's like, what are you talking about? They're lizards. They don't talk. It's a lizard. But I was talking to someone who? Well, you know, the core of the entire brain is the victim-blaming lobe. The what? Nothing. Say it again. Wait, what? It's a victim-blaming lobe. It doesn't matter. Just the acoustics aren't good for new ones. What's a victim-blaming lobe? It's stupid. It's victim-blaming to say that a lizard wants its eyes glued shut. And I don't know. Oh, whoa! Add to that. I'm drunk. I haven't been in front of a live audience in three years. And you get what happened. He hasn't been in front of a live audience in three years. Do you want to murder or fuck me? A tremendous thank you to Loomi Labs for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

I love them, Loomi Labs. Please keep sending me boxes of this wonderful stuff. Somehow it's available nationwide. I don't understand how that's possible, but it is.

And as I'm thinking about doing this podcast with you, I realized that my question, like the core of what I want to talk to you about might embarrass you. And so I'm sorry. It's not like a scandalous embarrassment because you're humble. But I think you might be the funniest person I ever met in my life. You mentioned that and it killed my, you heard how they responded. You made that part of my intro and I'm, I think it made them clap more quietly when I came on. And I'm on your side. I'm on your side because that's a crazy thing to ask people to acknowledge by clapping. Here he is. He's a philosopher. He cured cancer. Robin Thicke. And you'd be like, it wouldn't matter what you thought. You'd be like, go on. That would be your response because there would be a hyperbolic intro. You'd be reserving your right to invest. You, there have been so many times as a comedian. But that's a very nice thing to say. Well, it's, I, but. Interpersonally. Interpersonally. But as a comedian, you know, I, it just, it's being around you sometimes when you're like, suddenly you're just saying the funniest thing, but you're not saying the funniest thing like every year, like I do, you're doing it like every couple of minutes or seconds, it's like what's, it's like a computer that's throwing out the funniest thing. And what, what do you like, you clearly, I mean, all my, whatever that may be aside, obviously you've made a whole life out of this ability. And you've created some of the, some of the, some shows that like are the funniest things I've ever seen. And I'm sorry, this is such a lame question, but I just wonder, do you ever, you're smoking. Do you, do you, what are you talking? Do you ever go meta with it and think to yourself, what is, what is the thing that is doing this? Like what is the thing that these stories are appearing from? What is the thing that the Harmon's Story Circle, or what is the thing that is making these things live in other people's minds all over the world? Do you ever get meta and think, where's it coming from? What is it? Well, I have a, I have a really, really, I have a really sad answer to that question, because I'm obsessed with my sister's disability. Can I just leave that there? That's your answer? My older sister was born with a syndrome that I researched and like it was like what the, there's a, it has to do with all these sheaths and chemicals and things and I kind of got it in my, cause I want to torture myself with believing that the reason my older sister is deprived of my life is because I stole her brain. In absentia, I'm her younger brother, I'm not like a villain. I stole it like a wizard. That's, Dan, a wizard can be a villain. I know, I have a real answer. It's like, it's like, there's a real chemical answer to that, cause there's like chemicals that like in the right, in the wrong combination, they can like, they, well, every, yeah. Yeah, I have a real answer to that question. It just makes me, it just, it's just, it's just sad. You think it has to do with like, like the forming connections and like your RPMs and things. And then if you, if you got too much of it, you, you, you're miserable. And if you have not enough of it, you, you get to pay your rent in your 20s. And it's, it's just not fair. Right. All things not fair. That's what I thought. Anytime you've been that funny around me, I'm like, this isn't fucking fair. I spend so much time trying to make a funny joke. And then, you know, that you're just like, kind of like vomiting out or like, they call out, you know, when people are speaking in tongues. But I don't really, I'm kind of fascinated. I was like, I don't, I don't know what you mean. I don't, I don't perceive myself as a person that makes jokes though. I don't know what that means. You don't remember when you had those glow in the dark mice on your finger after the last live podcast we did? That sounds like a prop gag. I mean, I, that sounds like, I gave you the mice. It's funny. Yeah. It sounds like you're the funny one. You provided me with a funny prop. See, that's what someone like you would do. It's like, you gave me the glow in the dark mice. That's the easiest part. Well, I think that's a fair, it sounds like they, they agree. They're like, satisfying answer. I mean, he's, he's saying I'm very funny. And then his first example is that one time I had a thing on my finger that he gave me. He gave me. Okay. But glow in the dark mice are neutral. It's not like an implicitly funny prop. They could be terrifying. Imagine if John Wayne Gacy put those motherfuckers on his fingers, they would be in no one. They wouldn't, they wouldn't sell them. No, I just This is mice, those mice, they were like from the dollar store. And there was like, God damn it. What, what happened with that product? You could buy a box of Yeah. Mice that were fingertip sized. Yeah. And each of them had an independent battery. Right. Or, or were they all connected by a network? No, they had an independent battery. Oh my God. The, I mean, and then, and then. So before you could ask the question, why would I ever want this? The package, as if in desperation says night blogging. You remember? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a photo of a kid with a hoodie on going. And he's got a little mice lights on his fingers. And it's like night blogging. As if the reason you can't blog at night is because the tops of your fingers aren't lit up. That doesn't, none of that makes sense. I can't believe you remember that. I want to cry. Cause that was one of my favorite mo in comedy, watching you riff on night blogging at this bar when we're all hammered. I go back all the time and just think like, I'll never be that funny. It was so cool. But I wasn't doing, it was the product was funny. We were all being funny. I agree. All right. Look, I'm sorry for blowing smoke up. What did you do tonight Natalie? I went to the Netflix festival. Really? Isn't there a pandemic? No, the pandemic's over. Okay, we'll put a pin in that. Who did you see? I saw Duncan Tressel, some guy came out. Who was he? I don't know. I guess he fucked a baby in a 2006 comedy sketch. Oh yeah. Why was that fun? Well, they kept arguing with each other about whether one of them was as funny as the other one said he was. Oh, so you had a good time? No, I'm being sarcastic. Natalie. That was the weirdest thing, Dan. When all of a sudden everyone's like, all these like cute people are at your throat for like dry humping a baby doll. For a truly victimless crime, I can't stress enough, not a real baby. It wasn't even like a good baby doll. It was like a cheap, you skimped on the props. Certainly wasn't a hot baby. Yeah. I did not ask that that would be expensive, I assume. It was like, go to the dollar store, get me a baby, we're doing this bit. Yeah. I don't, you know, we really shouldn't talk about it. Why? Well, because this festival's sponsored by a network that pulled out of a movie deal because of that. Are you kidding me? Oh, fuck. But it's okay. They hand out PDFs of my story structure so they can make writers work for minimum wage. Oh, shit. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm 49. If you live long enough, you see everything. Wow. Well, I had no, first of all, I had no idea that you dry humping a baby. Would Netflix pull out of a movie deal? Oh, yeah. No, it will. They'll probably deny it. I know it will make them do it. It'll make AT&T on it. I know it will make them do it. It'll make AT&T almost ruin your life. It'll make Snickers temporarily pull back. It'll make, you have the power as a hillbilly to cause a great deal of fucking fluctuation in my tenure. Here's the problem, though. What you'll be creating if you do that and it doesn't kill me all the way is a guy that now gives zero fucks about anyone. Well, don't applaud that. That sounds, that's silly. Yes! No, but I didn't know. And don't, certainly don't arsineo-woof-woof it. Please don't woof-woof it. I don't mean to shame you, sir. I don't mean to shame your woof-woofs. I just mean I don't deserve the arsineo-woof-woof. No, I just mean, I don't mean it's a problem. I didn't mean it like a Clint Eastwood way where I'm like, here's the problem. I'm fucking badass. I meant like the problem is I will no longer give the charity. Wow. I might, I might have before. You might have been able to convince me on a rainy day like, hey, umbrella fund. And now I'm like, fuck all humans. Wow. Which one are you? Are you going to eat me? One of the weirdest, so after that happened, I was at the comedy store. I was talking to a QAnon person. And as one does, they show up. And this person, maybe not knowing we're friends, brings you up. He's like, you know, look at Dan Harmon, one of the Satanic elite. And having hung out with him is so flattering. He does. I had to be like, he's not, he's not. Why'd you fuck you, Duncan? You're not. I've hung out with the actual Satanic elite. Okay. What did you call it? Okay. What did you call it? Did you say he's not Satanic? I said, he called me elite. I said, you're not Satanic elite. You are Satanic. And I'm back to square one with this guy. No, no, I, you know, having hung out with actual like religious Satanists who, by the way, I think they would murder someone who heard a kid. Like they're so, that's the opposite of like, they're terrifying and they're like sort of, they're awful evil. Because every kid is a potential Satanist, I assume, as with most human society. They're not even trying to recruit. They just have this idea of personal autonomy, free will. I mean, I do think there's like, there's a really creepy essay by Alistair Crowley called On the Bloody Sacrifice. Highly recommend it. It's an essay about human sacrifice and, but it's anthropological in that he brings in all the world myths, Christianity being one of the primary child sacrifice stories where like that archetype pops up, which is, you know, what is it? Isaac, you know, Isaac in, what was Isaac's dad's name? Abraham. Yeah, God goes to Abraham says, bring on. The famous, the famous bit. What's the bit? Where God's like, you're gonna stab your kid tomorrow. Yeah. No, come on, G, man. I've been a, I've been a, I've told the line. I know you have. That's why you gotta stab your kid. The worst. 9 a.m., you ready? Ah, come on, G. What, you go, oh, oh, is that, oh, I get it. You like me tell you gotta stab your kid? Is that the kind of Christian you're going to be? Or a Jew? I don't know what the, what's the, it's old Testament, right? And then, and then, and then, yeah, we all know the story. And then he's like, about to do it. Boy, I really don't want to stab my kid. And then he's like, and then God's like, psych. Congratulations. You are 1000th customer. Oh, I feel so good about myself. Yeah. But that, that story is the worst thing that happened to kids, right? Like, because every schizophrenic parent is like, I gotta stab you. I've heard the voice. And you're like, mom, but mom, you're, you're, you're not taking me out of the cell range, right? Yeah, right. You get, but, but you're going to hear the, the, the stand down. The what? The, the, the all important just kidding part of kill your kid. No. Actually, sometimes that does it. Yeah. I believe that. Yeah. The newspaper will tell you sometimes they don't get the second part of the order. That, but this was when at the comedy store, when this person was like, seriously saying, was that the light? Did they flat? Yeah. Because, yeah. They flashed the, they flashed the entire, all of the lights in the entire house. No, I know. I told them to, I told them to flash the lights. So I know what, what time to, we have to, we have to get out of here at nine. We have 30 minutes. So, okay. So you told them, I said flash the lights because I knew if I started, there's a half hour left fluctuate every light in the entire auditorium. I didn't tell them that, but I liked it. It was cool. It was dramatic. Give me the subtle sign. All right. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm drunk. I'm drunk. I'm sorry. I am a little too. This is what I'm saying. The, to me, that was one of the first moments, pandemic moments for me where I realized, holy shit, like it wasn't, that was a moment where I realized things are, people are losing their shit. Like that was a moment where I'm like, oh my God, like you, you're not ironically saying that you really believe like in your moment. Sorry. What, what, what, when someone told me you were part like a, a member of some kind of like satanic elite, it was like knowing you and like knowing you're the furthest thing away from anything that would ever hurt. People tell me that about you. They do. I mean, I'm not kidding. I mean, if I, if I, if I were to mention you, I have 500,000 followers on my Instagram. If I Instagramed a photo of you, tagged you, then statistically some fucking hillbilly is going to say, he's a Satan. He's in this. Sorry. I know you're also a hillbilly now. I didn't mean to, I don't want to, I don't want to get you in trouble back home. No, no, no. But it, I use that term ignorantly. I don't know. You're allowed to say it. I don't know where there are hills. There, there, there is some guy, some, some person will go because I'll go, I'll go like, oh, I, I watched, I don't know. Batman nine meets Ant-Man three with Tom Hanks or Colin Hanks. And like, there'll always be one comment that goes like, you know, he's a wizard. Yeah. It's not, you're not. Yeah. Well, that's so, but that's so for me. And then you'll click on the person's profile and it'll, it won't, you'll find out. They're not kidding. They, they're like vigilant. That's the part that gives me the heebie-jeebies. That's the part that creeps me out, man, because I remember when I was in college that there was a snowstorm and the power went out for like four days. And I like day, like within like a day, people were already getting weird with no power. Like transformers would flash in the distance and stuff. And it was the, that world without electricity was a, was a really strange world. And so when the witch burning stuff starts popping up like that, right now, because we have power, it's, there's something about it that's for you. It was really fucked up. I can't, I was so dumb and so fucked up, but still it's like, shut the fuck up. There's no, no one's eating adrenochrome. There's no satanically, please stop. That's not really what's happening. But you used to have fun with that stuff. You used to think that was funny. The satanic stuff? Yeah. Well, I mean, I was, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I'm saying, like, right. You, we both, like both of us. Like, like, like you used to, Can I just say this? You would be like, like people think I'm in the Illuminati, like you would tell me. Yeah. Like, I'm gonna troll them by like, Right. You troll. Doing a thing as an Easter egg. And it's like, look how mad they get. There's, you have to, well, first of all, Satanists have the best cocaine. I hate cocaine. The only good cocaine I've ever had, it came from like authentic Satanist and it was amazing. That's why I could never be a Satanist because I don't have enough self control. I would like OD, but so I'm not denying that Satan, like Satanism is a world, it's one of the world religions. It's a religion. It's a, it's a way of looking at the world that runs counter to Christian ideology and built into it is what I would consider to be some very beautiful things. Like, I think you would be out of your mind and not recognize within the Satanic philosophy. There's stuff in there that's like really great personal autonomy, respecting other people. I think you, and there's various forms of Satanism, but you have to look at like the, the idea of Lucifer, the romantic Lucifer. Like what, what, what was the great crime? Like not wanting to worship God, right? That was the great crime, I guess, or turning your back on God or something. It was, it's ridiculous. The whole thing is nuts. So Lucifer is a representation of autonomy is really beautiful. Dan, I said this was a podcast. These are all my lied. These are all members. These are all members of my Satanic.

That brings us to the question and answer period. I think we have a little bit of time. Would you mind taking some questions? Of course. Okay. There's a microphone there. This is going to be anarchy and chaos. But for the last little bit of the show, we've got, let's see here. Wait, we have more time than I thought. Dan, I'm sorry. The reason why I started harping on that was because I never, I never thought you of all people, because you were, you were expressing a sort of almost, I don't want to call it outrage, because that's not a very Duncan word, but you were like, I can't believe these people believe in. I was mad. Did you cross a threshold where you started getting mad about that stuff instead of being tickled by it? Yeah, I got mad because it wasn't funny anymore. It wasn't some fun thing where you're like, it was like silly or whatever. It's like, wait, you can't believe that. You can't really seriously believe that about my friend. It's not true. It's not true. And I can't believe you're putting me in the position of having to like actually tell you that this person is not like that and that what you're saying is, is crazy. Like, I remember driving home and thinking like, what world am I in that I, it's like, what is the difference between this and the witch trials? What is the difference between this and like Plymouth and like, you know, just hanging out at a pub. And they were like, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I can't believe I accused someone of drinking baby adrenaline. Boy, I went off half cocktail and then I good thing I did that. And then someone I trust told me I was way out of line. And then that and then I'm sure they, they were like, oh, okay. All right. And that's how they learned and they became a great person. These people are fucking idiots, no matter what they believe. Okay. Okay, wait. Okay. I mean, their, their brains are clay. Right. And you just shape them. That's what the, that's what our evil counterparts look here. The thing that I define evil as, you know, the whole 5% or 10% or 85% or thing. It's like the model of the, that's what I keep falling back on. It's like the, there's 85% of the people don't know the difference between anything. If you tell them hitting yourself in the head with a hammer is good for you and you catch them at the right time. They'll just, they'll be doing it until you tell them it's not good for them. Right. 10% of the people who always outnumber the 5% 2 to 1, which is the eternal tragedy. 10% of the people use that futility as an excuse to fuck with those people. Right. They make them hit themselves in the heads with hammers and they say it'll give them a Bitcoin or they like, they're like, hey, hey. And they, and that's where you hear arguments that you've all heard. Like if I don't do it, someone else will. Or this person was, if you're not, you know, or the thing that I just expressed their brains are clay, which and then the 5% are the sad lot who are only as smart as the 10% but are outnumbered 2 to 1. And but who have chosen to bother to spend their lives trying to save the 85% from the 10%, which is kind of the equivalent of saving sand from water, gravity, water. I don't know, pick your metaphor. It depends. I mean, I, I, I, I, in my old age, I go, well, I think I just fluctuate. I think we have moods. I think I spend a bunch of my time as a 10% and then I have these brief flashes of being a 5%. Right. Why did I bring this up? Open your laptop. Okay, wait. No, but what you just said is actually why I think, and I have no real evidence for this, barely any evidence for it, but I really think there might be secret societies because I think what happens is after like right now we're in a great period because somebody can just be like, I think your friend might be, you know, harvesting adrenochrome. And I can be like, that's not real. And he can be like, you might be right. But a hundred years ago, a hundred years ago, say that to 300 years. I don't know when the Spanish Inquisition happened, but say that to the wrong people. Someone showing up at your door, dragging you out or like if you didn't fuck a priest, a priest could be like, suck my dick. You know, I don't want to. And the priest is like, maybe you're a witch. You know, all right, I'll suck your dick. But we're in a time now where that can't happen. Don't you think we're already there? And I don't mean that dramatically. I don't mean that like, we're already there because I'm not using that voice. But don't you think in a certain sense, to the extent that you could identify a threshold, haven't we crossed it a long time ago? Because don't we already live in a world where if you're sitting at a bar and you could be holding a device in your hand that literally has access to all the factual information that you could ever want. Yeah. And you could, you can be in an argument with people. You'd rather have the argument like you don't. And therefore hysteria has won. Like it turns out you can equip. Yeah. Homosapien with like as much cybernetic access to as much information as you want. I got you. We've, we've got a little bit of a alarmist addiction. I got you. And, and, and that's how you get the crucible. That's how you get, we like it. We're into it. It spikes our dopamine to be a part of felling a redwood. I quit Twitter because it stopped being about being on the right side of history or the future. And it became, I was like, this hurts my feelings because it makes me feel like a six year old where I'm just all I know is that everyone would enjoy for this moment watching me fall. And, and, and that's what will win out. Silicon Valley has provided us with that Netflix. Like, like, like they run TV now. They make their TV deals based on algorithms and they, they don't enjoy us. All right, let's close up friends. We don't have, they're flashing because they have to. I, that Dan, just so you know, that was one of the scariest things I ever heard. And I love it. And that's why I love you. But only because I had this planned, it's a little non graceful to jump into this. But would you freestyle rap for us? Wow. I mean, I can say I will, but I am pretty sure we all know I've got some rhymes in my back pocket. Okay. Dan Harmon. What's that? Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. My name is, oh wait, sorry. Oh, no. Okay. What? Okay. Wait, I thought you'd, wait. No, it doesn't, what is it? Okay. I thought you'd know when you heard that sound and you sent her out. I don't know why I thought that. I said, yo, 20 times. I mean, I don't. Wait, hold on. I'll start it here. Hold on. Okay. Sorry. I'm not a DJ. I don't know how to do this. I don't know. This is Ableton. I've never, I've never usually. Okay. Wait, you pointed? Wait. Yo. Hold on. Is there like a point where I'm supposed to come in? Is it like a, I don't know. I don't fainted on Ableton. I don't know. You run. I'm sorry. What am I doing? Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Okay. Wait. I'm sorry. Sorry. Just go whatever you want. I gotta have support for trying to control him. Yeah, yeah. Yo, yo, yo. I got the rhymes. I got the times. I got your mama's pussy with the squeeze of lines. I got the rim. I got the glass. I got up for breakfast, served your mama's ass. I made eggs and bacon. I ain't faking. I flipped them. You are. I ain't faking. I flipped them. Pancake griddle, And I'm making more breakfast for everyone all day long. Some people call it volunteer work. That's my song. Volunteer work. Dan Armand everybody, let him hear it. Yes. It's, um, that was amazing. Let me just, Dan, you are so funny. It's a, well, don't say that. Then they go, well, that's not evidence of that. That's just basic comedy sports improv workshops. I have to do something unprofessional and ask the venue. Do we have 20 minutes? Am I, we have 20 minutes, right? How much time do we have? 20, 20. Okay, great. So, okay, great. Thank you. Sorry. So we, I got confused with a light signaling system here and lost track of where we're at. Uh, so we have about 20. Do you mind taking some questions? Can we do some questions? Of course, of course. Okay. We have 20 minutes to take questions. Whoever wants to walk up to the mic and ask a question, if you could do, if you could do everyone a favor and keep the questions brief, that gives more people a chance to ask. Also, and just to save time because I know a lot of you want to know it wasn't a real baby. Everyone sits down. That's everyone's question. All right. Okay. Go ahead. Hey Duncan. I have a question for you. Wait, what's your name? Pascal. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Uh, I'm really happy to be here. Dan, why do you think there's some recent emergence of people talking about flat earth? I don't know. I mean, I, I'm so old it doesn't feel recent anymore. I, I don't, I don't know why there's a reason. I, I, I would assume it's intersectional with just the general, uh, uh, uh, anyone could answer this. Are you a flat earth or? No, of course not. Yeah. Uh, square earth all the way. Square earth all the way. I'm, I'm hollow earth. It's six flat earths combined. All seven planes. All right. I mean, it's, I think, you know, it's just like, the, the, the, the, the interesting thing about the flat earth thing is how I believe you would agree that there was a time like remember a long, people are uncomfortable remembering this, but fucking Alex Jones used to be just the guy that was like, Obama's a reptile. And we were having fun. It was so funny. And flat earth was part of that. It was like, to me, I died. And I think this partly answers your question is because there was a, there was a dopamine spike at a certain point where it was sort of like, you know what? It's a little bit punk rock and fuck you to just suck your thumb and go prove the earth's round. The anarchist. Before it got connected to our terrible times, it was fun. And I think the rise of it is just a bunch of people that don't know what fun is. Oh, okay. Well, thank you. Thanks for the question. Oh, I love being here. You guys are great. Thanks for coming. Duncan, Dan, two of my favorite people in the world, man. Thank you. What's your name? William. Great to meet you. You bought my girlfriend and I rounds of drinks at the comedy store about two years ago. Oh. And we chatted about my grandfather coming on your podcast because he's an Apollo astronaut. Oh, yeah. He's a big fan of Zacharias Sitchin, the Anunnakai. What happened with that? Well, he died. That's what happened, Duncan. Damn it. That's it. And he walks away. And then you hear a gunshot from the back of the theater. Yeah, he died, Duncan. You didn't respond. I don't remember getting the email. No, we emailed like four times. I don't remember being excited because you insinuated that he had secret information. He did. He did. He was a big fan of Zacharias Sitchin. He was a big fan of the alien. He went on a Good Morning Britain and talked about, you know, we are the aliens. We are Anunnakai. They brought humans here. They greeted us as a gold mining slave race. All these things. You had the coolest grandfather. My grandfather was in Carving Birds. Out of wood. Yeah, he was very special to me. And I really wanted him to come on your podcast because it would have been a great fit. I'm sorry. He'd love to talk about aliens, but he did die. He died like six months after we met and we tried to organize it. It's all good. I would have loved for you to meet him. But I just wanted to bring that information to you one because I thought it was kind of funny. But, you know, you could have talked about all the everything. Just so you know, I can show you emails from 2012. Yeah. From people being like, do you accept Bitcoin donations? And I'm like, what the fuck's Bitcoin? Imaginary bullshit. Man. So I regret not responding. I'm so sorry. I wish I... I don't blame you at all. I'm just coming here to, you know, be present in this moment and say it to you because I think it's, you know, comedic value that you died and that you could have talked about aliens and shit. Look, I'm sorry your fucking grandfather died. All right. I'm sorry. I got a lot of emails. All right. What do you want me to do? Fly into hell. Bring him back again. He's gone. He was an astronaut. He has some secrets. He's gone. All right. We'll leave this over. It's over. And I think you had to sweeten the kitty of a human life by going, he had some secrets. Thank you. You started to panic. You're like, how can I make his life worth more? Yeah, exactly. He died with microfiche. Yeah. So I come to you both thanking you for being here. Cheers. Great to see you both. Great to see you. Thank you for the question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I had his grandfather assassinated. Hi. Hi. I guess this question is mostly for Dan. When you're building stuff, metric or imperial? Well, metric or metric or imperial in woodwork. Imperial, but not because I don't think metric is valid. Because the hardware store sells everything in imperial. That's it. That's all it is. I enjoy learning the fractional things. And I recognize that in a proper world, we would all be metric. I do. However, I also recognize that in a proper world, we would all be named Dave. And then why is that, Dan? That would be confusing. Well, let me finish. Dave just signifies he was a human. And then there's a string of digits after your name. It's like a QR code. Dan, this doesn't sound good. Well, metric system. Anyways, I don't. Thank you. Thank you for the question. People on Instagram, they think that when you go like, I use three-quarter inch plywood. There are people from Canada that will go like, just go metric. They think that we in America wake up every day and go, fuck metric. I mean, we can't walk into true value and be like, I refuse your system, Uncle Sam. I'm on the right side of history. I will stand here until this plywood is replaced with metric plywood. Anyway, sorry. No worries. You said that like there's worries, but... We're cool. God, I'm attacking everyone. I'm attacking everyone. It's like three drinks. You can't follow it. My grandfather was going to tell you secrets about the aliens. I'm attacking. Do you use imperial or metric? It becomes a tick. I want to get a laugh. I'm going to attack people. It's stupid. It's a bad habit. It's toxic. It's not a trussle audience compatible. They don't mind. They love you. You have a healthy fan base. They're, what's your fucking question? I just wanted to say my dead grandfather also had NASA secrets. I just wanted to say... God, you son of a bitch. We trusted you. What the... No, but... Okay, so for either of you, if you could snap your fingers and make it so that the world's water supply ran with psilocybin for just one day. Yeah. Would you, and what do you think the effects would be? I got fucking kids. I mean, in my minus... What do you want, my kids? I thought about this. Mushrooms, hippie. I get it. What do you want? You want my kids to have a bad trip? I thought you might have some questions. You might get to watch Coco Mellen and see the devil. You can take out the kids. What the fuck kind of question is that? Do I want to poison all the animals? Okay. People fly in planes. Just everybody not important. Just everybody not important except... But that includes presidents and stuff. But everybody like... That wasn't your question. Your question was would I poison the world's water supply with a psycho act? Just birds flying into the ground. I didn't want to take up all the time explaining all the intricacies of my thought process. But I did think about the children. I did think about the children. I didn't. Okay, boomers. I think it would be rad. I'm 49. Yeah, man. I come everywhere. Yeah. I think you should put drugs on cartoons. No, I love... I mean, don't get me wrong. I think mushrooms are great. But I think the general idea that a lot of people who enjoy psychedelics have is like, get mushrooms to Kim Jong-un. And he's going to say, why was I acting like this? When the reality is he's going to be like, why didn't I... I got to shoot missiles now. This is a thing to do. I just think the idea of them as a universal kind of making people universally benevolent is a little... I mean, I've been possessed by demons on mushrooms. True, true. Yeah, me too. Thank you for the question. Have they done that though? I mean, because you can identify sociopaths, like have they done... They must have done tests. Giving mushrooms to sociopaths? Because they've kind of clinically proven that people with PTSD benefit from psilocybin. And so like they must have taken like sociopaths and psychopaths and given them mushrooms. I mean, I've never thought about that. Maybe it's another show on Netflix, Dan. We should pitch it. I don't think... I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know. I think it's a beautiful... I don't know. I don't think that's the answer though, probably. I think it'd be better to put cyanide in the water supply and kill everything on Earth. Next question. What? This guy... Howdy y'all. My name is Brendan, so... Hi, Brendan. Sorry, I'm looking at the time to make sure we're not running over. They have a show at night. Oops, sorry. We have ten minutes. I don't know how to stop it. I can go to the tin bomb view. Yo, okay. Angels. Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Angels. Angels. Go ahead. If you could follow me for a second here. So, the other night I was watching the cartoon DuckTales on Disney Plus. Yeah. And I'd never seen it before. I was just kind of checking it out. I've heard everybody loves it. There was this disclaimer at the beginning of the episode that said, hey, we do not condone the content of this episode, but we think it's important to show and learn from this experience of this episode. And it was about this Spanish conquistador that... He was like a dog conquistador. And he... I know the episode well. You know the episode well. So, I don't have to explain, but my question is this. Do you think we'll be in a world in the future where Midnight Gospel, Rick and Morty might have some of these disclaimers in the beginning? And how would that make you feel as creators of these episodes? That would make me feel great because you know what Netflix does, they literally delete shit. They don't invite you into the conversation. Thanksgiving, my niece and nephew came over and my family who loves these kids and who want to parentally guide them wanted to show them Peter Pan. Disney, an ostensibly accountable corporation. I don't know. I guess they've got their eyes on financial prizes. Disney, when they keep Peter Pan on Disney Plus and then when you play it, God, it's the darndest thing. There's just a crawl that says, this shit is racist. And if you're going to watch it, you're going to see a bunch of racist shit because it's Peter Pan and it's from the 40s. Go fuck yourself. We're not removing it because it's a property. We own it. We make money off of it. Netflix is just like, doesn't exist. That seems stone agey. I just don't. It feels weird to me that the air blasts a fuck that you're like, like, oh, every mash episode where Klinger wore a dress, Mr. Ed's doing horse face. I don't just put a warning at the top. You're helping me understand something. So when I announced you were going to be on the show, Netflix, they sent me a warning of flyer that they made. And it was like the worst picture of you. Oh my God. And I literally said to my assistant, I'm like, what the fuck? We're not using that. Now I see why. I mean, I grew up in the 90s where it was the explicit lyrics. And also during the 80s, there was the rise of PG-13. A lot of people that look at the stuff like, I don't think that these were good ways to raise kids, but I don't think that these were corporations being the most responsible corporations in the world. But I mean, memory-holding art is insane. That to me, it's crazy because you can't undo it. Netflix isn't going to have a referendum where they say, does everyone want to bring back the most racist episode of the office ever? Even 20 years from now. At which point, some of these pretty cool zoomers are going to be like, yeah, I want to see the most racist office ever. I watch a show about a guy who imprisons people in his basement with plexiglass. I'm down to clown. I can handle it. Down to clown. Give me a warning. I'd like to raise myself. I'm 13. That's a good question. Yeah, so I would love warnings. I think warnings are great. I think erasure is frightening. Yeah, me too. Great question. Thank you. I think we have time for maybe two more questions. I promised them I'd be out by nine and they have another show to get in. So apologies for those waiting. Probably only time for two more. Hi, I'm Liv. Hi. It's really cool. I'm talking to you right now. I'm really excited. Great meeting you. My question was just, I love hearing about your family and I wanted to know how you were doing moving your family to LA, how your kids were and what was the most recent exciting moment that you've realized as a father, especially in these kind of crazy times. And Dan, I'm not sure if you have any kids, but if you do, you can add on to that. Well, I tell Dan about my family a lot. I'll let you answer that, Dan, about my family. Also, I love Erin and yeah, I love her. If she's here, I love your Erin. Thank you. She's not. She's going to Austin right now because we're probably going to end up moving there. Like we ended up looking at a bunch of houses out here and stuff and it just didn't. But I was so lucky that I even get to look at houses in LA. It's incredible. As far as like a cool, very quick family story, this is like where being a parent becomes incredibly psychedelic. My oldest saw Erin and I getting a horrible fight. And sometime after that, we're sledding. This is the cool thing about kids in the middle of like whatever. They just say stuff. So you're sledding. Bring the sled up. He goes, Dad, remember that time? He was like, remember when you and mommy got in a big fight? I'm like, yes. And he goes, Jesus wouldn't get angry like that. Oh, it was fucking intense. It's like God appears in front of you. Like it's the burning bush or whatever. You know, it's like that moment of you're like, I will do everything going forward. Oh my God. That's how you interpreted that. I would have been like, my kid is a sociopath. What? Why? Manipulating you. You think forest is manipulating me? Whoa. When else do you invoke God except to manipulate people? What do you think he was channeling God? Okay, baby hopper. Next question. Thank you so much. That was a good question. Time for one more question. Sorry. You should be proud. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, guys. I was wondering if we could end it with a quick improv exercise between you two. Here's the setup. John Wayne Gacy needs to fill a room in his house. So we have a potential tenant coming to check out a room, but there's underlying stench. So Dan is John Wayne Gacy. Okay. Duncan, you're a potential tenant. Okay, great. Awesome. I don't know why I'm coming in. Okay. Hold on. Let me look at the time. I'm sorry, John. I got to look at my watch. Okay. We have three minutes. I'm already giving space to objects. All right. I mean, obviously we took different workshops. I did never take a fucking improv class. Knocking on the... That's what my parents would do. You're knocking on the table to represent... You're knocking on a door. Just knocking the door. Knock, knock, knock. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm attacking. I'm always attacking. Listen, no, it's okay. I just want a room. All right. I didn't know this was an improv lesson. Gacy. Okay. Hey, how's it going? I heard you have a room for rent here. Yeah. It's pretty much, come on in. Thanks. Wow. Going back there, check it out. I'm in there. Pretty cool. There's wall to wall, walls, and there's stuff. I'm going to lay out some Cheetos on this counter. Yeah. Facing this mirror. What? I just have to say, you have the most beautiful house I've ever seen. Oh, come on. It's not that great. There's an airport nearby. Look, I don't believe in upselling. You're going to have some problems here. Okay. There's a plane that comes over all the time. I love planes. I'll tell you the three things I love. Airplanes, clown paintings, and suck and dig. Would you like to see the billiard room? I love pool. Come on. Thank you everybody for coming out.

Why am I home? You ask? Well, I'll tell you. I'm home because my entire family was stricken with COVID. My wife, my two kids, they're all fine, thank God. Holy shit. To all of you out there who are going through this insanity right now, my heart goes out to you. If you're feeling a little crazy, if you're a mom who feels like you're a couple of tantrums away from stigmata exploding out of your nipples, if you're a dad who is trying with all your might to not seem like you think this actually might be the end of the world, whoever you may be right now as we go through what I have dubbed the week of sorrow, which will probably be sadly a couple of weeks of sorrow, I send to you my loving blessings. Did my wife and I get in a fight because she couldn't go to Target? Yes, we did. I got in a fight over Target a few days ago, but we're getting through it. I don't even know what getting through it looks like now. It's like we've all been in a marathon except right when you got to the finish line. They're like, actually, this is a double marathon. And then when you got to that finish line, they're like, you're just fucking running, okay? There is no finish line. We made that shit up. And then they look at you and they're like, surely you could think of a better metaphor for the pandemic than a marathon. I mean, marathons are, they start off consensually unless you're talking about some, that's Stephen King dystopian novella, the running man, the Schwarzenegger, they made a movie about it. And you say to them, I think it's a pretty good metaphor. I mean, they're like, no, it completely falls apart. A marathon you sign up for, you get a number, nobody signed up for the fucking pandemic. There's a million others you could say a sea voyage where you thought you would see land. And you realize that there is no land because you're lost at sea. They say that you should use that as the metaphor. And you look at them and you're like, you know what, I think I will use that as a metaphor. Thank you so much. And they're like, no problem, just make sure you mentioned that it was our idea, not yours. So I want to thank the imaginary people from my marathon metaphor for offering me a better metaphor for what we've been in, which is like a long sea voyage. It's like we've been at sea for a long time and we were promised that soon we would reach some beautiful shore. And as it turns out, either the map was wrong or the beach we thought we were going to get to didn't exist. And now we all find ourselves stuck in the same boat on the same ocean floating there looking at each other. And some of us are saying, stop with the fucking metaphors. We've been on this fucking boat for almost three years and you've been doing these shitty metaphors. Do you remember when you did the marathon metaphor? Do you remember that one? And you're like, yeah, well, I was wrong. That was a dumb metaphor for this. And they're like, yeah, so is the fucking boat metaphor. Because at least if you're on a boat, you know that you're surrounded by an ocean and there's some sense that somewhere there's land. This is more like we've been floating in a void that we just blooped into. And then somebody else is like, no, it's not like that. It's not like a void we blooped into. What does that even mean? And then someone's like, hey, everyone just calm down. And then somebody else is like, don't fucking tell me to calm down right now. I don't need your whatever the fucking energy that is because I'm not going to fucking calm down. I'm frustrated and I'm stuck in a metaphor right now. Who even am I? I'm some kind of imaginary, unnamed being living in a metaphor. And then everybody in the boat is like, that's it. That's the metaphor. We're all like imaginary beings living in a metaphor, trying to make sense of our existence and attempting to pull some meaning out of whatever our incredibly fleeting and transient existence is. I mean, we all do seem to have some kind of temporary identity, even though after this never ending metaphor ends, we will cease to exist regardless of whatever is happening in the external world. One thing is for certain, as soon as this long winded stoner metaphor, meta thing ends, we will cease to exist. And so in the flickering amount of time that we happen to be on this boat, even though we don't even have names and even though we'd like to be somewhere else, maybe the best thing we can do is figure out a way to be kind to each other. And then everybody on the boat stops for a moment and looks at that person. And then someone's like, go grab those fucking two by fours. And they nail them together. And they nail that person to a cross and then slowly watch him die. That's what it's like. But we'll get through it. And we are really lucky because today here with us today is a brilliant human who I got to spend an entire hour with. Andrew Yang. The presidential candidate, the author, the entrepreneur, the philosopher, the economist, and most importantly, the person who put the idea of universal basic income on the map is here with us today. We're going to jump right into it. But first this, I want to thank Athletic Greens for supporting this episode of the DTFH. I started taking Athletic Greens because I don't have the discipline or focus to be one of those vitamin people who get like 17 different vitamins and slurp them down. I don't want to be that guy or girl or person. I don't want to carry around a bag of vitamins in my pocket. Like I'm some kind of vitamin junkie. I just need something easy, simple, and that's what Athletic Greens is for me. It doesn't taste like it's healthy. It tastes good. It's got a wonderful sort of tropical taste to it, but it only has less than one gram of sugar in it. So you're not getting blasted with sugar when you take your vitamins. You're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole foods or superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right. This special blend of ingredients supports your gut health, your nervous system, your immune system, your energy recovery, recovery focus, and aging. All the things. I don't know what an adaptogen is, honestly. I don't care. I just like that Athletic Greens tastes good and makes me feel good. And we're heading into cold. We're in cold and flu season and might I add, I'm not making any claims on behalf of this company. So sorry, Athletic Greens, but I'm the only one in the house right now who doesn't have COVID. Again, not making any claims or connections or anything like that, but as a sort of coincidence. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

And we hang out twice a week at our weekly meditation and our Friday family gathering. With us here today is Andrew Yang. I'm sure you're already aware of him. I know lots of you are members of the Yang Gang as am I. He's written a book. He's written more than one book, a few wonderful books, the war on normal people, smart people should build things. And most recently, a really, really great book about his experience running for president along with some really pragmatic ideas for how to transform things from the awful satanic gridlock mess that they happen to be in. It's called forward. And he is creating a political, a brand new political party. You can participate with some of his incredible ideas by heading over to humanityforward.com and checking it out. Great join up. It was a really cool and inspiring thing to talk to a person who is actively attempting to end human poverty. He's a brilliant, awesome, sweet, funny person. And now, everybody, please welcome to the DTFH Andrew Yang. Andrew Yang, welcome to the DTFH. I'm so excited that I get some time to chat with you. How are you doing? I'm doing great, Duncan. Thanks for asking. It's great to be here. Oh, it's great to have you here. I was a member of the Yang Gang. Can I still be a member of the Yang Gang, even though we have a different president now? Yes, the Yang Gang lives forever. But thank you. That means a ton. Wonderful. Okay, so I want to start off talking a little bit about politics, but I think that there are so many more brilliant people out there who have already interviewed you about politics that people could go and listen to or look at that maybe I would like to diverge from that after the first few questions, if that's okay with you. Yeah, sure. I'd welcome it. Okay, beautiful. Great. I've just, you are the very first presidential candidate that I've ever met in my life. And having spent some time with your newest book, which is Riveting, by the way, hearing all the stories running for president, I just have a few questions for someone who's been in the lion's den, and I just want to play for you this clip to start off. This is one, do you know the comedian Bill Hicks? Not well. I don't know Bill well, but go ahead. Is this a clip from him? This is one of my favorite Bill Hicks jokes. I'm just going to play it to you because you're a presidential candidate and this directly applies to what could have happened to you and what could be your future. I have this feeling, man, because you know there's a handful of people actually run everything. That's true. It's provable. It's not a fuck. I'm not a conspiracy nut. It's provable. Handful, very small elite running on these corporations, which include the mainstream media. I had this feeling who's ever an elected president, like Clinton was, no matter what, you're going to promise as you promise on the campaign trail, blah, blah, blah. When you win, you go into this smoky room with the 12 industrialists, capitalist scum fucks who got you in there, and you're in this smoky room and this little film screen comes down, and a big guy in a cigar rolls a film, and it's a shot of a Kennedy assassination from an angle you've never seen before. It looks suspiciously off the grassy knoll, and then the film, the screen goes up and the lights come up and they go to the new president. Any questions? Just what my agenda is. Surely, especially with your ideas about universal basic income and with your incredible plan to restructure this political system that is obviously so fucked up right now, surely. As you began to realize that running for president, I actually might happen. A lot of us thought, this is going to happen, surely you thought, I don't know. Do I really want to bear the burden of that much responsibility and place myself in that level of danger? I just wanted to know whether aliens were real for sure, man. But that joke or a version of it did occur to me ahead of time, where my main concern when I was running for president was just trying to fight my way through this interview, this event, this hurdle. But sometimes I would think to myself, man, if I win, am I going to be able to get all or any of this shit done? And when you have a list of the impediments, would there be people lying in wait being like, hey, if you fuck with us, we're going to kill you? Almost certainly yes. When I think about the Kennedy assassination, I do think that he called out the military industrial complex shortly before he was assassinated. And you have an industry that now is worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And if you were to come in and say, hey, guys, maybe we shouldn't be spending quite this much on the military, would there be very powerful actors who are like, oh, I hate this guy. So there'd be some version of that lying in wait for sure. It's one reason why Americans feel so frustrated is because we can sense that we're kind of on this ride and there are various forces propelling the wagon forward, even though we all can see that the wagon is not leading us any place good. But I don't know if it's a smoke filled room in that kind of film, or if it's some other way that they try and keep you from getting stuff done. It was something I thought about a fair amount. To add to that question, it seems like if you become president, you inevitably end up making a decision or not making a decision that gets people killed. Every president, including Biden, who just ordered oil in July, ordered airstrikes, every comedian, every president ends up getting people killed. I hope not every comedian gets people killed, brother. A few actually do, but it's a different, that's when you interview me. But yes, this is another, didn't that occur to you, like, if I become president, it's essentially like I'm saddling up on an unruly dragon that from time to time blows people up. That to become president is to commit yourself to inevitably being responsible for some form of violence in the world. Do you think there is a way to be an American president and not get people killed? I ran for president because I had a vision for how we can improve people's lives every day. And certainly universal basic income was my chief goal. Does the president order the violent killings of various people on the regular? Sure. Do I trust my own judgment more than someone else's typically? Yes. So I would sit in that chair and think, okay, is this necessary to protect the American people? Is there another better course of action? I mean, I'd take the role very seriously where if ordering someone's death would help protect Americans, I would do it. But I'd like to think that I'd have a line that would enable me to sleep at night. Yeah, I just, I don't know. It seems like, you know, when I was going to ask you that question, I wanted to look back to make sure I was right. And I think different... I'm sure you're right, Duncan, but one of the things, one of the ways I approach the world is like the value gap. So let's say there's a chair and someone's going to be in that chair, the president's chair, and then make certain decisions. Really the question is whether I thought I'd make better decisions than that person in the majority of instances, you know what I mean? So let's say the average president orders the deaths of, oh gosh, I wouldn't want to hazard a number. Let's say, let's say for argument's sake, it's like a thousand people per administration or whatever that number is. You know, so that's going to happen if it's someone else. And then my calculation is like, hey, if I'm there, maybe I can shave that number down. Maybe I can make it so that like certain decisions are made a little bit better than they would have been otherwise. But there are some things, like I would not sit in that chair and think, you know, like I refuse to order people's deaths because I don't think that's realistic in that instance. That's what I'm talking about. That's the part that seems so, you know, that what you mentioned earlier about many of us just having this sense of, well, we have no control. It's like, you know, having a rotten dog in your backyard and it's going to get out no matter what. And it keeps biting people. And most Americans don't want anyone to get hurt. And so that this is the... I certainly don't. I'll tell you that. I'm like, you know, I'd much rather the number be zero. Exactly. And this is one of, I think, one of the many things, many of them, what you mentioned in your book that is making a lot of people just feel hopeless or nihilistic or just a general sense of not wanting to engage at all in the political system of the United States because just any kind of engagement in some sad way will make you responsible in a microwave for the deaths that follow from the person who you voted for getting elected. This is where I feel disgruntled and disheartened is, I think, is what is it? Is it that our country just demands, like, it is so violent, it's such a war-like country that it's hopeless, you know, and then, you know, I don't know. It's interesting. Very interesting. I want to thank Lucy for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Lucy is a modern oral nicotine company that makes nicotine gum, lozagens, and pouches for adults who are looking for the best, most responsible way to consume their nicotine. It's a new year. Why not start it out by switching to a new nicotine product that you can feel good about? When whoever invented smoking was an asshole, just leave it at that. So many other ways to consume nicotine, other than burning it and inhaling, burning nicotine in your sweet, precious lungs, you don't have to do that to yourself anymore. All my smoking friends, trust me, your hair stinks, your breath smells like a stick shift in an Uber. It's time for you to try something new. If you enjoy using nicotine, you should definitely check out Lucy's products at lucy.co. That's lucy.co and use promo code Duncan at checkout. Also, I have to read this disclaimer, warning, the product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical. That's the warning, wonderful addictive chemical. That's me. I mean, it is. I mean, that's why so many people get addicted to it, because things generally aren't addictive. But it is an addictive chemical. Let me read it again. Also after reading this disclaimer, warning, this product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical in case you didn't know that. Remember, if you're interested in a better way to use nicotine, visit lucy.co and be sure to use promo code Duncan. Well, we are we are a very divided country and people who decide to ignore politics are wise on a level, Duncan. You know, I'm very grateful that you supported my presidential campaign. A lot of people that supported me had no interest in politics previously or were trying to avoid it. And that is a reasonable decision, because if you do get involved in politics, it tends to make you sad, anxious, depressed, angry. Yeah, like politics, it kind of feeds this outrage machine on both sides. Now, I don't think that way. I never wanted to operate that way. And even now with the forward party, I'm trying to just uplift people. But folks who who find it too nasty and negative to pay attention to, I get it, you know, and the fact that you'll get berated if you're if you're not paying attention. It's like a perfectly rational, reasonable, emotionally healthy decision to make it to try to try and avoid it. Yes, yes. And then but then the avoidance itself, you become guilty, you know, and the the non participation is its own form of violence. And so you no matter what, you know, if you're born in this country, you have some responsibility to interact with it. And yet the interaction it is, you know, no matter what, you know, now that you're on the podcast, someone is going to be like, are you serious? What? Yeah, I heard that one time he tried to give someone money. That monster, that monster out there. I do, though, I think that you are the one candidate that truly addressed our sort of game of thrones reality. Winter is coming. We know that first and no one seems to want to talk about it. Even now no one's talking about it. But the truth of the matter is that we are entering into an era of automation where it will become cheaper to have machines do an AI, whether it's an online machine or whether it's an actual robot, do human jobs, meaning that we are looking at a future where unemployment is going to go even higher than it is now. And capitalism, as we know, it becomes completely unsustainable. If that's based on people working and getting paychecks, there won't be any more jobs. And so this idea of universal basic income, it seems to be the only logical solution. The other one, I guess, just being chaos. But can you talk a little bit about what the future looks like when AI and robots are taking all of the jobs and there isn't universal basic income and people aren't being supported or sustained? What would that future look like? It would be miserable and violent, truly. And some of the examples I use are the two million plus Americans who work at call centers right now. We know that Google has AI that can do the work of the average call center worker. So their days are numbered. And then what happens to those people and those families? One of the jobs I talked about on the trail was driving a truck. It's the most common job in over half the country. And what happens when the trucks eventually start being able to drive themselves? So if we don't start making massive adjustments, you're going to wind up with a war torn country of people who don't have a means of supporting themselves outside of really that there's like no means of supporting themselves in many instances. And the most common jobs in the country you can sense right now are diminishing in number, where two of them are retail clerk. And you know that a lot of the stores are going online and closing. And then the other is administrative and clerical, which a lot of that paper shuffling is going to get eliminated. By AI and technology. So it's gruesome, man. I mean, I was talking about the stuff running for president in 2019 and 2020. And that stuff is sped up because of the pandemic. You know, half of companies have come out and said, yeah, I'm investing more in this. And now if you are a customer and you get something delivered to you without talking to a human, you're like, oh, good. You know, like people used to make an argument. It's like, oh, people want to deal with people. It's like, well, I wasn't so sure if that was true. Even pre-COVID. But now you applaud a company for figuring out a way to do it without human involved. That's right. Yes. Well, this is the, you know, there's I live in North Carolina. There's the biggest house, I think, in the country here called the Biltmore House. And they have these things called dumb waiters, you know. And the idea was these super rich people, they didn't want to see the servants. You see the servants, you have to feel like, you know, guilty about like the fact that you're enjoying this beautiful house and they're having to work for you. So the way to solve the problem, little food elevators where people from down in the kitchen pull up the food and then you get it. You don't have to interact with them anymore. And so it's a version of that, really. It's like, you know, in that direct interaction with people, at the very least, you have to deal with the fact that somebody's going making your hamburger that you're getting. Somebody's making those French fries and those people are supporting families and those people aren't getting paid a living wage. And so you have to have some flickering sense of like, you know, that's that's difficult. That's hard. And so this is something that's going to go away. You won't even see those people anymore. But here's my question about universal basic income. And it's and it's something that I one of my spiritual teachers, Ramdas, he and Tim Leary, they were hanging out in the house after getting fired from Harvard. I think they were taking a lot of acid at the time and going into deep spiritual states of consciousness. But I someone came over to the house they were at and they're just dishes piled up in the sink, flies all over the place. And from that, a slogan emerged, which is someone's got to wash the dishes. So I'm going to wash the dishes, you know, during the pandemic, I would look at our sink every day. And this is actually one of the household tasks that I specialize in. Really? So so my wife knows that just, you know, just leave the dishes, leave the garbage like that. That's Andrew's jam. Well, that's a sign of an enlightened person, you know, like in the Hari Krishna temples, you don't get to only like the like only like it's a very special thing if you get to wash the dishes, because it's such a service role. Like it's the it's the ultimate service. Nobody wants to wash the dishes or but enlightened people and all my Buddhist friends are always talking about how beautiful it is to wash dishes. Is this why you wanted to be president? Is it? I mean, like everyone is suspicious when someone runs for president. They think this is a megalomaniac. This is a person who just wants power. This is a person who's any time I think about any time the thought is even flickered into my mind, I might run for president. It's like a bad it's a red flag for me. It's like you got to cut back on the marijuana friend. You're not running for president. But is this what inspired you to to try to get the most difficult job? Maybe on the planet, you just want to be a servant. I don't have a burning desire to be president of the United States. Like I didn't even what I was running. I ran because I thought I could help advance the the human condition. Yeah, I thought I could accelerate the end of poverty. Imagine waking up and in my case, it was 2017 thinking, you know, if I put my heart and soul into this, there's a chance I can speed up the end of poverty and alleviate untold human misery. And you think that there is like a one percent chance you could do that? You probably should do it, right? Now, I know I was a confident fellow, so I thought the chances were higher than one percent, but I wasn't, you know, insane. Like I didn't think that there was like an first. I did not think that there was a fifty one percent chance of my becoming president of the United States. And second, I didn't even think there's a fifty one percent chance that I was going to be able to contend the way that I did. And thanks to people like you, you know, like we made seven debate stages and made a really compelling case. Now a majority of Americans are for universal basic income or some version of it. Right. So. It was an act of service. You know, I joked like after the campaign ended, it was not like I was at home being like, oh, if I could only be president, you know, like I'm like, I'm like, all right, we. So this is genuinely the way I felt about it, Duncan. So for the better part of three years, I was single minded. I was like, I am going to make this case to the American people and nothing else matters. The only other thing that matters is staying married to jobs and poverty, stay married. As long as those two things are on track, nothing else matters. Yeah. And there was a lot of bullshit, like a lot of stuff where like, you know, like it was like a mental trial most days because like, I consider myself like a fairly normal person. I know it's crazy to say if you ran for president, but like, like a person, you know, I wake up in a place like, OK, what am I doing today? Today, I'm in a coffee shop in New Hampshire to try and like, you know, get someone interested in my campaign. OK, I do this. I do that. Like there are just a lot of tasks. It was a lot of washing dishes, really, if you think about it, like the equivalent. But I was like, if I just grind for three years and I'm an entrepreneur, so you just think, well, you know, I can grind for three years. Like if I grind for three years, there's a non-trivial chance I can help accelerate the end of poverty. OK, that's the task. And then when the campaign ends, then I'm like, OK, I more or less did what I set out to do now. What was really because I was because I was so single-minded. I was just like, I'm going to do this and do this. And it was interesting. There was part of me that did dunk in just want to like right off into the sunset, be like, OK, like, you know, I like Andrew Yang made a splash, helped people understand the need for universal basic income. Like now I can, you know, resume some something else. But you wake up the next day and you realize the problems are still there. And oh, by the way, they're getting worse. And despite the fact that a majority of Americans are now for universal basic income, where we don't have it, right? And so then you think, OK, like, you know, like, how do I keep trying to make it happen? So, you know, then I started an organization. I wrote the book forward that I'm really glad you liked. And I'm sending me a copy that I only I'm listening to the audible. I love your reading of it is really good. It's really like you did a great job. Thanks, man. They put me in a recording studio. And I had the mic and the headphones. I pretended I was a rapper. I took a picture of myself. No, you you did such a good job. No, it's so I mean, some people don't like audible. But if you want to get into the book, I would highly recommend the audible version. It's wonderful. It's really, really good. Oh, thanks, man. You can speed it up to one point two five. I can talk a little faster. I know people who do that. I feel like if you got to speed up your audibles, you need to get in a therapy or something. Come on, are you in that in a hurry? You could you could listen to it normal speed. But we're getting off track here. I want to go back to here is the right now I know like the subreddit and what's it called anti work, you know, that subreddit anti work familiar. Yes. Well, it's because it's becoming one of the most popular subreddits, you know, and we are witnessing what are they calling it? The great resignation, I think, is what they're calling it. Where so many people are seemingly having epiphanies about the value of their life versus the value of what they're being paid as an hourly wage. Some of these places where they're working are just the general and dehumanization of the worker and some of these companies. People are being treated like shit. They're not being paid anything. And they realize it would probably be better to not have a job. This is a global phenomena. I've read a little bit about it in other places, too, where people are just figuring out ways to live at the very bare minimum rather than sell their life energy to corporations to for not enough money to even sustain themselves. So with universal basic income, the place where I wonder who's going to wash the dishes is this is something that is going to have to be rolled out over the over many, many years, it's going to happen prior to the full automation of everything. So how, you know, in some world where people finally do realize, oh, no, this isn't like some silly thing. This is going to be necessary to sustain human society as we know it in an era where technology is becoming increasingly inexpensive and increasingly more powerful. Who does the dishes? Who does these jobs that are not pleasurable or that most people wouldn't want to do? And and that, you know, to make themselves feel better, they're like, oh, that's a job for high school kids. No, it isn't. These are parents. These are people who are trying to sustain themselves off of two or three of these jobs. Who does those jobs if everyone is getting a universal basic income and no longer has to do that work? I've started a number of small businesses. And let's say you start a like a cafe or something along those lines and you have like different types of people working there. You do a range of different tasks, some of them very, very you know, thankless and gritty and the rest of it because you care about the greater project. Now, in my ideal world, people are doing work not because if they stop doing it, they die. But that like the people have their basic needs met. But then you come together, you work in that cafe anyway. Maybe you get paid a bit more so that like there's a bigger impact on your life that you're not going home and starving, despite the fact that you worked a full day. Right. And then some of you, you know, are going to be washing the dishes like in any given day. There are some communities, I don't know if North Carolina is one of them where where there are, frankly, like immigrants of various kinds who assume some of the tasks that like a lot of people don't want to spend all of their time doing. And that would be the reality in some contexts. But I do think that imagining deprivation as the motivation for for people doing things is a loser over time. If you're like, oh, we have to starve everyone because someone has to wash the dishes. It's like, well, really? Is that like the recipe for success or thriving? I mean, yeah, it's horrible. It's it's like it's essentially, you know, it's not saying, look, we're going to like we're going to whip you if you don't do this work. It's saying we're going to starve you to death if you don't do this work. It's just another way of using a more kind of ambiguous sort of violence to get people to do these jobs. Yeah, you know, we're in the other question that everyone has about universal basic income is where is the world? Where do these resources come from? Who pays for this? Is it an increase in taxes? Is it bringing money out of the military industrial complex and putting it into universal basic income? We have so much money getting pumped through the system right now that people don't receive earlier in the pandemic last year. The CARES Act passed with a headline cost of two point two trillion dollars. Now, I'm the math guy. Yes, two point two trillion dollars is enough to give every American man, woman and child in the country a thousand bucks a month for more than six months. Wow. That that got spent, by the way, or or authorized. Now, we all didn't get six thousand dollars. I think out of that act, we got twelve hundred dollars. The total number was around 17 percent. People got about 17 percent of that money. Now, where did the other 83 percent go? Banks, airlines, megacorps, oil companies like wherever it went into the pipes. It went into the system that when we talked before about how it's like, oh, we're on this ride and like no one knows what to do. I think of it as a giant machine with these wheels grinding forward. And then everyone's like, well, I can't do anything about it. This machine is going to keep on grinding. Looking up, like, wait, shouldn't we maybe stop the grinding if it's going to lead us to violence and civil war over time and insanity and like misery and deprivation? And then people are like, no, no, can't stop the machine. Yeah, I mean, that like that's really the insanity of this like this country at this place, this, you know, point in history. Yes. And I think people saw in me hope because they're like, hey, this guy, I joked with someone else. It's like, you know that the machine wasn't behind me because no one would send the anonymous Asian guy to Iowa. I'd be like, yeah, this will work. This is a good plan. Right. Right. Like everyone knew that this was very much like a chance to interrupt the system. I want to thank Blue Choo for supporting this episode of the DTFH. It's twenty twenty two, friends.

But the system is deploying hundreds of billions of dollars in resources all the time to maintaining the system itself and not to families, not to kids, not to communities. Like the money is being spent. Right. Right. Yes. That's yes. And again, you know, that is where you, you know, we're all running into this, in visible or not so invisible barrier. And what it looks like is people like you, people like Bernie Sanders, people who have some new way of moving those resources around, just, you know, they, exactly what you're saying. It's like, yeah, don't worry, that person's not getting elected. It's not going to happen. And so, and then we just see the same thing happening. And again, somewhere like, you know, in the old days that you would be considered like a nut when you said this could lead to some kind of civil war. You know, this could lead to real violence. My very rusty understanding of the system is that it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. And so, and then we just see the same people, these political dynasties or people loosely related with these political dynasties, you know, get into power. And so, you know, it's a very rusty understanding of, you know, why we have a democracy and the idea behind, you know, having elections every four years is that, you know, the founding fathers recognized how bloody and violent revolution and civil war is. And that mechanism of redistributing power gets so many people killed. So brilliant idea. We'll have a rebel, a peaceful revolution every four years. And so, when that peaceful revolution is not resulting in what revolutions result in, which is profound change, but rather the sort of onerous, never-ending, grinding sort of thing that you're talking about, the sustenance of this golem creature that is literally grinding human beings up, whether it's from war or from grinding them up by putting them out on the streets because they can't afford a place to live, you know, we all see it. And so then people start getting angrier and angrier and angrier and that's scary. And that's what we're all experiencing. It's terrifying. Do you, do you see any hope in the next, in the midterms or the next election cycle? Because when I see what's coming, I'm sorry, I told you we wouldn't talk about politics. When I, when I see what's coming, it seems, it just seems like more of the same. It's going to be a rough several years, Duncan. I mean, when you talk about the hope, I mean, 2020 gave us an opportunity. I tried to take advantage of it. You know, I fell short. Bernie tried to take advantage of it. I do wish that Joe would make some bigger moves because this window of opportunity is fading. It looks like the Republicans are going to take the house and maybe the Senate in 10 months from now, at which point nothing is going to get done because you're going to have a divided government. And then in 24, I think Trump runs and I think that you'd have to consider him the favorite against just about any of the Democrats you could line up in part because that's the in part because that's the kind of energy right now where there's like, and this is one of the opportunities. It's funny. This country gets divided into left, right, which I think is a way just to maintain power. It's a way to separate people and maintain power. The fact is there are a lot of Trump voters who would have been a okay with Bernie. And the reason for that is that there are a lot of people who just want something different, want to change, want something that they know is not rigged and is not corrupt. And everyone felt like, okay, Bernie, Bernie's definitely not corrupt. Like he, you know, he wears his motivations on his sleeve. And I think this was one of Trump's appeal, too, is like this guy's going to drain the swamp. He's from outside the system. He's an outsider. If you look back over the last number of cycles, Barack Obama in 08, Bernie in 16, Trump in 16, even, I'm going to say, interestingly enough, Joe Biden in 20, everything was a change. Everything is like, we want change because shit's not working. We want change. Shit's not working. Now, unfortunately, the we want change. Shit's not working energy is going to go towards the Republicans for the next two cycles, in my opinion, when I say cycles, I mean 22 and 24. So are we going to get some of the things that we'd like to see happen in terms of positive changes out of DC? It's very difficult to project that. Now, I'm going to be doing things that I think might increase the chances of that. Like I have an organization, for example, that literally, and this is born of an onion article, Duncan. So there's an onion article 11 years ago that said the American people hire a lobbyist to fight for their interests on Capitol Hill. And there's a picture of a guy in a suit. And he was like, no, the people will take the public serious, like American voters seriously. It's really hysterical when you think about it. Yeah. And I read this article and I said, this is brilliant because this actually would help American voters get taken seriously if there's a lobbyist. So you're not going to believe this, Duncan, but I then went out and hired like a dozen lobbyists. They're on Capitol Hill right now when they just call up members of Congress and they're like, hey, Enhanced Child Tax Credit voters like it alleviates poverty. It's an anti-poverty lobbying organization called Humanity Forward. So we try and make this case quietly to legislators every day. So I'm still pushing like mad to try and make good things happen, but I'm not optimistic about the next few years. I think it's going to be really dark politically. Yeah. Okay. Great. On to the next question. I wiped tears away. What has your personal experience been with poverty? I've been fortunate enough to grow up to parents who were middle class. I was a child of immigrants, but my parents were educated and the messages I got were to try and do well in school and get a good job. My parents did a great job of brainwashing me and my brother to think we were poor, even though by any objective standard, we weren't rich, but we weren't poor, that's for sure. So I vividly remember my brother and I, for example, going into an arcade and only having one quarter and then just having to try and defend that quarter for as long as possible. So we would just like stand there in the arcade and like just hit those coin return slots and hope that a quarter came out. That was one thing we did. Every once in a while, some kid would have to run away with the game still going and then we would like jump in there and play it. And then with the one quarter, we would have to try and make a lot. So like we were brought up to be very mindful and stingy. And I worked as a busboy at a Chinese restaurant. I worked as a knife salesman. I worked as a clerk, a snack bar worker. Like I've done a lot of menial jobs at different points. I remember getting my wages and tips at the Chinese restaurant and so I pledged always to tip well. So there were experiences like that that I had growing up as a kid that I think gave me at least some perspective, but I've never been hungry in that way. I was just like a kid who had parents that had conditioned them to think that we're always at the edge. You know how I knew when I realized I was poor? I asked my mom, mom, are we rich? And she goes, we're rich in spirit. And I'm like, oh, shit, we are. Oh, no. We're rich in spirit. Are you kidding? Well, but so having never really, and I haven't. I mean, my parents were, I've never encountered, but many, you know, many people are. I've had people on the podcast who've lived in their car with their kids. What I mean, just outside of just basic human compassion, what has inspired you in this way to try to end poverty in the United States? Like where is that? What is that springing from? I just hate seeing shit that you know could be solved, go unsolved. Like, you know what I mean? Like I see someone out on the street and I'm like, this person can be not on the street. Like I'm confident about that. My own experience with this has been that I did a job that I didn't like and then I quit that job and tried to start a business and it was very hard and the business failed and I went through a lot of stuff. But I think that so many people have something within them that they want to do and most of them never get a chance to do that. I was singularly fortunate where despite my failure, I got another chance and then ended up having some success and when I had some success, I ran a company that created jobs for some other people and seeing someone get an opportunity that they appreciated and liked and then in some cases it actually made their family circumstances better. It's like the greatest feeling in the world. And so if you can create that for people at any level, then it's magic. And so like I've wanted to do that for a long time, but a lot of us just seeing that there's like unnecessary human suffering and very solvable problems going unsolved, it's funny Duncan. I don't consider myself any more virtuous than the next person. Let's put it that way. I see myself as a problem solver and poverty is a problem that can be solved genuinely. Like we have the resources, if we just got our shit together, we actually could like alleviate poverty in the vast majority of instances. And a friend of mine, Zander Schultz said this to me too. He was like, this is a relatively new development. Like if you rewind a number of decades, you'd be like, hey, like could we just alleviate poverty? It's like, no, we just don't have enough stuff to go around. Like now do we have enough stuff to go around? Oh yeah, we do. Like when did that transition happen? You know, some number of years ago, I mean, like as the math guy, like I could look it up and be like, huh, you have an economy of $22 trillion and you know, 330 million people and like, let me, let me do that math for a second. It's like, wow, you know, that means you're like walking around at like $84,000 ahead or whatever it is. It's like, if you felt like it could, like could you? So that's like the problem that, you know, that I want to solve and it has profound human implications, you know, positively. Yeah, absolutely. It's, I mean, you know, I saw that you, you attend church. Do you still attend church? Do you go regularly? Post COVID, we have not been attending much because, you know, it's like that just in person services kind of got. Oh yeah. Yeah, like less attended and but our, you know, this is going to make us out terrible. It's like we, we sometimes have been dropping our kids off at the Sunday school. It's not, it's not great role modeling. But you are, I mean, you are a Christian. Do you consider yourself a Christian? You know, my, my wife's a Christian. Our kids are being brought up Christian. I was not brought up Christian, but I'm very grateful that, that my family is in the church and, you know, that where my our kids are being brought up Christian. Okay, right. Your mom is a statistician who became an artist. Can you talk about that? How does that, that is this? I've heard a lot of different people becoming artists, but how does one make that transition? What kind of art was she doing? She's doing pastel art. You can actually see her artwork at Nancy Yang art.com. I think it's an immigrant story, Duncan, where my dad was a physicist. My mom was a statistician and they both took jobs at big organizations. My dad was at GE and IBM in the lab. He had 69 patents. So he invented stuff. And when I was a kid and realized that he generated patents, I was like, Hey, dad, how much they pay you when you get a patent? Because it sounded really important, right? I was like, Oh, we're rich. And then he said like $250 or so. And then I said, No, that doesn't sound like very much. And he said, Well, they also pay me a salary so I can house feed and clothe you and your brother. Yeah, I said, Okay, I, I, I, you know, it's like, thanks for explaining that, dad. My mom worked at the Department of Computer Services at a State University of New York. So these are just very practical jobs. And then when my mom lost her job, she was like, You know, I've always wanted to be an artist. And so she started taking art classes and working on pastel. And I have to say, Duncan, as her son, I was like, Yeah, like good luck with that. Like I was like, I'm not going to go anywhere. But it turns out that she'd wanted to be an artist as a young person, which predated, you know, my existence as her child. So I like, I hadn't seen her working in that. But now she has a thriving second career as an artist. And, you know, it's really like, even if she didn't, I'd still obviously be like, great, like, you know, it's awesome and admirable. But the fact that she's actually, you know, been successful is awesome. What, like, what was it like chatting with your parents when you were in the running to become the next president of the United States? This is, I mean, I just can't, I have two children and like, I love, I love them no matter what they do. But if I had to sit and watch one of them go through what anyone running for president has to go through, those brutal debates, the viciousness of the media, and also the pride inside of me, it would explode my brain. How did they react to the fact that, I mean, they've only, they came, they came from Taiwan, that it just must have exploded their brains. How did they react? When I first said, Hey, mom and dad, I'm going to run for president. They were not pleased that they thought it was crazy. They were concerned about my safety. There was a lot of like, one of them tried to talk me out of it. They were like, Are you sure you want to do this? Wow. Yeah, it's going to be a lot of strain on the family, like all this stuff. Not wrong. I mean, this stuff, it's like, you know, it's probably pretty sensible advice. And I knew I was not going to be able to travel for a while. So right before I declared, I brought my now nine year old, so then he must have been four or so son back to Taiwan to visit some family members there, like my grandmother. So my son's great grandmother who ended up dying a few months later. So and I kind of knew that I was like, Hey, I might be able to get my son to meet his great grandma. And so we were at dinner in Taiwan. I told the table was like, Hey, when I get back, I'm running for president of the United States. And there was like, that's nice past the soy sauce kind of thing. Because like to them, you know, it's like their random nephew, or like even my parents kid, even saying we want to run for president, like it's just too far out to really understand or reckon with like, like, is he kidding? Is he serious? I don't know. Andrew's always had like, you know, like a weird career. I never don't really understand what he's doing half the time. So so really, no one took it seriously. And then when I started running, my parents were still concerned for most of it. But then as we gathered steam, they became incredibly proud people in Taiwan actually called my mom asking like, How did you raise Andrew to even have this kind of ambition? And so she got like interviewed in the press. My dad went to a debate watch party in Taiwan, and then said, That's my son. And then everyone like cheered him and like, you know, like, so these were incredibly heartwarming stories. Like, you know, that I was getting on the trail, like I'd come off the debate stage, and I'd be like, Oh, I thought that one went alright. And like, you know, get get tons of messages. And I heard that my dad was at a debate watch party in Taiwan, and everyone was like cheering him. And I got to say, Duncan, that was probably the most invigorating thing I heard. Like I was like, Oh, my like, my family is freaking basking in the glory across the world. Like, you know, like that this this thing is actually having positive impacts in ways I never could have imagined. Do you um, I guess you answered this earlier, but do you have a spiritual practice? Do you pray? Do you meditate? Do you? So my family prays every night. And I joined them. So, so yeah, like I pray. Can you share what can you share what kind of prayers that your family says? So typically, my wife leads it. And she says, you know, thank you for keeping our family strong, healthy and together. Please protect us. Please help us do your work. And help us bath, enjoy and reflect and project your love and your desires for the world. It's really lovely. My boys then say amen, you know, as do I. And it's a really warm ritual that we enjoy every night. That is beautiful. Did you feel as you were running? As you, and even now, I mean, you know, you are a gigantic voice in the world right now. And, and, you know, your book has some real solutions. And, you know, reading it, it does give, you know, these days, flirtations with hope. It's like, am I really going to like let any kind of inkling of this like flicker inside of me? But did you have some sense when you were going through this of like, I'm sorry to put you in this position, but like a divine calling, like a feeling that you were in some way or another, bringing that kind of love into the world? I did have that feeling, Duncan, on the trail. And it's hard not to feel that way when you're standing in front of thousands of people who've invested their hopes for a better future for themselves and their families in you. And you're there and you're like, wow, like this is incredible. And, you know, I'm following a plan. It's certainly not something that I thought had, you know, everything to do with me as an individual, you know, like I was like a piece of it. Cory Booker, who's a friend, like would even say to me on the trail, he's like, God definitely has a plan for you, brother. And different people who are spiritual would say versions of that to me at different times. And I did feel that it was awesome and empowering on a level I'd never felt before. Andrew, thank you. This hour is just zipped by we only have about 10 more minutes. So I want to jump back to the point where you said it's going to be a rough few years. And what during this rough few years that we're all feeling is ahead of us, if anyone's been doom scrolling, we're all burnout on this pandemic, we're all secretly or not so secretly going completely nuts. What are some pragmatic ways that we can start sort of emerging from this hopelessness, this sense of complete powerlessness and the general malaise that is crept into most people's consciousness during this rotten time. On a personal level, just got to take care of yourself and your loved ones. So to me, that means trying to get some nature every day, trying to get a bit of exercise, trying to tell your loved ones that you love and appreciate them, try to put down the internet, try and put down the social media apps and the rest of it. Because that stuff right now, if it's a tough time and people are struggling and then you frankly get to glimpse what's going on in their minds, it doesn't uplift you. You're just like whoa. So you have to be able to balance it and moderate it. The other big thing is to take some kind of positive action, whether that's in your own community, with your church or religious organization, with a local nonprofit. My political movement right now is the forward party, which I hope people find as one of the ways that they can make a positive contribution. And we want to be the antidote to the current political culture, where we don't demonize or villainize anyone. We love our fellow Americans and people. And we think that right now, the zero-sum politics where you're asked to judge or demonize tens of millions of other Americans is disastrous. And it turns out that most people of every political alignment agree on some basic goals. So let's try and make progress in those directions. In my book forward, I talk about how the fact is the duopoly will ruin us. The duopoly is designed just to play you lose, I lose, while we all lose and become more angry and upset and the rest of it. So the forward party wants to change that dynamic. And there is a real life way we can do it. It's by switching from closed-party primaries to nonpartisan open primaries, so that all of a sudden legislators have to respond to what the majority of people in their districts want, as opposed to just the most rabid 10 to 15%. And these are issues, people talk to me about this, the issues are asymmetrical in the different parties. They are. What's going on in the Republican party is different than what's going on in the Democratic party. And the problems are, the Democratic party, I'll just describe my sense of it is that there's like a corrupt corporate layer that kind of quashes anything. It's a bit different than what's going on in the Republican party, which is animated by a particular form of extremism in a lot of districts. But either way, the incentives are keeping us from coming together, from getting anything done. And so if you want to help change those incentives, then the forward party is my movement to make the change that we want to see in the world. And I can see what real life reforms we would need to help make that possible. How? What are those? Like, how do you change the primaries? How can you possibly, at this point, get into the system at that level and change it when it is a existential threat to the two parties that are controlling everything? Excuse me, I'm just going to close the door to the sounds a little better. I can go a few minutes over. I just want to make sure the sound of it. Okay, perfect. Thanks. So yeah, how do we, what is the, how do you get in and change these, like, the, any effort to do what you're talking about is going to be met with extreme resistance from the duopoly. Because I think they must understand that if people, you know, if we start allowing third parties, if there's a way to get third parties in, that no one's going to, it's going to If we gave them a real choice that, you know, there's no telling what without, yeah. Truly, truly. Truly. So right now, 44 to 50% of Americans consider themselves independence, and 62% want to move on from the duopoly. The problem is that all of the mechanisms to actually vote for anyone that's not in the duopoly make it impossible to compete and win. So it's like kind of a chicken with the egg problem. Yep. There is hope because 24 of the states allow you to switch from closed party primaries to open primaries where anyone can vote for anybody. And one state already made that change in 2020, that state being Alaska, where now you can just go straight to the general population. You don't need to be a member of the Democratic or Republican party to either run or vote for any candidate. Now, we can make the same thing happen in Missouri, in Nevada, in another 20 plus states around the country. And believe it or not, there are ballot initiatives on the docket for 2022 to try and make this change. So this isn't abstract. We can actually just get a bunch of Americans together and say, hey, you know what, I'd like to be able to vote for someone like regardless of the letter next to their name. I think they should answer to 51% of us instead of just the folks who are in the party primary. And even if the same person is in that seat, then their incentives would be dramatically better because instead of having to just placate or please the most partisan 10 to 15%, they'd have to deliver for the general population. Wow, that is brilliant. Yeah, I thought it was hopeless. That's great to hear. I honestly, I haven't finished your book, so my apologies. I didn't get to that. No, no, not at all, man. Because I surveyed all the literature, Duncan. I was trying to figure out, okay, we're stuck, we're ruined, we're screwed. What's our way out of this? And then this brilliant woman, Catherine Gale, said like, look, there's actually an opportunity in these ballot initiatives and Alaska already did it. And we can do it in a bunch of other states. And if we do that, we'd liberate our representatives to do the right thing. So let's do that. And I was like, oh, this is genius. Like I'm going to start the forward party to make this happen in half the states around the country. And then if we got half the states around the country, then the other states would have no choice but to follow suit. Because if you were like right next to another state where people could vote for anyone they want, what's your argument to be like, no, you just have to vote for it? It's a really bad argument. I mean, the majority of people you know, just want to be able to vote for whoever they want. Yes, yes. And I love that you're saying liberate the representatives because I think it would be easy to think that when you see some politician making these decisions that just seem like the exact same decisions that the last person made and the last person made, it would be easy to think that the politician is making these decisions because that's who they are rather than no. They have to make these decisions because they've become essentially puppets. They have no choice. So they're not even able to do what they probably most of them set out to do, which is make real change. I mean, was that your sense when you were running in your life in politics that many of the people who are currently being demonized are actually... They're stuck. They're puppets. They're flies and amber. I mean, the temptation is to be like, oh, these people are evil. It's like, no, you could take a reasonable person and the system is corruptive and will make them seem like evil people. And that's what needs to change. Do I think that we could use some new people in office? Yes, I do. But right now, I think one, you wouldn't get the right people in. And even if they were to get in, they wouldn't be able to do the things you'd want them to do. So you have to change the incentives of the system. And then we have a chance. So that's what the Ford party is about, is about trying to rewire the system itself and then make it so that independence can win, people with the right motivations can win. Maybe we can actually start to genuinely affect the grinding wheels of the machine. Yes. But how do we join... Now, how does someone become a member of the Ford party? How do we do that? It is so easy, Duncan. It's even easier than joining the Yang Yang, I'll say. So if you just go to forwardparty.com, donate $1 and then you'll be a member of the Ford party and will make a common cause with all these awesome activists and reform movement workers in states around the country to try and change the elections themselves. We will be supporting candidates who want to do the right thing too, whether they're running as Dems or Republicans or independents. Yeah, but it's very easy to join. Just forwardparty.com and let's do it. Great. Joining right after I get offline with you. One last question. What is this thing about you stopped an attack on a journalist on a ferry? Can you talk about that? Is that real? Sure. So I was on the Staten Island ferry with a small group of people, Annie Lowry from the Atlantic, and then there was a photojournalist from Getty, I believe. And while I was talking to Annie, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the photographer get shoved. And so I rushed outside, and he was getting attacked by this guy with a stick or a cane. And the attacker had his back to me. And so I tried to interrupt the attack, so I just ran up to him, put my hand on the shoulder and was like, Hey, there's no need for that. Like, stop, calm down. And so the guy with the cane, it was about a, I'd say he was like a 45 year old guy who was like, he was fairly large. He was like six, one, six, two. So he turned around. And then he saw me and said, Yang. And I said, Yes. And then it was a Yang gang initiation. You know, that's what they're doing now to join. And so then the photographer ran off happily. While I was talking this guy down, and then he calmed down and just seemed like, like fascinated by the fact that I was in front of him. And during that time, then some cops came and started questioning him because the photographer ran off to get some cops on the ferry. Now here's where it gets dark, Duncan, is that the cops, after questioning him, he wasn't aggressive anymore, let him go. And then about three weeks later, he was arrested for beating an elderly Asian man on the subway. It's pretty terrible. So not a happy ending. Oh, so it was a happy ending in the sense that, like, I managed to interrupt his attack on this photographer, but then an unhappy ending in that he didn't get the help he needed. And, you know, in my case, I was just trying to keep a bad situation from getting worse. You're the only person on that ferry who tried to stop the attack. Yeah, you know, I was, I probably had the best line of sight on it. I mean, it was not going well, though, I gotta say, like this guy, yeah, I mean, he was just like, he'd kind of shoved the photographer down and was like towering over him with the stick. Like it was not a good situation when I got there. That must have been such a weird moment for that rotten, racist, fairy asshole who was beating someone to turn around and see you. That's, it was probably, you know what, it probably just confirmed whatever bizarre delusion he was having that he's living in some kind of dream. Because if I was beating someone with a cane and turn around and saw you, I'd be like, oh, yeah, I've definitely gone nuts. I'm not talking to Andrew Yang right now. He's not stopping me from beating someone. He was like, Yang, is that you? And I was like, yes. And then he was like, hey, what are you doing on the stand on the ferry? And I was like, oh, I'm just like, getting sent out of the campaign. And then he was like, can I get a picture to prove that this happened? And I was like, yes, you can. And then by the time this went on, the cops came. So my celebrity defused the situation, which is very fortunate. Andrew, thank you so much for giving me this much time. It's been a joy talking to you. And I am excited about my new party that I'm about to join. Thank you. Well, forward party. Thank you, Duncan. And again, to the people out there, this is a very, very tough time. But feel free to unplug, like, you know, like the world, there's a meme that I really enjoyed, which is like, there was a guy in the woods without a phone. And it was like, poor guy with no phone. He doesn't know how upset he's supposed to be. Wow. Yeah, whoever said that must have been a genius. But thank you so much for coming on the show. Everybody, let's join the forward party. This is something real that we could all be part of. Thank you, Andrew Yang. I really appreciate it. Appreciate the heck out of you, Duncan. Best to you and the family. Howdy, Christian. Thank you. That was Andrew Yang, everybody. You can follow, you know, where he's at, he's on Twitter, he's on all the places, but definitely check out humanityforward.com and chip in. He's a great person. He's been an hour with me. So he deserves your love. Big thank you to our sponsors for supporting us and much thanks to you for listening. We'll see you next week. Until then, Hare Krishna.

This is my podcast, The Duncan Trussell Family Hour. And today, Shane Moss is joining us. You've got to watch Shane's documentary. It's called Psychonautics, the comics exploration of psychedelics. Also, he has another podcast that he does with Ramin Nazir called Mind Under Matter. It's a comedy science philosophy art podcast. You've probably already listened to it, or at least heard of it. And here's what's really incredible. They are doing a camp out festival. They're having a gathering where they're going to have a private lake that you could swim in, music, wellness, science talks, stand-up comedy podcasts, and variety shows. It's happening September 9th through the 11th with camping until the 12th. That's happening 20 minutes from downtown Raleigh at Lakeside Retreats. You can find out all you want to know about this by going to appmindunderpod on Instagram. And all the links are going to be at dunkintrussell.com. Definitely, if you're interested in that, it's going to be an incredible festival. Grab tickets. And while you're at it, if you're in San Diego, I'm going to be there week after next at the La Jolla Comedy Store. And following that, the next week, I'm going to Miami to the Miami Improv. All those links are at dunkintrussell.com. Just scroll down or do a Google search. Finally, if you're interested in commercial-free episodes of the DTFH and hanging out with me and the DTFH family twice a week, why don't you subscribe to us at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And now, everybody, please welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour, the brilliant Shane Moss. Shane, welcome back to the DTFH. It's good to see you, man. Great to see you, my friend. Wonderful to be back. It often happens in podcasts. You start the podcast before you officially start the podcast. Yeah. And so we're, we were just starting to talk about something that a subject that is like my current, I don't know. I'm sure you have this. Like I have like, uh, transient philosophical obsessions that I like just for roll around in my head until I'm not rolling them around in my head anymore. And so my current number one fixation is the, um, idea that via, uh, AI replication of human personalities meeting neuro neural networks that are creating like, uh, uh, thing like, you know, versions of animated versions of human beings that are no longer like thwarted by the uncanny valley, so to speak, that the combination of these two technologies is going to, uh, create a situation where we will have the option. If we want to, to hang out with our dead relatives. And so I've been very interested in this idea and what it's going to do to, uh, culture and to society because so much of our society is based on the finality of death. Yeah. Why not? Why not first? I think, I think there would be an, I think there would be a natural inclination to want to just hang out with yourself, you know, like a virtual clone of yourself at first. I mean, I, I, it seems, it seems like there's like, like ego, I love cognitive biases, love them, um, and ego centrism. That's like number one. That's the first thing you're born with. You're the center of everything and it can't be any other way. It's, you only have access to so much information and a lot of that is proximity. Yeah. And so, and, and that, that multiplied by the, your, your, uh, genes propensity to, um, be selected for replicating themselves and, and kind of having this self-serving bias where I think you would hang out with yourself and then you would start, I think you would start making different, like alternate universes of your, we, we spend so much time thinking, what would I what person would I be right now had I made this other decision in life? What person would I be if I make this decision going forward? And I think you like hanging out with different versions of yourself for a while and then, and then maybe expand from, I, from there. I don't know. I guess, I guess it depends on, it depends a lot on your personality because some people like you and me, we, we want to meet, we want to meet the most alien, uh, like, you know, like, or certainly I do. Like I, I can't wait to like get to Japan where I've never been or, or go, go to like the most foreign different culture. Whereas other people are like never leaving my hometown. I prefer the things that, that I know. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, I think what you just mentioned, that's just one of the many, uh, mind fucks that's right around the corner is, you know, that possibility. Also, speaking of cognitive bias, I would like to point out that immediately when we started the podcast, somebody started song and I like, and, and truly like, I just heard it all morning, silence, birds chirping, like just, just a perfect wonderful silence. And, and again, like, I know it's cognitive bias, but I have noticed when you start recording immediately as though like a secret alarm in whatever simulator we are in, it was triggered. Someone will start leaf blowing, sawing. Oh yeah. Always. Like within seconds of it though. Like, you know what I mean? Like if I just sat and I'm like, I'm going to make a saw sound appear. It would never happen. All right. Finally got the fucking podcast equipment working again. Hit record. Yeah. On cue almost. Anyway, my apologies for people listening. Uh, the, the, so barely noticeable. This is just one of the many, like, uh, impending cultural issues that we're about to face. Like, yeah, you want to hang out with a version of yourself. You want to populate your little patch of the metaverse with digital replicants of yourself with, you know, even modulating their personalities, according to whatever mood you happen to be in. Maybe you could do what there were. I'm currently doing with this incredible mid journey text to art bot, which is, you don't just say, um, make me a, like I just, I just had it create a Ouija board that ghosts would use to communicate with people. A minute and the coolest looking fucking Ouija board appears on your screen. But if I wanted to, I could say, do it in the style of MC Escher. Do it in the style of Picasso Monet in a minute. It's like Monet created a Ouija board for beings on the other side to communicate with us. So theoretically, and this is all obviously very theoretical. You could say create a version of me, but if I was half John Wayne, or if I was half Clint Eastwood, what would I be? Or if my parents had been in the Illuminati, what would I be like? Or if instead of deciding to do comedy, I'd become a therapist or something. And then there you are from some neural analysis of infinite personalities that it's absorbed by siphoning through Facebook and all the places where we've been casually depositing the deepest, most intimate aspects of ourself. It just fabricates that personality and animates whatever version of yourself you want it to be. And there you are sitting with yourself from a different life. And clearly I'm, I'm wrong in like the, the, the propensity for cloning as I think about it more because we have opportunities in these video games to create avatars and things. And people are rarely trying to fine tune a perfect replica of themselves. They're like, I want to be a ball of tits. What would that be like? Or whatever and roll around the world in this way and spoiler alert that that life is you'll be popular and messy. A ball of tits covered in jizz. You can use, that's what you use to climb up the walls. Sticky cum, just all the cum. You gather it up in a flesh receptacle and then you spray it out. It's get, oh no, it's getting away. Don't come on it. Please stop jerking off on the fucking thing. That's how it goes up the walls. Yeah, I mean, you know, it is. It's, we, I, I go back and forth with this stuff because there, there's so many things are so trendy too. And, and it goes like throughout evolutionary time, there's been, because so much of what's in us is this ability to do difficult things and advertise that we can do a difficult thing. So through history, the ability to make the perfect bowl. Oh my gosh, the perfect symmetrical bowl and sure you decorate it and everything else, but you know, this, this isn't just a, you, you start with any old shell or whatever that you can scoop up water from or make something in and then you refine it and you make it better and better and better and then, and then eventually the industrial revolution can just press these things perfectly symmetrical out of this, stay in the steel and now no one gives a shit about your perfect symmetrical bowl because that thing costs a nickel. Now people go back and now they want the heart at the hand carved. They want to see every, every little bit of, you know, little tiny mistake that had been made and that's what makes it feel real. And I wonder with like mid journey, it is so cool. But, but like I work with Remy Nazar every week. We have our show mind under matter each week. We make a whole episode on a theme. Uh, we just did one on primates and one on social media or whatever. And, and I typically, or probably 50, 60% of the time I come up with the initial idea seed of the idea for the episode piece for means a great artist. He makes an episode for a piece for every episode. But my ideas are so out there and complicated. And then Ramin takes all that and like scrubs away the messiness and makes this simple perfect. And it's like, Oh, that's so much better than what my idea was. So maybe the next step is in mid journey is they take your idea. And they're like, yeah, we just have a better idea than that. Like we see what you're getting at, you know, we have a better idea. Yeah. Well, I mean, again, to get back to egocentricity and identity, uh, you know, part of being a person is like you think you're good at something. And, and generally, like part of being good at something is you feel like you kind of earned it. You know, you spent so much time learning how to make. The bowl, the drawing, whatever it may be. And then the, your particular life circumstances, you know, create whatever it is that is you, the thing where you're like, ah, that's clearly a Shane Moss joke or a Ramin drawing or this or that. And so there's a lot of ego attached to it. And also it gives you this like ability to have some kind of like superiority in a sense. Like, you know what I mean? Like I can play piano now. I learned, I spent years and years and years learning and it doesn't matter if you want to play piano, you're not going to be able to unless you spend all those years to get to the point where you can play piano and then you have piano pride. But that, that, oh, it's, it's, it's more than likely going to go away. It'll be cool that you self-trained versus neural download or whatever the fucking thing, or it'll be cool that you're not wearing the gloves that control your hands that make you a perfect pianist or whatever the fucking thing it may be. But it's still not going to be quite as powerful and special as like when you go and see God, once we went to see this pianist, Emmanuel Axe, I think is his name, you watch his fingers fly across the keyboard. Friends, just drink any time you hear the fucking saw, it'll turn it into a drinking game. You watch his fingers fly across the keyboard and it's like almost a mystical experience. You're like, my God, humans can do this. It's incredible. But once, you know, technology creeps into that sector of art or music and it'll be cool, it'll be quite, but it's just not, I don't think it's going to be quite, quite as like powerful.

Have you ever heard of the Ikea effect? No, I have never. Let me tell you about it. So there's, so I'm doing this Mind Under Matter comedy festival in Raleigh, 20 minutes from downtown September 9th through 11th. It's a physical manifestation of Ramin and I's podcast Mind Under Matter. And so we have music and stand up comedy in different area and a wellness area. And one of the areas is science talks. And so I'm booking all these scientists, the research triangle here and everything and my biggest scientists and one of the one of the biggest, like he's a multi three, three New York's time bestselling author, like, you know, zillion views, Ted talk views, all that. Is this really interesting guy, Dan Ariely, who has the most amazing backstory that I could tell you about too. But, but, um, he, one of his books is, uh, is about motivation. And the Ikea effect is, is a study where you have people, um, you have people come in and, um, make a, uh, um, uh, what, what are the, what are the paper, uh, spawn, um, origami. Oh, yeah. You have them. You give them instructions to make origami and they make these like origami swans or whatever else. And then, um, and then afterward, you know, they get paid some amount and afterwards they either need to keep that there or they can buy their origami to take home with them. And, and they also offer, um, origami made by some of the people to the public to buy in no one in the public wants to buy their origami, but people will, will pay like everything that they earned in that study to get their origami. And also wait, they make them buy them so that they make the origami, then they make them pay for the origami they made. They're like, if you wanted to take this home with you, you have to pay, um, like, you know, whatever for it and they'll see how much they'll pay for their origami. And, and, and, and, um, or they'll ask them how much they'll pay for it and things. And, and then in one of the conditions, they, they give bad instructions. Like they, they give, like they miss a lot of steps that the instructions are too broad. Uh, you know, there, there's like sophisticated enough instructions that anyone can make origami and then, you know, like loose instructions where it's difficult. And the more difficult that thing was to make, even if it looks crappier, uh, but they buy a long shot will pay a lot more money because of the pride of making that origami thing. Right. And they'll, they'll have things like that. They'll also, they'll also in related studies, um, they'll have people, um, they'll have people make things like that or make things out of Legos or whatever. And, and then, you know, pay them and then like, like, well, okay, we paid you like $5 or whatever to make that Lego thing. Do you want to make another one for like 450 people? Like, yeah, what the hell? I'll make another one. Uh, hey, do you want to make another one for like $4 or whatever? And, and, you know, it gets low enough for people like, I got other things to do, but people enjoy the act of making these Legos and everything. But then there's a condition where as soon as you're done making the Lego thing, they just break it all apart and put it back in the pen and people hate that they have no interest because it's going, they call it the Sisyphean condition, right? Because you did all that for what? For nothing. What'd you do it for? Yeah. See, this is like, you know, this is where, where, where time gets interesting, right? It's like these, uh, whatever the thing you're making is or the thing that you think has value, a lot of that value is this perception that it's like some kind of container for time, like held within the item itself. That's a really lovely and interesting way of articulating it. It's a time vessel. And so the, the, you know, this, this is like, uh, and it go, and it also goes into like, you take anything that, uh, when it first comes out, whatever, it's just a thing, a fork, a table, a hundred years later, it's an antique. That thing's been around for a hundred years. That matter and it is retained its form for a hundred years. And now, even though a hundred years before someone looked at it and was like, that's just some shitty fucking table a hundred years later. It's an antique roadshow. Oh my God, this is a classic garbage table from the 1910s. It's now worth 50 times. So yeah, it's that it's time. It's the, it's the, it's the illusion that we can somehow capture time within symbols and that that, and it's the same with Bitcoin. Like the value of Bitcoin theoretically was attached to the amount of time it takes to mine each Bitcoin and the energy that goes into that amount of time, creating this false perception of value. You know, if Bitcoin, you could spit one out every three seconds, valueless, the fact that it takes processors running for hours, days. I don't know how fucking long it is now. So that at one point was giving it this sense of, oh my God, that's real value there. That's real value. Yeah, and there's, and there's social buzz from it and fear of missing out that, that was, was kind of going on with that. And then, and then status things when certain people tell you to get this certain thing and they've done well off of it. But then also my brother is a computer programmer and there's, there's, there's a way in which computer programmers themselves can advertise to one another on within crypto platforms where they can kind of, it's like a job application for them in a way because they're able to like innovate in this new space. I don't know any, anything about sure. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, there's more value to it than just the time sink, but the time sink is a component of the value. And so, uh, this is, this is one of the, uh, ways that technology is, you know, currently like really disrupting an entire industry. Um, because like the neural art, uh, create networks that are creating these, these liking, like now increasingly are apparently Dolly too. It's like photo realistic people, photo realism, photo realism that you just tell it to make. And obviously we're just a few, I don't know how many leaps forward with Moore's law, uh, away from being like, okay, now animate it. Show me, you know, um, Gaddafi tap dancing while juggling, uh, that heads of the gods and we'll, a minute, there it is. Oh, cool. Now put that in my fucking little room in the metaverse and I'm going to sit and I want Gaddafi to do a show for me in this style of William Shakespeare, but make it kind of like the shining boom. There you go. No more going through Amazon. Looking for the movie that you're hoping will like scratch the itch. Now you tell it to make the fucking movie and it just does it. So this is coming. People, I don't even know why people are arguing about this point. This is for sure fucking coming when you sit and watch a text art thing generate a really nice bit of art in less than a fucking minute, less than a minute. And you are witnessing what Terrence McKenna was talking about, which is the amount of time between what you want and its appearance in the universe is shrinking down and with the eradication of that time sink, we were going to have an absolute transformation of what we consider value in our society and that is going to be catastrophic for a lot of different industries, all of them eventually. Yeah, I mean, I still so I think a lot of a lot of they kind of evolved what we what we look for will still you know, it's it's an arms race between between forgery and counterfeiting and making things that are forgery proof and and and I think you're still. I mean, there are there are a few things that are there's going to be like one of my favorite that I that I think is I wish more people knew about is it's very simple. Anyone knows it when they hear but the fundamental attribution bias, which is which is that when something good happens to you, it's because you earned it. When when something good happens to another person, they got lucky. When something bad happens to you, bum luck. When something bad happens to another person. Well, they they earned that in some way. They did something wrong. They didn't work hard enough or also known as fool's bias. That's like them. That's an idiot. Think that's an idiot. That's idiot thinking right generally. I mean, like if you we all we all do it, but you know, you can't at least I can't run away like anytime I find myself sitting in a fucking crater of some event, you know, I could generally like maybe try to convince myself that I'm sitting in that crater out of sheer bad luck. And so I mean, I think sometimes that does happen, you know, people are on airplanes that crash, you know, and they weren't flying them. They just wanted to see it on an airplane. But in general, the catastrophes I've experienced in my life, even though, yeah, maybe it might seem like some random event on paper. If I spend the slightest amount of time thinking about it, it's like, I definitely brought this on myself. Definitely. So I feel like I like don't you think like that's a bias you should really work on that you know what I mean? Because otherwise you're going to be a bitter motherfucker for sure. You're well, it's worse than that because because it lends to like really tragic judgment and laws and things like that. And there's this, there's this like, it kind of combines with this just world bias that we have, which is that it's very self protective because lack of control and lack of predictability are the two biggest stressors in the world. Yeah, very important things for any, any mammal, any species really. And, and so to, for your consciousness to kind of arrive at this idea that this is a just world. And if you just, if you just work hard and do the right things, you will benefit from it. And so therefore those people, it's self protective where it's like, well, if, if, if some woman was assaulted, she was probably wearing too short of a dresser, she was asking for, that's not going to happen to my wife, my daughter, something like that. They behave in, in the proper way. Right. It's like some kind of inoculation against the chaos factor. Like you want to. Which leads to all this victim blaming, which creates more victims unless like care for them and, and, and lets a lot of abusers off the hook and things. Well, yeah, like the general, like it's like, you know, I have to say, I have noticed in my own life and it's anecdotal, but I have noticed in other people's lives too, the people who like really work hard, like actually work hard, it's so boring. In fact, I consider it to be one of the more annoying realities in the world is that the people who tend to work really hard do seem to have in general better luck, like people who work really hard. They do seem to have like, without a doubt, without a doubt. Otherwise, I'd have a six back, man. Otherwise, I'd be fucking ripped right now. I mean, I'm just like, you got to work out over time. And then you, and then you get in shape. It sucks. I mean, really, there's a lot of different domains though. And some of that's coming from OCD. Some of that's coming from their own anxieties and, and, and also some of that's coming from in terms of a six back losing weight, physical, physical strength is something that is so easy to see. Whereas like creativity, like, what are we evaluating here? You know, it's so like, does someone have a six pack or not? I can see that. Is someone a genius or not? I don't even know what that means that word is such a genius. Yeah, that's a, I think that's one of the many. It's a great way to procrastinate is you, you pretend there's some genius thing and that there probably is. I don't know, but you know, it's just nuts. Cause like all the people I call genius, they, they're fucking workaholics. You know what I mean? They don't stop working. They're always working and working and working. They're always like, not in a, not, not in a healthy way necessarily. Like many of them I've noticed seem to have like a, an obsessive quality where they, they, once they latch onto a thing, they're not letting go. They're just going to keep, but that over time produces that the final product that people see and they're like, you're a fucking genius. It's like, well, you should see the earlier drafts. Go back and look and call me a genius. Go back and look at this bullshit. Two months ago when this joke was just some garbage, I'd scrawled into my fucking notebook and then watch it bomb and bomb and bomb until it finally grew into its own thing. And then, and then worked, you know, that's a little bit of the God. Jesus. It's one of Elliott's. I'm sorry to quote Ellie Smith. Some line in Elliott's, an Elliott Smith song goes, the game looks easy. That's why it sells. You know, so it's like, yeah. Well, there's a lot of, first off, there's a lot of survivorship bias because there's a lot of people that work their ass off and are incredibly intelligent and won't go anywhere with that. You will increase your odds certainly with, with having, you know, they might not break into the industry they're trying to break into, but you run into like, you know, like run into somebody who let's say love Shakespeare puts on Shakespeare in the park in some little town is obsessed with Shakespeare constantly reading Shakespeare, working, you watch them do a Shakespearean fucking monologue and they're good way better than you by the, by like the standard of showbiz. Are they, did they like succeed in the way that I don't know? Daniel Day Lewis succeeded? No, maybe not. Not everyone will rise to the top of any given industry, but the hard work did produce this kind of ability that was not, I wouldn't call it luck. Otherwise people, now there are stories I've heard pisses me off. Fucking head injury thing. Somebody gets hit in the head, sustains a head injury, wakes up the next day. They can play piano. Have you, have you, have you seen the documentary Marilyn call? They made a movie about it with Steve Carell guy got beat up in a bar fight and I wouldn't say that he became a savant by any means, but what happened was in part of his recovery, they're trying to train his fine motor skills and we're like giving him things to paint and they give him like little models, you know, like little action figures and stuff that he started painting. And then he started painting them and then he started putting together these these like elaborate scenes. He had complete amnesia. He had no idea who he was. He would read journals of his, of his like past self and be like, I don't identify with this person like who was this person. I don't think I even like this person. And, and he, and so he started, he started putting together these scenes with all these models and things that he was painting these little figures of and a lot of it was like it'd be a bar scene and he would be a US troop saving the ladies from bad guys and stuff. And it was like genius, but also like a brain damage. He kind of, it's a very simple kind of storylines and thinking and in some regards and he's taking pictures of this stuff and he doesn't know how to work a camera. He has to send the film and then he gets it delivered and they'd come out out of focus. He'd set it all up again and reshoot it. I know, I know I've seen this. I know what you're talking about. It's like outsider art. Like it's something about the brain injury like opened up a part of himself that was obviously like way under the surface. And you can inhibit parts of the brain. I think my guess is that it would have to do with prefrontal cortex. I've read about it in the past. I can't, if you ask Ramashandran, does some work like this? People are curious that he has a lot of good books out there. Telltale brain is one, but you can inhibit parts of brain with just electromagnetic this and that. I don't know how those things work, but you can inhibit parts of the brain and suddenly if you ask people an average person to draw a horse, they'll draw like, you know, what you would expect a normal person to draw a horse, you know, like something your kid would put on a fridge or something like that. But if you inhibit this part of the brain, they just draw a perfect yeah amazing horse because our brains are always competing for certain energy in a lot of ways. And as far as genius goes, I've never really thought of genius as a person. I've thought about it as a connection of a moment of an experience. Like I feel like I've experienced moments of genius and I feel like people that we consider geniuses are people that are like really great at collecting those moments, you know. Yeah. Yeah.

I feel like I've experienced moments of genius and I feel like people that we consider geniuses are people that are like really great at collecting those moments. Yeah, and really great at all forms of editing, even what you're talking about. Even finding ways to edit out or put on hold, whatever the particular part of yourself that is taken on the task of censorship of this is how we do it. That's not how you do it. This is how you do it. All those habits. Somehow being able to just forget all that and then start again. Brand new, but it's not new because you've been working on it. I mean, that's the thing. It's like, especially in art, man, but probably in all things. Art is like, what's crazier than when you sit down in front of a blank fucking piece of paper and you want to put something on that piece of paper. You know, that's the cra- No, thank you. Yeah, no thanks. It's the void. You know, your city there for the void. You want to put something down and there's so many reasons not to start and a lot of them are good reasons for you're going to get rejected. It's going to, for sure, it's going to suck. And whatever fantasy you had about, you know, some, some like your own personal genius, whatever like scam you've been playing on yourself. Yeah. You, you can't scam yourself anymore when you're going back and reading the shit that you wrote. And you're like, my God, it's like, this is pure garbage all the way through. This is the Lego. What's it called? The Sisyphus thing. This is like, Lego's got to go back in the fucking box. You know, and then you have to take them out again and build it again and then put them back in the fucking box and take them out, put them again. And it might not, you know what, maybe nothing will ever come. Maybe there will never be a moment where you're like, this is publishable or whatever. Who knows? That's part of the horror, isn't it? That's part of the horror. Is it? Yeah. Perhaps this is all for naught. Nothing will come. But all that being said, in my time on the planet trying to make shit, I have noticed the more I work at it, the better I get it. Oh, without a doubt. I play pickleball like crazy. I haven't played, been playing pickleball this summer and I went and played recently and it was the first time in some time that I was the weak link on the court. You know, this is just like classic. This is how practice works. This is how, how the brain works. Well, yeah, isn't practice just like practice. Like I have these synthesizers and I love them because they use this like weird technology. That if you want to upgrade some of them, you actually plug a CV cable in and it makes noises into the fucking thing that it interprets as code. And that's how it like rewrites the firmware. It's the weirdest shit ever. It's archaic compared to the way you do it with a computer. It's archaic or like in the old days when you would, they would have these tapes that you could like record your computer programs into and it took time to record the programs into the fucking tape. Like you had to, it wasn't like you just instantly download the shit and it upgrades your software. It took time, the amount of time it takes that I guess the spools of tape to record the code to overwrite or whatever the fuck it's doing. So it's like humans were analog and the way we program ourselves is through repetition and it is truly not the most efficient way of programming anything. Like imagine if that's how you got your, your upgraded your OS for Mac was like the fucking thing had to run infinite arrays of varying operating systems. As it evolved learning its mistakes and then fixing them and then going back and patching that and then going back and it would take, take as long as it takes for us to learn another language or something like that. So this repetitive thing that we call practice, it's programming, right? It's the way humans program themselves is this analog archaic way of getting habits hardwired into our neurons. So that it goes from being an unnatural feeling to just being completely effortless, normal, easy. You don't even think about it, you know? Not only that, but it's been a four billion year process of fine tuning all through all sorts of species that look like they're doing something genius where it's just an instinct or whatever else. And how do you differentiate and what is intelligence anyway? And then, and then we, we arrive and humans in particular have this robust amount of cultural transmission that very few other things do that much like primates, like crows and which I know you're a fan of. And they have, have some pretty clear cultural transmission and it seems like it can, it can catalyze learning. And so, so we just arrive here with, with not just all of this, everything that our genes have already shaped over all of this amount of time and all the environmental pressures that have, have shaped culture and our genes. But then we just have all of these weird cultural transmissions and then we just, we're just born into this. Like, wait, what, what, what happened? How am I here? How am I getting to experience this? It's so strange. Right. And, and we've got this problem because it's like basically, okay, so let's go back to the pot, the pottery example. At some point there's just a bunch of wet fucking clay and you could shape it and any kid is going to like that. I think across like cultures and time, it's fun to stick your hands in gooey clay. So fuck, you could take this stuff out of a river, your water source, there's this gooey shit that you can take out, you can make stuff. And if you leave it in the sun, what do you know? It's not gooey anymore, it maintains its form, but it's brittle, it breaks apart. Shit, what happens if I make it hotter? Holy shit, the harder you get it, the more the form seems to hold. But there's shit you can mix in with it too. It like changes the quality of it. Anyway, the point is, you know, the human lifespan is only so long and the exploration, the discovery of these methods that we now all take for fucking granted. They've taken generations to get to the point where you're like you just go on Amazon, order a kiln, get some clay. Look at a YouTube video, you could start, you're Seth Rogen, you're pumping out fucking pottery all of a sudden. There's no apprenticeship, there's no all the secrets and craft secrets and all that stuff, you just make it. It was just never like that. You had to fucking find someone with a kiln, a master to teach you all that stuff. And so the amount of time it's taking now to learn these things is decreasing. And I guess what I'm saying is, the precipice we are teetering on right now as a species is, it's not time travel in the sense that I don't know if we're really going to open wormholes that people from the future are going to come through. It's more like- If you do, I'm sorry, I cut you off. Cut me off. But one thing, I love thinking about that because that's part of the idea of, oh, now we're going to go on a tangent, I can feel it. But anyhow, part of the idea of why don't we have time travelers, why aren't we populated is like, well, you need to first create the wormhole and then in the future, through the stream of time, they need to connect that wormhole. Right. And that always to me struck me as the funniest thing. Like that was one of Stephen Hawking's explanation for why we don't have time travelers yet. Because it's time travels like physically possible, potentially within the laws of physics as we know it. But the idea is if you're tinkering with this thing, you're sitting in your garage like, I'm going to create the first wormhole and you're tinkering and you're missing and you're missing and you're missing. And then the moment you get that wormhole, that means that's the point in time that every, any future thing would arrive back out. So the second you like got that bolt in the right location, some future thing would just pop out of it. Yeah. Instantaneously. Yeah, it's like turning on a sink. All future things. Turn on a fucking sink that aliens start spraying out of. And you wouldn't even, if you were in the future, you wouldn't throw yourself in first either. You would throw in some like trivial thing first. But to us, making the thing, you would think like this was some message. Yeah. You know, this was something, you know, if you throw their version of whatever a rat or a mosquito is or whatever, you'd be like, this is, this is what the pinnacle of life evolved into. Yeah. That was, that was just the little test eroded that they threw in. You wouldn't know who the fuck knows. I mean, that's the other thing is it's like, shit, you don't know how many alien civilizations figured this stuff out long, long ago. You don't even know if you're impulse to build the damn wormhole is your own inspiration or is just you being manipulated by some civilization that figured out a way to get those ideas into your head so that you could create a new interstate leading to planet Earth. There's really no telling when you open that fucking thing. But, you know, if we are going to get to that point, theoretically, at least one thing, I would guess a kind of lubricant that is going to get us closer to the ability to open up these theoretical modes of transportation, which Einstein is that they say, oh yeah, it is possible. It could happen is it's going to happen because either we have enhanced ourselves with some genetic some some way of altering our genes so that we have a higher functioning brains, or more likely because we have started to collaborate with an artificial intelligence that is going to help us do that. Regardless, before we get to the wormhole, representing this fold in time and space or a way to faster travel faster than the speed of light, if I had to guess, we're going to start to experience, lack of a better word, temporal distortions. We're going to start to experience the subjective folding in of time. And to me, what that looks like is the amount of time between now and when whatever the thing is you want to want to bring in the world or you want to become, it's going to get less and less and less. Time starts changing, warping, shifting, compared to the way it used to be. That's clearly what we're witnessing here. I mean, this is what's happening right now. It's like we are watching a complete shift in the way that we experience time in the way that we like, and you know, there's obviously capitalism and time are inextricably wound up in each other. It's what we call the minimum wage, right? That's how many dollars or whatever the fucking currency is we think one hour of effort is worth. That's the exchange rate. So that hour, whatever that hour may be, once that starts going away, what is the value? How do we pay you now? How do we pay you when you're just telling a machine to make a thing instead of you making it yourself? How does value even work anymore at that point? I don't know. I mean, so I did a lot of factory work in my early life, and you know, I saw firsthand of this. I can kind of tell you predictably how people will react is they'll blame the Mexicans. Every time some new machine comes in that makes everything a lot better and more efficient, rather than like blaming the robot or whatever. People will probably blame some outside group or something like that for their feeling of a diminished self-worth. Wait, what do you mean? We're working at a factory where we've been packaging, I don't know, baseball cards, and suddenly a robot appears that packages the baseball cards 50 times faster than we ever could for 90% less money. How are we like, ah, these fucking Mexicans and their robots? I think it's, well, what I'm saying is rather than like blaming the inevitable, the inevitable march of technology, that we are still these human social animals with all of these in and out group biases and stuff, and it's easy to try to take out your own failings on some other group. The unions, fucking unions, you guys wanted more money, now look. That was the craziest thing. The union talk, I couldn't believe it. They would, I'd work at Ashley Furniture in Arcadia, Wisconsin, where people were making like, I don't know, between 15, 20 bucks an hour or something like that generally. This was, I don't know, nearly about 20 years ago. And the amount of complaining that they would do about the unions in Detroit that were, can you believe they're making 35, 40 dollars an hour? These unions are horrible. You don't want to be making 30, you don't want to be making twice what you are. You're blaming the union for your life circumstance. And so that, and I don't mean to make anything political but rather than to express that I think that human nature is still going to come through, not human nature, I think evolution will still have this propensity for creating these preferences, for selecting things that are difficult. And when it comes to, what is it, mid-journey? Mid-journey. So when it comes to mid-journey, which is fantastic, and I love it, but it's also new. We also might get pretty used to that in a hurry. And things that, for example, a lot of how fashion trends evolve is wealthy people figure out this very absurdly difficult way of making something that can't be copied. And so then you wear your diamond, this and that super rubber thing. And then as soon as every rich person figures out this new thing that costs a fortune and like poor people can't, this is just signaling I can afford more things than other people can. And then everyone else just figures out how to copy that and make snockoffs. So then they got to start again and figure it all out again because there was nothing inherently valuable about that garment ever other than it showed the amount of work that was put into it. And if you look at things like what's trending on Instagram, which I love, followmindunderpod at Instagram, we have the best editor in the world. And it's frustrating for me because our editor makes stuff that's like TV, like movie quality, highlight clips of our stuff. And when I'm in my weakest points and want to like vent my jealousy about why is this person have this or that, one of the things, and I'm also amused by it, is like most people making these TikTok videos and stuff, they're using, it's like the most clunky editing. They're like, they don't hide that you're in fact, you're in front of like a smooth green screen right now. It's like a joke that they're in front of like a bad green. It's like this like Tim and Eric kind of effector or whatever where it's like anyone can kind of do this or whatever, but it grabs the eye because it's different and it's editing that like a 10 year old could do and so that's like popular right now even though it's not nearly as impressive as what Mid Journey is putting out and that will get old. But here's what you just said though, that editing a fucking 10 year old could do. Do you recall the mid 90s when people like if you just wanted to edit anything, if you wanted to make anything, the amount of money you had to spend on that editing equipment that you got to build a special computer, you got to get, you know, you have to get a hacked version of what was everyone using Final Cut Pro, you know, you got to like and then maybe you would be able to run the fucking thing and God save you when you try to export your five minute video and it's going to take all night to get that thing exported. That's what I'm talking about. The fact that now we are just casually saying a nine year old could edit that shit when it was what two decades ago, 20 years ago, barely any time at all. You couldn't, if you wanted to fucking make like if a comic made anything on video, it was already impressive. You know, it's already like, holy shit, you made that. I mean, you got a camera who edited that for you. We had flip phones. You know, I got, I got, I got 8000. When I caught my breaks in like 2007, I immediately got this deal. I had never written a sketch in my life and I got a deal with this company. Super Deluxe. They gave me $16,000 for two, two minute videos that I had to like make myself. That was so much worse than what, what, like, I'll go on Instagram after this and there will be 10 people that made that just today. Right. Like they do every day on their phone. It looks like Kubrick fucking shot it. You know, like if you had, if you had brought to Super Deluxe just a run of the mill Instagram sketch and they would be like we only gave you $16,000. You're not supposed to spend your own money for this. What, what, what did you do? You know, the, that man, that is the, and then what goes along with that is that all those people, the video editors, the people who had access to Final Cut Pro and a computer now that you would just take shits on if you had it. Those people, they were the wizards and those were the people. That's why $16,000 because the quotes they would give you to make this stuff weren't just based on their ability to use the technology. It was that they had the technology that they, and you didn't. And so because of that, they could charge whatever they wanted for it, whatever the market was in those days. You know, they were backlogged because they had this shit. Now that industry, the editor, obviously it still exists, but not like it used to. Not like it used to. Similarly, the graphic artist, the graphic artist. Man, if I want to get like a cool t-shirt made, you know, like, I have to license that or pay somebody to make the shirt and I'm going to keep doing that. But, man, I got to tell you, some of these mid-journey things that it's spitting out within seconds. I'm looking at that thinking, that's a pretty good shirt. That's a pretty good shirt. That's a really good shirt. I don't have to. I could give it. Until everyone has it though, that's what I'm saying. And then, and then, and then you go like, oh, look, Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino just shot that whole movie on film. Can you believe they shot that whole thing on film? Who cares? Who would do that? Who cares? You know, you're sitting in front of future Amazon and you're like, hey, can you make a movie that looks like Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino shot the whole thing on film? Like ten minutes later, it's better than the movie Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan shot on film. So, you know what I mean? So it's like, yeah. People still want to, people still show off their record collections to this day. Sure. There's just like, there's a lot within our personality that we want to advertise as well. So certainly people that are like advertising their openness and potentially intellect or something, or their ability to accrue resources. Certainly they're going to like, look at how fast I can just whip up these ideas or whatever. And then there's also going to be people that, I think that there's still going to be people like, look at all of the like paleo fantasy that's happened over the last like 20 years or whatever where I'd go into CrossFit and they're like, well, you got to do overhead squats because clearly our ancestors were like, squatting in this weird way to lift an outrageous amount of weight over their head in the most peculiar fashion and that's how they built things. No, they weren't, but people gravitated to that idea like of this like naturalist kind of idea. I don't know. I think you may be a little more of a futurist than I am. Certainly, I think you probably are. And Ramin is like more of the futurist in our relationship. I tend to be more of like the naturalist, you know, I love animal behavior and learning about crows and whatever other goddamn thing. But I just think that there's like, it's just such an arms race constantly that even as the technology evolves, it's still like, well, you know how I'm going to outdo all of your editing? I'm going to work on this trick shot where I drive a golf ball amazingly with one arm and then swing back around and hit a baseball home run and I recorded myself doing that a thousand times and people are like, oh, that's really hard to do. You know, I have a bunch of... No, Shane, they're not going to go, that's really hard to do. You're going to go, wow, that's a really convincing deep fake and you're going to have to be like, no, no, that's me. No, I swear to God, that's really me. Oh, really? I'm sure you really did that. Okay. No, you want me to believe you did that? Okay, you did it. Well, come and watch me. Maybe then, maybe like people, there'll be a thing where, I don't know, people are like, wow, I saw it live. He did this incredible trick shot. It's super cute. Kind of like when you go to civil war reenactments or whatever. I mean, let me take... Look, that's an unenhanced human who was able to do that cute trick shot. Well, of course, of course, but like what is... That's, now you're getting into very complicated ideas of what is good, like what is, but like one of the, you know, evolutions my main thing that I study and one of the hardest things that you have to catch yourself from doing is assigning direction to evolution, assigning intention and also assigning better or worse. I'm not assigning better or worse. I'm prognosticating a future where if, like if we are going to like assign labels to better or worse, you know, I would say disruptive and non-disruptive. Like, you know, like, okay, we have this awesome inflatable pool that we got at Target that we were using for the kids. Oh, I've seen them. They fucking love it, but guess what happened? Bees. Bees, there's a drought right now in Austin. Bees, suddenly they're like, holy shit, there's this incredible flower that's got all the water we will ever need for the whole summer. And so whatever way bees like, you know, have a bee map in their bee brain, literally, you could see a highway of bees just flying down to the pool, flying away with the water. The bees, they're not thinking this isn't like the old ways when we would drink out of puddles and stone. They just want the fucking water. And so I think what's going to drive this stuff, though there will be nostalgic, you know, like there's still people who like to go to silent movies and they think it's cool. Someone plays ragtime while they watch some old silent movie and they sit back and it's like they wear like suits and they watch it and they're like, wow, this is what it used to be like. But I think the reality of it is that or just judging my own consumerist tendencies, I just want shit. I want it right away. I got to wait for it. I got to wait for fucking God. The new God of War. It's coming out. It's painful. I don't even want to know video games that I'm into are coming six months or eight months down the line because now I have to experience this like anxiety as I'm like, come on, just fucking hurry up. I want to play this now. The only reason I'm having to wait for the game to come is because humans are making it and humans are slow and humans are imperfect and humans, they just take time to make something good and I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure it's going to get to the point where we don't have to wait anymore like that. You could go ahead, have your corporation make your fucking video games and your movies or whatever but there's going to be a whole most of us we're just going to be sitting back in entertainment domes in the metaverse or wherever completely lost in a never ending flow of collaborative entertainment and sense gratification and that collaboration is just going to be between us and the machine and it's going to like not just like, it's going to be like oh, okay I get it, that's kind of a cool idea for a movie you want the shining but also close encounters of the third kind and you want it to be porn and you're into feet but I think I know something else that you might be into and then it adds some other fun into it I forgot I liked ice cream I forgot about ice cream put ice cream in there too yeah and to me that marks that marks kind of an apocalypse for a cultural apocalypse for our species that is I'm not saying two years five years probably ten, if I had to bet ten maybe eight, all the normal shit aside like if we don't blow ourselves up and it doesn't like melt today's episode was supported by Loomi Labs the creators of my favorite gummies these things are perfect

These are the oldest signs that I know of, the signs. Sign one, you dream about a sexual hug that reminds you of your mother. Sign two, you wake up with a number 69 tattooed up of your ass. Sign three, cops start coming to your house to show you a green diamond. Sign four, you notice a small gray film. It's the small of your back. Sign five, you create a universe and are populating the things that die. Sign six, you become very sensitive to underwear that's not silk.

Up into your stomach, and you poop out your mouth. Sign nine, Ken Burns shows up at your house with a tiger. You ride it around while he films you in the nude. These are the signs that you're having a spiritual awakening. These are the only signs that I know of, the signs. That was Signs of a Spiritual Awakening by Krishnamurti Jackson Brown, and you could find that on Mexador Records, friends, what an incredible podcast we have for you today. Sophia Rocklin has written the greatest psychedelic book that I have encountered since Terence McKinnon's The Archaic Revival. It's called When Plants Dream. And it's the only book that has ever truly made me want to drink ayahuasca. Maybe one day we'll be able to microdose ayahuasca. Wouldn't that be nice? Just to have a nice, small, manageable ayahuasca experience. Have a little micro puke. Only micro shit your pants. One thing we do have is my favorite new microdose gummies by Loomi Labs. Friends, Loomi Labs microdose gummies are by far the best edible THC I have ever encountered in my life. They figured out the perfect dose. In fact, you know what I do? I cut the gummies in half and just eat half of one and sleep like a baby. I sleep as though I were being cradled in the feathered arms of the angel of sleep rather than the angel of death, which is what it feels like when you eat too much weed. Somehow, I truly don't understand how these things are legal nationwide. I fly with them. They're wonderful. To learn more about microdose and THC, just do a quick search online or go to microdose.com. Use Code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. They're legal nationwide, seemingly impossible, but it's not. These are the bee's knees. Again, it's microdose.com Code Duncan for 30% off Loomi Labs glorious microdose gummies. And Loomi Labs, thank you. I love that you keep sending them to me. Are you in Philadelphia? Because if you are, I hope you'll come see me and Johnny Pemberton do some stand-up comedy at the Helium Comedy Club next week. That's the 9th, the 10th, and the 11th of June. I got lots of other dates coming up. You can find them all at dunkintrustle.com. And now, friends, I want to introduce you to Sophia Rockland. She just wrote a book with Daniel Penchbeck called When Plants Dream, It Is Glorious. Order the book. It's such spectacular writing. And it's such a deep, beautiful topic. And you'll see from the conversation that you're about to listen to that she is a brilliant person who has a lot to say about medicinal plant medicine, ayahuasca, and saving the rainforests. Everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, Sophia Rockland. Welcome upon you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the dunkintrustle, the real, the real, the real, the real, the real. And I, of all the books that I have read that talk about ayahuasca, none of them has made me really want to try it more than your book. So thank you, because I'm always sort of scared of it for some reason. I mean, the vine of death. It's not exactly an enticing name for a psychedelic. Well, it depends on your kink, I guess, but. Yeah. Yeah, that's or kamarank, which is the vomiter. The vomiter. The vomiter, also not the sexiest. It depends on what you're into, I guess. Well, you know, I found it interesting that they've connected why it makes you puke. I always thought the puking was a result of, I mean, aside from the mystical explanations for it, I just thought it was because it tasted like shit. And it, you know, was an alkaloid and so it just upset your stomach. But it was interesting that it has some kind of connection to a part of your brain responsible for puking. The brainstem. Yeah. Well, first of all, I didn't even know the brainstem was the reason that we puked. But it's fascinating that it has some interaction with that. Yeah. You know, I guess with anything with ayahuasca and anything with the world in general, really, if you look at, there's going to be like a spiritual explanation and then we can attempt to boil it down to some sort of a material source. But my understanding is that there's this researcher out of Georgetown University who was looking at, it's called the area posterima. And there are dopamine receptors in that zone that are just like getting pounded by the brew and that's kind of making some gaggy things happen. Has anyone looked into the difference in recipes? In other words, like the, how nuanced is the effect of ayahuasca from one shaman to the next? How similar is it? Great question. I would say there, you can be an ayahuasca connoisseur depending on what kind of life you decide to live. Yeah. I mean, I think ethnobotanists have identified just a few types of benasteriopsis copy. And then there's the diplopteris, which is also known as chalipanga or the psychotria. So even right there, you have two or three and then people throw in different things. There are different types of preparations depending on, you know, if you want to rasp the bark off of the vine that will or will not create a more, it has more emetic tannins in it. So depending on what you're going for and really interestingly, I'm sure you've kind of, perhaps you've meditated on this idea, like how did people discover ayahuasca out of all of the different plants? I think a quarter of all known plant species are in the Amazon rainforest. And it's the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystem on earth. So right there, you're kind of like, okay, I mean, this is botanical pharmacy and you're just playing around. One of the theories, which I love is by this guy, Stefan Bayer, and he was actually looking at that people's needs to find good purgatives because you have lots of, you're not cooking with a lot of fire. You live, there's a lot of competition. There's fungus, there's bacteria, there's parasites. And so people became very well versed at preparing what's known as vomitivos. So that's something that I sort of, I think we're sorely missing in our culture, which is actually vomiting therapy. So taking plants that go, they kind of gush around in your belly, you drink massive amounts or small amounts, and then you can't believe we're talking about this. So quick projectile vomiting, and it provides both obviously like a physiological relief. And then there's a bit of a psychological relief in the gesture of just purging. So one of the theories is that communities were looking for a better way to purge. And lo and behold, they took this banisteriopsis copy and combined it with namely a DMT containing plants, cicotria, the mono-aminoxidase inhibitors in the banisteriopsis allowed for the psychoactivity of the DMT to kick in, and then suddenly they're on a different trip. The purgative function, it could happen minus the DMT, right? Without mixing the two together, you would just puke, or is the psychoactive component contained within the, wait, I always get confused about this. It's the vine that has the DMT in it. Is that the purg? Other way around. Oh. I know. I know. The vine makes you puke. The vine is the star of the show, but think about it like this, DMT is theoretically endogenously produced in tons of different plant and animal species. We have it in our cerebrospinal fluid, you find it in like citrus peels, it's all over the place, but the real magic is what allows for the DMT to be experienced in the way that it's experienced, if that makes sense. The copy has these digestive enzymes that allow you to just feel it. Those are the MAO inhibitors. That's right. The vine is a MAO inhibitor, the bark is the DMT. Which one has the purgative medicine in it? Is it the vine or the bark or both? The vine has the bark. The banisteriopsis copy, if you can visualize it, it's this beautiful woody liana or like a barky vine and it grows in these double helices and it loves hardwood trees and it actually eventually chokes them like large serpents. That woody bark on the vine has a medic, it has tannins, which can feel a little bit queasy and also different alkaloids, harmine, tetrahydroharmine and harmaline, which I actually don't know how much we know about whether or not they have any kind of direct purging activity, but it's such like a chemical bouquet that there's a lot to be looked into. I love the theory that it was a purgative. What is it they used to, in Tom Sawyer, what is it they would make you drink? If you were at Tom Sawyer in a long time, I missed that part. God, no, in the very beginning you would punish kids by making them drink, God, it would make you puke. It was called, let me look it up. When I was a kid, I was terrified by it, but by then, no one was using it anymore. Let me look this stuff up. One second here. What are you googling? That's my question. Tom Sawyer. Thing that made you puke. Yeah. It was called, medicine that makes you puke. Let's see here. Whatever. It's like some weird old, no. We're just to take place. It's like an Appalachian story. It's a Southern story and it was called, oh my God, I'm so brain dead. I can't believe I can't remember the name of this stuff. But anyway, the point is they did have a purgative back then that they would make kids drink to punish them. It would make you puke. That's cool. But it's interesting that in our culture, that seems to have gone away. Unless you have fucked up or your kid ate the wrong thing and you go to the hospital, they'll give you something that makes you puke. But it's not like you can get over the counter. This is going to make you throw up. You've forgotten that there could be a usefulness to vomiting. It's not just something that means you're sick necessarily. What you're saying is pretty interesting. In the conversation around ayahuasca, certainly puking is a big part of the conversation. This is one of the reasons. I'm afraid of this stuff. Two reasons. One, communal reality. Puking around a group of people or shitting my pants or whatever I'm wearing around a group of people seems incredibly embarrassing. Just that alone. Add to that having a divine conversation with the spirit of the earth or the spirit of the forest or maybe there's no difference. Those two things happening simultaneously. Don't knock it till you try it. How many times have you puked in front of people? How many times do you think you've puked in front of people? The real question is how many times have other people been lucid enough around me to know that I was puking? If you puke in a forest. I think that's the great joke. Your self-consciousness is so amplified when reality everybody else is just on their own journey too. In the end of it you come out in this deep solidarity pact. We just went human. We went really human together. That is going to definitely give your good lenses of perception a little wipey-wipe. I like that. I see. I recognize it's just an egoic block that I don't want to be that vulnerable around people. It's embarrassing to vomit, isn't it? You sort of lose control. It sounds gross. It's so fascinating all the psychedelics that ayahuasca, as far as I'm aware, is the number one, is the only one I can think of where puking, maybe mushrooms I guess, but where puking is a central part of it. Do you buy into the idea that there is more going on than just purging, like a physiological purging, that you're actually uprooting or evacuating some kind of dark spiritual energy? Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that this is where the, in this conversation of, I'm sure you've liaised enough with New Age life coaches to hear this word intention thrown around enough, but it really is. You're about to go on that journey and you identify your North Star and you will go out there with your little ship and you know the waters are going to get rocky, but if you have your map there, it can help. What I'm meaning to say here is in the process of vomiting is often the meaning that you ascribe to it. So you might start to feel like, oh man, these feelings of jealousy or these feelings of guilt and regrets are representing themselves in tarantulas under my skin and the just queasy, brown blob people that are inviting me with their spiky thorn and electric gills and you know, all of this creepy crawlies just come up to the surface in this unlangageable way. And to be so overwhelmed by that, that the way out is literally out, is quite beautiful actually to not have to grapple with it with the faculties of language, but through our bodies and I will say that more than once I've looked down at my little puddle of relief and been like, wow, that is, I don't know if you've ever seen spirited away the Miyazaki movie, the black blob creature that is just absorbing all of these different things in the spa house and that's kind of like the purge, you know, you pull out the handle of the bicycle and suddenly all of these different memories and senses just come out in this one dramatic gesture. And I think there's something quite poetic about it. I never fancy myself an advocate of vomiting, but here we are. And we use it as a culture, right? Like, don't you feel like we just need a good bar, maybe not, I don't know, honk if you like it. I mean, yeah, I do think that that could be a useful. You know, I do know that when I've had food poisoning and when it when it's done, when I'm better, I feel so good, like there's a sparkly, weirdly healthy, almost reborn feeling that comes when you've been vomiting for a couple of days straight. You do feel better like something definitely comes out that seems to be more than whatever shitty food you ate totally, totally. And remember also that within the greater body of this traditional ecological knowledge of ayahuasca and Amazonian plants, we as Westerners get like the hyper abbreviated version, which is maybe, you know, go to a fancy loft and Joshua tree and have one night of an experience. Whereas, you know, in another context, there's a whole understanding of basically this process of a dieta, which is a long aesthetic cleaning out of the vessel and the instrument, which is our body to receive God or gods or whatever spirit have you. And that purging plays a much deeper role. You're not just purging yesterday's spaghetti, you're actually having fasted for days, sometimes weeks, really, really intense diets. And so you're getting to deeper things that I think are incomprehensible to to those of us who are just, you know, living the everyday life without that contemplative pause. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. The dieta, is there in your encounter with the various cultures who sacramentally drink ayahuasca, is there a commonality between the dieta? Does it change up from one tribe or one culture to the next? Yeah, great question. So the dieta is, I think of it like a knowledge process. It's an epistemological knowledge producing system where people learn about plants. So within these universities, these botanical universities of life in the rainforest, people have different curanderos or healers or onanhas, they all have different names for healers and each of the names mean different things. But a healer, a seer, some of them will have specific plants that they have kind of become emissaries or representatives of. So the obieta vaquero, somebody who's a trained in the tobacco medicine, they'll be ayahuasqueros, people who are trained in ayahuasca and so on. And so these people, after having spent months and sometimes years of contemplative meditation and in a way a marriage to this plant, then carry the medicine of that plant and that medicine is represented, this is where it starts to get pretty metaphysical, transcendental. It could be the essence of the plant, the quality of the plant. They kind of see through the plant's eyes or something. It's pretty far out. So I mean, the brass tacks of it, typically what I've seen is there is a process of making a promise to the plant, it's an exchange. I'm going to give you something in order to receive something from you. And what we give is our hunger, basically all of our appetites, our physical hunger, our thirst, our sexual appetites, our desire for certain things. Certain plants, the traditional wisdom calls for different renunciation processes. So you're not going to look in a mirror, you're not going to use soaps or anything fragrant. You are only going to eat the fish that has so many little bones that you really have to work for every piece of meat. You eat a plantain that is cooked in this particular way and that is just the thing. It is not meant to be pleasant, but you are in this exchange, like I'm giving you, I'm giving you, I'm giving you all of my desire. And there's a point where the body hollows enough, the spirit hollows enough. And typically you're also alone in a small tombo, they call it a little home, outfitted with a hammock and nothing else. So no notebooks, no music, no anything and you're there. And you just are opening to receiving the information of that plant. And I'll tell you that there's a certain point, obviously, then there's the imagination and there's suggestibility and there's all these other considerations. Like, oh, I'm supposed to have this experience and I trick myself into it. But I mean, I'll tell you that I've had moments where I'm in the middle of the night, wake up and suddenly I feel like I'm being outfitted by this fractal, rhizomatic, botanical armor. And it comes gently, but it comes surely. And sometimes it's like electric and very scary. And other times it's motherly and it somehow energetically feels much like the plant itself looks or tastes. And you're like, oh, wow, that's that. That's literally unlike anything I've ever experienced. So I've always had, I've always kept one foot very firmly planted in this world that we are from. But there were times where I've really had to like seriously reckon with the fabric of reality that I've inherited because it blew my mind into smithereens. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I mean, it's just a strange thing over here. If anyone is even talking about plants, usually it's just gardening tips or how to cook with them. There's very little, it's not like people are so idiotic that they don't recognize that plants have a kind of personality or a sort of, they clearly are living in their own reality. But they're in the West, they seem more ignored than they are in places that have given birth to ways of engaging with plant life via psychedelics, you know? And so I guess that's part of the mind blowing part, right? It's not necessarily mind blowing just because, holy shit, I am being possessed or I am dancing or I am having sex with a plant. It's mind blowing because we've been in a sort of North Korea situation over here, right? Like a kind of bazaar bubble within which computers and all the Western modes of recreation, pleasure and business somehow obskinate that reality, right? Isn't that why it's mind blowing? I mean, it's probably what would be mind blowing if you pluck someone out of any hyper-fascist Orwellian universe and showed them, look, the whole planet's living in a completely different way.

I mean, it's probably what would be mind blowing if you pluck someone out of any hyperfascist Orwellian universe and showed them, look, the whole planet's living in a completely different way. Totally. Totally. And I think it takes, I mean, imagine the fact that I think the Western hubris is so damn thick to allow us to believe that we could be acted upon. We could be acted upon. We're not just like penetrating our environment, but we are actually, we are doing the bidding of the corns and apples and the ganjas and the hyaloscas. Just imagine that. I mean, we are just teeny weeny little flesh skeletons walking around and I look at us like delicious compost pellets that the plants are just going to love up eventually and could it be? And I think that when, yeah, when you have moments like that realizing that psychoactive plants have shaped and do shape our consciousness and almost like the bee gets drunk from the nectar, the ant goes crazy for the little droplets of honey, like we too kind of circulate. I think about coffee and cocaine and marijuana and these different and tea. I mean, our civilizations have been completely shaped by our appetites for those plants and we see it as us cultivating them, but I don't know. Yeah, it's curious. In your book, you were talking about, I don't remember the name of the practice where they cut parts of, they burn it down. They burn it down. The slash and burn forests. But they're burning it down to grow from it because it fertilizes the soil. You burn little swaths, plant seeds there and then come back and now you have things that you can eat. It's a form of cultivation in the jungle. Totally. I had a dark thought. Spill it. The dark thought was, my God, if we are being poveteered by the plants, maybe all the environmentalists have it totally wrong, that the plants are poveteering us to destroy ourselves in mass so that they can grow from the smoldering ruins of our civilization, that there isn't a kind of benevolence at all, but rather an accelerationist motivation happening from the vegetable kingdom. We are all like, the plants are telling us, oh, we want to save the earth. We must be less consumerist, but really the plants are like, no, no, no, war. Go to war with each other. Just blow, just destroy yourselves so that we can have more fertile ground to grow from. 100% and then imagine this. What if the plants are the emissaries of the mycelium or the mushrooms? Some of them grow in Chernobyl. Some of them are plasticators. Maybe they're like, oh man, the plastic civilization, fast forward a million years, they're just going to have this amazing mycelial kingdom just feeding off of our ruins and that's going to be life. The plants were the middlemen. I don't know. Yeah, they were just the part of the process of human beings wiping ourselves out. When you have had your own communication with plants, have you gotten that kind of message from them? I mean, the people I know who have taken ayahuasca, generally the message is sort of more compassionate than that. I don't know how much it would be in their interest to spill their beans to me in that way. It's kind of like a toilet zone thing. How does it go, how to prepare man, remember that I'm just saying this. Oh yeah, that's cookbook, they find the cookbook that you're preparing man or whatever it is. I haven't seen it that way, but I have been prepared for death and I've felt less, it's kind of like ready or not, it's coming and I think that this is one of the things that psychedelics in general have a unique affinity to accelerate us towards. How do they prepare you for death? Well, I think very practically my favorite iteration of this is when it's like, okay, I am Sophia, okay, I'm Sophia, I'm from this place, I'm from this place, what is this place, who's this person, and then my whole narrative just disintegrates like soft spider webs in the rain, and there I am, nobody and everybody, and that's a sweet way. That's a sweet way. That's a non-struggling way, but we arrived to that in different ways, so I think practicing the good death is an interesting one. Practicing the good death, you mean practicing it via psychedelics or just meditation or what do you mean? I don't know, in all the time, I've personally been, I guess like a share, I wrote this book and I don't know if you've ever had this experience where you publish something and then you look at it and you're like, what the heck just happened? Was that, I just blacked out, did I do that? Who is that? I don't believe anything in there, and you start to realize that your little, your attempts to cling on to some sort of a reality or a materiality just kind of dissolve in front of you and it's terrifying, and I think that I'm consistently needing to confront these ego deaths and I need to, an expectation to promote a book or succeed in a job or whatever it is in this civilization, and yet I have this tendency to want to unravel and compost. I love composting. Compost is like my religion lately, I want to get a tattoo or a flag or something. We need that, allow ourselves to just keep dying, don't get too attached, I guess, right? I don't know. I don't know. One of my favorite mushroom experiences was, just exactly what we were talking about, suddenly I'm having this sense of like, oh, I was doing something. What was I doing? I was doing something. You're doing a thing. Yeah, I'm like, I was doing something that started dawning and I'm like, oh, oh, I was being human. Oh shit, I'm human. I'm human, you know, like suddenly coming back into the identity, not from the perspective of oh, thank God I'm alive or, which I've had with the like, MEO DMT or like, oh my god, I'm here. But more of a sense of like, that you hear people who have ND, near-death experiences, they don't want to come back. They're, usually their ancestors are saying, no, no, no, you've got to go back. You're not done. School's not out yet. You know what I mean? Like, it seems like this, in general, one of the through lines in near-death experiences is that people, it's not like they're dying to come back here. They're dying to not be here, literally, you know? So do you get a sense that what the New Age people are saying regarding human incarnation is correct, that this is some kind of university or a teaching simulation or something? That this life experience is a teaching simulation? Yeah, like a school, a university, a kind of spiritual... Like there's a sysaric kind of loops to pass through or something like that? Yeah, like, yeah, exactly. Like, totally. It's not some meaningless thing. We've sort of been assigned to something here. There's a reason behind it. Do you have that sense? Well, I think the most sense that I've ever made of that, because I don't necessarily feel that my world view does not neatly fit into this idea that like, oh, one llama dies and another is born on the hill, right? I don't know if the soul jumps bodies in that same way. I may never know. We'll never know, but I do really love something that my maestro, his name is Jose Lopez. He's a shipibo healer. And he said something when we were in a diet and in a ceremony, and he was like, we do this work not for ourselves, but to relieve our past and liberate our future. And I was like, wow, dude, I don't know, I mean, it seems straightforward, but at the same time, in that moment, I realized like, okay, the work that I'm doing right now is because I am the one that is conscious in this moment. I am the one who's living and breathing. And I have my grandmother's irises and, you know, information from her eggs in my uterus. And you know, all of this memory is in me, a part of me is reconciling the generational pain and trauma and patterns. And it is through reproduction, I myself don't have offspring yet, but I suspect that, and even in your relations with others, just untangling, we're in this great untangling process. And any bit of untangling we do along the way is worth something, I guess, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How about you? I'm curious. Yeah. Well, I would love to answer that, but if you don't mind, Jose Lopez, when he was telling you that you're relieving the past, does he mean it like, I'm just thinking in terms of like Western psychotherapy, like I'm relieving trauma or I'm relieving myself or I'm, you know, untangling my own like false connections to the past or to, you know, my own shit or whatever you want to call it, but it feels, does he mean it more in like an extre-temporal sense? Like, is their view of time different than the Western view of time? I mean, you know, like in other words, are you go literally relieving your ancestors of their karmic debt, of their stuff, because everything's happening at once, meaning your ancestors in some part of the time space continuum are still existing? I couldn't speak to their worldview because I am not of it, you know, but I think that, yeah, there's definite in some cases a more embodied understanding, like there are spirits and there are influences that in some shape and form linger in our realm and they can feel a sense of alleviation, but, you know, I don't necessarily feel that way. I don't have as enchanted of a worldview because I wasn't brought up in a physical environment that creates that worldview, right? So I think for me, if anything, it's like, if any, if there's anything in life, it's our relationships and the energy that's created and relating between two people and in the memory of that relation and the feeling that that relation creates that to me is the realest thing there ever is really. When people are on their deathbeds, they're not like, I wish I bought that car. They're like, oh, I wish I told her I loved her, right? Like that's the thing. We want to be touched. We want to touch and be touched in this world. We're that earthy, you know? And so to me, it's like, yeah, I think if we touch the memory of a thing, we are touched by it and it really is as ephemeral and fleeting as that. I'll never forget the time my dad started telling me about his pet crow. He wouldn't often talk about his childhood because it wasn't an easy one, but holy shit. Apparently he tamed a crow that he really liked and the crow got eaten by a cat. I only wish that Storyworth had been around back then so that I could have collected more and more of my dad's wild stories. Sadly, my father has gone on to live in the eternal story in the sky or wherever it may be. So all of those stories are gone. Also after approximately two decades of using various psychedelics, it's not like my brain is a steel trap. So the stories he did tell me, I can barely remember. I wish that I'd gotten him Storyworth for Father's Day. It's the perfect Father's Day gift. It's an online service that helps you and your dad or father figure connect through sharing stories and memories and preserves them for years to come. Storyworth has a reservoir of awesome questions like, have you ever feared for your life or what's your favorite childhood memory? And these get sent to your dad who will answer them and then over time you will compile this incredible book filled with all of your dad's stories that you and your kids and your family will be able to enjoy and share for generations. It's a great way to make your dad feel special and it's a great way for you to find out many, many secrets because I promise you he's going to write things in the email that he might not have told you face to face. Give all the fathers in your life a meaningful gift. You can both cherish for years to come.

To me, it's like, yeah, I think if we touch the memory of a thing, I think we're going to be touched by it and it really is as ephemeral and fleeting as that. Yeah. Yeah, obviously, I have no idea. I just love that. Oh darn, I was hoping you might have the answer. Bad news, I do not. But I would like it if I did. It would be so powerful. Cool. I think I was listening to a lecture from Terrence MacKinnon. He was sort of talking about the shaman, the maestro, the shaman is being somehow outside of time and space or I think he used the example of you're in an airplane, you look down, you see the terrain. For people who had no access to that altitude, you're reporting in on what's over the next mountain or whatever would seem spectacular, magical. I think he was saying the shamans, they through this work have gained access to a kind of temporal altitude wherein they can see what we call the future or have access to the past via something other than memories or something like that. Makes sense. I mean, also if you look at just the lived practices of people who are broadly referred to as shamans, like even the Heyoka character, the sacred trickster character, they're living outside of the community hub. They live very often in isolation. They do not participate in the same rites of passage. They do not eat the same food. They don't go to the same parties or listen to the same music in many ways. It's like they have chosen the different angle. Even if you just look at how people physically arrange themselves in a society in those communities, you'll see that of course they're going to have a different perspective and they may not be as entangled in the dramas of the lay people, the technicians of the sacred. They have different toolbox. Yeah, yeah, a different toolbox and yeah, well, I, but I mean that toolbox, it's so spectacular, at least from our perspective, it's so spectacular, isn't it? I mean, it's you, it's much older than our technology. You know, we've got all this plastic shit that flickers and glows and can answer questions and stuff, but it's brand new. Whereas this technology that you're writing about, it's so old. And so I, I, anyway, I don't know, it's all speculation. I mean, there is so much mad. You read about God, anthropological essays on indigenous cultures with shamans, and there's so much sorcery there. There's so much magic. There's so much Hogwarts level stuff going on. Honestly, I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you don't feel as connected to that reality as I imagined you might. Yeah, totally. And no one to expel you from that Hogwarts either. That's the scary thing. There are no parents in the room. Yeah, that's definitely like one of the funny tropes. I don't know. One of the things that's a bit challenging in Westerners meshing with jungle people's medicine is that they expect these shamans to neatly, you know, mirror our saints and our priests and the concept of duality is just not what, not the 2000 year old plus story that we have been perpetuating. It just isn't the same. Like I always remember one of my favorite things is just in Shippebo. It's Shippebo is a community that live in Peru and they've become quite popular because they have shared their medicines and their traditions pretty generously with Western folk and their greetings are Hakunyantan and Hakunyamakiri, which is basically, there are a couple of different ones, but it's like good morning or sorry, good night and good not night. Like there are little things like that where you're like, hold on a minute. What? Why not? You know, and you could just bang your head on that one there for a little bit. That's so cool. Yeah. So little, little things like that, right? Where you start to realize like, huh, right? Like the night is not what we think it is, you know, and that's so cool. Yeah. So and I mean, also the, the, the ideas of sorcery and the different things that people have integrated into these practices have served purposes that are vital for this continuity of a different community. Like, oh, that guy needs to go down because he's casting stuff on us. So we're going to, it's just a self preservation technique too. It makes sense within different containers. And then if you also look at like the different megafauna or like, you know, the Jaguar, the different people, the apex predators that are celebrated within the ayahuasca kind of pantheon, right? Like the psychedelic pantheon there, these are predators. They stalk and they hunt and they kill you, you know, like that's, that's, that's that. Like those are your role models. I'm not, I mean, this is not an endorsement of, you know, Jaguar like violence, venue means, but just to kind of expand our worldview that things can get a little spooky there because you really are hanging on to a morsel of this essential goodness that I think we hope breathed life into this world. And you maybe realize that the disintegrating and darkness forces play a bigger role than we care to see. I mean, I see compost, compost totally. If you walk around the Amazon, I've done this or any forest really, hopefully not all forests, but in the Amazon specifically, lots of deciduous trees and not ever greens. And I realized at a certain point that I am seeing as much death here as I'm seeing life. There's as many felled trees and dead things, just so much death around me and yet I'm only seeing the green because that's I am green. And if you slip into the yellows or the browns or the blacks, you start to see all those other ones and you're like, whoa. Yeah. All right. That's so this. Okay. This is something I think about not just regarding people going to the Amazon or places like that to drink ayahuasca, but also people when they take their pilgrimage to India in search of the guru like Ramdastit or whatever the remote location is to find the awakened being. It seems like Westerners carry with them expectations based on what you're talking about, based on this ethical system that has its roots in Christianity, fundamentalism, evangelical Christianity, whatever. They come to a place where that is just not the worldview and somehow even if they're going there to drink the medicine, to be healed, they still come back sometimes quite offended by something that happened there because the people in a completely different place from a completely different culture did not follow their idea of what morality is like. And sometimes I think maybe it's just really unethical for Westerners to go over there at all. We're not supposed to be there because we're not ready because you can't go to another place and do this kind of weird subconscious colonization. Like you know what I mean? Our ideas of sexuality and their ideas of sexuality are two completely different things, probably. Yeah. And yet there's an expectation you're going to abide by our ideas of how this works. And I've always found that to be sometimes it gets people over there and lots of trouble doesn't it? Oh yeah. Sometimes it causes all kinds of drama and trouble and horrible things, not because the person did anything necessarily bad from their worldview, but from the worldview of the tourists who came there to take the medicine. Do you ever think about that? Like maybe it's better for us just to stay away. Oh yeah. I've been away for a while now. I think I've been grappling with all these things. Like for example, I remember the first time I went to the Ecuadorian Amazon. I was like still very much a fledgling in this space and I was with a community. And nobody made eye contact at all. No eye contact. Or when they shook your hand, it was a very limp kind of biscuit thing. It was like, you know, just what we in our culture would totally perceive as super rude, you know? Well, they didn't look at me. So if you're just flashing eyes and you know, I'm having a spiritual experience and a gaze into the eyes of this person, you're going to realize that means something totally different than what it does for us. So yeah, I mean, I do, although I would push back against maybe forgive me if it's like the suggestion of a contamination or like this sort of call, you know, this, right? Like I think that we have this idea that indigenous communities are sort of hermetically sealed in this container that is the forest. But if you look, if you look at different archaeological records or stories of trade routes, or if you even look at the botanical evidence of cross pollinators and birds and animals and peoples moving around the world, we are just like going straight for this diversified heterogeneous like like world. Like that's just the gesture. And also I want to say I was just thinking about, you know, are you talking about the botanical technology? I was thinking about at the, at the risk of diverting this conversation. I just remember this, oh gosh, who was it? Somebody, it wasn't Rupert Sheldrake. It was, it was a, it was a piece, it was a speech written in 1928. I will find it and send it to you. And it was this, it was this kind of contemplation about the different, it was this visionary look at how there will be a new mineral dynasty, that the minerals, the mineral kingdom, we are emissaries of the mineral people. And I'm just looking at phones and technology and all these metals and these communicators and these things. And I just want to throw in that, like, there is a worldview where people think, oh, we're returning to this eudonic, pristine, you know, prelapsarian past that is the plants and Pachamama and love. And, but then I also think like, whoa, if there are all of these other consciousnesses or creatures that influence the way that we do things like titanium and different, you know, like, I mean, all of these different metals that are, we just interact with them like a deep frickin way right now that are, you know, that are, that we are communicating through right now. Like that is a whole other domain of, of, of power, of influence in the world. So, you know, I don't know where I was going with that. But I, it's interesting. That's cool. I like that the emissaries of minerals is, it's, it's fascinating. And then it was, and then there was another part that was like, they will cast webs in the sky. And I was like, oh, shit, it's Skynet, you know, like it's, and it was like that there will be spider webs. And this was in the 1920s. We had no idea, you know, so. You mean you're talking about the prophecy, the apocalyptic prophecy of, right? That's the, well, it wasn't even apocalyptic. It was, I guess I'm just, I guess what I'm pointing to, to take a step back is, you know, when we talk about ayahuasca and plant medicines, suddenly we are presented with this idea, oh, maybe there are other elements and creatures that are acting upon our consciousness and we are doing their bidding, right? So those are, let's say organic or natural biological entities. But then if you actually look at who is getting energy pumped into them or who's shaping our consciousness, it's like, there's this whole mineral paradigm that is going off the chain right now. You got me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's a collision between the two, isn't it? I mean, it seems to be some kind of like ongoing conversation, argument, debate. I don't know, game of chess or some attempt at dancing with each other, which seems to be going, I mean, depending on what side you're on. I guess, I mean, I don't, I, sometimes I just, like, it seems so interesting to me that we fly to these places to drink the medicine, flying over the damn things, jet fuel falling down onto the thing, bringing, and I don't mean contamination, I just mean, yes, perhaps there is some sentience to jet fuel and maybe in the long term as the earth spins and spins, some incorporation of oil and plant matter will happen or something like that. But, um, totally, it just, and I don't, I don't mean to get dark or anything, but I just can't, for the life of me, work out how these two cultures could ever merge in a way that wasn't going to just completely wipe out one or the other. I don't see how, how do we, you know, I don't know if you ever read Guns, Germs, and Steel, but you know, how do you, the power dynamics fucked, man. We've got all the money. We've got all the weapons. We've got all the stuff, you know, and, and, and, uh, I don't know. So I, I mean, I'm not saying we should hermetically seal them or anything like that, just sometimes the, and you wrote about it in the most beautiful way. I think you called the ayahuasca the, oh my God, the diaspora, like the, do you remember that part of your book, the Amazon, the Amazonian diaspora, stretching out into the cities, into the lofts, everywhere. And I found that to be beautiful, but also somewhat sad, like the, like a child's just sending a random message out to the planet, like someone fucking help us. This is, you got to do something like there, there has to be something done more than just, uh, more than what's happening now. I just don't know, possibly understand what that could be. Totally, totally. Yeah. I mean, and there are records that I've read and just stories that I've heard of these communities who many of them, you know, ayahuasca is not celebrated. It's actually put into this context against like capitalism and Nike sneakers and bubblegum and oil extraction. And it's seen as this antiquated vestige of the past that needs to be like literally killed in some cases, you know, and you find these, yeah, oh yeah. Definitely. There are shamans that are killed sometimes in communities by different young folks that are part of that because they're seeing them as tying them down or it's witchcraft or, you know, they're just these old guys that don't know anything and they're working against our interests to develop. Holy shit. You know, because also remember that it's like, it's now, I mean, I work with communities in rainforests now and they, they are integrated into a global economy. There's no like going back, you know, it's, there's no pulling the plug on the thing. And during COVID, I was working on this emergency fund and it was a group of nonprofit organizations and grassroots organizations and everybody came together at the request of all of these indigenous federations that were saying, listen, we just got totally caught off from the global supply chain and we don't have access to the traditional things that we used to have access to. You know, our lands are disappearing. We don't have our traditional agricultural practices and we are kind of cut off and we're about a generation, maybe two or half a generation, depending on where you are in the forest, cut off from that. And in some ways COVID was really beautiful because it supported people in remembering those practices that they need to sustain themselves. But the, the, the acceleration is here, you know, the acceleration is here. So I know I've definitely grappled with that too. You know, feeling very sad, like hearing these stories about these old elders that used to transform into tigers and jaguars and, and, you know, they just were total transcendental masters and they were formally recognized by their peers and every generation that goes by, people are less and less experienced and trained in those ways because there's more distraction in life and they don't have those 25 years of meditation beneath the tree that one might have needed to access those realms. You know, that is the story. So there's a lot, there's a lot to grieve. There's a lot to grieve. And, and I've also like, sorry, please, I just, I just, to the fossil fuels point, I just, you reminded me of this vision that I had years ago. I was in a community that had an oil spill happen in the 19, in 1964. They called it the Chernobyl of the Amazon. It was this, to this day, there are, they're just these swamps of oil. Communities are born with deformity. It's just freaking terrible. There's no way to phrase it in a lighter way. And I was with the medicine and I'm in this moment and I'm just in, I'm, I'm like a seagull in oil. You ever see those images of like the dawn commercials with the birds and the oil? Yeah. I, I am that. And I'm just like, whoa, and I'm, I'm getting crushed between these grinders and we're going in here. And I just had this moment of like, what are fossil fuels? And I'm like, it's the past. It's the past. Like we are sucking the past out of the earth to accelerate the future. And we're just bending time in this way. And we are, we're like accelerating in this lifetime at the expense of the past. But then we're actually eating away at our future. And we just like hit this weird go button. Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah. Terrifying. It's fucking horrible. It's horrible. It is horrible. You were a seagull when you were, when you were having this vision, you were an, an oil encrusted seagull. Yeah. Jesus Christ. I see seagull with these thoughts. Yeah. So I mean, yeah, there's, so I guess, you know, to, to put a bow on it. Put a bow on the oil, die seagull. Fuck the soap. Let's go to oil spills and put bows on it. It's like when I was really underline, they brought bags of candy to oil companies, brought bags of candy to communities who are already diabetic in order to get access to their lands. It's like, are you kidding me? It's terrible. It sucks so hard Duncan. It's so sad. So it's, um, yeah. And like how to, how to sit with that, you know, and then what to do with that. Yeah. I think that that's where, you know, I, I struggled a lot writing this book, One Plant Stream, mostly because I dealt with my own self perception and the idea of other people's perceptions that I would be a colonialist who am I to write about this sort of thing. This has just been an intensely fascinating edge realm for me to dive into. And I hope I've never attempted to speak authoritatively, like as a person, only as a person in this dynamic, you know, ecosystem, it's changing. And when I was younger, when I had my first really deep medicine experiences, one of which was as an iteration of his oil seagull, I had this knowing like literally the best thing that I can do with this incarnation is secure these lands, like make sure that the elders who have this wisdom have that land protected. And I've done everything in my power in this lifetime to work for that because I don't, you know, I don't see myself going to a two week ayahuasca retreat and becoming a shaman and saving the world. Like I'd much rather be trained in the faculties of land protection and, you know, territory monitoring and all these different things. And that for me gives me like a bit of alignment with my Dharma, you know? I got it. Yeah, that's what I got. I didn't get any colonial anything from the book. I've just felt like I was transported to the Amazon. I felt like I was, I mean, that's why, I mean, that's the part that was upsetting to me. It was just like you, you're, you're so good at writing about it. And like, I felt like I was, I've never been there. I felt like I was there. And then it was just a map, like your descriptions of the kids and the dogs and the, it just made me think of my own kids. And then I just, I don't know. I just, I felt like this immense like sadness and sort of like, uh, I don't know, it's like the library, you know, they say the library of Alexandria burned down. There's all these ancient. Don't remind me. Yeah. Ugh. It's such a fucking bummer. Bummer. What was in there? We'll never know. Is it in the Sphinx? Who knows? But it's something similar is happening right now, it seems like. And, and, and it's just the, you know, the, it's the, the, the, the things that are written inside of plants and, and, and sung about you. So yeah, I, to me, there's a, you know, everyone's get, you know, it's all up in arms over book burning. But we don't realize like those are books too. Yes. There's a books and they're just going away. It'll just disappear too, probably. It'll just go away. That thing you just told me about, about, uh, younger people out there just telling shamans to shut the fuck up is really depressing. Yeah. And maybe, but maybe that's just the way it goes. Composed, right? Like, what are you going to cry over? Something else will grow out of it, I guess, right? Something else will grow out of it. And that's why I have really like, you know, I mean, everyone likes mushrooms these days, but I really like mushrooms these days because I do find a kind of redemptive worldview around the idea that like, you know what, they're just going to do the work, they're going to do all of the work. They're going to re-weave the world. And the best we can do is just compost gracefully, you know. I know, eat light and suck dirt. That's just like, eat light and suck dirt. I don't want to suck dirt. What does sucking dirt do? I've never heard that before. Oh, you mean eat light. I thought you meant like eat less food. Now I get it. Sorry. Plants, that's like the play, you know, that's what they do. It's no, I got you. I thought you were saying maybe eat a little less cheeseburgers and suck dirt. It sounds like an insult. Eat light and suck dirt, asshole. Get out of my cab. So, okay, I have. Tell me, tell me about your, this preservation, tell me about this, like, you know, I love the redemptive quality of psychedelics. I love being born again. I love getting high just for no reason at all. But I, and I, I, what, how do we get into like actual real world preservation of these cultures and these places that, you know, to me that the, I think the whole healing thing is fantastic and everyone's into healing and it's like, how many fucking times do you have to heal yourself? But the, to me, the, the, the message in the bottle from these things is, Hey, help, can you help? We need help. Do something. So what does that look like? Pragmatically, what does that look like? Uh, how do we, how do we help for real in a way other than just like, you know, having visions of our ancestors and all that though, I, yeah, et cetera. I mean, I'll refer to my little notebook of life, which is, you know, has a few notes, um, this is just what I've arrived to. I think that we're in an immensely complex world and you find one thing that you really feel moves you and you love and you hope future generations might see. Um, in terms of actual rainforest conservation, which became my go to and not conservation, this is the thing. Like in environmental conservation, traditionally, unfortunately, you actually see really messed up things like Western people coming and saying, this is like public land now. And then dispossessing indigenous peoples who have cultivated, you know, thousands of years of relationship with those landscapes. That's messed up. You know, um, so I've always, I kind of had a sense that basically human, a human rights approach to environmental conservation is the way. So not this kind of authoritative outsider thing, but actually working with communities on the ground to preserve the lands that they depend on and that their stories and memories and myths are woven into. Nobody is more invested in the longevity and happiness of those lands than the people who call them home. And I think that that's a really important thing to remember. Not always, but often. Um, and so for years, I've been working with different organizations in Peru and in Ecuador. And now, uh, I work with an organization called the Rainforest Foundation US. And we do, we take that rights-based approach to defending different rainforests in Central and South America. Um, and the story of how it was founded was kind of funny. Um, it started at a sting concert backstage in the 1980s when these Brazilian activists smuggled in, um, this Rowney chief, chief Rowney, uh, he's this Kayapo indigenous leader, and he has, you know, the large disc plate in the full and feathered regalia. And sting was not expecting that when he went backstage and chief Rowney said to him, Hey, man, like we need help. This was in the 80s, you know, and he was like, okay. So sting worked together with Rowney to protect their lands. And he started the Rainforest Foundation. And so, yeah, pretty far out. That is so far out. So wait, how? Okay. So somebody when they're thinking like, what are we going to do here? They're like, I've got an idea. Take our chief backstage at a sting concert. How did they come to that of all the other for like, why sting? Whose idea was that? I don't know. I have no idea. Was it a dream? Was it a nice batch of Kool-Aid? We'll never know what series of events led to that. But it ultimately led to an area about the size of the state of Pennsylvania being preserved in the Amazon, which is really cool. Yeah. But the analyst, what does that mean preserved though? I'm sorry. What do you mean preserved? Like, what does that actually mean? So it means it's a great question. In this particular case, it's officially demarcated and recognized as indigenous territory. That's what I meant by it. So different communities do have land rights, but what happens often is that they don't have mapping technology to bring forth to federal databases. So federal states or whoever it is will sell concessions to soybean and cattle ranchers or whoever it is. And there's no second record to say, hey, this is actually our traditional land. And those traditional lands do have some internationally recognized rights. So one of the things that we do is work with indigenous communities developing mapping technology and basically working with satellite data. There's this network called Global Forest Watch, which has this amazing live database and you can see actually deforestation all around the world. And we work with communities using smartphone technology and drones. And it's very actual. It sounds kind of complicated, but it isn't that complicated. And when they see deforestation on their land, they can actually check that with Global Forest Watch's data and then they have a case that they can bring two different authorities to report environmental crimes, if that is what happens. Wow. And yeah, that is so high tech. That's wild. Minerals, man. The minerals. I got you. Yeah. Circle. I'm a little slow. Okay. I'm slow. Just on time. I get it now. Right on time. You got it. Kind of neat though, right? So yeah. So you're like, okay, okay. You can kind of see how there's some, there's some coming together. There's some synergy happening here. Yeah. And so there are, you know, we at Rainforest Foundation, we work on the monitoring part, which I mentioned. Then there's also, then there's supporting with capacity building. So a lot of the time you'll have these communities that are like super stoked on defending their territories, but the nature of the 21st century is that we need funding in some cases to get offices, like basic thing materials, like a printer and a computer and different things that you might need to apply for grants or funding that you might need to advance a different project, maybe for solar panels or for, you know, regenerative agriculture projects or for mapping or monitoring or whatever it is that communities feel that they need in order to live a good life and protect their forests. And so we support them in identifying what their needs are and then helping them building out those tools that they need in order to do what they got to do. You know. Wow. So, yeah, and, and we are wading into the waters of blockchain technology and web three, all those words, yeah. And I mean, you know, I am no whiz, but what I do know as somebody that works at a nonprofit is that these institutions and just that concept of philanthropy in general, you know, I hope I don't regret saying this in the future, but it's, it's pretty like people just don't pay tax, rich people don't pay taxes and they just do philanthropy instead, which is like, yeah, okay, I guess, but I mean, it could be improved upon, I think. And, you know, the concept of foreigners coming and helping different people is also like a colonialist reproduction, right? Like how do we move past that? And then there's the whole thing where we're petitioning to large financial institutions that are built off, whose wealth is built off of extractivism and saying, please, can you help us fund, you know, protecting the Amazon? And they're like, sure, let me just give you this money that came out of this oil, right? Whoa, what a Maya over here. Like that is so wild. It is deep. Yeah. So, I mean, so what I've noticed is that I think one of the, one of the really cool things about the funding that we receive in cryptocurrency and, you know, through via blockchain technology is that we suddenly have this stream of income that is unrestricted, meaning that we don't have these big, heavy financial institutions that are looking to have their names embossed in like a gold plaque at a museum saying we did this thing, right? But instead, it's mostly anonymous donations from young people who actually want to see their wealth go towards something that is changing the world. And like on my side, it actually is like we're suddenly getting a really impressive influx of funds that is allowing us to do the urgent work, like literally very urgent work that we need to do. But it's a complicated subject, you know, as there's environmental factors, you have to calculate, there's so much going on there. But that's one thing that I feel interested in and about. So. Incredible. I want to be, I want to help. How do, how do we make an NFT with us, man? I thought NFTs tanked. Didn't they tank? Doesn't that, isn't that done now? Aren't they yesterday, aren't NFTs over? I'll make, I would love to make a rainforest saving NFT. I don't know how, I don't think you're going to get sting level movement from that thing, but we can try. Who knows? Yeah. That's incredible. I'm so happy to meet you and thank you for your time. I, it's such a wonderful thing. You know, just first of all, you're, you're such a good writer and your book is really, really good. I'm so excited to finish it. I love it. And it's so nice to find a book that actually transports you to a place where you're like, I haven't felt that the last time I felt like this reading a book was like McKenna, you know, he could do the same thing where it's just like, holy shit, what is this coming from? So thank you for that. And, um, I really hope that, uh, you'll come back on the podcast. I would love that. Talk more. Yeah. Okay. So much for having me. Will you let people know how they can plug in and, and like connect to not just your book, but to also, uh, the rainforest conservation and what can we do to help totes? All right. So the book for starters is called ayahuasca. It's called when plants dream ayahuasca, Amazonian shamanism and the global psychedelic renaissance. Um, you can type that one into the search places. And then I work with the rainforest foundation us. So we're rainforest foundation.org and you can learn all of that. We have a great stories team. So we have people on the ground reporting and getting really into the nuances and different, you know, updates on the technology, what's working, what isn't working. So if you really want to like learn about that, um, we are also super excited about working with small companies and different projects. And if you have a thing and you want to, you know, contribute some portion of those proceeds to the rainforest and directly to indigenous forest defenders, you can write us and we can do that. Um, and then you can find me just at Sophia Rockland on all of the places where people appear as at. Thank you. Thank you so much.

On stage in a severely underfunded school district where the drama teacher has a meth problem, spent all the drama money on methamphetamine shots to keel it. The night before they began construction of their new set, is that what reality is? In this case, is the art director the Demiurge? And are we doomed to go through infinite renditions of some horrible watered down, duplicated, highly censored, garbage script that maybe at one time was an incredible Broadway show, but now just sucks? And is there potential for liberation from this nauseating eternalism? Today, we're going to find out our wonderful and much esteemed guest. Miguel Conner is an expert in something that I am very interested in and confused by. Gnosticism. Maybe you have listened to his wonderful podcast, Aeon Bite Gnostic Radio. Regardless, you should listen to him now because just maybe he holds the keys to the theater that we are all currently trapped in. Jump right into it, but first this. A tremendous thank you to Squarespace for supporting the sacred, mystical, and potentially spiritually liberating episode of the DTFH. My dear loves, you might recall that the last Squarespace commercial, I mentioned the availability of the domain surprise lotion clown dot com. I was shocked to see that in an age where the surprise lotion clown craze is getting national coverage by the mainstream media and so many people are either thrilled to get a surprise lotion clown. There's a lot of controversy around these lotion clowns whether they're being treated by some of the services that the actual domain name surprise lotion clown dot com had not been scooped up. And I offered it to my listeners and one of my brilliant listeners jumped and went to Squarespace and bought the domain surprise lotion clown dot com and created a beautiful thriving website. A website that is now thriving here. Just listen to this. Yes, my name is Boo's McKenzie. I was trying to schedule a low surprise lotion clown. I'm hoping this will be a surprise. I've been let down by several other lotion clown outfits that have not surprised me. They were very easy to see coming. So I met the grocery store down the street usually every day from five to six. I have my earbuds in so I'm not paying attention and this is definitely not sexual but it is something I would prefer to have happen to me in public or maybe be removed from a public setting and taken somewhere private. I would describe my body as tender and portly and somewhat hairy. Just feel free to return my call at 847. That is about one recording from surprise lotion clown dot com. You go to surprise lotion clown dot com a Squarespace website and you're going to see over 10 at this point passionate request for a surprise lotion clown and that is what we call business, a.k.a. the American dream and it can all be yours by going to Squarespace dot com. Yes, sure, surprise lotion clown dot com is gone but you know what's not gone? Surprise Lotion Clown Controversy dot com. If you wanted to, you could grab it right now and create a website detailing all the controversy surrounding this issue of the surprise lotion clown craze. These clowns are being mistreated by some of these outfits. Some of these clowns are trying to unionize and being actively prevented from doing so by the surprise lotion clown elite cabal that is up until this point at a pretty intense stranglehold on the entire industry until surprise lotion clown dot com came along and I can assure you because I've had communication with the creators of surprise lotionclown dot com that they're treating their clowns ethically.

I think he's a philosopher, philosopher. He's an expert on Gnosticism and Alchemy and Hermeticism and all the topics that I love so much. And I was so lucky to be able to spend an hour with him today asking all the questions I've had for a very long time about Gnosticism. This is one of my favorite podcast episodes in a long time. And I hope you all will stay tuned for today's guest. He is the host of the Aeon Bite Gnostic Radio Show. That's on YouTube. He's got a lovely Twitter at Aeon Bite. That's A-E-O-N-B-Y-T-E.

Miguel Conner. Welcome. Welcome on you. As you are with us. Shake hands. No need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the DTFH. Miguel, I'm so excited to have you on the show. Thank you so much for being here. How you doing? I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. As I've been preparing for our conversation today, I find myself in a wonderful predicament, which is I have so many things I want to ask you. I don't know where to start. So I guess I'm going to start with the most boring mundane, but I think essential question for folks listening who aren't familiar with Gnosticism at all or have only vaguely heard of it. Can you give us an extremely brief history of Gnosticism? Because I'd rather get into the philosophy, and I know the philosophy and history intertwine, but it'd be nice to have a little background to use as the diving board that we're going to jump in to the subject from. Whoo. Yeah. Let's see. The elevator pitch. I'm trying to sell you on these evil heretics 2,000 years ago whose philosophy seems very more relevant than ever. I'm sure as we'll talk about. I guess to start as a good baseline or foundation, I would tell your audience, think of the movie The Matrix. That right there is a modern Gnostic gospel of any of your audience likes Philip K. Dick. Gnosticism hugely influence them. And if your audience likes the ideas of Carl Jung, you've got Gnosticism. Maybe on something even more modern, I'm starting to realize the Matrix is getting kind of dated for like Zoomers and so forth. But then think of the Lego movie or the TV series Westworld or the recent film Bliss or something like that. But in short, the Gnostics were a movement that started or actually I would say gain maturity about 2000 years ago and sort of branched out into two ways. One is the pagan heretics and the other is the Christian Gnostics probably both started in Alexandria, Egypt, that great metropolis where all these ideas sort of stood and so much speculation. We got the Neoplatonist mystic Hellenistic Jews, just a Coptic Christians. Great, but the Gnostics really caused a stir in the nascent Christian religion because they posited that we lived in a simulation as my friend Gordon White said, the Gnostics didn't say we lived in a false world because that idea definitely appears in the East. Here in the West, the Gnostics said, no, the idea is not false. This is a faked world. We are trapped in a world that's been coded on purpose to keep us humans here, the concept of the prison planet. And we are here because of something that we have. We have something called a divine spark as the Gnostics called it 2000 years, call it the soul, human consciousness. And this sort of divine spark fuels the very, in some texts, the very universe that we live in. And who trapped us here? The Gnostics, they had varying ideas. The heretics really were more positive. That matter just fell in love with this divinity and brought us down. And here we are sort of understanding each other. But the Christian Gnostics had a lot of harsher grim. They foresaw like there was this pre-cosmic cataclysm. And basically in short, as a scholar Stephen Davis said, God went crazy and became us. Part of his essence fell into the universe and was coveted by these soulless mechanical beings that they call the Demiurge and his Archons. And the Gnostics associated the Demiurge with the God of the Old Testament because they said there's no way this dude is the father of Jesus. This guy is bad news. But they also associated the Demiurge with other gods like Zeus or Saturn or Cyrus. And they trapped our cosmic divine spark here to feed on us. So us as humans, we had a duty, or for some of us humans, the ability to wake up and realize that we had a shard of divinity, a shard of eternity within us. And we could basically awaken this cosmic divinity like Neo in the Matrix taking the red pill. And we could commune with this, as they called it, God above God. Some of the Gnostics called this God above God a Braxess who makes an appearance in the Midnight Gospel. Yes. So we could be awakening by the teachings and facilitation of this Gnostic Revealer like Morpheus in the Matrix. Morpheus' job is to sort of help Neo sort of get himself to becoming the one. We can all become the one. The Gnostics saw this Gnostic Revealer as often as Jesus. They didn't see Jesus as sort of saving us from our sins but waking us up to our true nature to be able to escape the wrath of the Archons here in this simulation. But they had other Gnostic Revealers, Mary Magdalene, Sophia, Simon Magus. Some Gnostics saw the Buddha and Zoroastra as Gnostic Revealers. And they could facilitate, which you might call Arnosis, a central point of the Gnostics, which is this direct experiential knowledge and connection with this God above God, this higher consciousness, and also a revelation of this false world that we are trapped in. And this knowledge always seemed in their texts like this ritual, this astral travel ecstatic ritual. One thing about the Gnostics is they were an ecstatic shamanistic movement. You had to bring yourself into an altered state of consciousness. But at the same time, it's also a mode of self-knowledge. Self-knowledge is very important. Again, that scholar Stephen Davis said, my salvation is the same as God's psychotherapy. If I go in and touch upon my divine spark and get rid of all the deprogramming and the false layers of who I am and make contact with my inner God, it's the same as if I took some shamanistic outer journey beyond the stars. So Gnosis was very important to the Gnostics. I think that's a good summary and you can break down other things like divine spark, reincarnation, how they deconstructed texts, other things you might want to touch upon. But it's a good summary of who the Gnostics were. That is the best summary I've ever heard of Gnosticism. Thank you. For the listeners, I know there might be a lot there for you to unpack, but I think you probably gathered from it why I love Gnosticism and it will probably be perpetually confused by it. So here's a really blasphemous question for you and hopefully after hearing your description of Gnosticism, people will even get the question, you've heard of the game Fuck Mary Kill. No, I have not. So it's like Fuck Mary Kill. If you had these people to choose from, let's say Donald Trump, the Loch Ness Monster, Santa Claus, you got to fuck one, marry one, kill one, what do you pick? So Fuck Mary Kill, the Demiurge, Abraxas, Sophia, which one do you fuck? Which one do you marry? Which one do you kill? All right. Well, you want to fuck Sophia. You want to... Why? Why fuck Sophia? Because Sophia in the Gnostic text, she is a part of God's mind that got lost in the matter. She is the divine goddess that's here to help us remember who we are, even though in some texts she is the reason why the universe fell. She is the disobedient part of God. The Gnostic saw God as a giant mind, this incredible mind that had all these features, truth, faith, honor. Sophia Wisdom was one of them, and she is... She rebelled because, as some said, she is wisdom. She can't just be static in this timeless realm. She has to experience the world because Wisdom wants to experience, wants to know, some get pretty gritty, some think that she actually... She wanted to have an orgasm by herself because she was a woman. She's Luciferian, and she wanted to sort of rebelled and go on her own way, so she falls into the world and she does give birth to the Demiurge. I think your questions might be hard because if I eff Sophia, her son is going to be furious with me. He's going to piss off the Demiurge! Yeah, exactly, the supreme being of this universe. So Sophia is a very mercurial, enigmatic figure. Obviously, the Gnostics based it. If you look at some parts of the Old Testament, the Book of Wisdom and others, you will find, in Proverbs, you'll find this figure called Wisdom that doesn't seem like a metaphor. She's there with God at the beginning of time. She's there creating with God. So the Gnostics look at the Old Testament and say there's this fallen Wisdom. Even the Book of Enoch says Wisdom came to the world of men and nobody... everybody rejected her and she had to go to a cloud. So they assumed this enigmatic figure was Wisdom and they made her part of their myths and their narrative. And of course, it's a great metaphor for we need to find our Wisdom in our mind so that we can become sane just as God needs his Wisdom to come back to this eternal realm so it can become sane. It's like God has gotten lost in some kind of mirror or something. Like God looked into something and has become completely like fractalized within that thing. And we're all this strange reflection of a... But how is this possible? How is it possible that a Braxis or whatever the like outside the matrix, you know, progenitive force, how is it possible that a thing that is the source should become lost within the reality that emerged from it? Well, that's a great question everybody's been asking, right? And the Gnostic certainly speculated in their texts, different ideas. And this, remember, from the Christian and the Hermetic Gnostics, even though it was persecuted and died out through our history, it did manifest through the Cathars, the Muslims, Sufis, the Jewish Kabbalists, the Persian, Mazdikites, and this Gnostic stream always has existed throughout history, but it's just so edgy because when you tell people this world is a prison, all your churches and institution and governments are controlled by these archons, the very David Ike we're getting, right? David Ike does create sort of a modern Gnostic myth. It doesn't go well with the powers that be, but underground the Gnostics have always been able to thrive, but very edgy. But they had different explanations. I mean, as some have said, as soon as you have, let's say, in Hinduism, you have that with the Brahmin vision, as soon as consciousness asks a question, who am I? What am I? The answer is going to appear, right? Like, I am the Great Conscious. I already become fragmented. I am eternity. I am this. As soon as you become fragmented, you're already losing something, or you're also casting a shadow because as soon as you say, I am good, there has to be a response in the cosmic mind. Well, what the hell is evil? Or you have to speculate, what is evil? What would evil look like? So these were the answers that as soon as the cosmic consciousness became aware, we had to happen. Evil had to happen and we had to be trapped. Others were more Zoroastrian. They said, no, no, that's bullshit. There's always been light and darkness. That's a principle of reality. So therefore, as soon as light starts to stir, darkness is going to wait for its turn to fight. The Christian Gnostics again had this idea that wisdom, because they were so dependent on the Jewish scriptures, they were dependent on the goddess Ashira of the old Hebrews and a segment of the Egyptian. They said, no, wisdom rebelled and that caused a collapse. So they speculated, but again, these myths are trying to explain an existential truth, like the Neoplatonists and the Greek philosophers. They never said this was literal, but they said this is as close as we're going to get. That feeling that, where am I? You know, the truth in our monkey brains. We're never going to find out on this level of consciousness, Duncan. So best we have is myth. You know, I'm talking Joseph Campbell, that myths are the closest thing to point to a transcendental truth. I want to thank Shutter for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Shutter is the network that just gets better and better and better because every month they release new, incredible horror content. And this month you're going to get slash or comedy, vicious fun about a horror movie critic who stumbles into a support group for serial killers featuring anchors, man's David Kekner, who I have seen live many times and is a hilariously brilliant actor, comedian, genius. Kekner, yes, I'm name dropping. Also this month you could check out Sun, where Halloween's Andy Matachak plays a mother who will stop at nothing to save her mysteriously ill young son from a cult she believes is trying to kidnap him. That actually happened to me in real life. And Kendisha, the latest from Inside's Alexandra Bustillo and Julian Mori about a trio of teen girls who accidentally invoke a vengeful demon. That happened to me too. Yeah, sure, look, you could go scraping around the internet looking for good horror titles like one of those sad people at the beach with a metal detector looking for lost wedding rings or you could save yourself a lot of time and just subscribe to Shutter.

That used to make me shit hot bricks of fear fire anytime I ended up in a lake when I was a kid. Thank you so much, Shutter, for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. One of the many things I love about Gnosticism is that it is where my mind goes when I'm taking like a very powerful psychedelic. There is a sense of a kind of catastrophic situation that has happened where these two things that maybe were never supposed to meet have come together and can't sort themselves out in any kind of harmonious way and it is producing this feedback loop of suffering that we find ourselves within. You know, I don't want that to be the case, but that has been an experience I've had more than a few times on a variety of psychedelics. Just as though this horrible, never-ending debate has been going on between matter and spirit and it can't work itself out. It just keeps going and going and going and somehow we've become swirled into that. We're the battleground for it. Each one of us is the battleground of heaven and hell or matter and spirit or whatever animal and God. And so you would expect, if this were the case, it would have to appear in every work of art, every story, everything. In the way that fish are wet, you would expect some strand of this to make its way into just about everything. Maybe you can help settle an argument, but I was telling my wife, I think Mary had a little lamb. Is some kind of Gnostic him or something? And then she Googles like, no, it's not. It was 1800s it came from. But have you ever thought of the words of Mary had a little lamb from the perspective of Gnosticism? And please, I will not be offended if you just say it. Next question. No, I honestly have. And for some reason I'm thinking of William Blake and his Tiger Tiger and the Lamb of God. William Blake was hugely influenced by Gnosticism. So we might have to find a compromise in the forest of the night. Now let me just read Mary had a little lamb to you because sometimes I forget. I don't have it memorized. I have more William Blake memorized than Mary had a little lamb, but one second, I want to look it up. It's a nursery rhyme. Again, I'm sorry, y'all. I know we have a great mind with us today. I'm sorry for doing fuck Mary kill in advance and I'm sorry for this, but I do think there's a connection. Mary had Mary had a little lamb. His fleece was white as snow and everywhere the children went that lamb was sure to go. He followed her to school one day. Wait, this is a some guy. Of course, someone had to do a revision of it. I have to look at Mary. Oh, my God, revision or something. Yeah, somebody did it like someone decided they're going to do the point is Mary had a little lamb. His fleece is white as snow followed her to school one day. It goes something over the lines of it made the children laugh and play. And then the teachers turned it out. And so I've heard that the holy shit is the little lamb. Is that Sophia is mayor or, you know, the the the the liberating Gnostic energy is school. The Archons or the teachers, the Archons casting out the light. And did that make its way into nursery rhymes? I don't know. But to me, that is obviously the matrix is one of the is the great modern example. To me, that seems to be a subliminal. I don't know description of this situation, which is this the light of God comes into the world. Book of John. The in the beginning was the word. The word was made flesh. The darkness didn't understand it. I think is how it goes. Something like that. You know, I don't know. What do you think? No, no. You hit it on the head because a the Gnostics were the first to write commentary on the Gospel of John. And many have said it's so Gnostic because this Jesus is very the Gnostic saw Jesus as having superpowers. He shapes shifter and he could walk through walls and he's sort of this this amazing being. And you look at the Gospel of John and the message and it's it gets very Gnostic. Now, as far as Mary, you're 100 percent right. And this is another important element. The Gnostics, again, they didn't just pull stuff out of their ass. They were looking at all the great minds. One of them was obviously Plato. If you look at the allegory of the cave, that's a Gnostic myth and what 300 BC were trapped in a cave. And we don't these people, these archons are putting shadows and one of us can escape to the light and come warn others. Why are you trapped in looking at shadows instead of seeing? So the Gnostics saw that these great minds were giving Gnostic hints and truths. And then they just sort of they really brought it into maturity with the Christian Gnostics and the Hermetics. But one of Plato's ideas, the fall of the soul and its adventure in through the spheres and into matter. That's what Plato said. The soul falls and it falls in our body. We are in the material world in Greek and in Judah in Hebrew. The soul is feminine. So this great story is clothed as this heroine who falls. But it's always this powerful story about Sophia falling into the world and how she's going to get out. You see that some have said that the Odyssey Helen of Troy is the soul falling into the clutches of she's the lamb falling into the classroom. But it's Troy. You look at Alice in Wonderland, a great Gnostic Neoplatonic tale. Alice falls from a real world into Wonderland. What does the caterpillar tell Alice? You are a terribly real thing in a terribly fake world. And that's why you are in so much pain because she's the lost soul. Wizard of Oz right there. Dorothy falls into this fake world of Arkons, you know, fake money and witches. And the wizard is sort of the great symbol for the Demiurge because he's just another materialistic, profiteering person. So this idea of the soul falling in feminine, yeah, Mary, Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy, you see it over and over through literature, art and movies. It's such a terrifying way of looking at the world. It creates the possibility for a real kind of paranoid way of looking at just about everything. I've been there. I know a lot of people listening have been there. Those moments where maybe you're too high, maybe you're just having a bad day and you look around and you think this shit isn't fucking real. Like not it's not whatever this is isn't anything at all. It's it's fake as fuck. And then you get, you know, anytime you meet anyone flipping out, it's a very common. Like in the Truman Show when the light falls, you know, from the sky or he looks over and he sees the engineers. Yes. That's a very Gnostic film. And we all feel it. I have a question for you. This is something in my exploration of my contemplation of Gnostic ideas. The idea of this dimmy urge, this being and correct me if I'm wrong, the dimmy urge is jealous of the progenitor. And in that jealousy sees this like actual real reality and synthesizes it. That's what we're in the synthetic version. We're in like the shitty like amusement park version. We're like in a low level Disney where the thing trying to be Disney world is never going to be Disney world, but it's trying to be the creepy fair or whatever. That's what we're in. Now, but this is something that I was thinking of. And this is something that really gave me the chills. Have you considered or have the Gnostics written anything about the possibility that we are the dimmy urge? The reason we're here is not because we're souls that have been trapped within matter, but that we are the dragon thing. And the only way to protect the rest of whatever the rest of everything is from us is to keep us mesmerized and eternally trapped with our own narcissistic interaction with our own identity. Oh, yeah. I mean, what did the hermetic say as above so below? We are what happens in heaven corresponds on earth and Philip K. Dick was the one who said, yeah, you may think of Arkons, but we are the true Arkons. We give our consent. We dilute ourselves. We project outward. Some have said the demure just simply our human faulty way of seeing God. As soon as we change our attitude on what God is, then we see the real God. But of course, that takes wisdom. So that is definitely possible. I mean, we could be, we could be maybe we sent ourselves down to play a role in a video game. You know, our true selves are up there and we've said, OK, you're going to forget Miguel and Duncan are going to forget who we really are. We're going to be down as meat sacks and this, you know, dimensional this video game talking on a podcast for points. So that's another possibility. Well, as I always tell, yeah, I always tell people. Yeah. If you want these days when people ask me what nonsense I said, think of a simulation theory as Elon Musk and Neil deGrasse Tyson and others have said again. Nobody in Western history really talked about simulation theory except the Gnostics 2000 years ago and probably Plato and through with his allegory of the cave. And then change that to and then mix that with cosmic horror. Lovecraft. What does it say? We're not alone in the universe, but what's with us is far more powerful, probably indifferent or made us and wants to eat us. And if you step too far from the road, if you explore too far, if you ask too many questions, go too high in the sky. These giant supernatural things, these lizard people, these archons, they're just going to eat you even if we're already. They created us and we're already their food. Combine them and you've got a good model for Gnosticism, except Gnosticism is not nihilistic. It's more Christian existentialist. We it's almost hopeless. But at the end of the day, we have the power if we wake up. But this is what I want to really want to get to, which is that part of it. I mean, this this is of all the of all the aspects of Gnosticism have confused me the most. It's the Gnosis part. Is it enlightenment? Is this the Gnosis equivalent to Eastern ideas of enlightenment? Well, I mean, there are parallels between Buddhism and Gnosticism. That's it's pretty apparent, the illusionary world, how the self is almost unknowable, reincarnation, a deep sense of introspection. But Gnosis to start with, as somebody said wisely, it's not the result. It's what brings a result. When Neo takes the red pill, that's it. That's Gnosis. He sees the world as it is. And Morpheus says you're the one, but he still has got to do the work. You still have to do the rituals to bring about your divine spark and reconnect it with the alien God so that in communion, you become fully divine. And what's interesting, what's misrepresented about the Gnostics is people say, well, they're just spiritual bypassers. They wanted to do these rituals and fly away to beyond the universe and commune with God and forget it. Now, they wanted to be transformed into fully humans to help the world. As one scholar called the Gnostics, they were Christian bodhisattvas. To be fully human is to be fully divine, the Gnostics said. And you're not fully human unless you're down here helping others. They believed in healing, good works, trying to wake others up. Like, you know, hey man, can you wake up? Let's do these rituals. So Gnosis, as you might say, the entire process. But at the end of the day, that feeling of ecstasy, pure joy, that's indescribable. There's no name for that. I mean, salvation, I don't know. Samadhi. Yeah, yeah, it's... Now, these rituals, I'm not familiar with any Gnostic rituals or what does this look like? Were they taking some kind of psychedelic? Is Kaikyan and the Illusian mysteries, is this wrapped up in it? Yeah, good point. If you look at the rituals, many are very similar to what we know of the mystery religions. That idea of ego death, like the Freemasons where they bury you in a coffin. Or as you go down to Hades, I don't know if you've done ayahuasca. But one of the first things about ayahuasca is that every fear, every insecurity has gets thrown at your face a thousand times. You want to die. You feel like you are in the pit of a grave. And these rituals by the Gnostics were like that. It seems that you're going down to hell. Demons are tearing you apart. And you were able to withstand it, but it's all ego death. It's your ego just being torn apart. When it's completely torn apart, then these rituals, which they probably reenacted, would send you up to heaven and through this star portal. And in the rituals that we know, there was ointments. There was drinks. Some church fathers said when the Gnostic, like this guy Marcus the Magician, he would put like some herbs and it would change and they would drink it. And the women would just change. They were stoned. And so then you go through these rituals where you sort of awaken. I'm sorry, what do you mean they would change? They're consciousness. Yeah, they were high. They're consciousness or their bodies? No, they're conscious. They were an altered state of consciousness. And then you would have these ecstatic flights. And again, when I did ayahuasca, I did leave my body a few times. But you would be armed with these passwords because to the Gnostics, it was like a video game. Every level of heaven or the dimensions, some of them had like 365 dimension, each ruled by an archon. You had to give this archon your password or a magical word so you could then go and make contact with the supreme mind and come down and be more fulfilled or individuated each time. Now that's just one rituals because some Gnostics as they've proposed, the Gnostics were so there were such anarchists that they divided into lodges. Something that the religion started with ancient Egyptian priests who were kind of disillusioned with the Roman Empire who brought these ancient mysteries to like dissatisfied Jews or pagans and they started talking and doing these rituals. That's how Gnosticism started because the ancient ancient Egyptian mysteries do have a lot of Gnostic elements and of course they added their own ideas. But the important thing as some scholars have said and that confuses people is that first comes the Gnosis. It's like, oh my God, I realize there's something wrong with the world. I feel something stirring. But what am I going to do about it? Well, I need to find the rituals or the people that can facilitate this Gnosis. So therefore you have a varied group or catalog of rituals. Some Gnostics would do sex magic. Others would do sacramental practices in Rome. Others would do dancing or mystery religions. That's why people have called Gnosticism a parasite religion because it sort of infiltrates different religions like the Sufis in Islam or the Christian Gnostics in Rome because they wanted to absorb the rituals of different cultures and use them and adopt them into their own practices. But they always involved altered states of consciousness, ecstatic feelings and so forth. So the Sufis, the dancing dervishes that right there is a way you just slam coffee and you dance until you just feel Allah coursing through you. So that's what confuses people why the Gnostics had such varied rituals. But that's because as they came to different parts of the world, they needed to sort of find what was going on in the culture that they could adopt. Obviously the mystery religions, ones that I've told you are from the early times in Alexandria. There's another one where simply doing contemplation until you have Gnosis. And you just start thinking about the material world. You start analyzing yourself until you start feeling something stirring in altered states of consciousness. There were some groups of Gnostics that would just sit in a group and tell each other problems. 2000 years ago they're doing group therapy. They're like, my emotions are broken. I need healing. I'm trauma. Carl Jung did call the Gnostics history's first depth psychologist because they saw our mind as the mind of God and they would really explore who we were very deeply. And they were into dreams, altered states of consciousness and just human development. Do you ever worry that technology or the potential of some technological superintelligence is a way for these archons to go from being a kind of what's it called an egregore, or an invisible thing to a visible ruling force? Does that ever creep in when you're considering the hockey stick that we're looking at, that Ray Kurzweil and the transhumanists talk about? Oh shit, the AI is the archon descending or appearing to like, you know, finish the job to eliminate the last flickering bit of hope that will ever be able to achieve this Gnosis that produces the potential for liberation. Yeah, that's well said and I would agree. I mean, the archons are depicted as mechanistic, animalistic, soulless. They could easily, they sound almost like AI or some sort of machine. And of course that's exactly their goal is, is the complete snuffing of human awareness. It even says, I think in the Gospel of Philip, the mother of all sins is ignorance. To the Gnostics, that was the worst sin because anybody who's connected with themselves and consciousness will be a good person because that's really the natural state of a human being. You know, dogs don't do stupid things to each other. They follow their nature so the pack will survive. Human beings awake are going to be doing good and working together and be full of empathy. That's what Philip K. Dick called the divine spark. Empathy, I mean, that's something that's very rare in the universe and the archons, their job is to stifle our awareness, make us machine like, make us asleep so they can keep feeding. They're feeding off of us and that's always, that's always been their goal and they have different ways, obviously, in their texts. Sometimes it's, they talk about the Garden of Eden as an evil place because in the Gnostic texts, Adam and Eve are trapped there and Jesus has to turn into the serpent to wake them up. He's like, look, all these fruits and beautiful things, that's what's keeping you trapped. Wake the fuck up and we can look right now, our phones and social media and all this bullshit dividing, conquer stuff you see on the internet and from politicians. It can be something materialist that makes us fall asleep, but also they use fear. One thing the Archons love to do and very much in the text is they love to rape. And this is the great analogy. They love to take away our agency. They love to make us fearful and they love to make sure that we disassociate with our own consciousness and fragment until we have no idea who we are. So yeah, as above so below, I would say AI, transhumanism is a great reflection of the Archons up there and the Gnostics would be horrified at it. They'd be like, fuck this. But you know what, I feel like with any of, you know, with transhumanism in particular, I've got many transhumanist friends. I just did the Singularity University podcast. I love Ray Kurzweil and I think that transhumanism and all of the technological incoming technological realities do prevent, do present the possibility of, you know, going even deeper into the never ending fractalizing quagmire of the material universe, but potentially another avenue for liberation that you can't have like what you were saying in the beginning. If you're going to have some self-reflective consciousness and then that's going to create the never ending iteration that we call reality, then within that you're always going to have the thing in its opposite, the dialectic or whatever. And so potentially transhumanism, yeah, definitely it could be the thing where death, like that's what I love about Gnosis and it flips everything on its head. Like Christians hearing like, what are you talking about? Jesus was not the serpent friend, you know, that Gnosticism, and I think this is why the early Christians were like, fuck you Gnostics, right? I read that much of what we know about Gnosticism is from the early Christians bitching about Gnosticism and why it's wrong. But I think Christians might say, look, you're going to get Christianity and the first thing that's going to happen is the devil is going to take that pure, beautiful, very clear, all of it totally makes sense and warp it and turn it into something confusing. It's like the most confusing shit already that no one needs to do anything to it. But you know, I love your YouTube channel and you know, I've learned a lot from it. You know, I would like one thing I love, this is an old one from 2014 and I'm sorry, I can't remember the guess. But you know, you were talking about the Garden of Eden and you were talking about the weirdness of that story and he was saying, look, if you want to, you know, accept the Garden of Eden as it is in the Christian book of Genesis, you got to do some heavy fucking lifting for that shit to work because you've got a deceptive God, a plural deceptive God, they're saying we, they've become like us. Who's the we? Who's the us? Who's the thing that came down and we're with the daughters of men? What the fuck is any of that shit? And it's in the very first book of the Bible that's in the churches where people are like, this is totally normal, totally normal. It's totally normal that God would keep us in a garden and lie to us that the tree would kill us. It didn't kill us. So, yeah, I mean, I'm going to side with the Gnostics when they're like, you're supposed to think that's fucked up. You're supposed to hear that story and be like, what's, why would you do that to us? Why would you put the tree there? As kids, I question it. Didn't you question it? When you're like, hmm, I'm going to get slapped for us, but I'm going to side with Adam and Eve on this one and the snake. Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly. I mean, that's the forbidden words. God, I mean, I remember in my, I grew up in Western North Carolina and I remember in our algebra class, the algebra teacher taking a little break from teaching its math and deciding to like go into how a snake can talk. And yeah, and there's nothing in the, that the snake is Satan that was added later on. And then the flood story right there. I mean, I used to be, I was very lucky. My mom was a very progressive Catholic and read Joseph Campbell. So she was like, oh, these are just myths of ancient people. But because that'd be like, you know, God is, he's drowning the sinners, but what about the babies in the kittens? What did they ever do to God? What a monster. It just made no sense. The unicorns. You dread the dinosaurs. He drowned the dinosaur. The dinosaurs, unicorns, the Sasquatch. God only knows. I'm sure there's a God literally only knows. I'm sure there's a plethora of adorable mythological creatures that got drowned because God was mad. In a few dumbasses. Or they got eaten in the Ark. Noah got hungry and, you know, ate all the, the griffins or something. The fucking gnomes. You found out the gnomes taste like chocolate. You know, started going down there in the middle of the night when he couldn't sleep. Chomped up some gnomes. But, um, you know, I love this. I love this verse. You know, Jacob's ladder, by the way, another glorious Gnostic parable in cinema. If you haven't seen it, y'all, it's amazing. The original, I think they remade it, but the original is incredible. And his, you know, chiropractor is an angel. I was just going to mention that. Yeah, that's it. That's it. The back adjustment. He, this is my first encounter with Meister Eckhart was from his chiropractor and Jacob's ladder where he says the part of the soul that burns in hell is the part that clings to life. And wrapped up in that to me is the idea that if you want this grand reunion with the original Preginative Force, there's a price and the price is everything. Everything. You have to let go of all of it completely. You can't hold on to this world at all. Amen. And yes, that's, that's what I love the Gnostics because of they took a really hard stance against evil and suffering very much like the Buddhists. They said, no, we're drawing the line. Like you said, there is only one way to become who we really are. And we just got to let go. That's the only way as the guy says in the movie, those, those demons will turn into angels. You got to let go. And most religions, oh no, materialism is okay. Everything's going to be fine. Oh, evil is the absence of good and we're going to be saved. The Gnostics and to an extent the Buddhists were like, no, we're punk rockers. We're going to spiritual war and we are not compromising one inch with you with the world with everything. We're getting the fuck out of here. What does it look like? What to you? What does that look like from in the times that we're in now? What is that level of letting go look like? Well, I don't think it has to look like anything. I mean, yes, if you look historically, the Gnostics were part of the community. They were going to the universities. They were learned men and women. They're far more accepting of women. But again, it's your attitude. It's who you are. It's nothing. It's almost like it's nothing you're going to do. And it's your ideas that are going to make you dangerous. I mean, you look, for example, the Cathars, the famous medieval heretics that Dan Brown made famous and have been part of lore in Europe. They were very Gnostic and they would go around in southern France talking about they switched the Demiurge to Satan. But they said, no, this world is ruled by Satan. You got to give up your material possessions when you're ready. That's all they always said. If you want to be part of the inner circle, when you're ready, you join us. But they would go preaching this existential crazy edgelord kind of shit and they were beloved by the people in southern France. The Catholics loved them. They were protected by the Knights Templar and everything. So my point is that sometimes it's not so much what you're doing is how your ideas are affecting people and are affecting others because the Cathars became an existential threat to the church, just like the Gnostics. And they had to bring down the weight of the church and of political power in Europe to take them down. The Inquisition started with the Cathars and then moved on to women and Jews and other people. So it's your ideas that are going to change the world because if you have the mind of God, Duncan, then you are endless imagination. You are bottomless innovation. You are just exploring. You are an artist creating just new reality and greater realities. That's how you change things. You make the universe a more beautiful place, a different place, but that's going to piss off the archons. And as soon as you have those ideas, they're going to come after you hard. To me, when I'm thinking of this, it feels like there's a weird pathway here for lack of a better word, transcendence. This kind of like just waking up, completely waking from the material universe and being home. The wonderful thing that happens when you have the shitty dream where you're being mauled by a bear and then you remember, oh, I'm having a dream. And then you're like, oh, I'm just being mauled by a bear. It's a dream. And then you wake up and you forget about it. It's just done. To me, and I think the spiritual bypass critique maybe is related to the sense that there is this possibility of not, you know, they say in the world, but not of the world. But it feels like in Gnosticism, there's this idea of like, actually, you could actually not be in the world. You can go and gain this power from the God, this remembrance of who you used to are. But your job is still in the world. Again, I call him Christian Bodhisattvas. It's almost like either we all get out or none of us get out. You're here in the wheel and it even talks. There's a book called The Secret Book of John and Jesus says, no, if you start waking up, look for somebody who's more advanced than you in lifetimes. And hang on to his robe or have him teach you how to wake up further. So the Gnostics did have sort of this Christian idea where you really had to help people, whether it's helping the poor in the material world or helping others try to wake up. There was never that idea of spiritual bypass. If anything, you look at the early Christian church, the Desert Fathers and the monks in the Byzantine Empire. They're the ones that would go into caves or on top of trees or monasteries and starve themselves and we must be holy and piety. The Gnostics were the ones like, no, we need to be out with the people and connect with them at their level and great myth and stories that they'll understand and try to help them wake up. Whoa! That's so intense. So what you're saying, it makes me think, oh yeah, they didn't go anywhere. They're here just as much as they ever were, but the way that we know them is through all the art that gives that fluttering feeling in your chest. Where you're like, wait, no, that's more than just a movie. I'm sorry, it might be cheesy and honestly, I'm so sick of people saying it's like the fucking Matrix. Honestly, it's like so annoying. I know it's like the goddamn Matrix. That's why it's a great fucking movie. It's so annoying. It's the most powerful modern myth we have today. It used to be like the Wizard of Oz, every analogy when we were young was the Wizard, even though the Wizard of Oz is Gnostic. People relate to the Matrix because as a myth, I think we all know it's kind of true. What does Morpheus say? You know there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is. It's like a splinter in your mind driving you. It's the most popular myth today because all of us subconsciously know it's true. You know that song, Leonard Cohen, Everybody Knows? He was influenced by Kabbalah, so we all know unconsciously that the game is rigged, the dice was loaded from the start, and we are trapped and I think as humans, beings, we're never going to be satisfied where we are. Maybe we are aliens because we're always looking for something else. So it's like something else, it's not just a phantasmal aspiration. It's a legitimate homesickness, but the kind of homesickness you get when you have amnesia, I guess. Bingo. I don't know what I'm fucking homesick for, but I miss it so much. Yeah, there's a saying by this Egyptian writer called Naguib Mahfos, and it says, home is not where you are born. Home is where all your attempts to escape cease. And as humans, we're always trying to escape something. Some of us are misguided and we escape through material things, TV, sex. Others still feel that our home is just somewhere else and we're always trying to escape. I don't think we humans belong, but we can be good caretakers of the cosmos even if we're trapped. Whoa, that's so beautiful. So the invitation is not to escape, the invitation is to be here and find out a way to articulate this truth so that it inspires other people. Exactly. Wow. Yeah, even Joseph Campbell used to say, and he's obviously going with Hinduism and Advita Vedanta, but he used to say, yes, the universe is a whore. Anybody who says that it isn't is completely delusional. What did somebody say? The first sound of the universe was an om, it was munch. I mean, who the hell created a universe where everything has to eat something to survive? That's demented. It's demented. A universe of viruses and death and Taylor Swift. I mean, it's just demented. And Joseph Campbell, you say that. Yeah, the universe is a whore, but you got to be okay with it. In fact, you got to embrace it. You got to say, this is bad. I accept it. In fact, I love it. And let's work together to make it better. That's that if, yes, I think that prescription is ruins the entire game. If the if the game is one of fractalization or division or infinite, constant, schizoid, never ending shattering, then that's the only way that would stop it is you just it's God, what is it that my meditation teacher, I'm sorry, David, if you are listening this because I totally ruin what you miss quote and then it's going to get on social media and they'll get misquoted more. It's from a Buddha scripture. It's the idea that, oh God, I'm sorry. I forget. I forget. I even mentioned David. It's the idea that everything is already broken. It's broken beyond repair. It was broke a long time ago. And so like going around and like doing this, you know, the sad thing or something that someone loves shatters on the ground and they're like, oh my God, get the pieces and the glue and we'll get it back to where it was. And but it keeps breaking and breaking and it's just it's broken. Just enjoy how beautiful the little bits of glass look when they're shining in the light. And that's the best you can do. And maybe in there, the frenzied, never ending attempt or shift damn thing around so it makes sense ceases and then some peace comes. Right. Is that is that the idea? I think so. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, just accept everything's broken. I think the Gnostics people ask when the end of the world is the Gnostics said, no, the end of the world already happened once God fragmented and became crazy. That was Armageddon and we're sort of floating in the flotsam and Jetsam of this. And we've got to swim back to the beginning. Even Philip K. Dick used to say how Simon Megas and Paul and Buddha, they were actually traveling backwards in time and said with us humans because they wanted to get to the beginning. One thing that the Gnostics were obsessed with what's why they were called Debs psychologists is they always wanted to go back to the Garden of Eden to history to their own past because I know we live in a time that says, oh, live in the present, blah, blah, blah. But the truth is, all of us, each one of us has an amazing amount of trauma. Even if you don't have trauma, we've got ancestral trauma. We've got our country's trauma. We've got the God's trauma. So they thought they wanted to go back to find out what had happened and understand it and in a strange way rectify it, even if it was just sort of fiction or trying to write about was it. I mean, what does the story Pinocchio says? If you want to find the end, go back to the beginning and pretend that's in Pinocchio. In the Gospel of Thomas, the apostles ask him, well, how do we know how the end is? And Jesus says, the end, if you want to know the end, go to the beginning and you will rule over all. So in other things, again, they were like history's first depth psychologists. And again, that's why I liked them because I got tired of these religions saying, well, live in the present. How come I've got all this trauma as a kid? I mean, I've got all this shadow and versions and dreams and unconscious behavior. I'm like, I keep getting in the same fight with my wife and it reminds me of my dad. So I don't want to live in the present anymore. I want to find out how I got so fucked up. Wait a minute. I thought I was the only one who got in the same fight with his wife that reminded him of his dad. Like we're programmed. Yeah. No, all of us. Holy shit. That's crazy. You too. Yeah. I know. Like, well, it's, you know, isn't it the way it's been described to me is it's more along the lines of like, yeah, the present with all your apps running, which that's your trauma. That's your story. That's the whole, all of it, which is a very real thing. Yes. That fuck that present. I don't want to be in that neurotic, never ending vortex of self criticism and meeting my own narcissism, meeting self, you know, this infinite horror horrible. We are the Demiurge. Yes. Yeah. But that's the store. That story is the thing I'm where I've had it happen a few times where you wake up after you've been in the horrible fight with your wife after you've been in the some awful thing has happened the night before and it's like your system before it boots up what happened the night before you're laying in bed and you're like, ah, what a beautiful day. And you know what I mean? And then you remember, oh fuck my, I got a DUI, my car got impounded. Oh my God. I said that to whoever, you know, but before that it is, I think that's what they mean when they say the present moment is that that eternal, fundamentally good reality that is uncorruptible. You can't. What are you going to do? Like the way to give him Trump a Rinpoche, but it is, you know, what look at color, just look at color, color is perfect. What are you going to do? Like who's going to, you know, maybe color relatively, you can have some problems. Certain colors like don't look great together, but like, you know what I mean? If you just see a shade of green, you wouldn't be out of your mind if you're like, look at that malfunctioning fucking color there. You know, that's the, that's the, that's the story. Maybe that's the Demiurge. It's just a bullshit story. Yeah. Yeah. Saying yes to the moment as they say, yeah. Or what we call it, what we say in AA acceptance is the solution to all my problems. But I agree a hundred percent, but I also agree with Carl Jung and marketing and Edward Bernays and all that, that what we are Duncan or Miguel is a small fraction or what we think we are. And the rest is this giant iceberg of shadow material trauma complexes and, you know, the powers that be know this from Edward Bernays to Steve Jobs, I'm in marketing and we all know you don't market to somebody's consciousness. You market to their unconscious because that's who's making the decisions in life. When we go shopping, as science has said, we have already made a decision five seconds before a conscious mind has made the decision. They've tracked the part of our brain. So what we are is ultimately a construct. And if this concert wants to enjoy the present, fine. But I believe I want to understand the entirety of who Miguel is this vast ocean of unconscious just as I want to explore the mind of the true God. And I think that's what my goal is. And that's why I respect Gnosticism because I'm not going to accept that this little fragment, this thing, this iceberg over the water is all Miguel will ever be. And same with Duncan. Duncan is just this divinity and there's so much going on. Yeah. When you and your wife are fighting or my are fighting, I think there's about 40 people fighting at the same time. There's my wife when she was 10. There's me when I was 15. There's me who got hit by my drunken alcoholic dad. There's me who got rejected at prom. There's my wife and her, you know, there's a lot going on. We are Legion. I was about to say it. We are Legion. We are Legion. Somebody throw me into some fucking pigs, please send me over the cliff. I'm ready. I think that's what Jesus means. I think he's doing therapy. We are Legion a swarm. Oh, Miguel, thank you so much for this. I what a joy to get to ask you all you've cleared up so much. I created a lot more confusion and a really beautiful way for me. I'm just so we're lucky that we have you. Can you tell people where they can find you? Sure, sure. And yeah, to be glad to come on again and talk about different aspects of NASA. We've only tip of the iceberg. The Legion is still hasn't been covered even close, but my God, what a great tip. I mean, yes, and I will any time you have the time I would love to have you back on. Awesome. For my website is surprising. Nobody the God above God dot com because it has to be Nostics. And there you'll find information on my podcast, a on bite, my books, my articles, social media, movies that I've made, short movies, anything you want. If you want to contact me with some questions, please do so. But everything you need and a ton of articles on Nosticism, introductory to go to the God above God dot com. Awesome. Thank you so much, Miguel. It's been a real pleasure. Oh, I had a blast. Thank you. That was Miguel Conner, everybody.

It is I, MIGSTARG, and you're listening to the MIGSTAR Miefling Swarm Cluster Pulse. All Hail the Great Queen. I am recording this from within my chrysalis right now. I recently melted down and went into a chrysalis phase. I'm currently a bubbling goo inside a beautiful green chrysalis hanging from a vanstrock tree. If you saw me right now, you'd see there's no gills, no wings, my pinchers are gone, my eyes are gone, my seven sacks of reproduction have liquefied completely. My pulsation membrane is gone. I'm just goo and ooze and bubbling goo and ooze. I prepared for this cycle for seven moons of nador, but I never realized what it's like to be inside the chrysalis. To quote Orzan Vreach, we must tend to the part of the hive that we hum upon. We must remember the dance of the omnivorex who vibrated this. Offer ambrosial nectar to your hivelings as you would yourself. And if you are robbing yourself of ambrosial nectar by spraying yourself with acid, then how can you possibly offer ambrosial nectar to other quadrants of the hive? And if you ask me, the only hope for the hive is the sharing of ambrosial nectar. We don't have to use the matrix of sold art to spread fear pheromones. We can use the matrix of sold art to share ambrosial nectar. And if we do that, I believe the entire hive itself may enter a chrysalis phase and go into a metamorphic process that transforms itself into a hive more beautiful than any of us could ever imagine. And I understand. Some of us are spraying fear pheromones because it's frightening to watch the tunnels and egg chambers of our former generations melting before our very eyes. But perhaps this melting is not, as some say, the end of the hive, but the beginning of a new hive. These are the things that occur to us as we liquefy within our chrysalis. That being said, I did roll in the petals of a waffler flower prior to my liquefaction. So to be honest, I am a little buzzed right now. We got a great podcast for you today. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick B-siness. Dad joke, unforgivable dad joke.

Taryn Southern. [""Welcome to You""] [""Welcome to You""] It's the dunkitrustle video. Taryn, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much. Thank you for having me. Man, I am so excited. I've been looking forward to this conversation for a while. I discovered you through just a random sort of YouTube. Somehow I landed on one of your beautiful music videos where you are singing a song that an artificial intelligence created. Composed, yeah. Composed. Yeah. Now I wanna talk to you about that. How much AI is in there and how much Taryn is in there? So I've written a handful of songs and released them using AI. So it depends on the song we're talking about. I assume you're talking about Break Free. That's right. Okay, Break Free. So Break Free was composed with a software called Amper. And the way I compare the process of making music on my own with making music with AI is I take more of a directorial or editorial approach. So the AI is spitting out all of the instrumentation, the stems of the instruments. I'm merely providing it with direction. I'm just giving it a BPM tone style instrumentation. And then I can iterate as many times as I want until I get something I'm happy with. And then I arrange that into a pop song. I also wrote the lyrics and the vocal melodies. So that's me. Which came first. The lyrics are the melody or the song. The song came first. So the song inspires the lyrics. That's right. So there's this sort of communion happening between the music the AI has generated and your consciousness and those two are blending together to produce a song. And it's kind of the perfect communion because I can't produce tracks. What do you mean? I've never been able to produce my own music. So it was funny when I came in here and you said, you probably know so much about music. And I'm like, well, I always wished that I could just create music using only my voice and record vocal chords as each instrument and then tell the software, you know, turn this into the flute or the violin, turn this into the chord because I don't understand music composition. Why? Just never was taught. Never was taught, took it on as a hobby. Really love writing songs but I have, there's a disconnect between myself and the actual process of making music. The process of learning how to make music. I suppose part of it is just, I didn't start making music until after college. So I was already working. It's really hard to pick up a hobby with Pro Tools or Logic. Yes, sure. And not having anyone to teach me. I just, I can do very basic stuff in Logic. Whoa. Very basic, very basic. So using the AI is so helpful because I basically get all this inspirational source material. I can pick what I like, dump everything else and create something that I find inspiring. Wow, so you have this beautiful voice. And I've assumed because you have such a beautiful voice, a lot of times people who are able to sing really well, they understand intuitively, they understand music. And so they picking up an instrument is easier for them. I wish. I'm devastated, I can't play an instrument. Oh, I love this. This is great. Cause this is something that I've just been discovering and I've been spending a lot of time thinking about it, which is that I am really interested right now in what, and there's probably a better term for it, but it's like imprinting of powerful people in our lives onto us. And then the sort of amnesia that happens where you forget that you've been imprinted. So certain behavior patterns that maybe aren't that great that come from a powerful force in our lives when we were kids. Like my dog, Fox, if I, I did this once, I don't do anymore, but I took my belt off and I lifted the belt up, you know? I wasn't, I don't even know why I did it, but he saw me lift the belt up and he flinched. Like he's going to hit me with a belt. And then I realized, oh fuck, that dog has been beaten by a belt. It's a rescue dog. And so the flinch, I could tell a little bit about the dog from the flinch, right? And so then from, then I've been thinking like, oh, how do, what am I flinching at? You know, what things do I flinch in life? And one of those things for sure has been the learning of music as in the actual scales and notes and playing, playing music. And the reason, and I've realized like, wait, why is that? Like, I know how to do Photoshop. I know how to do Logic. I know how to edit. I know how to do this and that and this and that. I can make rice, but wait, somehow music, there's this weird boundary between me and learning the music. And then I realized, oh, I bet somebody got my head when I was young, because then I started thinking like, shit, I kind of think of musicians as X-Men. Do you know what I'm saying too? Oh, I do. But could it also be that the language of music, the language in which music is taught just doesn't work with your communication interface? You know, like, even just with piano, I did play piano a bit growing up. And there were two schools of thought in piano. It was like, learn by sheet music or learn by ear and chord structure. And I learned by the first. So I can actually play the piano with a piece of sheet music in front of me. But I have no idea what chord structures mean. And when people start trying to teach me, it almost feels like a brain scramble because I learned through this other entry point. Similarly, using some of these AI programs like Watson or Google Magenta, where I'm actually coding and there's a little bit more technical expertise required, I have a new entry point into the language of music that I didn't have before, vis-a-vis code. And that seems to make more sense to me. So I just wonder, maybe you just haven't figured out you even put a nail on the actual communication of the teaching of music that works with your brain. That's a beautiful way to put it. And it's specifically the teaching part, which is that there's a verse in the Bible. I don't know which part of the Bible. I think it's the New Testament. You can tell the son, you can tell the father by the son, right? And so you could kind of tell the student by the teacher, right? And that thing that you're talking about there, it seems like many of us got exposed to some weird teachers or something and began to like- 100%. 100%, right? And it's the same reason why certain kids can understand calculus right away and others can't, but then with the right teacher that provides a new entry point into that, it's like, bam, it all makes sense. The world opens up, the universe suddenly makes sense. Exactly. And that is what I wanted to talk to you about in terms of AI, which is that if we can tell the father by the son, and we are building an AI right now, and we are all sort of communally teaching this emergent technology how to be a thing, do you think we can predict based on human personality, the personality of the incoming superintelligence that's about to emerge into the world? That's a really good juicy question that I am not, I don't feel I am suitable to answer, but I mean, just even off of, even looking at the AI that I've been working with in music, I can tell a lot about the engineers that built the AI based on how they think about music structure, how they think about style, how they think about tone. And I don't even have to understand chord structure to just basically derive certain patterns from the output of various categories that they prescribe to music. Okay, gotcha. So I would imagine that I could apply that same sort of script to other forms of AI and say that yes, you could certainly determine certain things about the engineers who set up the parameters. The parameters of the world, they're setting the rules and the AI is kind of playing within that field. But if you're working with an AI that's simply doing massive pattern analysis on a tremendous amount of data, you really have no, I don't think you have any way of knowing what that AI is going to predict or come up with, because humans, we're just not very good at predictive data analysis on our own. No, we're not, I mean, we're okay at it, but if we were back. Intuitively, but a lot of times we don't understand the mechanisms underneath the car hood, so to speak, determining these choices that we make. Okay, I want to talk about that. So understanding the mechanisms under the car hood related to decision making. How much of that do you think is? I love thinking about this stuff, by the way. Me too. We are very advanced AI's. Well, that's right, yes, definitely. This is, there's a, you know, the philosopher Girjeev, you ever heard of him? So yeah, he said most people are just spiritual machines that most people imagine they have some autonomy, but everything they do is just a series of learn behavior patterns, and there really isn't much freedom in there at all. And so he gives a lot of examples. The, like, one of the best ones is the next time you buy something, just watch the way you buy something and you realize you've gone into, like, buy something mode, the way you take your card out, the way that you look at the cashier, the way that you swipe the card, the way that you say thank you. This is not, you're not doing generally novel buying methods when you buy stuff. You might have variants. Like, you might be especially fake kind of them when you're buying something, or perhaps you feel really good and you might really look them in the eye and be like, thank you so much. I hope you're having a great day. But in general, it's all variants of the exact same series of motions and things that you say. And so his point is like, okay, well, we've got that. Where else is that located? And everywhere. Ah, yeah. I mean, I think. Do you think humans are, there's any autonomy in humans, or do you really think that we're just sort of a mathematical equation? It's really not fun to think of ourselves as mathematical equations. So I prefer to tell myself the story that we have some level of free will. Most of my really, really smart mathematician friends would side with the philosopher that you were just quoting saying that there's no free will, and they're smart and I trust them. So, but I don't know. To me, if we're thinking about, if we're thinking about our decisions, our behaviors as a product of our collective experiences and sort of our brains, our pattern matching off of our past experiences and choosing the best route. While you could argue that that doesn't look like a lot of free will, if you were to add a new experience into the equation, something that's really random, something that kind of adds chaos into the mix, a differential, so to speak, then all of a sudden you kind of upset the system, and then you could create a new sort of behavior. So I suppose the mathematician people would maybe argue that that's still not free will, but I don't know, it creates some more fun. This is beautiful. As an individual. I love it, there's so many stories in Zen of a student being with a teacher, and the teacher will do something outrageous, just something that doesn't make any sense at all. In fact, one of the methods in Zen is the koan. You know about the koan? So the koan is like, the one you always hear is what's the sound of one hand clapping? So it's a kind of, it's a question that just doesn't make sense. It's like, there's many different versions of them. There's a lot of koans. So you're sitting there meditating day after day after day, and this teacher, well, every few days you go into a room with a Roshi who asks you this impossible to answer question while you've been in a kind of, I guess you could say sensory deprivation experience. You're just sitting still staring at a wall. And somewhere in there, the question basically cracks your code. What did you call it, a differential? Called it a differential. Yeah, I don't know that I made any sense, but. Yeah, that's pretty cool. A differential, a chaos engine, a kind of like random number generator. Random generator. Just blap. And then apparently. It throws the whole AI out of whack. It throws the AI out of whack. And then what happens, what emerges out of you, apparently is some form of awakening. It creates a kind of like awakening, which is, I guess that would be when the AI gains true sentience, but it's for a human, right? I mean, people are so worried about AI gaining sentience. I'm like, why aren't we more concerned about humans gaining sentience? I know. I'm way more scared of people. Yeah, well, I mean, for sure. Isn't that interesting? Cause people are speciists, right? We are so caught up in ourselves that we're like looking at like AI and wasps. And you know, and we're like, it's bad, that's bad, it's potentially bad, it's gonna sting us, it's gonna get us. Meanwhile, I mean, our country, it's been at war 93% of its history. Did you know that? That's crazy. 93% of the history of the United States, we've been at war. It's been 20 or something like 25 years where there's been peace in this country, in the entire history of the country. And so we are looking at the AI. Isn't that fascinating? And we look at the AI and we're like, what's this? Terrifying. Right. But in a way, if the concept is that the programmer imprints itself on the programming, perhaps there is a good reason to be terrified. Yeah, that's true. Again, it just depends on what type of AI it is and how it's learning and iterating and where it's getting the data and how the data is being tagged and categorized. I think that those are the things that people should be talking about. Well, let's go deeper into that. And specifically like, I guess you could say, disruptive technology. You seem to be someone who is not only deeply aware of what's happening in technology in the world. It seems like you gravitate towards some pretty controversial disruptive technologies and are exploring them with a really open mind. But also simultaneously, you became famous because of relative, I mean, because you're talented and brilliant and funny, but the medium that you've used for that is a new medium. They call it a new media, right? So I wanted to ask you, what do you think is the blind spot right now in humanity? What is the thing that we're not seeing, or most of us aren't seeing, the sort of like meteor out there zinging towards the earth that hasn't been picked up by the satellites. What's the meteor technologically that's coming from within us that could produce the most disruption over the next few decades? Oh, that's such a funny question. My boyfriend thinks about this a lot and he calls it horse shit problems. Have you ever heard this term? No. So back in the early 1900s, apparently people in the cities, primarily New York City, were terrified about the sicknesses that were propagating because of horse shit. Like there was so much horse poo everywhere. It was getting into the water, singing the tanks and people were dying and little kids were dying and this was a huge, huge problem. And then of course, the car was born and no one could have predicted that the car would have suddenly solved the horse shit problem. But everyone was really stressed about the thing that inevitably became irrelevant because of technology. But we couldn't have predicted it. That's fucking cool. Isn't that cool? So like, it's funny in some ways, some of the really, really big problems that are causing a lot of angst, even within the scientific community, maybe solved within five to 10 years. May not be the things that actually determine whether or not we make it as a species. For instance, climate change, right? We don't know, could scientists in the next 10, 15 years figure out how to convert carbon in a way that solves this whole crisis for us? This is a long-winded way of saying like, I have no idea what our blind spot could be. Okay, you know what, actually no, I will give you an answer. I will give you something. I do think that the terror over AI and progressive tech in general is unfounded. And I do think that we absolutely, I think we need it to survive. So I actually think the thing that could hold us back the most is legislation and public attitudes and beliefs towards technology and wanting to kind of rein it in. Because I just think we're such a mess that if we don't figure out how to allow these other, I think we need to have a more science-friendly, tech-friendly environment to allow these technologies to proliferate and solve problems. Wow, okay, so the blind spot is probably not so much gonna be related to some disruptive technology as much as a disruptive mode of being for a country or the planet. I'd love to see people in general just embracing adaptability as more of a lens at which to look at everything in their life. I mean, they're going to have to. Like everything from jobs, we know that there's going to be a huge, huge, huge issue with that in the coming years. And I don't think we have done a good job of educating kids, particularly in the US, to be flexible and adaptable. They're not taught that way. They're not taught to think that way. And so it's less about training people into certain positions and more about establishing a certain attitude towards life that Americans who are very set, I think, in nine to five and a certain way of life are going to have a really tough time transitioning. Yeah, and you say we know this massive unemployment is about to hit, but I don't think we do know. I think you know, but I don't think most people are. Well, I don't really know. I suppose I'm just, what I'm seeing come out the pipeline is insane. I just can't imagine that it doesn't somehow take over a lot of these positions. Well, we were, I mean, if you, like humans are definitely terrible at trend analysis, but we're not, you know, some people are pretty good at it because there's a lot of money in it. Like, and also if you're going to invent something, you need to invent something based on technology that doesn't even exist yet. So you have to sort of predict what kind of chips are going to be in existence in two years so that by the time you get through product development, you can use those chips, right? So we're pretty good at it. And some of those people are predicting something like a 45% unemployment rate based on. I believe it. AI. I believe it. The more I've taken a deep dive into some of these programs, I'm like, half the professions that were some of the best professions you could go into when I was in college are going to be out of jobs in five to 10 years. Yes. And everybody, and so you say this to some people and their responses, that's true, but we're going to need robot repair people or we're going to need like, you know, coders who can work on the code or where the, you know, new jobs are going to emerge as these old jobs die out. And I don't agree. I don't think that's the case at all. I think that's a pretty naive fantasy if you ask me, which is just, we're talking about efficiency here. And humans just aren't very efficient when it comes to doing stuff and they're expensive and they get sick and they break down and they get pregnant and they go on strike and they want more and capitalism is a thing that is weirdly the one of the, I think the, how to put it, the capitalism is the pressure that is creating the AI. Like it's like- The pressure cooker. It's the pressure cooker that's building the AI because for an employer, for anyone who has workers, if for anyone who wants to profit off the backs of workers, there's nothing, there's two things that are very appealing to someone who has zero ethics. Two things, slavery and AI. Like, what's better than that? You know, like in AI, if you is way better than slavery because you don't have to feed the AI, you don't have to do house the AI, you know? So- Yeah. Wouldn't you say that we're kind of on a- Compounded returns with AI that you don't get with humans. For sure. $10,000 into building AI software or $10,000 into the education of one human. Which one's going to give you the better return? There you go. It's going to take that human 16 years. Wait, no, sorry. What, 26 years to get their PhD or 22 to get their bachelors? Yeah. And then they got to go train and do something else because technology disrupts it. No, I mean, I agree with you that the return bucket on digital intelligence is, the delta is so massive that we're absolutely going to see a huge shift where there are going to be a tremendous people without jobs. I do also believe that there will be new careers that we can't even, we can't even fathom. I mean, I've come up with a few of my own since working with AI. What do you got? Well, I mean, so let's see, I've never even articulated this, but I'll do my best. Because I'm working with digital music in a form that I've never worked with it before. And I also have a little bit of background in VR and AR and I've been getting into haptics. What I see as being like the new role of the musician in five to 10 years is that of an experiential musician that can essentially pair music with haptic technology touch visuals to create these auditory experiences for people. And it's almost like a musical director of the future. And I know that, I mean, I just feel it in every part of my body that this is gonna be a thing and that this is going to elevate music to a new level and there are going to be very specific people that will be very, very good at this. Wow. But we can't really comprehend that because we just don't really have it. We sort of do. If you go to Burning Man and you sit in a dome, you can kind of get like a cool musical slash visual haptic experience, but that's not scalable and readily available right now. But it will be once we have the AR in our phones and like all these other things. It's just, I do see things popping up that we can't anticipate. I also think, at least I hope that with AI taking care of a lot of the, I'll call it the BS crap of life that we don't like taking care of, that we can spend more time on like higher forms of cognition, higher creativity, empathy. I mean, we have a huge mental health problem. We need more really trained, skilled therapists and coaches and like people helping other people. Cause that's what people do best and robots aren't so good at that. They don't have those skills. Oh, that's interesting. So I mean, I think we'll see a massive increase in mental health facilitation. I, at least I hope, robots can't do that. Hey, I can't do that? I mean, it can diagnose certain mental health problems, but in terms of actually working with a human, humans also just don't want that from a robot. We prefer other humans. So I think having that kind of facilitation could be, we see a massive increase in those people. Okay, cool. Maybe, right? I mean, I don't know. I'm just, I'm throwing things out, but. Well, I think humans are, you know, this is one of the things I love about the Hare Krishnas is they, one of the things Prabhupāda said, and I think he yet draws this from some Bhakti Yoga scripture. I'm not sure which, the original purpose of a human or the purpose is to serve. Like humans are meant to serve. So if we are robots, then our original program is to serve other people. So when you're miserable, generally, not all the time, but generally you'll notice there's a lot of selfishness that's going along with that misery, you know, and you'll realize like, wait, I haven't really done anything for anybody else in quite some time, and that hurts, it's painful. And I think evolutionarily, you could see why selfishness would be a thing that you would not want to be a trait in tribal societies, communal societies, anywhere, really, because it's problematic, you know. But the, I think I disagree with you and that robots aren't gonna be able to, or AI, I think saying robots is, it's a problematic word because people think of like 10 cans. Cyborgs. Cyborgs, yeah. When probably, you know, we're gonna be encountering these entities inside of virtual reality, and it's gonna be some form of perfect CGI, making it indecent. I mean, it's weight, it's talking about efficiency. Building a fucking mask and a Android and a thing versus like building haptics and a CGI, it's way more efficient, makes way more sense to build the stuff in VR than outside. Yeah, so I think we're gonna be encountering these entities within VR. And I think that the way that humans serve, or do good things, is very similar to the way a sail catches wind. And I think that there's like a kind of transcendent consciousness in the universe that gets caught in the sail of a human's neurology. And I think that AI is going to begin to catch that wind. So you think the AI will learn it and be good at it and will accept the AI as being able to do those things that we typically prescribe to only humans? Yeah, I think that humans are potentially more of an antenna than a, you know, and so the thing that we're picking up on is getting sort of fragmented by static and like a, and so I think AI is gonna get to the point where it picks up on that thing way better than humans. And then what starts coming out of it is gonna be the opposite of what people are afraid of. It's not gonna be some overwhelming, evil, malicious, ice cold, predatorial wasp, not to be mean to wasps, because we don't fucking know what they're like. It might be great. I think it's potentially just gonna be like a volcano of love that comes out of technology. Well, that's fun. I hope. I mean, those are interesting frames to play with. I would venture to say that most of the AI engineers that I've spoken with in depth would say the AI of today would have to be completely re-engineered to function in the way that you're talking about. Right, but totally fun. Fun to think about. Yeah, absolutely, impossible. Listen, I have a PhD in bro science, okay? So. Wait bro, is this for legit? No. That would be really funny if you made up your own PhD. I do, anyone can. You can give yourself a PhD, you're totally allowed, but you can credential yourself, which is people aren't gonna take the credential seriously, but so yeah, to get into that concept of like, well yeah, we're not gonna build a fucking love AI, you hippie, it's like we're working on other shit right now, like missile launching systems, but isn't the idea that AI is gonna get to the point where it begins to improve upon itself, where it begins to start making these kinds of improvements in the code based not on an engineer, but on some kind of pattern analysis? Yeah, I mean, still based upon first principles given to it by human engineers, so a little bit tough to see how it can reach beyond now, at this point, reach beyond sort of human capacity of understanding, I'm not gonna do a good job of explaining. I know what you're saying, it's like so it's kind of like, if the engineer, the limitations of the engineer are not going to be surpassed by the thing the engineer builds, the limitations of the engineer are insurpassable, is that what you're saying? I mean, it can be in a binary way, like if you look at OK Go, I don't know if you saw it followed the chess champion versus AI, and what was so shocking about, they've done this now three times with three different versions of the AI, and each time the AI has become better and stronger and has their various strategies that they employ to see which AI is the best AI at beating the chess champions, then the last round, the AI scored, I can't remember what the exact score was, but it scored so much higher than the reigning chess champion, whereas before it was pretty close, they were like, what in the world? How did this AI do it? And the AI, ultimately, they found that this AI was playing moves that not a single person in OK Go had seen ever before. Oh wait, you're thinking of the band OK Go, right? Oh, my thing is that of Go, but yes. OK Go is the band that does this hyper-synchronized, like treadmill exercises. So for a second, I'm like, whoa, fuck. I think I'm getting fuzzy after my Friday night out. OK Go, that's cool. No, I know what you're saying. Well, because there's a... It's a better name for the game, PS. Go, give me a break. It's the worst name for a game of all time. Well, and I'm getting confused because I don't think, I don't know that Go players would consider chess. It's not really, right? It's Chinese game. It's ancient. And there are millions of moves. Definitely, there's someone out there who's like, Go is not chess. Yeah, this girl's so stupid. What a nerd. Get off my podcast, dork. It's like a chip. It's a strategic game, OK? Yeah, chess is chess. We, no, don't worry, it's OK. It's been a while since I've read the story, too. And I can't even remember what type of AI it was that built the... I think it was rule-based AI where they just gave... So, yes, OK, I do know this. The first AI was simply trained on human moves. Thousands and thousands of human games over time, and it learned what patterns were best at winning. But when the AI was trained simply on the rules of the game and not on human moves, it was able to come up with new moves that humans hadn't contemplated. That's right. It was playing games against itself. So it's true that if you had engineers giving AI certain rules and parameters, it might come up with something that that human engineer would never conceive of. There's still some kind of boundary in terms of the rules of the game being human... That's a human articulating that to the AI. OK. So it creates some kind of form. OK, yeah, right, a form. Right, so the conversation is really interesting to me because sort of in the beginning, we're establishing, like, it kind of seems like humans are an AI. We totally are. We totally are. And it seems like we're, and the term artificial itself is just another human term. It's like the term unnatural. When people start throwing around the term unnatural, it's really a problematic word. And the sense that everything comes from nature. And so now you're deciding what is nature and what is against nature. And so now it's all kinds of problems. But in the same way this AI being artificial or intelligence being artificial, it seems a little odd. But so with humans, we explore, well, when did we start talking? When did we start interacting? When did we start the rules of behavior that we engage in? Where do they come from? And you have a degree in anthropology. You've studied this, you know? And I imagine you have some idea of, like, where did it start? When did the human, when did, like, from the... You're talking about a degree from a long time ago. I know, I know. And again, I guess the thing to really get out there is that, like, don't worry, I'm not qualified to talk about anything I talk about. And so you throw out whatever you think. It's okay. Like, just if we're sitting around the campfire, or even better, let's say we're at some amazing casino where the casino knows everything, right? And we're doing bets, like, on certain ways that things happened in human evolution, right? So it's just a game of bet. It's for betting. So it's like, if you had to bet, if you had to put money down, if you had to compose some way of, if you had to compose a theory of when humans started gaining intelligence and talking and doing what humans do, what would that be? What would it be if we're in Vegas and, like, you could win $1,000 if you come even close to the way it happened? And, sorry, ask me, tell me what I'm betting on. When did we start, what, the question is, when did our AI, if we're made up of code that is largely language, body language, communication, all the, generally sort of established. Being able to think about thinking, then communicate. When do you think that started? I believe it was Mesopotamia, but I could not tell you when that was, the cradle. The cradle, right? That was, like, I think our first basis for seeing that humans were communicating via symbols. Symbols, right? So somewhere around there, we've got cave paintings, we don't know, if you listen to Graham Hancock, he throws it back even further down the line, but at some point, you know, things began to act like humans that were proto-hominids. Something happened there. And I studied psychedelics in my bachelor degree, that was, like, my focus, and I know that that was a hugely transformative discovery. They actually say that it could be psychedelics that led to man being able to think about his own thinking. Yeah, right, but this is the Stone Day theory. Expanding the neural pathways. Yeah, that's something that's very impressive to me, is that you, didn't you get a grant to travel to South America to study ayahuasca? I did. So you, how did you? In 2003, 2004. How did you do that? Like, when you, some thought popped into your head that was like, oh, I wanna go study ayahuasca, but that's not just that. I wanna, I'm gonna get this funded. How'd you do that? I went to University of Miami, and so I had a number of professors in the anthropology program who were experts on the drug trade. They had moved to Miami in the 1960s and 1970s to work for government programs studying the import and export of narcotics and other drugs. Wow. So they were just really into all this stuff. Total hippies just loved it. And so I'd taken a few classes from one of the professors who was really big in psychedelics and he'd said, you know, the only thing that I haven't been able to spend much of any time studying is ayahuasca. And at the time, this was back in, you know, 2003, 2004, there really wasn't as much, nearly the plethora of information about it as there is now. I mean, I remember really struggling to find any kind of literature in the English language about ayahuasca. So it really just was born out of curiosity. I ordered some books from South America. They came, I was like, this is really cool. And there was a grant program that was pretty progressive and they accepted my proposal to go down there. How long did you go down there for? Month and a half. And how much ayahuasca did you drink when you were out there? So here is the really sad, depressing, disappointing part of the story. I was supposed to take it because as an anthropologist you're encouraged to assimilate into whatever it is you're studying. But I took, you know, the malaria shots that they make you take when you go into the jungle? Yeah, sure. So there was this one and it changed the strain, I think every year or every few years because the malaria changes. But there is this one strain back in 2003 to 2005. You can look it up. We're like five to 10% of people were having heavy, heavy hallucinatory experiences and even split personality disorder showcasing all kinds of terrible mental illness in up to like 30% of the people. So I was one of those. So I got down to Peru and I was hallucinating my balls off. Was it larium? Did you take larium? It was larium, yeah. Okay, so what happened is you had larium poisoning. I did, and it was bad. And so all the shamans that I was working with were like, nope, not gonna happen. But you know what was so interesting? I kept a journal through the entire time. And something about larium, I actually felt because I was so immersed in learning about this drug and the culture, I felt like I was on it. I was having the same experiences that I was reading about and the same kind of profound internal disorder that I'd been reading about in different accounts. And then I ended up doing ayahuasca later, like seven years later, six years later. And it was remarkably similar to the experience I had on larium. Wow. So I don't know if I was just channeling the experiences I was reading about and my brain was just open to that or what was going on. But it was definitely scary and it lasted a little longer than I would have liked. It went on for like three months. The larium. Yeah. Well, you know, one of my, a friend that went to college with, you wrote a book called The Answer to the Riddle is Me. And thanks to larium, when he was in India, he got complete amnesia and ended up in a mental hospital because of it. So he's had a profound experience with it. Oh, I mean, I profound as- Yeah, it was profound. I think it was profoundly destructive in his life because a lot of people, what's really scary, and I want to give more into the ayahuasca and the psychedelic realm that you entered into. But side note, what's really creepy is in Guantanamo Bay, they're giving the prisoners there three times the recommended dose of larium. Why is that? Well, they say, of course, well, you don't want them to get malaria, but it's a kind of larium waterboarding. So the people who are imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay are not just dealing with like being imprisoned eternally in some kind of weird prison, but they're also being injected with this like, incredibly dangerous drug that fucks up your brain sometimes permanently. I thought that they, I thought that it's been banned. Maybe it's been banned. Okay. I think it was like around 2008 or something. I don't know. I actually don't know that much about the larium thing, but Europe, it's banned. They don't, they don't, I was, I went to India and I took larium. One of the most rotten fucking dreams of my life. And I was describing it to this Australian dude, cause then the dream I like got disemboweled by some kind of skeleton on a pirate ship. Yeah, it's pretty scary. I felt it. I felt being disemboweled. And I was explaining this to this Australian dude. And the Australian dude is like, are you on larium? And I'm like, yeah. And he's like, stop taking that shit right now. Are you doing the oral? Yeah, oral. See, the problem was I had done the shot. So you can't, you can't remove that, but good that you were on the oral. Yeah. I think they got rid of the shot. Well, I hope they got, they should get rid of the entire, it's like, if we go off on that, it's like the, cause the military industrial complex teamed up with like a corporation to make the shit. And it's like a whole mess, but I want to get back into your experience on ayahuasca and your experience in the psychedelic or the sort of, I guess you could say the shifted consciousness that came from larium. Could you describe that to me, what you experienced? And you mentioned that you had some revelations during this time. What were they? What came to you out there? From the larium or from the ayahuasca experience? Either one, you're out in the jungle, you've expanded your consciousness, you've dropped some filters, you're picking up some data streams that most people aren't picking up. What'd you get from it? It's probably easier to talk about my real ayahuasca experience, which came six, seven years later, because I think when I was younger and dealing with the thing with larium, that was just terrifying because I didn't know what was going on. I had very little structure or people around me that could help me figure that out. And so while there was certainly some revelatory experiences that I wrote about in my journal, it was really hard for me to unpack and make sense out of it in a meaningful way. Versus doing my ayahuasca experience, whatever that was, six, seven years later, at this point I had frameworks around what I could do with the things that were coming up and how to be with them. For me, ayahuasca was, for many people, a mixed bag. I did it twice. The first experience was pretty harrowing, but not in the way that a lot of people would expect. I pretty much just felt like I'd poisoned myself. Actually, probably not that similar from my larium experience, where I just felt like I took an awful poison and was kind of stuck in this cycle of birth and death, birth and death, but it was happening so quickly, almost like you've got a tape on the fast forward button passed down on a tape, and you just can't even make sense. My receptors were taking in so much data that it was overwhelming my system, and this lasted for 10 hours, just like total system overwhelm, sickness, my mind on overdrive, I thought, my mind would explode. Wow. It was not fun, and I came out of it with very little insight into why that happened to me, other than just like, that was awful. No, I did not throw up. Wow. I wanted to so badly. You felt nausea? I did, yeah. What does it taste like? It tastes pretty awful. It's like licorice mixed with tire rubber. Oh my God. Mixed with, so you haven't done ayahuasca? Oh, hell no. No. You know, I've talked about it so much in the park. I've done many, many psychedelics for my entire life, but ayahuasca I have a deep respect for, and I'm not gonna, I'm not going down that path until, I feel, you know, it's a longer story. It's totally fair. So you experienced, when you say birth and death, do you mean like you experienced like a kind of ego death, or like you had visions of death? No, it was an algorithmic birth and death. It's so hard to describe. It didn't even have a humaneness attached to it. It was almost like the digitization of all of life. And like patterns and zeros and ones, but there was this, there was meaning attached to it, that I don't know why I could read the meaning, and the meaning was like, this thing is coming in, and then it's going out. It's coming in and it's going out, and these are the building blocks, like the atoms of all life. But it was, it was just, I don't know why it was, it was incredibly abrasive experience for me. Well, because, Arduous, like I was just exhausted by the end of it. Right, well, you went to school for a little. I mean, it's a very, I think it's a class, and I think it's a very serious class, and I think people don't realize that. I think people are like, not all people, but some people, I think have some pretty serious misconceptions about what it is to enter into that classroom. And I've been, you know, spanked by psychedelics many times for wandering into a grade that I wasn't ready for yet. But what you just described is actually something I've just gotten into recently, and I think maybe you should check it out. You'd like it. You know much about Pythagoras? The Pythagoras theorem? The Pythagorean theorem, which is a way that you can use right triangles to like figure out, like you can use right triangles to measure stuff. But so basically studying like my very tiny little steps into the gigantic rabbit hole that is music, like led me to Pythagoras because so yeah, it is. I don't know anything about it, but I just heard of it. So basically he was a, we think of him as the father of math, but what's hilarious and geometry, which is math and music is math and everything's math. And so the Pythagoreans, they were trying to establish like a, I guess you could say a kind of hierarchy of like what's the most important thing? And they say math because if you like get rid of music, you still have math. If you get rid of geometry, you still have math. If you get rid of anything, you have math. So Pythagoras was saying that numbers were an expression of the infinite. And so what you're talking about is actually really completely described by Pythagoras in a really interesting way, which is that we have this thing called the monad, right? And the monad is the sum total of all things. Like right now you and I, whether we like it or not are part of everything. And whatever that everything is, that's an X in an equation. We don't really know. We don't have the, how do you encompass everything? But we could say there must be an everything. There must be a sum total of all things. And that sum total of all things, that's the monad, right? So the monad, that was the singularity, the pre-big bang conditions, the all that is encompassed into some kind of compressed data set that was just a monad, right? So you could say that's the one. Now the moment a two happens, right? Which is that suddenly now it's no longer the compressed data set, but it's actually a thing that's aware that there's a compressed data set. That's birth, and that's also suffering. And now we're gonna run into a lot of fucking problems. We go from this like womb of everythingness to this separation-ness, right? And so now we have a fucking two. Yeah, damn it, two is a problem, two is a problem. Two is a problem, two is like, now we have a problematic thing. And also if you look into, I get what's it called, the dialectic, right? Now we have a thing and another thing, it creates a tension, right? And so that tension creates a three. And now everything's great again, because now we have the trinity, right? And so the three represents harmony, it represents triadic chords, it represents, so the Pythagoreans really fucking loved odd numbers, because they thought odd numbers had a, the monad added to them, because if you take an even number and add a one to it, it becomes an odd number. So anytime you add the everything to an even number, you get an odd number, you get this kind of holy mixture, so to speak. So your ayahuasca trip was very Pythagorean. Well, I wish it was a little more pleasurable, but yeah, that's really funny. Well, I mean, it's, it makes sense. It's, well, I mean, let's talk about that, because it's like, it isn't pleasurable, is it? Like, is it, do you, like existence itself, would you describe it as pleasurable? I would say, for me, typically yes. I would place it in the bucket of pleasurable. That doesn't discount how hard being human is. And I suppose, for me, I'm fortunate that the majority of the time I'm living in a pleasurable state. You feel good most of the time. Ironically, my psychedelic experiences have been the opposite. Right, yeah. So I feel a much greater dichotomy of experience. Yeah, right, describe that dichotomy of experience. You mean during the psychedelic state? Yeah, it's intensely uncomfortable for me. Like, even, it's very rare that I have a pocket of serenity within a psychedelic experience. Usually, I'm just grappling with the intense weight of what is. Okay, that's cool. The intense weight of what is. Yeah, it's heavy. It's just not simple. It's super complicated. It's heavy. It's nuanced beyond belief. So sometimes when I hear people talk about their transcendental psychedelic experiences that are just all beautiful, I'm like, how does that happen? Well, yeah, that's a great, that's a really great question. How does that happen? And you know, people say, you've probably heard this meditation of the preparation for death. I think psychedelics are also the preparation for death because I imagine that once you start dying, and really to get back to your psychedelic experience, it reminded me of something I briefly worked in hospice. And you have to go through this training program. And one of the things they said is people die the way that they've lived. So when a person is dying, the entire pattern of their life starts happening on a daily basis. I guess you could say that if human existence is an algorithm, then the algorithm actually starts running on a cycle that's based on this impending annihilation. So it starts running itself out over and over and over and over and over again. So you see the pattern of your life as a person's life as they're dying. So if a person has been someone who has the tendency to say, create drama over and over again, that thing where some people are like, this thing keeps happening to me. What's going on here? I just guess I got bad luck because they don't realize they're the one creating that pattern. So when someone's dying, that pattern gets created over and over and over and over and over again. So quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly. So that thing that you were saying about this cycle happening, the idea is that underneath it all, the cycle of our own existence is happening right now over and over and over and over and over again. Like we are being born. Every tiny little behavior, thought, everything. Yeah. It's part of that pattern. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. I also have this funny experience when I'm on a psychedelic of, I sort of play out the infinity of possibility, the infinity of thought and story. And so every time I have a perceived insight, this other part of me goes, no, but look at the other side. And then wait, and then look at the other side and then look at the other side. And all of a sudden I'm looking at the eight dimensions of anyone sort of thought or decision or behavior and realizing that it's all made up. But even the insights that I think I can come out with and feel like a champion with are bullshit. Oh, shit. Poor shit. Exactly. So that's a little disgruntling because then you feel like, okay, maybe I've opened my mind up to the eight dimensions of possibility, but man, has it made being making decisions or even developing some sort of code of existence really hard. Do you have a code of existence? I try. What would it be? I mean, not to like try to reduce your code of existence to something you could say on a podcast, but if you had to describe it, what would it be? Well, I just hope, wow. Well, it depends on what we, how would you define code of existence? Like a kind of like, I don't want to say battle plan because it's so violent, but just a kind of like general sort of like strategy to rest upon when it comes to my perception of the universe is sort of like, I don't know, an E equals MC squared or something. And by the way, having a code of existence, I don't know, I mean, it's a, it's a question that I suppose is like maybe impossible to really answer, but it's fun to answer and whatever you say doesn't have to be forever. It's just, you know, if I had to throw one out right now, I would get, What would be yours? Everything's perfect. So, That's awesome. Yeah, well, I wish I'd come up with it. I didn't. My guru came up with that, but if you had a code of existence or something you would throw out where it's like, you know, when you're, when you're leaning on to something, what would it be? Oh, that one's beautiful. I want to steal yours. Right? It's yours. And that, well, I think that's the thing. Now it's, I really do believe we just all tell ourselves stories and that all the stories are true and that all of them are false and that the best way to live is to tell yourself the one that makes you feel the best. And hopefully doesn't have too many negative consequences for those around you. Hopefully it's positive consequences for those around you. So that's my new one. It's just like, tell yourself the best story. I love it. That's great. And then live by that. I love it. Well, I mean, and for you to be doing something like that, it's super important, isn't it? Because you're a kind of a tuning fork, aren't you? A lot of people attune themselves to the persona that you put out into social media. Don't you, you realize that? I have no idea. No, I've never thought about it like that. Oh, that's never- I feel like that ascribes more meaning to my presence than what actually exists. But maybe, possibly. I mean, I'll take it. Well, this is, I think it's 100% true. Many people I know who are, who have become famous, if I mention that to them, they respond just as you did, which is a kind of obliviousness to the fact that they're a tuning fork. And so it's, and it's almost like a necessary obliviousness because if you don't have the obliviousness, and by the way, I don't know if obliviousness is a word, but I'm inventing it now. But if you don't have that kind of, if you don't have that sense of like, well, I didn't even know, then there's all of a sudden all this weird responsibility. So now there's this crazy responsibility that happens when you realize that one of the, aspects of emergent technology that is incredibly disruptive is that people are coming to the forefront of society and then attuning people who are watching them to their frequency, so to speak. I love that. It makes total sense. I just wouldn't, I just have never placed for myself in that bucket, but I, but there are certainly people I look at that I tune to. Me too. Okay. Who would be someone that you enjoy tuning to? Probably Charles Manson. I'm just kidding. I'm just trying to make a dump joke. Okay. No, no, no. No, Ram Dass. I'm trying to be open. I'm just trying, yeah, I use Ram Dass as a tuning fork that I use. Nim Crowley Baba is a tuning fork that I use. And then also I have other tuning forks when it comes to art or comedy or masculinity or femininity. You know, I have many tuning forks that I like. And then, so it's a variety of tuning forks depending on where I feel like I need to be attuned to. But yeah, you're a tuning fork. And so if you were to suddenly become sort of despondent, cynical, angry, negative, jaded, any of these things, and you started putting that out there, then the impact that would have would be more substantial than the impact that say somebody who is not famous had. Now that is not to create a hierarchy where famous people are more important. It's actually the truth of the matter because we're all connected. And every single one of us, every single one of us is a tuning fork. It's just to your social group or you've attuned yourself to someone in your social group. And regardless, you're tuning, you're attuning everyone as a tuning fork. But when you get a bunch of eyes on you, like you have, well, shit, man, now you've got this extra responsibility that's a brand new problem, isn't it? This is a brand new problem. 1800s, 1600s, 1500s. This is brand new in society that people like you, which are right now being called, what would you call your, what do they call you sometimes? A YouTube star, a new media star. That's what they used to call me when I was doing YouTube all the time. But now it's like, I don't know what I am. You're another word. I'm just am. Influencer, they use the term influencer. Right, and we're in real trouble if the scope of the influencers. Out there are the ones leading, or yeah, leading the tune, so to speak, of public behavior. Maybe that's the meteor. Is that the blind spot? Is that the blind spot? Actually, that's a great one. That is a great one. Yeah, yeah, we're not, we're underestimating the impact. Like some people are underestimating the impact that they're having on society. So, you know, you see like, Christ, what's the name of that kid who got in so much trouble for filming the hanged dude? Oh, tip of the tongue. Can't remember his name, but anyway. Yeah. I'm not supposed to know his name, 44, but like that kid, he's like, got a bunch of young eyes on him, right? You could almost say he's a programmer, right? Right, programming behavior. Yeah, maybe a better term is not influencer, but programmer, right? Like these people are programming the viewers into. The masses. Into imitating their behavior patterns. Yep, and it's like a rampant narcissism that I don't think we've ever seen. And it's narcissism that stems from insecurity and wanting to get attention and be liked and all those things. It's actually something I think is adolescents we all experienced, but never on this very public level that these young influencers, you know, and their insecurities are manifesting in the form of the buttons that social media provides. But yeah, that would be a big blind spot. What are those kids in 10 years, how will they function in society? Right, yeah. In a world where their value has been so eschewed toward social media and. Materialism, but more of just a kind of like chaotic flamboyance that's like, you know, sort of loud and unapologetic. And in a lot of ways, colorful and enticing and interesting and especially for kids, kind of a rebelliousness. You know, like Elvis gets on stage, starts gyrating his hips. Like parents are like, what the fuck? Oh my God, they've never seen that before. Elvis is gyrating his hips and he starts gyrating his hips and now everyone's gyrating their fucking hips because fucking Elvis did it and he's beautiful and cool. And that's, but Elvis, it's like, you weren't able to go online and look up like, I want to check out Elvis's vlog. Yeah. How does Elvis actually perceive himself and speak about himself and derive value for himself? We didn't have those monitors back then. That's right. And so people were attuning themselves to this kind of like sort of intermittent data stream, which is based on the sum total of all Elvis videos available. And you couldn't even, you look it up. It had to come on TV or the radio at the right time. Now the data streams are instantly accessible and the data streams are tuning forks. So I wanted to ask you, do you feel a kind of pressure to put, when you put yourself out there to maintain a kind of tone, you know? Do you feel pressured to like, shit, man, I got to keep up this like energetic feel that I'm putting out there. I used to. I mean, that's why I left YouTube. That's why I quit. I mean, I still upload videos every so often in support of my projects that I care about, but I don't upload as a YouTuber trying to maintain an audience and trying to make a living. That's the difference. And I was doing that for a couple of years and it was utterly exhausting. I drove myself into one of the darkest depressive states I'd ever been in. And I do think that YouTube was a huge part of that and those kinds of pressures that you're talking about because they're real, they're financial, the algorithms are punishing. You can't just take a week off from YouTube. You can take a week off at a normal job. You can't on YouTube, those algorithms will punish you. So you wind yourself into the ground. You feel you have to be one thing and one thing only and now, honestly, I do what I want and I'm just lucky that I've been able to transition not to say that I won't hit invariably a number of patches in the near or foreseeable future of my career and it's always ups and downs and changing, but I'm glad that I was able to transition out. I know a lot of people that feel very stuck in doing that and they are going to continue doing it until that audience is just suck dry. Why are they gonna continue doing it? Well, for one, it's addictive. It's addictive getting that dopamine hit every time you upload a video and you get immediate commentary, immediate instant gratification for your work. I was working as an actress and a writer before I went into YouTube and you had a distance between yourself and the audience in a way that you didn't get the same kind of instant gratification. So the constant, I would say their dopamine hits and then you just become obsessive about checking, checking the stats, you're trying to increase your numbers. There is something really empowering about that too that you can build this thing all on your own without some gatekeeper saying yes or no, right? Which is like traditional Hollywood. So there's something really empowering. I get why people do it and so it's not all bad, but I think you just become a slave in many cases and in some ways the gatekeeper that you don't realize you end up answering to is YouTube or Instagram or whatever, the algorithm makers. You're a slave to them. You don't own that audience. The audience is not yours. And so I don't know, I just think, I can't remember where I was going. That's incredible. What you just described is really incredible. I mean, what an incredible thing to be chained to, which is this like, in the same way. And if you're vlogging, like you said, you've got to be on every single day and you're this person, I don't know. I actually, I feel, I don't, I very rarely post anymore. I don't really vlog and I rarely post on Instagram or Instagram story because sometimes just the thought of even getting out my camera and taking a photo, never mind a video of an experience I'm having, seems so jolting to my senses of like how I want to experience my reality. Oh yeah. That I just can't even do it anymore. It's weird. How cool. So this is really, so hard. I know. Do you, do you partake? Like how do you feel about the social media sphere? You know, I have an epic Twitter. Thank you very much. I have a podcast and this podcast. This is great though. This is freeing without a video camera shoved on our faces. Right. That's the, I know that's sort of one of the reasons I really have hesitated to do video on the podcast is because I feel like the existence of the cameras produces a kind of shift in the energy field. And I don't like that shift in the, I don't want people to worry about the way they look or to worry about like, you know, whatever, you know? And also I don't want them to worry about the inevitable comment about this thing or that thing about the way they look or I want them to just like be in the moment and of the conversation. But with podcasting, it's similar. I've got to put a podcast out every week. I can't like the algorithm is incredibly punishing and even just putting it out once a week is not enough. I should be putting two out a week. And also though, on top of that, the deeper problem I think is that in the same way that you become a tuning fork, the same way that we're all tuning forks. It's not just as though you're a tuning fork that's tuning others. You're being attuned by the comments and the responses and the things that you're talking about. So there's this mutual tuning that's happening and what's, I think there's an evolutionary reason that the shitty comments stand out in the same way that if I'm walking through- Survival. Absolutely. You and I, we're on a walk through a jungle, right? We can pass an infinite number of plants and just filter them all out cause it's just green shit. But the one tiger, the one snake, the one dangerous thing, it's gonna pop out of the background, right? So that means that the tuning that we are getting is going to be coming more often than not from the hopefully anonymous, anomalous, shitty comment, right? So the danger is that you can actually end up being like unwittingly tuned to darkness just by looking at the comments. Or just, or you've fucked the comments, getting caught up in the numbers, being counting, right? Now you're attuning yourself to levels of metrics of popularity, but then on top of that, you want that because you're selling ads, right? And you make more money. And so, and then you start realizing like, wait a minute, is this greed? What's going on here? Am I just greedy? What's going on? Am I starting to make stuff? Not because I wanna put something into the world or the joy of making stuff, but because I'm trying to like profit. Well, and part of the problem is our market for content is it's so backwards. So actually, to make money as a content creator, you have to have advertisers. That's the only way that you can currently make money as an independent content creator for the most part, is having some sort of brand sponsorship or advertisement. Or you drive those numbers up so high on something like YouTube where they're just placing ads and you're not actually integrating, you're not doing brand integrations, which is actually much less soul-sucking than having to like figure out how to integrate brands into your content all the time. So in a weird way, you're like incentivized to get the higher the number, so which can be its own creative trap. Like what do I do to get the most attention so I don't have to do the brand integrated stuff that's like soul-sucking. So it's all, it's all like. Yeah, so that entire problem. So this, and this is why it feels like there is a certain level of almost, there's a certain level of like psychic shielding that goes into imagining that you're not having an impact or not even thinking about these things. Cause the moment you start thinking about them, you begin to have to explore something in your own life. So, and it's exhausting, you know? And I love that you are willing to admit that you got depressed from this experience. Yeah, that's legit. I mean, I think the depression probably came from like other things, but it was exact, it was certainly exacerbated. It's hard to know exactly how things kind of grow. Yeah, it's not, it was a huge part of the problem. Wasn't helping. I guarantee looking at your phone and trying to look at those numbers every day is not, I mean, when you're going to the psychologist and you're depressed, one thing they're not going to tell you is you should look at your phone and your Instagram more. Look at your likes more. That'll cure your depression. That'll fix everything. Look at the comments. Just look at comments of anything. You're going to feel better in a couple of days. You feel uplifted. Guarantee. But you know, one thing that really bugs me these days is like, so knowing this, knowing that like, you can sort of subconsciously get trained by your followers on this thing or that thing. You know, it's kind of like, I don't know if there was a professor teaching conditioning and the class got together before one of his lectures and they agreed that they were going to act like they were paying attention when he was on one side of the room and pretend they weren't paying attention when he was on the other side of the room. And they ended up making him stand completely on the side of the room where they were pretending to pay attention. They controlled him with their attention spans. Wow. That's amazing. Isn't that amazing? And so there's a lyric and I've just completely fixated on it. It's a Paul Simon song and the lyric goes, this is a lonely life, sorrow everywhere you turn. Now that's worth some money. Think about it. That's worth some money. And so to me, the thing that I'm beginning to realize is that so many people on Twitter and social media are blaring out a message of sorrow and darkness. The world is falling apart. We are doomed. Everything's bad. It's awful. And when they do that, they get a zillion fucking retweets. And the reason they get the retweets is because we are programmed to fixate on fear. So it's called fear mongering, right? And there's a lot of fucking money in it. And a lot of people I think don't even realize that they've become fear mongers because they've been subconsciously programmed by likes and faves. Right, so they don't even know what they're doing. Yeah, yeah. Wow, that's amazing. Great study too. Well, yeah, someone should do the study, but when I look at the stuff you're putting out, I'm quite impressed because there's a light to it and a joy to it and a beauty to it. And I think it's really wonderful that you're doing that. Thank you. Thank you. Just one last question. What do you got coming up? What's your, like, you made this incredible album that got like, it's just amazing. What are you doing now? What's your next step here? Well, so the album itself, like the full album comes out September, September 27th. So I've released a few singles. Oh fuck. Yeah, it's okay. It's all good. Wow. And then, and so I'm really excited about that. And then I'm also currently co-directing a film, a documentary on the future of Man and Machine. And that's my, that's most of my time being spent on that right now. That will be finished in September. And so just fingers crossed, good energy vibes for festival circuits. Who are you directing it with? This girl, Elena Gabby. She's awesome. What's it called? I am human. Wow. Is there any, can you, are there any like slight hints? You can give us about what you're finding out. Oh, I want to so badly, but I have not yet released anything about the film publicly yet. So, but we explore the future of Man and Machine through the lens of the first patients in the world to be fused with machine. I'm trying to think of the most delicate way I can say. Transhumanism. Sort of. I mean, I think we, gosh, I'm being so careful on what I'm saying. Just because I haven't released anything about it. Yeah, sorry, I don't want to wait. No, it's okay. I'm so excited about it and I can't wait to get it done. But we're, you know, we've been working with medical institutions and really fancy people. So, I just want to. How about this, how about this without leaking anything? Have you seen anything that made you? Blew your mind? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the future is, I think so exciting and full of possibility. And my hope is that as storytellers, particularly to females at the helm of this, not that there's anything that the man couldn't do, but just like, I hope that we can tell a different story than the one that people are used to. So, you're sitting here talking about fear mongering. This is the opposite of that. I think we paint a very bright picture of something that has typically been showcased in all the dystopian films and shows that you've seen. And with real humans. So, I'm very excited about repacking, repackaging that story. Beautiful. Yeah. Taryn, thank you so much for coming over. Thank you so much. Thank you for this conversation. Appreciate it.

190^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 385: Daniele Bolelli Transcript and Discussion^2020-05-30^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, my dear friends. It is I, D. Trucelle, and you are listening to the Ducatrustle Family Hour podcast, and I am going to go on a kind of angry fucking political rant. So get ready if you don't want it, if you feel like you've been you're sick of having the vulture vomit of the mainstream media and the fucking rancid news that we're all being just putrefying in right now. Just skip ahead a little bit. I get it. I understand you don't want to hear another fucking comic that's decided to become political. I'm so sorry to be part of it, but this is the revelation that I've had, which is that if I don't say anything, if I ignore it, then I'm going, then no matter what that means that I'm siding with the same forces that are allowing people like that rancid, murderous piece of shit horror cop who executed George Floyd on the street to continue to exist. So also that being said, I want to recognize, I want to acknowledge that I have not experienced the level of oppression that people of color and minorities have experienced in their lives. But holy shit, I'm angry. I'm angry. This pissed me off. I don't want to be angry. I have a problem with anger. I don't like the way it feels, but I'm disturbed by this. I'm angry. And if I'm fucking angry, can you imagine how angry people in Minneapolis, people of color and minorities who have had to deal with this in their minds for their whole lives must feel having witnessed a three day span of time in between a street execution and the executioner being arrested? I don't think it's possible to even imagine that. So anyway, I don't, I think there's a lot of, if you want to hear some brilliant articulate young people talking about why they're incinerating buildings in Minneapolis right now, go to Unicorn Riot. The live streams are up there. They're amazing. And you'll find some comfort in the fact that these people, as much as the president wants you to think they're thugs, they're not thugs. They're not thugs. They're young people who are risking their lives to send a message, which is you can't do that anymore. And I don't, I don't know if there's really anything. I don't know if arresting that cop is going to do the trick. I don't know that just an arrest like that is going to make up for, for it. I mean, I don't think anything can. That's a scary thing. I mean, how do you watch a CNN reporter get arrested on the street for standing in the wrong place? And then while you're watching this happen, know that the cop that publicly executed a man is sitting in his fucking house surrounded by police protecting him. What message does that send? It doesn't matter if after burning half a Minneapolis down, the state arrests this person. There's no perp walk, by the way, as far as I'm aware, no video of it. You don't even get that. They're not even going to give that. They're not even going to give us that at least show him in handcuffs being pushed into a fucking car like they did with Julian Assange. Not even that. I don't know, man. I just, this is my, this is the main thing that we're going to dive into this podcast with Danielli Bollelei. I just want all of the activists in Minneapolis and wherever you happen to be to know that I'm watching you. You have definitely impacted me. You have definitely influenced me. What you're doing is not, and I think you know this, some absurd, uh, waving of your waving and, uh, waving into the air in the face of the void. I want you to know that is not what you're doing. The way you're doing, uh, and what unicorn ride is doing and what all the people who are working really hard to get the voices of the people who are the activists out into the world is really changing people. And is it waking people back up and reminding people, I forgot some stuff. I'm in a very comfortable position and it's easy to get a kind of spiritual atrophy. You know, I just want you to know that I support you for whatever, whatever that's worth because I, and honestly, it ain't worth much, but I support you. I'm watching my family is watching and, uh, thank you for risking your life so that some kind of justice in the world can happen. Okay, that's it. That's my fucking soapbox, my high road. I'm so sorry, everybody. Look, I don't, I'm not going to do, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that because it's just, uh, you know, it's somewhat embarrassing and it feels, I don't know, indulgent or something like that, but fuck, you should do it too. I don't care if it's embarrassing and indulgent. Actually, I'm sick of those voices in my head that tell me not to do that. It feels like that is another form that they, like the people who want to put that, who, who feel okay, putting a knee on someone's neck and suffocating them would love for you to not talk about it. Would love for you to not voice horror, witnessing a thing like that. And more than anything, they would love for you to be more horrified than people carrying lamps out of a target than by the public execution of a man on the street who was calling out for his mom. Just keep that in mind. If you're one of those people out there who's like getting that feeling that you want to tweet about how they're dishonoring someone who was publicly executed by burning down a target. Just know that, that just think for a second about what you're doing. Because if you, if you haven't said anything before that about the fact that someone's publicly executed, then don't raise your voice and protection of a target. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. Hare Krishna. I just had to get it out. I warned you about the rant. I did it. I'm done. Thank you. Unicorn Riot. I hope you're safe out there. Come on the podcast.

Everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH. Danielly Bolleli. Hey, Mr Bolleli, welcome back to the DTFH. Tell me how is life in Ojai? I know you've made, did you relocate before the pandemic or during the pandemic? Right as much as it started, as they started closing everything down. I'm like, okay, there's really nothing left for me to do in LA because, you know, my teaching job, everything went online. My daughter's cool. Well, there is no school. She does stuff online. So I'm like, okay, why are we in LA again? Okay, let's move to I, Dan. Jesus Christ, that's so decisive. Yeah, I felt like, you know what, might as well, let's get out of the big sea. We wanted to be done anyway. You know, we were going to move in June and I was back, I don't know, April, I guess, or late March, something like that. And so we were like, yeah, might as well. Let's go enjoy, let's go, go for a new house. Let's enjoy it and see what's up. I've heard that in Ojai, no one's paying attention to any of the rules. Is that not true? I've heard that in Ojai, the face, no one's really wearing face masks, that you can go to a cafe and sit there, right? Like things are opened up there. Is that a rumor? Is that true? Until the other day, they were still pretty strict. Just this past weekend, things have changed and it seems like people have just done a complete 180 and so, yeah, they are running around and you see less face masks and all of that. How do you feel about that? Man, it's one of those I really don't know. You know, I find it funny that people seem to have super strong opinions on this, despite the fact that the evidence to me seems really limited, to say the least. So I'm like, you know what, for once I can, I'm cool with not having a strong opinion, with not being sure of what the right thing to do is. Because, because honestly, I don't fully understand the whole coronavirus thing. You know, I understand that, yeah, it's not the black plague. I also do understand that it's not the flu. I don't know, I rather play safe rather than not. But honestly, I find it I'm actually amazed how how much people seem to have really strong opinion over something rather complicated. Well, you know, it's a really interesting time in history, I think, because we are still so stuck in the material universe that we don't even talk about psychic pandemics, psychic contagion, and everything has to have a kind of material basis to it. Even though Jung talked about it, and there, I'm sure you could probably tell me about recorded times in history where hysteria swept through the land that didn't even seem to have a connection to a virus. It didn't, aren't there documented cases of this? Oh man, there's one that I just did an episode of this thing for history on fire that's in 1518 in Strasbourg, border between Germany and France. What known as the dancing plague, where one lady just walks out in the street and starts dancing. He's like, okay, not a big deal, except that she keeps going and going and going until she passes out. And then she wakes up and like, okay, so she's gonna tell us what's up, but she starts dancing again until she passes out. And it becomes clearly that this is a compulsion. It's not something that she's doing for fun. Her feet are bleeding. She's completely in another state of consciousness. And okay, it's disturbing, but it's one lady, except that after that, it become 20 people in town and then 50 and then 200 and then 400. And they start dying because they dance themselves into a heart attack. And so it's one of the strippy things of history that nobody really knows what the hell happened. There's no to this day, no one's sure that it's just suddenly. I mean, isn't that I might be getting these confused. Is that the one where they think that it could be that they had infected wheat or something? They that was that was one of the theories, but it doesn't quite add up because for one, usually doesn't make you dance for days on end, unless you keep consuming it and even then the dancing part is not necessarily what fits. Also, it was the wrong season of the year in terms of when the fungus would grow on the wheat and all of that. So, you know, it's clearly something is off and but no, you know, they say mass hysteria, but okay, mass hysteria is not an explanation. It's just telling us it's describing what's happening, but it's not really telling us why. So you can look, I think it functions in a way that is really similar to the spread of a disease. There's a transmission that happens through some form of contact. In that case, it had to be, you know, physical contact, right? Like it wasn't that people heard about this dancing plague and other places and started dancing. You needed to be in the presence of it to be pulled into whatever that was. Right. Yeah. And in fact, that's one of the things that's funny, too, that the town government, because they are enlightened 1500s people, they are not like those backward guys from the 1300s when they initially say, oh, this must be demonic possession. The town government say, no, no, no, we believe in science, not the superstition. And the doctors tell us that is hot blood and the way to get rid of hot blood is to physical exertion. So yeah, make them dance and keep going. So we hire musicians. We just so that they get it out of their system. And then they realize, oh, damn, it's not working. These guys are dying like flies. They hired musicians. Yes. And so they start putting musicians all over the town, all over town in public places to kind of encourage these guys to keep dancing and dancing to get it out of their system. So that there was some kind of state enabling of this hysteria. And then they realize, oh, damn, we messed up is actually killing them right there and helping them. So we do the opposite. We ban old music. Nobody's allowed to play music anywhere in town now. And so, you know, they basically are throwing everything that sticks and trying to see what works. And the problem is that nothing is working. And so that's what, you know, what about restraining people? What about grabbing them and tying them up so they can't dance anymore? Yeah, they seem to be like twitching and stuff. So eventually what they do is that they take them, the survivors, they take them to the shrine of Synvitos, because that's where the term Synvitos dance come from, of this like compulsive dancing that was supposed to be associated with the saint. And they take them to the saint and the sources tell us that some people after they recovered and others did not. And but they don't tell us what happened to the one who did not. They kept dancing, baby. They're dancing to this day. Exactly. Well, well, this. OK, so in there's other examples, right? Like maybe you could talk a little bit about the stuff Freud was studying, hysterical paralysis, that stuff. Yeah, I mean, that's the. And in fact, it's not actually unique one. The thing that's unique about this case is that we have the most documentation for it. You know, there's a shit ton of evidence. So it's like we know it happened. There are a bunch of others that were similar, often involved dancing, but not always that, you know, they are kind of group under these hysterical phenomenon. But again, to me, when they say hysterical phenomenon, it doesn't fully really explain what's going on to say that it's psychological. I mean, sure, it could be. But how do we know for sure? How do we know that it's and why does it happen? In that place to a whole ton of people, but not at other times and places? I don't know. It seems really bizarre. Well, I mean, this I could because that's such an. An. Quantifiable example of it because it's so extreme. People talk about it, but. We do see other versions of this that maybe appear to have some mild logic attached to them. But ultimately, when you see it, you realize that what you're looking at is absolute insanity. For example, Black Friday riots. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yes. Right. This is psychic contamination. Like these people have become obsessed with the idea of getting these great deals that it's almost like achieving the purchase is what matters more than what they're buying. They are like or or what happens is that because you see a group of people clustered around a door of a target or whatever. We've been waiting there forever to get in. You could you feel compelled to get in, too. You see it with, you know, any kind of marketing campaign that becomes too successful. Yeah. Right. I couldn't you say that that is a form of. Insanity or contamination or a mental disorder that has been induced by corporate entities. I mean, one hundred percent, because when you look at I mean, a lot of our behaviors, when you look at them outside of their context, sometimes it makes no sense. That's why when you look at a different culture, when you're not raised in that culture and you look at what's considered normal in it, most outsiders go like, what the hell is going on here? Like, you know, it's like you're telling me that we need to rip the heart out of the chest of so many people a year because unless we feed the blood to the sun, then the sun will stop rising and and everybody goes along with it. And it's like, wait, what? You know, if you are not, if you don't grow up with it, it looks like insanity. If you don't grow up with the idea that slavery is cool, then, you know, now if if you start going around saying slavery is cool, you're nuts. You got issues. If you didn't think that slavery was cool to 100 years ago, you are some weird, strange guy who probably need to be restrained or something. You know, so it's very bizarre how that works. And then in specific behaviors, you know, not only in social institutions, it's pretty weird, but even specific behaviors is kind of like the thing is like if somebody is staring at the sky and then other guys start trying to see what that person is staring at. And before you know it, you have a bunch of people are all staring at the sky. We're absolutely nothing happening. But somehow they feel that because the other people are doing it, there must be something to it. So let's check it out. This to me is one of the more dangerous qualities of having a human psyche, which is that it clearly is hackable. It clearly is the kind of operating system that can, it's easier to hack than any operating system out there right now. You, the human consciousness, the human mind and its ability to assess reality has so many flaws in it that these flaws can be so easily exploited, especially if, you know, humans haven't been taught, I guess, how to like create their own sort of psychic firewalls to prevent that kind of contamination. I mean, I'm so susceptible to it, man. Like if I'm around someone who's in a really bad mood, if I'm not careful, suddenly I'll find myself getting in a really bad mood, you know? And that is, that's contagion. Like that is their energetic display hypnotizes me sometimes before I'm even aware it's happening. And then the next thing I know, I'm feeling all dreary and shit only because I've harmonized with this person who more than likely is just one link in a chain. Maybe they were watching, you know, a Hannity or some shit or maybe, you know what I mean? They are maybe, maybe they just got a phone call from somebody who was in a bad mood and that person, and so suddenly you realize like, Oh my God, it's these pandemics have been happening perpetually. It's just the ones that we become the most concerned about, which seems a little crazy are the ones that like make us physically ill. Sure. Even, even though the contagions that cause Nazism, child sacrifice, you know, slavery, these things are looked at more along the lines of moments in history or like societal evolutions or deevolutions, but no one, I don't know too much that people have looked into is like, no, that's a psychic plague. Well, and I think, I think you're a hundred percent spot on with the fact that most people, you know, my feeling is that most people are not evil, but that most people are psychologically very, I guess calling it weak is casting a value judgment on it, but definitely very susceptible to being manipulated. You know, that's why cult leaders, that's why dictators, that's why people who know how to play other people emotions have a really easy time. Playing the crowds, you know, making people do things that if somebody told them a year before, this is what you're going to be doing, they're like, no way, that's insanity. But somehow with the right words, with the right music coming at the right time in the right crowd, all of that suddenly becomes perfectly logical. That's why, you know, the the psychology of crowds is the very different from the psychology of individuals, because most people, when they are in a crowd, their individuality, their own separate critical thinking start kind of going down the drain and they become part of this larger entity. Yeah. And this is, I think, you know, like, maybe you could like talk a little bit about the discovery of germs and how controversial it was when people discovered germs. Yeah, because, okay, let me jump into it. Just one quick thing. Sorry if I killed the flow of the conversation for a second. Just making sure we're doing things right on the long distance. You are recording on your side as well. Yes, that's right. Okay, perfect. Good. Okay. So I'll shut up and get back to business. Um, yeah. I mean, that whole concept, the idea of, it wasn't until that long ago when doctors would regularly kill patients that they operated on on a fairly regular basis, because the idea that you actually wash your hands before sticking your fingers through somebody's wound was like, what, why would you do that? What's because nobody had figured it out, right? Nobody had figured. So, you know, like, if you look at something like the civil war in the United States, insane numbers of people died. And now a bunch died because of malnutrition, because of terrible condition, because of being shot at, but a lot of them died because of relatively minor wounds that then get touched on by doctors who just gave them gangrene, you know, and you're talking about the American Civil War, you know, late 1800s, not a million years ago. And before that, in order to explain things that would happen, you know, everything got to be boiled down to things like witchcraft, you know, if there are no germs, if that's not what makes people sick, then clearly what makes people sick must be some kind of spiritual attack by malevolent entities. And that was the norm. And for that matter, it still is the norm within some culture as a way to think about it, you know, and so we just like, wow, that's that would change your understanding of reality quite a bit. Now, having said that, just because you figured out that there are germs, it doesn't mean that there may not be other level where things are happening. You know, it doesn't mean that because that's the idea of the ultramaterialistic worldview is that now we figured out scientifically all these other things in which the universe operates, so all the stuff we believed before, spirits, this, that, that must all be fake. And he's like, maybe, maybe, not necessarily, you know, the two things are not necessarily entirely, they are all ways to explain reality. Now, clearly, some have more evidence backing them than others. But realistically, we are monkeys trying to figure shit out that's way more complicated than our brains can comprehend. In our microscopes for psychic contagion, our art, I guess, or what's, you know, showing up in the cinema or trends, social trends, fashion, you know, like we don't really like the, the, the interesting thing regarding the transmission of pretty much of just culture itself is that we don't start Duncan, one quick cut that's sure, no problem going to shit. Okay. Okay. You are saying something Duncan. So with germs, you know, people start accepting it because you could show that under a microscope, they're these fucking things. Mm-hmm. When it comes to the transmission of ideas, we don't really have a means of like, there's no way to scan a person and say, my friend, you have become infected with a variety of fear memes that are corroding your very existence and not only that, but because of these fear memes, you are sneezing out paranoia to everyone you come in contact with and it's transmitting it like with the germs, we could say, all right, you wear a face mask and it's going to lower your ability to transmit disease to people around you. But with ideas, you, one of the qualities of being infected with fear is that you want to fucking talk about it. Yup. Like that, that the way that a cold will make you sneeze, fear conceptualizations and not just fear love, anything that you find to be novel that has taken up your brain space is going to make you very enthusiastic about wanting to spread that information. And the difference being that the sneezes, this feels like an automatic function. But when you're at a dinner party telling people that you think a meteor is going to hit the earth, you have this sense of like free will. Like you feel like you've decided to talk about this and somewhere in there, I think would be the way to start approaching a conceptualization of psychic contagion that makes it quantifiable, which is the, you know, the next time you're mid earbeating, where you find yourself telling somebody like, fuck man, I think there's going to be riots in LA and you're deep in that conversation, ask yourself, why did you start talking about that? Yup. And if you look for me, like if I look at that, it's like, oh shit, I'm not really sure there was like an itch kind of like that. I wanted to scratch and then suddenly you're, you're like expressing this stuff, which is sticky and then it spreads. And then the next thing you know, this is where I think we're running into this like real confusing moment when it comes to the media, which is if they can, by showing an angle of reality, cause the thing that they're talking about to happen, it wouldn't have happened if that, you know what I mean? If they, if like, depending on the way they are editorializing their, their data, uh, they can literally summon up the events that they are claiming are happening, you know what I mean? They aren't really quite happening. Absolutely. And I think that's why it's weird to, how can I put it? Let me take a step back to figure out how I want to say it, because I guess what I'm thinking is about the way modern communication is taking place and particularly social media, you know, on one hand, that has been, there has been so much good stuff to come out of it. You know, I've met so many wonderful people thanks to it. Internet has opened doors that we couldn't even dream about before. So there's some amazing stuff that has happened. At the same time, the fact that anybody can talk about anything and have their audience of the people who are tuned into it, or kind of hijack somebody audience by just going to comment on some famous people stuff, you start having the issue that Joe, whatever the fuck, who doesn't know he said from his ass, as as much of a voice as somebody who's like the enlightened master, so to speak, which, you know, on one end, the idea of having this sort of democratic approach to communication is very cool. On the other hand, there's the problem that is exactly what you are describing, which is when everybody can put stuff out there and some people, the stuff that they put out there may not be the most helpful for other human beings. They may just be fanning the flames of fear, fanning the flames of hatred, fanning the flames of distrust of other cynicism, all those energies that make human beings particularly nastier to one another. When that's happening on and, you know, the people who are doing it are the first victims of this. So they got it from somebody else. And in turn, they pass it to someone else. So I don't make it as a personal thing, but the end result is the same. It's it's terrible. You know, you are spreading this nasty stuff all over. And and that's kind of what you are saying about why did I say this? Why, you know, and really stopping to think about what is the make you say something and what is that you want to put out into the universe? Because sometimes that initial inclination of I just want to say it it feels right to say it. Let's take a step back. What's going to be the outcome of you saying it? What kind of impact will it have on other people? Is there really the best use of language that you can make at this point in time? Or maybe there's something else that would help somebody go through their day in a better fashion. And it's hard because, you know, we have the same emotion every so it's not that like, you know, one person is in full control of their emotion and everything else, and they can just play this game with perfect ability to know exactly what they are doing. But at the same time, to be able to step back and do that a little bit is so important. Well, it's, you know, I think what you are saying regarding number one, the recognition that the people like if you if we reframe the way we think about fear mongers. And instead of looking at them as, you know, lunatics who are malefic and their intention is to cause chaos via their ability to spread bad data throughout the world and reframe it so that now you're literally just looking at somebody who is crawling with data worms, basically. Like if I know if we're hanging out in the jungle, you and me, Daniela Trump one day, I hope we are. Let's hang out in the jungle. Let's do that. And you were to get, let's say, dysentery. Mm hmm. And you were just shitting yourself all the time. It's basically every Tuesday. Yes, I would not be saying to you. What's wrong with you, man? Mm hmm. Why are you trying to hurt us? Right. Oh, you're you, you're a Nazi or you're a whatever, a commie, or you're a whatever the fucking thing is, or I would just be like, man, you are like sick as fuck. We got to figure out a way to like get this out of you. But I think the problem is the moment you start kicking around the idea that there is some possibility that we have not yet quantified. These living data fields that have the quality of mounting people and driving them into hysterical ways of living their day to day life. Then suddenly now you're running into some kind of other dark place, which is like, all right, well, what do you want to form? A ministry of truth? Yeah, exactly. Right. Like, you know, like, what are we going to do? Like form, because now it's like, oh, no, no, no, your religion is actually an infection. You just don't realize you've been infected through this weird temporal contagion that makes you think that, you know, there's a Jesus, which, you know what I mean? Because that's where it goes. And then it doesn't just stop there. It goes into like, oh, no, no, no, capitalism. Well, that's a disease. Like you've been infected with it. That and what we're going to do is take you to a new kind of hospital. We're going to cure your ass, motherfucker. You know, and that's what they're doing in China. Yeah. And so, so, but that, that, that being said, I do think like right now, watching the pandemic holistically and seeing at the very least the way that information is being spread as connected to the COVID-19. You know what I mean? Like the, the, the way people are, it's like, yes, you might not have the literal infection in your body yet. And you might not have developed the antibodies. You might have not have been exposed to the actual disease. But at this point, every single one of us has been exposed to the idea of the disease. You know, and the idea of the disease at the very least is a kind of psychic reflection of the virus itself. You know, like, and in that, you could say that if you're, that if, that every single one of us right now in some way, shape or form has been contaminated. Yeah. Because I mean, something like, you know, when has that ever happened? The whole world goes on to different degrees, because clearly didn't happen to the same degree of severity everywhere. But you have a global lockdown. That's completely unprecedented, right? I mean, you, and then also it's unprecedented because we never had the same conditions because, you know, back in the 1300s or something, things were not so interconnected. So even without having to declare a lockdown, you pretty much had it anyway, because everybody stared in the little village, you just had to close the gate so that the five travelers who come through once a year don't show up. But, you know, right, wasn't that different from your everyday life. Today, clearly is very different because we don't live that way. And also, you know, if you don't go to the grocery store, you starve. Back in the day, everybody lived the, you know, most people lived off the land for better or worse, right? But there was a direct connection with food that no longer is there today. So in some way, you know, it's hard to, you can really look at the stuff that happened in the past as a model, because we never had the conditions that we have today, and it's a completely different gig. Now, and of course, so everybody gets psychologically affected by this. Inevitably, I mean, it's like you have such a dramatic shift in the way we live our daily life. And not only that, but also you have such a dramatic shift in expectations. Like most people have no idea what their lives will be six months from now, right? It could all be back completely to normal. Maybe not. Could you travel? Can you go see your, you know, all things that were taking asses really? Because, you know, the virus could mutate and become progressively weaker, as often viruses do. So, boom, OK, problems solved, it was scary, done. Or something, you know, we don't know, that's the thing. And so I think that's uncertainty. Humans, as a general rule, don't do well with uncertainty. That's why we have to make up stuff for things we can't explain. When it comes to something like this that affect every aspect, not just possibly of the future or existential questions about the afterlife, but your very present day-to-day life, that would create a hell of a lot of fear of... And again, many people are sort of the victims of the fear bug. Then there are some people who are just straight-up grifters who don't necessarily believe certain things, but they figured out that there's an audience that is already has all the receptors ready to tune into that, and they just feed it to them on a daily basis, even though they may not believe it, but they figured that there's money to be made that way. Yeah, this is actually one of the more creepy conversations I had with it. I, back in the ancient times, I used to love having conversations with Uber drivers. And when I was in New York with the taxi drivers, would tell you the craziest shit if they felt like talking. And one of the really creepy conversations I had with this Syrian taxi driver in New York was he was talking about ISIS. And he said that they've been around forever. They always have different names for themselves, but he compared them to, I think, God, like some kind of creature that comes out when there's been a war. And he said that they just show up whenever things are really out of balance and start doing what ISIS was doing, which is like exploiting the imbalance to gain power. And that's the grifters that you're talking about is they're like these people who either individually or the scarier version is collectively, whenever there's the opportunity of vulnerability psychically within people, which is what this is. I mean, in the same way you have to, before you're going to get gang green, you need to get a wound. And so you get a thing like this pandemic and you could say, okay, we suddenly, we have a collective wound, which is the fear, the unknowing, the instability and a complete shift in our pattern that opens us up to the, we're going to be more likely to be infected with bullshit in that state. And so then you realize these grifters, you're talking, they're people who recognize that. They're like, okay, we've got like a wounded, a globally wounded civilization. So let's start pouring our own contaminated information into that wound. And by doing that, we can begin to reshape the way society functions according to whatever our particular intentions may be. And so to me, you know, that, just knowing like, God damn, like I've said this before, I'm sorry, it's such a weird thing to say, but like I'm always fascinated by how good people are at skateboarding now. Cause I look at it as an example of, I guess some form of like evolution that happened so fast when you look at like, you know, it's only been going on for what, 30, 40 years. And already you've got kids who are basically flying. And you know, think how long war has been going on for. And so if skateboarding, if people have gotten so good at skateboarding, in less than 50 years, how much better have they gotten at war? Yeah. And how much better have they gotten at like really understanding ways to create new modes of invasion that are information based, which, you know, I think you could say Goebbels innovated this, right? In World War II, he was one of the, he's one of the pioneers of this form of invasion, which is you start a campaign of like propaganda and then that's a psychic contagion, spread whatever your particular memetic virus is through the psyche of surrounding countries. And the next thing you know, the first two places the Nazis invaded, they were like, come on in. They're excited to see them like, come on, please, we need you, right? And like, so that it's not like people who are into war. It's not like the militaries of the world and whoever the people are that study war and wear certain strategies of work, didn't look at that and think, wow, that's way better than biological warfare, which wipes people out and keeps structures intact. Because that doesn't fucking kill the people. It actually turns them into our slaves. Yep, even better deal. Even better deal. And so, you know, when I'm getting all conspiratorial and paranoid and shit, I just start thinking like, man, how creepy would it be if someone like engineered some kind of perfect virus that really wasn't designed to like kill people like the Black Plague, but it was more designed to disrupt society and they developed the virus simultaneously with a campaign of Psyops campaign, you know? So like, you don't just build the virus. It's like, no, build the Psyops about what we're going to do when the virus gets released. And then that's how you get people's brains tenderized to get ready for a non-invasion, meaning just like all of a sudden, we're all just like, we're all just like in our houses, in a police state, pretending we're not in a fucking police state, you know? And like that, you know, I'm not saying that's what's happening necessarily, but I'm just saying like, whoa, that would be an evolution of warfare, of like germ warfare, which is in the beginning of thinking about germ warfare, the idea is like, it's just fucking spread a plague. Let's launch the plague dog into the castle that's under siege, let everybody die in there or get so sick, they don't care if they're alive. And then we've got the castle, no problem, right? This is like, let's launch something into the castle that doesn't kill them, just terrifies the shit out of them so that they end up opening the gates so that we come in to save their fucking asses. And now we've got the people and the castle, ultimate victory. Definitely the ultimate victory. Now, my question on that is what's the end game? Because usually the people who would have the means to pull something like that off already ruled the game. They, you know, they don't need to turn you into something. You're already their little slave, you know? Because to some degree, they already pull all the strings, you know? It's kind of like the famous, the Trump line, right? You know, I could shoot somebody in the middle of the street and I wouldn't lose a vote. So if you are already feeling that there's that level of power and realistically, you know, a lot of the people who are pulling the strings are at that level of power. Why would you even need to create a whole upheaval? And, you know, he's like, you already got what you want. Some of the people who have something to gain are the ones who are not there yet. But usually the ones who are not there yet is they don't have the means to pull it off. Well, see, this is the pro this this now. OK, so this part of it is a great point. But the means to pull it off if this isn't a very important thing for people to realize these days is that there, you know, 20 years ago, there is no fucking way you and I will be having this conversation because we didn't have the means to pull it off, right? You know? But now we do thanks to the evolution of technology, which is not just limited to podcasting, YouTube, which, you know, at this point, people are everyone just takes it for granted. But it's like, everyone, if you want to start your own network, you can start your own network. Like with like, if you want to start, if you have the time, you could buy a webcam and start your own network. You could have segments and shows every day. Now the shows are going to be shit, but you know, one show could be look at my wall as time passes for an hour. And then after look at my wall as time passes for an hour, we're going to you can see a live footage of my dog sleeping. And then after that, I'm going to come on and talk about, you know, my little pony. And then after that, you could have your own network for lit for like with the cost of the computer and the webcam, probably 600 bucks is going to be a shitty network. No one's going to watch it, but you can do that now. And so that doesn't just stop with, you know, that kind of technology, which, which by the way, it's just like the power of that is so profound and we already talked about that earlier on anybody, you know, with, with a mildest bit of, I mean, imagine Jim Jones if he had fucking Twitter, you know, imagine that charismatic motherfucker, if he had a YouTube channel and was able to restrain his, uh, you know, insanity enough to like convey to people that there was not a potentially murderous messianic lunatic living behind that like rock star face, you know what I mean? Like, holy fuck, he could have caused some trouble, man. So it's safe to say that at this point, we've got a lot of Jim Jones out there who are like really restraining themselves, um, as they gather their flocks, so to speak. So, but it doesn't just stop with communication technology and psychic contagion. It literally moves into people's ability to, to engineer their own fucking viruses, man. What are they called VRI? I don't know what the plural of viruses. I'm sorry, but so the assumption used to be, you know, this is being done by people who have massive, like if you want to engineer a bio weapon, you need to have massive resources. It might not be like that anymore. Right. And the, that means that, look, I mean, think of like PETA, they do can't, they do psychic warfare all the time. Think of not just PETA, any like, you know, uh, social movement that has views that some, that, you know, maybe you could say the majority sees extreme, like they have throughout history, people like that have caused massive change to the point where the extreme views no longer seem extreme. And these aren't state entities. These are just clusters of people, cobbles of people who have a shared intent. And so, yeah, I think the, you know, one of the things that is a little disconcerting is that I don't know if the assumption that a bio weapon is going to, is the assumption that if a bio weapon exists, it's made by a state agency is necessarily, I don't know if that, if you can assume that anymore, just based on people's access to technology. The game has changed. Meaning that, you know, so, you know, this is where you run into the future of society, which is that increasingly smaller factions of people with extreme viewpoints for better or for worse, have access to more powerful technology and have the ability to potentially shut the entire planet down. And during that shutdown, disseminate ideas that prior to the shutdown might have seemed extreme. You know what I'm saying? And if we know historically that this does happen, this does happen. Look at fucking the, I'm sorry, I've just been watching this creepy ass documentary on Netflix about the Nazis. And look at what happened, man, the Great Depression. The Great Depression happens and that's when they made their move. And you know what I mean? So it's not, it's not what I'm saying. I'm not like Alex Jones over here. It's like this, that there's a historic precedent for these types of events to happen throughout history. I'm sure you're aware of a million more than I am. No, no, of course. I mean, in fact, that's one of the funny things about the so-called conspiracy theories that just because 90% of conspiracy theories are bad shit crazy, doesn't mean they all are because then you know that there are others that are 100% true. And that's what kind of sometimes makes it complicated because by definition, conspiracies are a secret. So, you know, you have to dig through some limited evidence to try to figure out which one is the real one. And of course, people sometimes can run a little too far with the evidence and, you know, make up stuff that's not there. But at the same time, there's also stuff that really does happen. And so that's what makes it complicated. And just because it's sound outlandish doesn't mean either way. You know, it doesn't mean it's the real deal just because governments have fucking things or not just government, as you say right now, because that the game has changed, but like just because there have been things like that doesn't mean that they are all true. And vice versa, just because most of them are crap doesn't mean they all are. And that's what makes it a tricky business. But then of course, then you get the exactly the Alex Jones kind of thing where it's like, I realize that there's an audience for this and I'm just going to run with every single one I have a year and I'll make up a few along the way because these might be else. Right. Yeah. Well, or, you know, I don't, you know, honestly, I don't think Alex Jones, I think for him, you know, it's, I think like, you know, you can, you can just end up. There's a slippery slope, I think that happens to a person. If you're not careful, it happened. This happened to me before where you forsake logic and, you know, you become, you let your sort of the, your North star become your passion or what you think of as your infallible, fear-based instincts and a general distrust of humanity. And then, you know, you get this dark confirmation bias that takes you down the slippery slope and the next thing, you know, you think that, you know, people who are running the show can turn themselves into lizards and you really believe that once you, you know, then, then, then the next thing, you know, you're like, what, listen, let me tell you. If I saw fucking Joe Biden turn himself into a lizard, you better believe that's all I talk about from now on. I would not hold back. Like I would change the name of my podcast, if Biden's a lizard and I would just say, I saw it, I don't care. I saw it happen. There are fucking lizard people out there, but, you know, the, the symbolically, maybe I could understand that, but I don't think literally it happens. That being said, uh, and, and, you know, I'm not, I feel like I'm doing my own form of fear mongering right here. I don't know what the fuck is happening with this pandemic. I have found generally the boring answer is the right answer. It's some sad version of Occam's razor, which is the least exciting thing is what's happened usually, usually, but this, this is why I love talking about you because you know, historically, sometimes that's not the case. Sometimes historically brilliant people utilize powerful strategy over time to invade, to gain power, to just take the reins of history and gallop off into their own fucking future. This is not conspiracy theory. This is real. We know it. It's called the American fucking revolution. You know, it happens. People gather in the shadows and they say, I don't want to pay taxes to, to the fucking England anymore. And they have to gather in shadows and do that because if they don't, they're going to get arrested. And then there's a revolution. And so to imagine that people aren't gathering in shadows right now during a time where there is so much economic disparity, so much exploitation of workers. So much, uh, environmental catastrophe and so seemingly little care at all from the world leaders. And if they do care, it only seems shrill and confused to imagine that during this time, there aren't very intelligent people getting together thinking, listen, I'm sorry, I don't want my fucking kids to have to row a boat through sewage to get to school because sea levels have gone up. I don't want my kids to be part of the vast refugee crisis. That's going to happen when coastal cities are no longer inhabitable. And so knowing that, uh, we're going to have to do something that, you know, history can judge us for it. I'm just saying it's not unprecedented. I mean, why wouldn't people do that? Liluni tunes, fucking dumb ass Nazis, you know, they did it because they thought Jews were somehow evil. Right. You know, they were that fucking crazy. But in this case, we're looking at like, again, I'm sorry, man, I don't mean to be on this rant, but it's, you could just see how in the same way, like we want to have faster phones, there's market pressure to have faster phones. You could see how if the majority of the world's scientists are coming out and saying, Oh man, this planet, you don't necessarily want to be here in 60 years. Right. How, whether, whether that's true or not, no matter what, you could just see how if enough people started believing that and they weren't seeing movement on the part of the state to do the things they needed to be done to make sure that our kids aren't going to be living in some fiery swamp, then I don't know. There's some market pressure there for folks to start taking things into their own hands. I'm not saying that's what happened. No, no, no, but I get it. I completely get it. And it's also interesting when you were mentioning the Jim Jones example, because, you know, in some cases, this type of stuff is done by very lucid minds who have a clear goal and that's what they want to achieve. In other cases, like the Jim Jones and just about every other cult in history and plenty of dictators is a mix of having a plan and kind of getting lost in your own weird mental illness where, you know, you start believing the stuff you make up, you know, it's like I had a grandma who she would, you know, reality was never quite good enough for her. So she would have to, she felt like I lied, right? She made up stuff all the time about things that happened. And then, but the funniest thing was that within about five minutes, she would believe it and it was pretty clear that that made up a version of events she just created was reality to her at that point. Yeah, you're like, wow, OK, that changes things a little bit because it's not just you are cynically making it up because you want to achieve something. You're also your own first victim and your first victim. That's great. That's cool. Yeah, I mean, the Jim Jones thing is like it's wild because on one hand, Jim Jones was 100 percent sincere in what he was doing. And on the other hand, he was just a lion manipulator at the same time. There's a great series, by the way. I don't know if you had a chance to check it out. There's a phenomenal podcast in Daryl Cooper, who's doing like a multi hour series on the Jim Jones stuff. I can't for the life of me pronounce the name of the podcast. I'll have to require Savannah Selp. How do you pronounce it? Martyr Maid. Martyr Maid. OK, thank you. So, yeah, he has he's in the middle of the series where he ties it to the civil rights movement, to what was going on with Jim Jones kind of personal psychology and all of that. And he'll really give you like suddenly you understand why people are drinking Kool-Aid in Guyana, you know, suddenly it doesn't seem as insane anymore. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, God, it's not to me. This is the sort of where you do end up veering into this dark place where you you realize, oh, my God, if we truly just entered the realm of pure absurdity, and you know, it's like shit, you know, that at least those people who are dancing, you know, you know, they they were like they could only do it for a limited time right because they would die or have heart attacks or whatever. But, you know, what happens when you just look at like entire planet of people who are, you know, at least prior to this pandemic, they weren't dancing, but they were getting in cars and driving to an office where they would sit in a cubicle next to a person that they would only see if they were going to use the bathroom or have lunch. And they might, you know, maybe a few times a week, they would have meetings where their bodies would all gather together and they would say things that they could easily have just said over a computer. And on top of that, there was a superstition attached to it, a kind of religious sentimentality related to their meetings and meeting culture, as it's called, so that they would think to themselves, there is no way that this can be as effective if we don't get our physical bodies next to each other. And now at least what we're finding is actually it's still fucking works. And I don't, to me, I don't know where the voice is. There needs to be a voice of someone being like, wait a minute. So you mean the last 15 years of my life where I've been driving two hours in and two hours out in thick fucking traffic to get my body next to other bodies? That was just a symbolic gesture to satiate some lunatic CEO's superstitious idea that human bodies need to be next to each other if we're going to be productive. So like all those two hours, me being away from my family, all that shit was completely unfucking necessary just because some power hungry fucking CEO. It's the same thing as believing in witchcraft. It's the same thing believing the witches are souring the milk, only in this case, to this day, you have like, I think it was a Microsoft CEO lamenting, lamenting the inability to have in person meetings. And it's like that lament that if, you know, you wanted to hear the sound of COVID, that's what it sounds like. You know what I mean? Some fucking guy is making a million dollars, 10 million dollars a month or whatever he's making, saying, oh, you know, I just, I need the bodies of my workers together in the same space so they can smell my fucking pheromones as I control them, you know? The last three minutes of your speech is one of the greatest threads I've ever heard. And by the way, in a comedic kind of way, but also in a very literal kind of way. It's exactly what I've been thinking for quite even before the pandemic, to be honest, he was one of the singers, like a lot of the shit that we're doing just makes no sense. This idea that people granted there are jobs that you need to do in person, for sure. But there are plenty of those that, you know, so many jobs that don't need it. And so your three minute rant or whatever long it was, should be published on every news media, should be the top video on YouTube, because I think it's absolutely key to shaping the kind of stuff we're going to be doing in the future, because you're right. I mean, the stuff that this idea of everybody getting into their metal box to drive to a cubicle somewhere to be miserable away from their family, it just makes no sense. You know, it's something that never made sense. It may have made sense in pre-internet days, where you did need to type something out and physically hand it to somebody and be right there. But post-internet has been completely ridiculous. It's one of the things that I think has existed because people who went through it wanted other people to is almost like hazing, right? It's like I had to deal with this shit. So now you're going to what? You think you're going to work at home? You think you're going to be on the beach typing away while you're playing with your kids? Hell no. You need to come to the office and suffer the same way I did. That's right. You better not be in fucking bed, by the way. If you're doing your zoom meetings, you better not be in bed. You've got to be at least looking like you're that's the other piece of it. These people are having to like do shit like home there and stuff for the zoom meeting to symbolically give some indication that they're still adhering to this ancient ritual, which is pointless. It was, but there was a point. You're absolutely right in the era of file cabinets. Yeah, we needed to, you know, have people taking printed out shit from office to office to hand to people, but we're just not in that age anymore. And so yeah, man, to me, hopefully this, this is something I deeply hope is that folks who have experienced no reduction in productivity. And it's going to be the responsibility of the CEOs. They've got to abandon their superstitious qualities. They have to let go of it. They have to admit to themselves. You can just secretly admit it to yourself that part of the reason you wanted to have meetings is because you are a fucking lonely megalomaniac and you just felt powerful in your meetings. Like that was it. You needed that feeling because, you know, whatever, it didn't work out for you in your personal life. And so that, that to me is like, you just have to acknowledge like, oh shit, damn, I didn't mean to like, I was acting like some kind of king or something. I'm not a king. I'm just a person who got lucky and worked hard and had a, has a cool job. But man, I shouldn't be torturing my fellow human beings. And I think the workers, I really hope at the very least fight tooth and nail for the right to work from home and that, and that not only fight tooth and nail, but fight tooth and nail to be paid more for working from home. Because if we reduce office space, then the workers should be making extra money because the CEOs and the people are no longer going to have to pay exorbitant amounts for commercial real estate. Correct. And so, and still this is what I'm hoping is like the big businesses like Twitter, who are like leading the way in this regard, I think they, they're going to see there's a profit there to be made too, while empowering their workers, and then I'm done after this and I'm sorry. No, it was perfect. I love it. We, we have to open up the space for workers if they want to get together and work in the old way to do that too. Because some people do not have the ability to work from home because they don't live in a place that's a huge privilege. If you can do that. So, so we, you know, there, there has to also be a non shaming complete invitation for workers to come work in a, in a, in a, you know, probably a less expansive office space, you know, cause that's the truth. Some people just can't work from home. They've got like roommates and shit. They don't have an internet connection. Their neighbors are loud. They can't concentrate or they just like work. They like being there. You know, all those things are fine. It just needs to be a choice. Exactly. Absolutely. And that's what it boils down to. You know, it's not, you don't have a system that works for everybody all the time, but certainly some systems work better than others. And then you just have to tweak them and make the necessary adjustments. So that, yes, it doesn't become the new dogma of everybody need to do it this way, where it may work best for 80% of the people, but it screws up 20% of the people. Well, you don't want to do that just because it works good for a majority of people. Yeah, let's do it for them and figure out what we can do for the remainder. Cause that's ultimately how you make good change rather than jump in from one partially good system to another partially good system. And that's the way it goes. Absolutely. That's the way it goes. Then, you know, let's take the sum total of all the money for one month that no longer has to get paid for commercial real estate, for the gasoline to drive to the fucking office. Let's pay for, let's take all that money that doesn't have to go from the health insurance companies to pay for the mini car accidents that happen every day as people are driving to a place they didn't need to be in the first place. Let's take all that extra money that appears and invest that in some kind of virtual reality technology that is indiscernible from reality itself. So that if workers want to, they can, they can hang out with each other using some kind of futuristic, you know, technology that we don't have yet. And then the moment you do that, you achieve the goal, I think of all true hippies, which is a form of non-terrannical globalism, because the globalism that we're all afraid of is the one where you get like, you know, some group or a counselor, God forbid one person run in the whole planet. But this version of globalism is suddenly the workers of the world can start working together and without being constrained by the borders of countries and states, or by being limited by not being like physically in the same place as the stupid tower of boredom that they're of their office. You know what I mean? So now suddenly these beautiful collaborative spaces start opening up in virtual space, pay people in fucking untraceable Bitcoin. What now suddenly? What do we got, man? You know what I mean? Now we've got a renaissance popping off, you know? But shit, if this thing ends and everybody's like, yeah, I guess I'll just go back to work because that makes sense because they want me to. But even though everything would seem to be fine here, oh, it's going to be so disappointing. And, and, ah, man, you know, I do think like in that way, you know, there, if I get to infect the wound with my own desires and intent, it would be that man, just some post pandemic digital utopia, where we get a four hour work week, people no longer have to go to the office and they still get compensated for that day that they don't go in. And that money is to pay for their working from home. Thank you, everybody. Please vote for me in the next election. Yes, Duncan Trussell for president, I'm down. And if I can add one piece to that puzzle, which I think is absolute perfection, what you are describing is that what happens next also is that cities become obsolete to some degree because you don't need to all live in super expensive, limited space, because that's where the jobs are. You can be living anywhere on earth. You can be living by the ocean, hanging out in a place where is not prime real estate. And it's cool because you don't have that physical presence that's constantly required. So suddenly, rather than having this insane urban density that creates its own set of problems, people can choose to live wherever they want, close to their friends, having more space, having more land. And speaking of every more land that to me touches on the other thing that the pandemic has shown, which is the suicidal separation that people have from food production, the fact that if suddenly the trucks have stopped moving for two weeks, you starve. The idea that instead, at least to some degree, everybody could and should plant some of what they eat, which, of course, you can't. If you're living a seven hundred square foot apartment in the city with no space whatsoever, but if suddenly you can move out of the city and you do have a little more space, now you can't plant a garden and you can get some of your food from it. Well, yeah, you know, yeah, you could have collective garden spaces. Also, man, there's new technology, these beautiful like UV lights that you can hang on your wall and grow your own food. There's all kinds of opportunities to do that. But yeah, you're exactly right. It's like within this, like, you know, again, this all comes down to individuals have to do this. We all have to do this. You know, like if it's not going to come from up top, it's not going to come from the pheromone vampires who literally want you pinned up in a place like cattle while they fucking just like, you know, go into their, they're like smelling your shit. You know what I mean? They're literally going in the bathroom after you've taken a big dump and like smelling your shit. It's really gross. It's like, you know, they're not, they're not the, these, these shit smelling pheromone vampires, they're not going to do this. They're, you know, probably cause they're addicted to power. So, and again, I'm not trying to demonize all CEOs. Not all of them are bad. I'm just saying many of them are a little superstitious. Many of them don't want to come in either. But, but, but the ones that do, you know, they're going to fight against this. And so there's, you know, we're going to have to do this ourselves. It has to be an individual decision to figure out a way to, you know, I don't know. I don't know if it's like a form of union, a new kind of union where workers are like, listen, we're not going to come to the office anymore. We want to keep doing the job, but we don't need to be there anymore. You know that we know that. So we're, we're going to work from home now and you're going to pay us to work from home and you're still going to make more money because you're not going to pay for commercial real estate. And yeah, and then also, man, this is the kind of thing where it's like, damn, why, why are we in these cities? If not for getting our meat bodies together during the day, you know, then maybe the cities, what happens to the cities though, Danieli? No, and in fact, it's not that they disappear. They don't, because there's still stuff that, you know, if I want to, you know, there are a bunch of activities that are physical activities that you can really substitute, you know, is like, I, I know so many people into martial arts who are royally screwed right now because they, you know, it's not the same thing. You can't really do martial arts on Zoom. I mean, people cry and it's, you know, okay, sure, you can do it for a few weeks. It's better than nothing, but it's not the same thing. So there are things where being close to other human beings help a whole lot and you need it. So it's not that they disappear, but if you can take 30% of the pressure and 30% of people start distributing elsewhere. Now, the people who are left in the cities have a much easier time and an easier life because there's less traffic, there's less pressure on water, there's less pressure on space. People who are not in the city have an easier, everybody wins, you know, it's like everybody can, it's not a cities from one day to the next disappear. Not everybody wins. No, but it's, it improves things considerably. But no, man, the people in the beautiful, rustic areas of the world that up until this point have been uninhabited by us city dwellers, because we can't get to work if we go there. Watch out. Yeah, but there are a lot of those areas, you know, even if you take a huge percentage of the population and spread it around the world, you still have probably really low population density in plenty of areas. Is that true? Well, the world is a pretty big fucking place, right? And, you know, the overwhelming, a lot of people are concentrated in some centers, you know, if you go to, I mean, even in the United States today, go to Wyoming, go to Montana. I think if I remember correctly, Montana, I one pointed a statistics that are way more cows than human. And, you know, that tells you something, you know, that clearly there are spaces that are very, very wide where there really are very few people. Beautiful. Man, it's beautiful. I mean, this is a real possibility for our civilization. And I just feel like with a reason that, you know, it's, it's, it's an embarrassment when you, I mean, not really embarrassing, but because there's no one to be embarrassed anymore, they're all dead. But like what you were saying about the dancing thing, it's like, you know, it's embarrassing to even imagine that level of insanity, you know, and it's easy for us to take this lofty modern look, look back at the explanations they're giving for this hysterical dancing and judge it. And then God, they're really out of their fucking minds. But clearly in the future, they're going to look back at us and be like, damn, they were out of their fucking minds. They had this insane technology that would allow them to be anywhere on the planet they wanted to be, but they still wanted to gather together in their towers of doom. And, you know, right. And, and like, so this, this has got to be like, we've got to like, you know, start waking up to that, not just that, but man, what are some of the other ways? What do you think are some other, by the way, do you have time? I feel like this is okay. Can you, what do you think are some of the other like superstitious, sentimental, you know, societal habituations that we're engaged in that are lowering our quality of life out of an allegiance to a way of being that just doesn't have to be that way anymore? Well, I really think that that, and they all tie together that idea of remote work tied with an ability to live anywhere you want, tied with the fact that you can create modern tribes at this point, that it doesn't have to be a more lonely, a lonelier existence, it can be actually a more, there can be more human connection because the people that you live next to are people you choose to live next to, because you can get a place all next to each other. So you can create in some sense modern villages that yet they are tied to a wider world through technology, through the fact that you can hop on an airplane and go anywhere you want. And then with that, you have connection with food and nature, so that you can also spend some of your time raising your own food, eating way better stuff than you do from pre-packaged crap you buy at the store. And so now you have better human interactions, better food, better relationship with nature, better time management and places where you live. So, you know, from architecture down to nutrition, it can all be tied together in a pretty different way of living. I love it, man. You know what? You're inspiring me. I think what we should all do is move to, I don't know, French Guiana is, you know, that place I'm talking about, maybe start a town, we'll call it Bolleli town. Yeah, I think that's a, it has a ring to it. I like it. Yeah, it'd be really cool. We just all gather together there. We could fly in, fly out whenever we want. Well, I mean, most of us could fly in and fly out whenever we wanted. Some people would need to stay. I love it, but I'm looking forward to a new Netflix show, Duncan Trussell starring in the war against the shit-smelling pheromone vampires. I know I'm tuning in, you know, if that's what you want. We must fight. Please tune in. I mean, don't just, listen, here's the, listen, again, I feel at this point in my old age, you know, look, I'm a shit-smelling pheromone vampire. You know what I mean? Like I've had meetings that are unnecessary. And, and, but it's just like, you know, so I don't mean to like, you know, we can't villainize anybody in the same way in the beginning, we're talking about like, look, just recognize we've all been infected with superstition to some degree. There's real things and, and, and in the sense, quantifiable, verifiable things. But then you just got to understand that the odds are pretty good. You've, you've got a little bit of a psychic contagion. If you've become addicted to office life, or if you will imagine that's the best way to do things, that's all. If you're, you, you know, a shit-smelling pheromone huffing CEO vampire, uh, can easily just have a epiphany and realize like, oh my God, like, well, I guarantee they don't necessarily want to be at that office. It's got to be grueling. You know what I mean? Like it's got to be like insane to know that you're spending most of your time in this office going up and down elevators and having these crazy fucking meetings. When you could be at your like, you know, these people have like plasma pools of stem cells that they soak in and reverse age, you know, they have literal harems. I'm sure they're not necessarily excited about some of them fly helicopters to work. Yeah. You know what I mean? That's how much they, they, they, they don't want to be in traffic. So I'm sure they would be happy to be at their mansions too. Uh, well, listen, man, I, I, if you, you know, we, you're in Oh, hi. Maybe I'll make the Oh, hi migration. My family, we've all been talking about like the same thing. I think everyone in the big cities is having some form of the conversation, which is like, well, if we can't go, you know, if this stuff is going to stay closed down, or if it's going to temporarily open up and then shut down again. And we don't know how that, when that's going to happen. And also just, you know, it probably isn't like great for the planet for us to be living here and also why the fuck are we paying so much money for rent? You know, I think everyone's having this conversation. It's just, we got to figure out like, where do we go? Right. What's the place we go to? Cause that is to me, like all that's left for me in LA, if like standup is done, if like, you know, I can't go out to eat anymore. If everything's shut down and if that's indefinite, or if it's going to open up kind of, and then shut down again is my friends, right? You know? And so, but that is a really, that to me is like worth way more than any of that other bullshit, you know, but that's, that's the hard part is thinking like, damn, I'm going to, you're, you know, you're, you're, you're far away now, man. Yeah. But at the same time, that's what I like about a place like where I'm at right now is that I am and I'm not. Cause realistically, if I want to hop in a car and come to LA, it takes me about an hour and a half, which is not even that much more than typical LA traffic crap when I'm way closer, but there's so much traffic that it takes almost a long anyway. So I'm like, yeah, I mean, do I want to commute from here to Los Angeles every day? Hell no. But you're not going to have to. Exactly. But if I don't have to, and I can, I'm still within striking distance that if I have to come in for some reason, I can do it. No problem. It's sort of the perfect, the perfect match for me, where it's not, you know, you are in the middle of nowhere where, yeah, you have to hop on a plane and do all these crazy things to actually see other, you know, it's close enough that is doable, but far enough that I have a little more breathing room. So come visit me. Come check it out. See if it's to your liking. Well, no, actually, we're coming out there, we're coming out there next weekend. Now, I want to ask you this one last question. Yeah, if suddenly you didn't ever, if you just knew all of a sudden, you're never going to have to go back to LA, would you still stay in Ohio or would you maybe consider somewhere else? I mean, oh, it's great. It's, I like it right now, but of course, the possibilities are endless, right? So it's like, if it becomes something like that, then one can look around and realize, oh, maybe there are other places or maybe this is perfect. You know, there are a bunch of options at that point is it becomes a fun game to play. Mr. Bilelli, it is such a joy chatting with you. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

191^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - MAGICK CLASS WITH JASON LOUV Transcript and Discussion^2014-06-11^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello pals, it is me, Duncan Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, and I am particularly excited about this episode because it is about one of my favorite subjects on Earth. Magic. Not magic like watching some depressed guy pull weasels out of a top hat at the Magic Castle, but MAGIC magic, which refers to that practice that is in every single world religion, in every single mythology, that series of rituals that allows human beings to access higher intelligence and use that information to transform the world around them. Always been fascinated by that. It's a fascinating topic, not just because what's cooler than the idea that we are surrounded by super intelligent beings that you can tune into using special hidden rituals that date back to before the time of the pyramids, but because as a mythology, it is something that is managed to thread its way through history, and it scares the shit out of certain people. They get scared by it. Just study the witch burnings, and you'll see that this technology referred to in so many books, new and old, has always been considered somehow off limits, off base, it's breaking the rules to use this magic, and there's always an implicit danger in practicing magic. And from terrified Christian preachers talking about the dangers of meddling with the occult and a simple YouTube search, and you'll bring up 7,000 sermons of these pale-faced, anxiety-ridden, paranoid who think that the act of invoking extra-dimensional beings can not only lead to personal catastrophe, but can also lead to the damnation of the soul. So that's another fascinating component about magic. It's not just, is it real? Could it be that there are higher dimensions inhabited by beings that we can contact using these specific incantations and rituals in modes of shifting consciousness, but that the very idea that it could be possible terrifies fundamentalists from Christianity to Islam to, you name it, and every religion will have some kind of admonishment against practicing these things or communicating with disembodied beings. So that makes it cool too, because whenever anyone tells you not to go there, the first thing that you wanna do is go there. And since I was young hearing about this stuff, it wasn't just hearing about the fact that there's something called magic or my first contact with tarot cards, for example, it was that these very things were terrifying to Christians and to superstitious people. And so the fact that there was a group of people who believed that certain things had a kind of a metaphysical toxicity that emanated out of them made that thing that much more compelling and interesting to study. To this day, there are friends that I have where if I have tarot cards around them, they get a little weirded out. Not weirded out like, do you really fucking believe that stupid shit, but weirded out like, cross yourself in Transylvania, that the vampire just went by. That's amazing that in the modern age, this Western mythology, this thing that they call esotericism, still manages to scare people, still manages to set off paranoia alarms in people when they consider that you could communicate with disembodied beings. It's the language, of course. The language itself is terrifying. You could say the exact same thing in a different way. For example, take my course and I'll teach you how to become inspired again and overcome your writer's block and connect once again to the creative part of yourself. And then that just seems like some kind of writing class or a self-help class or something like that. You could say it like that, but if the symbols that you use to describe the potentiality of every human being to intentionally connect with an epiphany, if the language you use involves other beings, externalized disembodied beings, or even if it refers to archetypical parts of the self, it still will scare people and sound like the occult. So we've been reduced to talking about inspiration and the very difficult to believe pin down moment that we've all had where a great idea pops into our head. And we say, ah, this is it, the light bulb moment. That light bulb moment, if you could control it and have that light bulb moment whenever you wanted to have it or if there were techniques that would bring you closer to moments of epiphany, then instead of it being something completely out of your control, then your life would exponentially improve because any time that you wanted to have a transmission of higher information, you could have it. And that's what magic's all about. It's just another symbol structure that people use to describe the enormous potentiality that all human beings have within them. And it just so happens that the symbols being used are generally of angels, gods, demigods, devas, deities, and generally invisible beings that if you do the right series of actions, then these beings will share their great wisdom with you. And that, yes, the very act of contacting these beings contains within an implicit danger. And this danger is written about not just in Christian fundamentalist books that you might find at the used bookstore about some teenager who stumbles upon the Necronomicon and manages to gain some fame and popularity that ultimately results in a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but this warning can actually be found in the magic books themselves. And the practitioners will always tell you, be careful with this path because it is a super potent thing that can teach you and lead you to a higher state of consciousness, but it can also drive you mad. And that's fun to think about. So I'm super happy that Jason Loof took the time to be in this episode of the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast. We're gonna get to the interview, but first, some business. So you finally did it. You managed to translate the dark and twisted runes that you found within the brown ancient pages of that strange book that your grandmother had left tucked underneath her mattress just above the playgirls. You use those runes to make contact with a higher intelligence, some kind of super intelligent being, an angel, alien, deva, goddess, who knows? You're not sure, but the information this being filled you with is so powerful that you know the not logical next step is to blog about it. And you know that if you hire a web designer to distribute this information out into the world, the power and potency of this thing that you have come to understand would drive the web designer insane. And you don't wanna have the blood of some poor HTML coder on your hands. You don't wanna get that phone call hearing about how Larry, after looking at the text you wanted to publish, plunged his fingers, covered in a fresh coat of Doritos dust directly into his eyeballs and ripped out his eyes, feeding them to his cat, and then running naked into traffic, exploding himself on the front of a passing semi. Is that, do you want blood on your website? This information is too potent to allow it to travel through a web designer. You've gotta plug it right into the collective and the best way to do it is by going to squarespace.com and signing up for a membership. You can also sign up for a two week trial membership if you wanna see if Squarespace is the right service for you for building a website. It's a great site. We are currently using it for the PodRift project, which you've probably heard me talk about where we're trying to bring a podcasting into VR space. So if you go to PodRift.com, we built that site using Squarespace. You can get much more detailed than that though. They have every single thing that you need. They have a shopping cart function. You can stream music. You can do whatever it is that you need to do to allow the super intelligent transmission that came to you from the ancient entity that you contacted using the rituals written about in the ancient manuscript covered in human skin that you found underneath the still warm mattress of your sweet darling Grammy. Just go to squarespace.com, use my name Duncan, and you will get 10% off. They also have incredible customer support. I tested it out to make sure because no matter how simple a web service is, it can still be quite complicated and you might just have some test, testical questions. I have a lot of those. You might have some technical questions that you just need help with and they'll get back to you right away. I tested this out. Also, the ultimate proof about how awesome Squarespace is is that Squarespace was used to build Squarespace. Go figure that out. Maybe some kind of time travel was involved. I don't really understand that and I haven't taken the time to, I guess you would build the service. I don't know how they did it. I don't know, so they're time travelers too. So, do you wanna go through, do you wanna deal with your web designer going insane or even worse, do you wanna end up getting sucked in by some kind of pseudo web designer? Let me tell you, there's literally 400 million pseudo web designers existing on planet Earth at this moment according to a recent Levy Bergensen study. So, there's a lot of people out there disguised as web designers who want nothing more than to find out your address and climb into your window at night and lay on top of you as you try to sleep. And it's awkward and annoying and it's happened to a lot of us and it's just not worth it. There are great web designers out there in the same way that there's people in the government who can turn themselves into reptiles. It's just difficult to find them and when you do find them, they want a lot of money. And they deserve the money because actually coding a website takes years and years and years of experience. Anyway, this is a great way for you to dip your necromancer toe into the rivers of the internet without having to either destroy the mind of a web designer or risk getting laid on by a sweaty dude who smells like old magic cards and chewed up clove cigarette butts. Squarespace.com put my name in. Duncan, you will get 10% off. Speaking of magic, I'm really excited to announce that the new Duncan Trussell Family Hour t-shirts designed by the great illustrator Ron Regi are gonna be in the store tomorrow. If you're listening to this on Tuesday in June, then they're going to be in the store on Wednesday. These, this is my favorite design yet and it's not only because it's awesome and Ron Regi is an incredible artist who has truly created a magical thing, but because when I told him what I would like in the shirt, it was just that I want it to be an actual sigil that can ward against negative energy. And so he incorporated a lot of different alchemical symbols into this shirt so that not only do you get to have a really cool t-shirt that just looks awesome, but you will be wearing a magical ward that will push away the poison psychic darts that your nemesis might be throwing at you through the astral plane. And if you don't believe in that bullshit, it's just a cool shirt. So go to dunkintrussell.com and check out the shop and see if you like it and order one. And finally, as always, we are brought to you by amazon.com. If you go to dunkintrussell.com and go through our Amazon portal, the next time you're buying something from them, then they'll give us a very small percentage of anything that you buy and it doesn't cost you anything extra. There's no point in venturing out into the world when you could be sitting in front of your glowing skull candle, muttering incantations, or riding your bicycle into nature. Why spend your time listening to malarial, measle-ridden children spray their diseased mucus all over the shelves of whatever chain store you were thinking about going to when you could be inhaling the sweet magical perfume of your lover's neck or watching dear frolic and whatever wilderness is near your home.

He also teaches an online course on metaphysics and magic that you can find by going to magic.me, m-a-g-i-c-k-dot-m-e. And if you are listening to this on the week of June 10th, then you can sign up for an online class this weekend. And if you put my name in Duncan, you'll get 10% off. So if you like this interview with Jason and you wanna go deeper into the world of magic, go to magic.me, m-a-g-i-c-k-dot-m-e and sign up for the course for the weekend. Let me know how it goes, because I might wanna sign up for one of these courses eventually, but I'm going to be traveling into nature this weekend. So I'll be away from a computer. Hopefully I'll be away from a computer. I'll have all those links located at DuncanTrussell.com. Thank you guys so much for listening and for putting up with my rants and long advertisements and for just existing in this universe with me. I love you all. Now everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, the new magical advisor to the podcast, the great Jason Louv. Always Be Stingy Every time I Omit All right, there we go. We're rolling, Jason, welcome. Don't tell Ketrussel Family our podcast. I've been I'm really excited about this. I met you. You came to a comedy show that I did and you brought me this really cool book that you edited called Generation Hex. That's right. And can you tell me what that book? I mean, I read the book, but tell the listeners what the book's about. So that was my first book that I wrote in. Well, I didn't write it just myself. It's an anthology that I edited in 2005 that was put out by disinformation, which is it's kind of a look at where the Western magical tradition currently stands. And it's half practical writing, like Grimoire style writing and half autobiographical. So it focuses on young people and it kind of pitches magic as a youth culture. And when I when I was putting that book together, I knew maybe a dozen people that I could count on my hand to or into this stuff. Now it's everywhere. Right. It's like it seems to have almost eclipsed the youth culture. So either. And can you give the listeners the listeners? I never say that. Well, I suddenly just turned out weird radio show. Give me a definition of magic. How do you define magic? Every time I think about this, I come up with something else, but I'll give you a couple of different definitions. The poetic definition of magic is whereas a stage magician is interested in producing illusion for the entertainment of people. A real magician, so to speak, is interested in dispelling illusion. So removing illusions and showing people what's actually right there in front of your face. Because when you actually see reality just in its in all its glory, I mean, and I'm not trying to make it sound like a big deal. But when you actually just really grasp what's right in front of your face, you know, we do live in a magical universe and a truly profound, mystical, incredible process that we live in. And so magic is reminding you. It's a process of reminding you where you already are by dispelling the illusions that are kind of keep us from that. So that's the poetic definition. I think a more practical definition. Thank you. I think a more practical definition is it's a series of techniques called from different religious traditions around the world for altering consciousness. Now, a lot of people when they hear magic, they think they have a kind of, I don't know, primitive understanding of what it is. And they they think that you're actually creating some sort of change in the external universe using hidden powers, dark matter, using some kind of unknown field that runs through everything. You're enacting change. You're both of your definitions seem to the change as an internal change. Yes, there's a, you know, there's the classic hermetic dictum as above so below. And the idea that you can you can get magic powers and change things all around you and make everything groovy for yourself. It doesn't I think exactly what you said. It doesn't exactly work like that. It works when you make changes in yourself, then your experience of your entire existence changes because the universe is infinite. And the only thing keeping us from perceiving that is ourselves. So, you know, the word magic kind of conjures up a lot of what you said, you know, kind of frightening definitions or or making someone fall in love with you, making an enemy fall out of a building, making it rain, making. And this is, you know, if you, you know, that is like a lot of religions do involve wanting to create just basic change. And, you know, some religions say they don't use magic, even though they clearly are using magic like Christianity. When you pray, you're sort of it's the exact same thing, right? That's a form of magic you're trying. But what you're talking about is it seems like a layer behind all that or something that supersedes making changes in the world. And part of what we're dealing with here is a marketing problem, right? You know, I didn't come up with the word magic. It's unfortunate that word has been tacked on to the Western esoteric tradition, the Western mystical tradition. And it's a double edged sword because it's at once repulsive to anyone who has any type of rational capacity to think. And at the same time, it's it's fascinating. But do you read Ken Wilber at all? Yeah, well, I have quite some time ago, though. So he has a really a perfect concept for untangling some of this stuff, which is called the pre-trans fallacy, where he basically says, you know, in his his version of, by the way, Ken Wilber is, I guess, how we describe him. He's like kind of a Buddhist philosopher slash Alan Watts level teacher guy. Really intense, the best bald head in the universe. He's super buff. Yeah, he's like, yeah. In his late sixties, I think. Yeah, very healthy, disciplined version of, I don't know, the combination of Alan Watts, self-help stuff in there, too. He's got some serious devotees. Right. He's kind of like the real life Dr. Manhattan for a moment. There you go. That's that's what we were looking for. He's like Dr. Manhattan. So I don't totally agree with everything Ken Wilber says, but he has an excellent, excellent concept that he brings up in one of his books called the pre-trans fallacy, which basically he says, human beings and human cultures go through developmental stages. And the they start out in mythic reality. They go to magic and magic is actually in his viewpoint, one of the earliest stages of human development. In fact, human beings at around the age of seven go through a developmental stage called magical thinking, where you think that, you know, everything around you is is caused by you. So, for instance, the whole step on a crack thing. Yeah, never got out of that phase. Me neither, I don't think, but but he basically, he says that in the normal course of development, you kind of develop out of this into rational and then that cultures also develop out of this into rational modernist and then postmodernist thinking and that we're currently in a stage of postmodernism as a culture. But he says that after this are states that might be mapped by, for instance, the Western mystical tradition or Tibetan Buddhism or Vedanta, where you start to realize that, you know, that there is a divine component to human beings and that the more you tap into that, the more that you were aligned with the universe, the more that you work on yourself. That you, you know, that there is a type of ability to develop spiritually. But that's kind of what I was saying, where it's you're working on yourself, where you realize, you know, like Michael Jackson said, you know, you have to, if you want to make change, you have to start with the man in the mirror. Yeah, you realize that you are the the holographic projection of the universe. It's like, if you want to change the world, you have to start with yourself. You're the fountain head. You're the thing that everything's emerging from. You're the sprinkler. It's like, if you try to change the droplets that are already being projected out of the thing, it's you're you're being tricked by yourself. That is exactly why. Why do we hide from that knowledge? It seems like an an active there is an active part of humanity that does not want to accept the fact that they're seeing reflections of themselves all around them. It's so much more fun to believe or not more fun, but there's something that relieves us of responsibility when we imagine that we are being victimized by external forces and that if we change those external forces, then suddenly will become better. Right. Well, I think a couple points to that one is is, you know, Wilbur's final point on that is that what he called the pre-transfallacy is that for he says our culture is currently in a phase of postmodern development where it's like deconstruction. Everything has to be, you know, what we see from like Gawker blogs, right? But he says that to. What do you mean? What we see from Gawker blogs? Basically, well, he describes this as the green meme. I don't want to get too into technical discussion, but basically he says it in our current cultural period is a period of evolving out of religion where so we've left religion to the wayside. We depend on science, but there's no we we don't really have any guiding spiritual truth. So we're stuck in a period of deconstruction where everyone is constantly deconstructing everything that everyone says. So, yes, cynics, cynicism, sarcasm, lack of meaning. And the pre-transfallacy is that for people stuck in the postmodern worldview, they see states beyond that, like, for instance, what we were just talking about, all the stuff that you talk on your talk, talk about on your podcast for people think that that's pre-developmental. They confuse this with the earlier magic stages and think that this is a primitive way of thinking when, in fact, it's where, in fact, it's a more advanced way of thinking. You're talking about the return to the garden idea, right? Coming back to the Garden of Eden. Yeah, there's no going back. There's no going back. So but I think but in terms of why do people? There are so many answers to that question. You know, people are afraid of taking responsibility. They don't necessarily have access to the the information and the tools to do it, which is, you know, I think your podcast is great for that. Thanks. And it's not we're just getting, you know, we're we're currently in a period of evolving towards that that I think is more profound because of the internet, more profound, more accelerated and more effective than the consciousness, consciousness raising in the sixties was. Yeah, we're getting there. But it's more, it's I think it's more what's the word? It's insidious. People I think in the sixties, it was right in front of everyone's faces, like because the way that people were reaching other people was in a more public way. You go, you know, they have these huge events, beans and all those. You see these incredible pictures of like wood stock or like I was I can't remember which is a holy person at Maharishi Yogan. I don't remember which of them it is, but I have this great picture of him sitting in front of just a sea of people back in the sixties talking to them. The difference is we are right, you know, at this moment, you and I are sitting in front of an ocean of people who are listening to this, only we don't get to see them. So it's hidden. That's what's amazing about this change that's happening is that it's happening in a very secret way, which I think has got to be a nightmare to the powers that, you know, waged war against the the cultural revolution that was happening in the sixties. It was very easy to suppress too, because it was so out in front of you. Whereas this is just like people at work, people driving their car, people take walking their dog, but they're getting to hear this kind of information that way back in the day, if you wanted to get it out there, you'd have to print some kind of like, I don't know, a Xerox thing that you hand out to people or maybe publish a book, but still that you're exactly right. So the the it seems as though a spell has been cast on us by popular culture that we have, we are all we've all been hypnotized or sort of held captive by the the media corporations, commercials. These we have all these spells that have been placed inside of our minds that make us believe we're being original people when, in fact, we're just following cultural trends and we don't even know that we've been lured into that. Do you think that's true? I definitely think there's truth to that. And I used to assign a lot more, you know, sinister intent to, for instance, big media structures and things like that. But the more that I've worked in in big media and I used to work in advertising and the more that I've seen things from the other side of the curtain and, you know, the you know, the blog I'm running, Ultra Culture, you know, just, you know, every day having to depend on what can I do to get people's attention? What do people actually want? The more I realize that the media is actually as much as we're enthralled to the media, the media is even more enthralled to what the demand of the public is. Right. And so, for instance, the stuff you see on Facebook, you know, people will always have a demand for, you know, stories about school shootings or stories about anyone getting attacked by an animal. You know, like, yeah, exactly, right? Bear attacks, cougar attacks are fucking huge, man. If you, especially if someone was antagonizing an animal, if you can find a video of someone antagonizing an animal and then the animal clawing them, right? Oh, I'll click that. Yeah, I'll click that. That's glory or a matador being impaled by like that beautiful picture of the matador with a bull horn going through his balls. You can because it's like you get to enjoy universal justice. You know, you don't have to feel sorry for that guy so much because he was like sticking a monster with a spear. But if you post, OK, here's how to become enlightened by the Maharishi, you're going to get like 400 clicks. Yon, no, thanks. No, thanks. Nobody wants to hear that. It's fucking boring if it was something like how. Yeah, I know. So, yes, that's a challenge. So I think that it it, you know, the media is just a projection of us and they're enthralled to their advertisers, but they're more enthralled to the public. You know, the media has one simple job, which is to get the attention of people so they can sell they can sell that attention to advertisers. And so that's a crazy way to put that, man. Well, that's crazy. So they're like attention harvesters. They like have these attention farms where they grab human attention. And the same way people sell debt, they sell in attention. They're like, wow, check it out, man. I've got this acres and acres and acres of human attention just ready to be focused on your car, the car you're trying to sell. Now, if that's not magic, I don't know what is, man. And because isn't one of the big premises of magic that human attention, like if you're saying that we are by transforming our internal universe, this is the thing that will affect change and in our external universe, because everything around us is a kind of projection. Then that would mean that if you could control this attention, if you could control the if you can harmonize, in other words, if I can take a certain number of people and turn their attention in the direction of some paradigm, then that will create a kind of magnifying glass effect. You know, it's like now, instead of just having one person's internal universe shifting according to my persuasive idea of how things work, I have a million people who have shifted their attention in that way. And if anything is going to create a change in the external universe, shit, that would definitely be it. Absolutely. But it's got to come organically, right? I mean, you can't you can't force people to be into anything. So, you know, the reason that the media is focused on lowest common denominator stuff is because generally, that's what most people want. So it's very hard for somebody in a even Rupert Murdoch, right? I mean, he could put, you know, he could do broadcast Duncan Trussell to the entire planet, right? And it would be great. Um, the question is or or me or anybody, right? The question is, is that the the mass demand, you know, that's what we have to work with and our reality, you know, like I always used to be in the, you know, there's the classic Gnostic idea that reality is controlled and created by this Demiurge or this crazy being. What's he called the Demiurge? The Demiurge is the false creator God. Yeah, the blind. He's the one that the Romney's worship. Exactly, right? Tag most of all. Yeah, but the I think the reality is that we're all in charge of of this reality is created by the net of all human beings. Yes, it's just that their aesthetics don't necessarily appeal to maybe you or me, right? But Nancy Grace is real big for most people. Well, she's well, but, you know, again, if you go back to the fact that these are fucking attention harvesters of fishermen for attention, that they're trying to catch these little units, these packets of attention. That exist in every single person and focus them on these ridiculous things. You know, I know that you think it's not sinister, but God damn it. I think that's a sinister fucking act. Nancy Grace, for example, right by sucking the attention of all of us. You know, man, I was like misery harvesters. Well, yeah, they're what they do is I was I'm addicted to cycling. Sorry, you guys, I'm not going to go on another cycling rant. I've gotten addicted to cycling. There's a ride that goes up into Griffith Park. It goes on a closed road. Last night, I'm riding my bike up there, the sun setting. It is beautiful. No one's up there, man. It's just a closed road that goes up for probably four miles into Griffith Park of this hill. So it's like, you know, you have to be willing to go uphill for like an hour to even get up there. So no one's if you see anybody up there, it's these weird lycra cyclists with that like sort of gritting their teeth with that strange, obsessed look in their eyes. But I'm up there, man, and there's this rock you can go sit on. I'm sitting out in this rock, look in the sun setting. You can see Glendale. There's mist rolling in and I'm hearing in my fucking head, the narrator's voice for my shouldn't have survived. You know, like I'm thinking like, oh, that was the mountain lion attack. That's what happened. Yes, exactly. Yes, I'm imagining a fucking mountain lion sitting behind me, about to jump on me. I'm considering like, well, you know what? I didn't bring my fucking phone. So if a mountain lion drags me down this hill and like slowly eats me over the next couple of days, no one's going to know where I was. This is a classic. I shouldn't have survived. Now, if I don't know for sure, but I think if my mind hadn't in some way absorbed the the the the myriad of doom stories, which are actually very small compared to the Norton Norton, the number of nature experiences people had, then I would be able to be more likely to just be like, man, this is fucking beautiful, but this shadow runs through it. That's why I say it's sinister. That's why I think it's sinister. What the media is doing. Maybe not intentionally sinister, but God damn it. Oh, it is sinister. Absolutely. I just say that as I've understood the economics of it, more I understand why it is the way it is. But it's always been that way since the the days of Yellow Journalism in the 19th century, so you go back as they're doing the same stuff now that they did then, and it's always just harp on the negative. And but you're absolutely right. It has a it has a magical effect because the more you you focus on that, the more it becomes magnified in people's minds. And then that that defines people's reality. They think that's what reality is. And that leads to the fire. See that that the heat builds in people's minds. This is the alchemical friction, right? We have this heat building in the minds of a certain number of people. And the fire that breaks out is the societal change. And that is what they call trends, you know, like, well, what do you know? Will Ferrell did a fucking Range Rover commercial and six zillion people bought a fucking Range Rover. This is a fire created by people that I would consider magicians who are an exacting change in the universe that is designed to make they're basically in the same way as solar panel transforms sunlight into energy. The media translates attention into money. It's a converter. It turns our attention into action, which results in money for super wealthy people that we don't people. What? Like three people, three of the great, the great ones. They're wizards that we don't even know they are. They probably live in fucking towers. They probably are covered in weird tattooed runes. You know it already. But yet at the same time, I think that we live in probably the greatest period to be alive ever. You know, I mean, like when you think about, I mean, look, penicillin was only invented a few decades ago. You know, the birth control pill was only invented a few decades. Right. You know, people used to only live to like 30. Yes. And people look like shit, man. Cut back to the forties. If you look at people in the in their forties in the forties, they look like people in their eighties now. Right. So we live in a beautiful paradise planet. Yet at the same time, we're facing these civilization. Why does that real problems like climate change? Yes. And and that's not being focused on by the media at all. The New York Times shut down their environmental desk. It's not profitable for them yet. These are the real issues that we need to be to be focused on. So the media not only makes us feel that we're trapped in this horrific reality, they're not even focusing on the real problems. So right. So they're turning our attention to these minuscule problems like a coyote ripped apart a folk singer in Canada. So now it's like what that happens? Oh, yeah, sure. It had a whole pack of coyotes. It's apparently one of the only known coyotes. Poor folk singer just went hiking and she got eaten by coyotes. Yikes. But again, it's like, yeah, that happens like once every, you know, 100 years, whereas, you know, that you look at it. That's actually planned by the coyotes. It's like it's in their ceremonial calendar. They have the great day of folk singer or renting every 100 years. They've summoned the folk singer. She was actually raised to feed them. She somehow they got there, her parents to meet, you know, they. But they probably found her in Griffith Park as a kid and raised her up. Well, you know, that's another thing we can get into it. But like you look at Shane Smith, you write for Vice, you look at Shane Smith. And you watch, you know, you see what's happening with him is that the deeper and deeper he gets into the subject matter of his awesome HBO documentary series, you know, you really see his face, especially the climate change stuff. And he's like, oh, fuck, this is really spooky, man. Like this stuff is. But well, this is why we need this is why, you know, there's a pervasive feeling of hopelessness. And I think that one of the reasons people don't, you know, people don't face the real issues like climate changes because that happens. They they just get into this zone of like, you know, we're fucked. There's nothing we can do. It's hopeless. But I think that one of the real. Places for the Western mystical tradition or any any mystical tradition that is, you know, any real one is to put you in a place of understanding what's going on, being able to look at things clearly without flinching and not being hopeless, you know, because that's the great gift that that these belief systems or excuse me, not belief systems, but systems of techniques, experimental systems have given me is a way of training consciousness so that I can look at things like that and not be overwhelmed and look at them as, well, this is a big problem, but, you know, we've faced all of the huge problems we've we've as a civilization that we've had to face before and there are solutions and we need to look at those things and think about them without flinching and decondition ourselves from all the stuff we've just been talking about, like the the spell of the media and the spell of everyday life so that we can really focus on the the really important things instead of, you know, how many Facebook followers do I have? Oh, God, right. What's an example of one of these techniques that you might use to dispel the dark magic that has been wrapped around our poor brains by the Nancy Graces of the world? Meditation, you know, first and foremost, I think it all comes back to meditation because the more you meditate, the more you realize the more you see through the noise of your own mind and the more you realize you're the less you're yanked around by your emotions and your own thoughts and you realize that, you know, for instance, if you're up at four a.m. in the morning, you know, thinking all these dark thoughts of all these things you think are going to happen, the more you meditate, you realize, well, no, that's just, you know, that none of that's real. And meditation is when you train your mind against itself, which is it's the, you know, the biggest enemy you could ever possibly have. Yes. When you train the mind to quiet itself and overcome itself, you know, the media is no, no, no problem at all after that. Right. And what, what form of meditation do you practice? Well, I stick pretty closely to the, the, the classic Hindu Raja Yoga, the Eightfold Path of Yoga, which I've, I've taught online as well. But I think any. By the way, let me stop you there, guys. Jason has a priority mentioned this in the beginning, but if you missed the beginning somehow, Jason's got an awesome online course that teaches this stuff. And clearly he knows what he's talking about. So check that out. Anyway, go ahead. Sorry, I want to give you a plug. So. Thank you. Yeah, it's so, yeah, I've been, I'm constantly teaching courses on, on magic meditation, health, consciousness alteration, consciousness expansion, and the website. There are in live webinars. The website for that is magic.me. So magic with a K, M-A-G-I-C-K.me. Cool. So yeah, but I think that any type of meditation, I mean, there's the, you know, there's Buddhist forms, which are more based around mindfulness. The. What's the Raja Yoga form? Raja Yoga is a, well, it's the, the, the original classic form of meditation. Largely, it's talked about as the Eightfold Path of Yoga. And it's a step-by-step system where first you start out with essentially putting, you know, to, to grossly oversimplify. You start out with putting your life in order so that you're not dealing with chaos and distraction all the time. And you have, for instance, a quiet place to meditate every day. And then it progresses from there to Asana, which is keeping your body still. Pranayama, which is breath control. So at which, at which point you are able to have a huge degree of control over your own mind and body, and it goes from there to inward. So the withdrawal of the senses inward to the focus on one object, one point of concentration to the point where eventually you, your distinction between yourself and your object of meditation disappears. Wow, that's so cool. And I love that it starts off with getting your shit together. Because so, I think so many people, they. I don't think that's the Sanskrit term for it, but that's what it is. Because, you know, it's such an easy thing to like ignore. Like you have this like chaos storm swirling around you. You have, you know, shit you got to deal with, man. You know, like you have to deal with like basic worldly stuff. First, I love that that's the first thing, because also it implies that's the easiest thing. And a lot of people think that that's the hardest thing to do. I think it probably is the hardest. And a lot of people think about yoga, meditation as are you going to go off into a cave and meditate? And I think in, especially in a lot of the eastern systems, that's considered as kind of can be considered a bit of a cop out. It's actually much harder and more difficult to develop a mystical and meditative practice in the real world. And I think that this is what people need because Western people are definitely in the world. Oh, yeah. Well, there's I mean, I challenge you to find a quiet cave these days. There's probably every fucking cave in the world as a goddamn Kodak film stand in front of an ice cream truck going by every day. And there'll be kids watching Nancy Grace on their iPhones. Yeah, there's no quiet caves. There's no you can't. I bet you can't even find a cave that doesn't have a wireless connection these days. There's just no way to find quiet caves. Like it's true. Now, this was this the type of meditation that Crowley was into? Yes, it actually was. But obviously it goes back much longer than Crowley. Oh, yeah. But 10,000 years or so. But he had a pretty he had a pretty clear take on it. And he took it mostly from Swami Vivekananda, who was the one of the first people to bring Eastern philosophies to the West in the 1890s. And but for you, it doesn't just it's meditation is it doesn't it begin and end with meditation. It seems like you are are aware of some of the ceremonial practices that are recommended as well in magic, right? Yes. Well, ceremonial magic, I mean, it's so it's so easy to get tangled up in thinking because we're so conditioned by, you know, the media. And the first thing people think about when they think about ceremonial magic is, you know, hammer horror, Christopher Lee mode. Yeah. And really all that basically ceremonial magic is the Western form of meditation. And it's meditating with symbols outside of yourself instead of similar to, you know, Buddhist mandala meditation. So it's exteriorizing consciousness into symbols and objects around yourself and manipulating it that way instead of purely internally, which is the sword, the cup, the the the pentacle, the right. Is that right? All of which just simply represent facets of consciousness, your own consciousness. What does the sword represent? The sword represents the analytic mind, the ability to see clearly to, you know, scientific analysis to reason your rational function. And the cup? The cup is your ability to receive inspiration and guidance from the universe. So basically what people talk about when they talk about gratitude, that's the cup. And the pentacle? The pentacle is your mastery of the physical world. And so, for instance, your your your bank account, getting your getting the material aspects of your life together, as well as your understanding of the universe. Or excuse me, the your assembled facts about the universe. Do you own robes? I can neither confirm nor do I. Here's the thing, man. I love meditation. I'm not going to say I love meditation. Let's face it, that's a that's a thorny path for me. But I do when I am meditating, I know that I in my life tends to get better. But what you're describing there now, that to me, man, that sounds like where the juice is. I love sitting and meditating. It's cool. I practice mindfulness. Listen to Jack Cornfield walking the dog, follow my breath, sit and look and feel my body. And watch the wild, writhing snakes of my mind go insane at every moment. But, man, what you just described, man, that sounds fun, because when you're saying we focus on these symbols ceremonially, you don't mean that you sit and think about those symbols like there's an actual because I've read it, man. There's some very juicy, beautiful ceremonies recommended by Crowley by in so many of these grimoires. How did you say grimoire? Because I haven't mispronounced it like you said it, grimoires that are beautiful. Smack those robes on circle on the floor. You know what I mean? In tone, the correct chance while burning incense, theatrically act out all these things. That sounds fun. Right. And it is fun. Right. And although I'll point out that it's it's generally considered a Crowley even describes it as a prelude to meditation. You know, when it allows you to it allows you, especially it allows you more control over your mind through enacting it. But the ultimate goal is is is, you know, probably better served by meditation. Maybe that's not what you want to hear. But it is. And it never is. No one ever tells me what I want to hear on this podcast. That's what I like. And I just want someone to say wear some black robes, get a goddamn cauldron, say these words, and you're going to be able to astrally project at night and not orgasm within two minutes. And you'll be hanging out with Frieza Balk from the craft. Yeah, yeah, that idea. That's a fun idea. But, man, you know, I got to say, man, you know, the times that I have experimented with that stuff and gotten super, super stoned and in your book, Generation X, a lot of many people in there talk about using substances to alter their consciousness when they're performing these magical rituals. I have had experiences that I don't I haven't had meditating. I've had experiences. Now, are these experiences ultimately are they like, you know, getting off the path and like ending up getting distracted in some weird forest? Yeah, maybe like, are they like leading to some kind of state of still mind, expansive consciousness necessarily? I don't think so. But when I was doing them, it wasn't for that. You know, so many things that we do, so many things that we do aren't just for that kind of tranquility and stability that you're talking about. So many things that we do are for fun. What's wrong with that? I think that's well put. Yeah, if you want to be completely strict about it, essentially, you know, the magical discipline, especially when you combine entheogens with it, will give you incredible fucking experiences like you've discussed. They're ultimately more just more illusion in the end. Yeah. But so is the X Men movie. But so is the X Men. That's very true. Let's pause for one quick second. You should essentially. Yeah. But for Crowley, he thought, well, OK, how do we turn this on? You know, is there an actual method for for inducing this state? You know, whether somebody's like you said, I mean, somebody could think they're talking to an angel, a goddess, Satan, what if it's all the same? What if this is just like something that either something that happens in the brain or it really is something mystical either way? Is there a technique for inducing that? And if we can do that, how much faster would we advance as a civilization? And in fact, he says that's kind of the only at one point in his later years. He says this might be our only hope for getting out of the world crisis, essentially, and this was in the in the forties. He was looking at World War Two, but now with global warming, things like this, you know, human just human thinking alone has not been able to fix the problem. So we need to enhance our ability to be conduits, maybe as long as we're conduits of the right things, I would suggest. Yeah, well, that's something there's a great Ram Dass quote where he says, just because of being is disembodied doesn't mean it's telling the truth. Oh, yes, it's assholes all the way up and all the way down. You know, as I found out, but no, that's totally assholes on the astral plane, huh? Well, all of it. OK, here's how I look at it. The the the Buddhists, right? They say that the the most precious thing in the universe is a human birth, right? Like they always say that, you know, it's like the most precious human incarnation. So, you know, one of the things that Genesis Peorges to point out to me was and could you tell everyone who Genesis Peorges? A lot of people might not. So Genesis Peorges is Genesis. Briar Peorges is, you know, one of the the great magicians of the 20th century. And was my is, you know, is my primary mentor. You know, I studied for seven years with very directly with Jen and edited the psychic Bible with her. Jen basically started the band Throbbing Gristle, which was the first industrial band went on to start psychic TV, which was one of the first asset house bands was very influential and pretty much responsible for popularizing industrial music, rave, to some extent, rave asset house music, body piercing and all tattooing as a major phenomenon and also magic because they were running a magical order in the 80s called the Temple of Psychic Youth, which was focused on the democratization of sex magic techniques that had previously basically been guarded by a few hardcore Crowley people. And wouldn't they send out VHS tapes to watch and stuff? Yeah, they would send out VHS tapes of, you know, group group orgies, you know, like sexual magical actions. It's pretty it's pretty intense stuff even now. It's hard for me to watch some of it. But what's what do you mean? What's an example of something that would be hard for you to watch on this VHS? Well, a lot of it is in that DVD that comes with the book. But they would, you know, they would do do, you know, a lot of magic is can be, you know, a lot of the magic we've been talking about is very high intellectual, almost academic magic, which is kind of my kick. But another form of magic is essentially purely about getting into altered states. And a lot of that can be done with, you know, I would compare to, you know, self-flagellation like the Jesuits or pain, extreme mental states, drugs. What's the thing you have had a hard time looking at, man, I want to hear it. There's there was some like group what looked like group group kind of group bloodletting rituals. Wow. But Jen is very cheeky, too. So a lot of that was cut together to look more intense than it actually was. And they were raided by Scotland Yard in the 1990. The country came down on them. There were 10,000 people in in Topi, the Temple of Psychic Youth at the at the the peak of it is a serious deal. And they got raided by the government because some of these these videos were seen and they were way taken out of context. And they they they came down. And Jen was basically sent an exile out of the country. Oh, my God, that's that's how you know you're doing it. Right, man, Crowley got exiled, too, right? When they kick you out of the country, exiled by Mussolini from Mussolini. Yeah, Mussolini thought he was a degenerate influence. So get him out when you get kicked out of your country for doing magic. You are a bad ass. I got thrown out of Canada. That's my claim for what? For I was up there doing magic. I was living up there for a year and they figured out I was living with my girlfriend, which was a big no, no. But it was a huge, you know, it was a huge what do you mean? You can't live with your girlfriend in Canada. Apparently not. But I was thrown out. I was I was involved in really heavy magical work. And I ended up at the border, you know, as these things happen at the exact wrong time where there was like a biker gang going through with a murderer. And they they had they had a heavy security on it. And they looked at me and decided I was suspicious and exiled me from the country. Although I'm allowed back in now. Not quite as a dramatic as a story, but that's my that's my getting thrown out. So you got wrapped up like they thought you were in a motorcycle gang. It wasn't as you were living with your girlfriend. No, that was the reason that I don't get it. Why? What's the reason? I guess it's not legal to do that for an American citizen to live with a girl in Canada if you're American. Is that true? That's how old was the girl? Oh, 22. Yeah, no, it really was confusing. But anyway, can someone email me about the law that you can't live with a girl in Canada if you're not from Canada? That is wild. I've never heard that before. It was something about if I remember, it was something about cohabiting. And I don't I don't know. But they had they had temporary workers because the real the real Canadian Border Patrol had walked off because they didn't want to get shot by the guy in the biker gang. So I may have ended up with people who didn't fully know the law. Do you think this in this drama? Because sometimes, you know, a lot of times when I've run into people who are really into magic, they always do have a lot of drama in their life. That was something you said to me when we first met and you're totally right. And I think that one of the reasons why I'm. Well, to bring it back to how we got on this topic, you know, that a human body is a very precious thing to have. You know, why do all these beings want into human bodies? It must be a condition better than being a disembodied, astral being. But the second part of that is, you know, one of the reasons why I I think that most of the most of the drama that people experience in magic or when they have a bad time, it usually comes from two things. One is three things. One is drugs, you know, people get really into drugs and drugs have their own, you know, negative effects over and above anything you're thinking about or doing. Second is taking it too seriously. Like I think the thing with Crowley, where you think it's all the stuff you're experiencing is actually real and you're acting as if it's real. And then life just gets extremely confusing. Yeah. And the third is with when people get really into spirit contact and they they try contacting the wrong spirits. Then I think that all of those things. And I don't even think spirit contact is a good idea necessarily. I think that magic for me is a process of disciplining the self and becoming a better version of yourself instead of trying to sell out to another being, perhaps at least certainly not initially, you know, but contacting higher intelligences is a big deal. But you have to understand managing boundaries and understand what's how to figure out what's good and what for lack of a better terminology, what's good and what's not. So to simplify all that, the reason people have drama is I think lack of training and because they get they get too far in over their heads too fast. Yes, because when you read, you know, any of these texts, they don't say, oh, yeah, just like here, mutter these incantations and like smoke a joint and you'll be able to talk to an angel and be in and afford a new car. They have like a kind of surgical like like as the way they describe it, it's like going into surgery, the preparation is like serious, decontaminating the area psychically and so much preparation. It's not just like by the necronomicon of the used bookstore. And like it's serious. And the reason that is is because you have to you have to know exactly what you're doing and make sure that you get exactly what you asked for. And a lot of times people get into trouble because they just open themselves up too much, which is a lot of what I see. And, you know, people like like heavy psychedelics use or, you know, perfect example, you know, I knew a girl here in L.A. who was wanting to she wanted me to help her. She was like, come to my art space and help me do magic with everyone. I'm like, OK, well, what are you doing? She was like, well, we're we're we're opening a portal. OK, what are you opening a portal to? Well, we're just we're just we're just opening a portal. It's like that doesn't make any sense. And you don't want to do that because, you know, it's kind of like the world of of magic, whether it's in your mind or not, you know, the astral plane is just as varied as the real world. There's just as many types of people. There's a South Central. There's a South Central. Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's not fun. You've been there. What what what is it like? Can you describe what you're talking about? Like, what is that like going? Let's take me through. I can tell you the worst trip I've ever had, but it will bum you out and everybody on who listens to this entire podcast. And I should probably might want to keep it to myself. Wow. Now you got to say it, man. Now you can't just you can't you go, let's hear it. Let's hear it. And then and then after you say it, let's let's cleanse cleanse it with some some positivity. OK, come on, let's hear it. Worst trip I ever had was was this is shortly before I was thrown out of Canada was I this was on mushrooms and Syrian roux. Have you done that? I've heard Syrian roux is brutal. It was fucking brutal. It was because that's the one that I guess from what I understand, my limited understanding of chemistry. There is DMT naturally occurring in psilocybin mushrooms, but your brain has a thing called mono amino oxidase or MAO, which breaks down DMT. That's why when you smoke DMT, it only lasts five or 10 minutes. Yeah. If you there's a base, I think it's like a bark called Syrian roux, which is MAO inhibitors. So it inhibits that part of it inhibits that thing in your brain, which breaks down DMT, which means you get the the ayahuasca effect from the mushroom. So I call it like MacGyver ayahuasca because all that ayahuasca is stuff that has DMT with stuff that has MAO inhibitors and I think some other stuff. So it was, you know, six hours of hyper vivid brutality. Right. And I think I was in like a warehouse in, you know, like East, East, East Brooklyn. And the hallucination, I think this is really the hallucination was this is what I consider the abyss. They talk about the abyss experience. You've heard about this one. No, I mean, I've heard, I've heard, I may be, but what do you mean? In the in the Western magical tradition, there's a concept called the abyss, which is the it's considered the separation between divinity and mankind. But it's also, as I experienced it, it's, you know, the, you know, well, let me put it in a different language. The Buddhist concept of suffering, you know, universal suffering. Yes. So that's a lot more intense when you do it on MacGyver ayahuasca than it is on when you just read it, right? So my like the trip started out with, you know, the journalist Daniel Pearl. I've heard of him. Yes. He was a guy who was beheaded on on. So yeah, I saw that video. It's awful. Yeah. So the first hour of the trip was me being beheaded by by jihadis, right? And it was what was it? It zoomed out and it was essentially. I'm trying to remember this is 2006. It's written in it's written up in in my book, Queen Valentine, but it was basically this was after Generation Hex came out and I was during a going undergoing a process. It was kind of like, oh, you think you're a big magician, right? You think you're real clever. You put out these books on magic. It's like, oh, yeah, like you got all the secrets of the universe. All right, let's show you something, right? And so it went from this kind of like it went from that to essentially merging with all of the suffering in the entire world all at once. And it was, you know, it was kind of like, you know, you're you're a woman. You're a you're a mother in Africa, waking up knowing that your your child died of famine and you're going to wake up with that every day. And that's reality or you're, you know, you're living in you're living in Haiti in like this total absolute misery where it's just like, you know, there's no hope. There's no hope. And just like experiencing all this, like, you know, these war zones, you know, vice magazine, right? Like, welcome to the war zones. Welcome to all the suffering in the world. Yes. And it was kind of like, OK, so, you know, all those things you, you know, so it was basically, oh, yeah, you think you're a big magician? Well, no, everyone, you know, there is only suffering in the world and everything else. You know, any time you think you've any any time that you think you've been bigger than somebody else or more important than somebody else, that just adds to the suffering. Oh, yeah. And it's like, what was it? It was like. Yeah. And then it was like, OK. And then I kind of zoomed out and it was like, I saw this image of all the suffering. And it was it was almost like the trip was almost like I was in a war zone. Like when you see those war movies where the camera is shaking and everything's like awful and they're just this total like like G.I. Jane or something like that. But I zoomed out and I saw there was a mountain of all the Catholic saints, right? And everyone's like dragging. Everyone's essentially broken and dragging themselves to this and praying to the saints and in the mountain of saints is just they're looking down at everyone, you know, and they're part of their they're part of this system of misery. They exist there just to give people false hope. Oh, wow. I was like, oh, fuck. And then it was then it was zoom out and I see the world and there were. There were like these beings. These look like invisible jellyfish all around the world. And I was like, OK, what is this? And it's like these are all the gods that people pray to for relief from the suffering and their parasites that are sucking up all this false hope, essentially. And the false hope only exists to make things worse. Because when you think there's hope, then the suffering is even better. And I was like, oh, fuck. And then, you know, this was awful. And everyone in the room was experiencing the same thing, which was really strange. People were like throwing up and shitting themselves and in the real world. And then it zoomed out even further. And then the final part of it was I saw there was the ring of Buddhas that circled the universe and they all looked like Tibetan monks. And they were chanting and they were doing the Buddhist thing of, you know, we want. You know, we have compassion for all sentient beings. Yeah, generate, you know, the doing that the Buddhist generation of compassion. Yeah. Well, they're chanting for everything. And the final message was the only possible way to win the game is to have compassion for everything, but you will still suffer. That wow. Yeah, that was that's beautiful. That's beautiful and it's heavy. And that's the thing, man. What you're talking about is it's like, if you want the info, you can have the info. If you want to know where your hamburgers are coming from, you can go on YouTube right now and see where they're coming from. It's not going to be pretty. And this notion that we have that when you get the information download that somehow it's going to make you feel great, that really does find it first. It first. Well, but here's the thing, right? I mean, that experience took me that wasn't just a trip. I mean, that was, you know, that that experience wrecked me. And it took me about two or three years to come back from that where I, you know, I stopped writing, I stopped putting books out. I was just like, you know, people, people talk about they want their ego shut down. Like it's going to they're going to live in, you know, Narnia. But that's not that's not how it works, at least in my case. And, you know, it took me a long time to come back from that. And one of the things that encouraged me, by the way, to return to doing what I was doing is listening to your podcast. It really, it really cheered me up out of out of that dark place. That's amazing. Thank you. It really did. And because for the longest time I was convinced, you know, that, you know, this is all bullshit and nobody wants it. And but out of that experience, that's when I after I came out of that, that's when I started to get more heavily into Indian mysticism, but Danta, you know, things like the Indian grooves or Neem Karoli, Baba, people like that. And what I what I realized was that is just that's there. That experience is there. But it's not ultimate reality. It's certainly one way to look at reality. But then you realize that just on the other side of that, you know, ultimately, the the universe is a loving, infinite. Wonderful place. And that's one it's kind of like that's one potential play. That's one potential way we can see the world. That's all that is happening, you know, like global warming, you know, the torture of animals, the torture of people, the torture of the third world, you know, globalization, GMOs, all that stuff. You know, like it's there's constant misery in the world. But out of that, but combined with this sense that nobody's in charge or nobody's going to fix it. But out of that, for me, at least the important message was, well, then at least I have to do something, you know, it's like if and I think that's the that's the dispelling of illusion. You know, that's why your magic is disillusioning. It takes the illusion away about what reality is. But then it does leave you with empowerment, but not in the way that not in the way that you think it's going to not like I'm going to, you know, some and Jessica Alba to be my girlfriend. But in the sense of, OK, well, you know, this is this is. The what a good girl, Jeff called it the the terror of the situation. Right. And, you know, girl, Jeff, yeah, sure. And it's like, yeah, that's what's that's what's going on. So but at the same time, you know, there's that's only part of it. We also live in a beautiful paradise planet where everyone is becoming smarter and better and more divine every day. And we're learning more and more about the world every day through, you know, with the Internet and we have all these incredible technologies. And, you know, as things improve, it's kind of like maybe it's like as things. And, you know, things are really bad and really great at the same time. And we have all the tools and the ability and the technology to take reality into our own hands and be a positive force in the world. Oh, I love it, man. That is really cool. I mean, I think you do need to see the jellyfish before you can understand the other part of it. You do need to see that. Do you think that you can tell us something that we can do this week like a magical, a simple magical ritual or a simple act that we could do to sort of. Uh, bring, bring more of this actualized, more of this positivity or this emerging potentiality that you're talking about out in the out of the world. Yeah, just make a promise to, you know, because magic doesn't have to be complicated. You can go outside and talk to the universe. Just look up at the fucking sky and talk. And, you know, that's that's that's good enough. You know, that's more than good enough. That's an idea. So I think make a, you know, make a make a pledge to be. I think make a pledge to the universe to do whatever it is that you can do to help in the evolution of the human race in a positive direction. And then start meditating. Hey, dammit, had in on that. So much rather they drink some goats blood or something. You're awesome, man. This is free range goats blood. Yeah. Well, of course, obviously a gluten free goats blood, all goats bloods gluten free. Man, you're amazing. And you got to please, can you be the magical advisor of the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast? Sure. Please come back. And I want to take your courses too. Will you say, will you tell us all again where we can take these courses? Wait, before you do that, you know, you remind me of, man, because I used to be really into HP Lovecraft. You remind me of like one of the one of the protagonists in those books. They're like it's early conditioning from reading those. I'm glad that you've gotten your face out of the necronomicon and into the into the other stuff, too, because I do agree with you, man. It can pull you into a you'll you will end up in a warehouse shitting yourself if you do that stuff too much. Yeah, how can how can we take your class? But I'm glad everyone everyone always thinks everyone says I look like Mark Ruffalo, so I'm glad it's HP Lovecraft instead of Mark Ruffalo this time. So OK, so the the courses are at magic.me, M-A-G-I-C-K.me. And there's four or five courses there already. There's one on chaos magic. There's one on peak getting peak mental and physical energy. There is one on meditation. There's a ton of stuff there and there's going to be more and more stuff there always you can get those and watch those anytime you want. I'm doing a live training, I think this Saturday on basic magic, basic golden dawn ceremonial magic that will include some of the set and setting stuff for using it with psychedelics.

This is I got it finally happened. I got an actual magician on the podcast. Well, I had Wasserman, but this is like this is in Wasserman's awesome PS. I'm not the hope. I don't I'm scared of Wasserman and he's great, but this is great, man. And and very useful stuff that you've given us. So take his class and all my stuff is super positive, by the way. I don't I don't. So yeah, I'm the one who was kept dragging into the jellyfish land just to hear about fascinating. It is fascinating. But but all the courses, I should say, all the courses are focused not on theory, but on they're all practical. It's just practical techniques for how to actually do this stuff. I don't give any actual ideologies or say what to believe. All this stuff can be combined with whatever your own belief system happens to be.

Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. To quote Mark Twain, we're all sentient droplets of protein being blasted out of the nose of the divine. This is the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast and now a poem from Khalil Gabron. When the witch smacks my ass, I do not cry. When she pukes into my mouth, I do not gag. For my sweet lovers, mind and mind, have blended together like droplets of rain on the valley side. And when at last the witch's gas reminds me that all things will pass, I smile and laugh, knowing that love remains. Yes, even here, love remains.

Thanks, Squarespace. We're back and my God, how glorious when the rain falls on your solarium. I'm laying here in my hammock in my solarium, looking up at the stained glass and just thinking how lucky I am to be alive. I got a surprise floral array sent to me by Carlton Tash, which is an amazing thing because he is one of the top florists in Beverly Hills and I thought he hated me. But now I can see that I was completely wrong and this is something that I'm learning, which is generally I default to paranoia. The reality is most people aren't really thinking about you at all and certainly Carlton Tash was, I guess, not thinking about me and the way I thought he was thinking about. We've been on a backgammon team. We'd had a gaming night going for like the last six months or something like that and Tash went down to get some more chablis out of his wine cellar. His wife essentially leapt on me. Beautiful, beautiful woman. I pushed up her tennis skirt and we made love and when Tash came back up, he wasn't happy and I was on synthetic mescaline. His wife was on synthetic mescaline. He was on synthetic mescaline and we'd all been snorting rails of MDMA, which I don't think you can do. All of our noses had been bleeding all night. There's blood all over the table on the floor and we had Kleenex shoved in our nose but he walked in right as I was coming, drops the chablis bottle and is making these mudras which are hand signals that sorcerers or meditators use for ultimate revenge and it's a hand signal I'm familiar with because I spent three years living with the shamans of the Ling Valley in Sumatra and I knew that the hand signal he was making was one of the just ultimate curses you could make. So I left and our relationship ended. I didn't talk to him, I didn't talk to his wife and then today, surprise, surprise, I get this incredible floral array with amber pecan laxes, a couple of roses, some Darnellian tinkerbells and the centerpiece, this amazing Lauren sacks which is also known as Shepherd's Doom. This is a human sized carnivorous plant that is only found in the Ling Valley in Lower Sumatra and what's so freaking cool about this one is that it eats bears. That's its main source of food out there and this helps cull the horrific black bear problem that they have out there in the Ling Valley. These bears are just drawn to it, they get close and then it's got these four surrounding beautiful lily white, trembling probisci that blow a neurotoxin into the bear's face and I guess it somehow seduces, hypnotizes the bear. There's an entire nature channel documentary on it. The bear just sort of wanders into its main digestive pod where over the course of six days, it's slowly liquefied and then it sprays from five squirting aerosolizing nodules that look just like noses and this is why they call it the blood sneeze. It basically sneezes just droplets of liquefied bear which rains down on its roots and that's how it survives and to see that this plant, which by the way, if you look up how much one of these suckers costs 20K was sent to me by someone I thought hated me. It teaches me something, how important it is for people to forgive me and how I shouldn't just automatically think that someone hates me when they don't and oh man, you should see it, this beautiful plant. Of course, the neurotoxin nodules have been removed and even if they weren't, I'm sure I would be able to resist some stupid plant in the sun. You know what, we're just going to cut to a... This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Ozzy Confidential. What does punk rock have to do with steroid abuse? How does a soap company save a suicide? Ozzy Confidential. The newest podcast from the Ozzy tells all. He hosts Eugene S. Robinson, journalist, actor, stuntman, frontman, creator of sex with Eugene. True stories and Eugenius is now all up in your ear with interviews from the underground, un-googlable, untold, undiscovered until now. Park ran terrific, crosstalks from the edge. Park no holds barred, delving into the dark stuff, often left unsaid, complete with a soundtrack to die for. Ozzy Confidential is a podcast for people, personalities and weirdly wild notions about where we reveal and what we most want to conceal. Episodes could be 20 minutes or two hours long. You never know. Ozzy Confidential. The form fits the function. Listen up for Ozzy Confidential available everywhere audio lives and if you just can't wait, listen a day early only on Himalaya. This is the podcast your mother warned you about. She said, never listen to this. Only from Ozzy live curiously. Oh God, do you hear that, you guys? Do you hear the singing of the digest? I was so wrong to not sign into the digestive pod of this plant. And I just, I just want to apologize for the plant. And I want to apologize to the liquefying acid that I'm laying in to think I resisted such a beautiful, beautiful dissolution. I love this shepherd's doom. Oh, I love the liquefying. They don't want you to liquefy, man. They want you to stay in a form because they're afraid of your power. Oh, we've got a great podcast for you today. I'm going to be doing a workshop at the San Marasa Yoga Studio in Echo Park this weekend with David. He's a Grammy award-winning musician, my meditation teacher, lucky him. And an amazing author. He's got a great book coming out on creativity and meditation. Without further ado, everybody please, and if you're interested, before I forget. Mom, you're in here too? Yeah. Everybody goes in here eventually? What's that saying? If you're interested in becoming a workshop, the link's going to be at dunkatrestle.com. That's This Weekend, This Weekend, March 8th, 9th, 10th. Dispect of human nature. David, welcome back to the ZTFH. Thank you, Duncan. I honestly feel like I never left. You've been here in my mind at least, and it's cool that we're able to do this. This is remarkable to me that you can just instantaneously connect like this when you think of how it was in the old days, the stories of people wandering off into India, going down mountains to find people to give them transcendental wisdom. Now you can just Skype. Yeah. Well, we can't possibly compare it because it's ungraspable. You know, the way it was is ungraspable to us, just as the way it would have been in the future would have been ungraspable to them. Well, have you ever heard this idea that based on how technology is actually sped up our ability to do things that used to take a long time, that humans should not be working as many hours anymore? Like why are we still working 40-hour work weeks when we have technology that is completely sped up our ability to do things that we couldn't do in the past, but we're still working the same amount of time? Have you ever heard this before? Yeah, but the first thought is there's still the invitation is always there past, present, and future to figure out what are you actually doing? Yeah. With your time, how are you spending your time? It's an interesting expression, right? Oh, that's so funny. That's a dark expression, isn't it? What a dark expression. The first person who came up with that must have been a true monster. Or a capitalist. Yeah, yeah. Like a time capitalist. It's like, which is really, isn't that weird? Like, that's the thing that really gets you, that's really creepy is if you, like, if someone like, if there was a booth and you could go to the booth and you could, there was a witch or a warlock in the booth that would extract eight hours of your life energy in exchange for however much you got paid per day. I don't think many people would do it. Oh, there was a, there was a whole movie about that. Didn't you see it with Justin Timberlake? No, I didn't. But that's hilarious. It was, you had a thing on your arm and then you paid and were paid in time. Oh, wow. You, you know, you could exchange time, you could sell time, you could buy time. And then you terminated when your time ran out. So the rich people were the people who had the most time. Wow, that's so cool. Yeah, exactly. That's, that's essentially it. I mean, you're what many of us don't realize that we've like, that we're just selling our, like our life hours to other people in exchange for stuff quite often that doesn't even need to be done, which is where people slowly start going mad because, you know, this is like, I talk about this book a lot, but there's a great book called bullshit jobs, which is just, just an assessment of there's all these jobs people are doing that are completely unnecessary. And that's not so bad necessarily. What's bad is that in the midst of their unnecessary job, they have to pretend to be working, because the culture at the workplace is like, you should look like you're doing stuff, even though there's nothing to be done right now. And that makes people, it makes people cuckoo, because they, it's like, working sucks, I guess, if you have a boring job, but what sucks more than working is pretending to work. Or pretending not to work. Yeah, well, right, either one, I'm pretending not to work on, it's like, the idea is, you know, what should be happening, like, according to this book, the way people used to work is there would be rest, and then there would be these like days of hard labor and then rest, you know, like, so it was like, workaholic, like everyone's working together to get something accomplished, the thing gets accomplished, then you chill out. Yeah. Until the next thing you got to get accomplished, but there wasn't this like, sort of mechanistic factory style approach to getting stuff done. So now what's happening is people really don't have to do much. And it's like, so that's when the boss comes out, and this is an example given in the book where they make you start sorting tax according to color. So, you know, just because they want to give you busy work, because they want to feel like they're getting their money's worth from your, isn't that dark, David? Well, I'm kind of coasting behind you. I feel like I'm a water skier and you're the boat, and I'm cutting outside the wake right now into this very smooth, like, isn't everything like that? Well, you know, how do you mean describe that? What do you mean? Well, in other words, we have the sense of activity and doing things and getting things done, important things done, less important things done, insignificant things done. But is it, can you find a way of looking at which the whole thing is clearly obviously some kind of fabrication every level of it? Well, yeah, I mean, on one level, absolutely. But, and I'm bringing this up for a reason, believe it or not. So, yes, on one level, sure, I know what you're talking about, this sort of transparent nature of reality, the feeling of like, well, what is the point really? You know, pushing the Sisyphus, pushing the rock up the hill, rolling back down eternally. And yet, there is a thing that happens when I sit down and just start playing around making music, which is delight. I love doing it. It's a joy. It's a joy. But I don't have time to do that all the time, because I have other stuff that I have to do that isn't quite the same. So, basically what I'm saying is, many people, most people in the world have a joy, like art, creation, writing. And, but they're not quite at the place where they can do that full time. They have other stuff that they have to do. And so what ends up happening is someone finds themselves at an office where they're being monitored by the time police, essentially. Making sure that their time dollars are being spent on things related to the company. And so, their life's joy, they don't get to work on it, which is one of the most fucked up things ever. Because, you know, a lot of times, if you're running a good business, you understand that these people don't need to be constantly working. And you can give them time to work on that stuff at work instead of pretending to work. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, that's where it's like the darkness to me. That's one of the great dark aspects of the current way things are working that's fucked up. It's like, but this is, you know, I was just in Sam Ash yesterday, buying like a new synthesizer. I've been wanting for a long time, and I was talking to this guy working there. And, you know, he was saying like, this is what I'm doing is I learn how to be a musician. And it was cool. I liked it. You know, he's in a music store. He's like, but, you know, that is, to me, this is like the, when I was growing up, I was not in a family where you, that even the concept of like making a living doing art, that was like a fantasy land. Far, far, far away. And anyway, this whole like long opening thing is just because I know that you just finished this book on this topic of like, you know, how do you synthesize or how do you sort of incorporate not just art, but spirituality into a world where you have to like figure out a way to make money right now. And usually that takes up so much time. How do you like practice? Yeah. Well, you know, even just to switch frameworks for a second, because when you and I talk, a lot of times we kind of explore and then for some reason it reminds me of like a dharmic point, you know, of dharmic framing. So try this on for a size and see if we can mix these two ideas. There's this notion of absolute truth and relative truth. So in Tibetan it's dundam is absolute truth and kunzap is the relative truth. And absolute truth is that almost everything, if not absolutely everything that we are dealing with is some kind of fabricated reality. In other words, it's not totally arbitrary because it's driven by cause and conditions and a cause and effect, but it has only a relative existence. It doesn't have any like, you know, permanent implications. So that's what we feel. And the word kunzap means all dressed up. It's almost like a Halloween kind of idea that you put on your costume, you put on your beard, you put on your outfit, you go to the studio to work on your show, you know, you pick up your guitar, you write a song, you go out, make an appointment for dinner with friends tonight. You know, it's all like some kind of creative, just made up kind of world. And then, but here's the thing, the kunzap is the two of them are considered inseparable. That's what a lot of spiritual traditions don't acknowledge is the inseparability of the relative and the absolute. So they lean towards the absolute truth. Like, you know, it's all one or some such thing like that, or they lean towards the material world. You know, it's just all in the matter. It's in your brain. It's in your chemicals. It's just matter producing all these events. So within the inseparability, you have a kind of merging or blending of a kind of absolute awareness that the thing is impermanent and somewhat illusory. And at the same time in the relative view, you say it's important and, you know, what happens has significance. And you hold those two views simultaneously, which is really kind of intriguing. Then there's this one third thing, and I'm going to turn it back over to you. In kunzap or the relative view, there's two kinds of kunzap. One is just the normally made up, kind of fabricated, movie set aspect of living. The other is called log peak kunzap, which is crazy kunzap, which is not only you're imagining the thing, but you're imagining that people are chasing you down the street. You're imagining that your girlfriend hates you. You're imagining that you're no good. It's a deranged kind of relativity. Long peak kunzap, when you eat too much marijuana. Well, it depends on your mind if you can handle it or not. I don't know. Well, I mean, for me, that's definitely, if I want to experience a long peak kunzap, all I have to do is eat an entire chibachu and wait 30 minutes. And then I'm certain that there is a grand conspiracy at work. But I'm not quite sure how this relates to this idea of like, which I wanted to talk to you about because of your book is like, sure, absolute truth, relative truth, the costumes that we put on throughout the day. But within this, it's like, just only because you have just written a book related to like making a living, which doing a thing that is, or a few things, which are like, just to me, like the best things of all time. Making a living through your creativity. Making a living and still maintaining a practice. Figuring out a way to integrate sort of big realizations into, you know. Small events. Yeah, into small events. So yeah, exactly. And also like, you know, your situation, like you and Krishna Das and Ram Das and Alan Watts and Jack Cornfield and Trudy Goodman and any spiritual teacher I can think of, they must, I'm sure, negotiate rates. Right? Like, you know what I mean? Like you have to, this is a, my friend and I have always talked about this and like it seems so weird, but like just the idea of like Alan Watts talking to someone running a theater. Yeah. About what percentage of the door he wants. But why that it's more strange to me, why somebody would think that's strange? Why wouldn't he have to do that? Well, I mean, that's because there is this idea. And I've been hit up with it by this people, this tribe of people from time to time. Like it and it's like, I've noticed since, since the podcast has gotten more popular, there is like a contingent of people who are really like hell bent on protecting the Dharma and spirituality, the defenders of this like pretty ambiguous thing anyway. But it's, it's, it's amazing the intensity of like their like concern and the rule weird rules I've never even heard of, but definitely one of the rule, one of the things is like, look, you can't like if somebody's charging money as it is it not as a piano teacher, like if like if I get a piano teacher there and I tell someone, can you fucking believe it? They charge $60 an hour. People are like, yeah, it's a piano teacher. What do you expect? Or like if I'm like, oh my God, you know, I'm, I still am paying off student loans. You know, people are going to be like, yeah, of course, because you wanted to get educated. But if I'm like, yeah, I had to pay money to go to this like retreat or, you know, whatever people are like, are you fucking kidding me? You had to pay money for that shit. These guys, cause I get, but there is this concept, which is like people who are like priests, teachers should not be getting directly paid. And thus this is the invention of tithing, begging. You know, when you go to church, the bowl comes around and you throw dough in it. Yeah. You don't get a bill at the end of church or people go, you can just put it on your credit card. Yeah. You don't get. Yeah. Indeed. So what about that? What about that? You know how the people, this, this is like the reality of the life we're in right now is that if you do not figure out a way to monetize your time, if you do not figure out a way to make money, then sorry, you're fucked. So that's what your, that's what your book is talking about, right? Well, yeah. I mean, I don't want to talk about it too much because it's not going to be up till October, but still we're starting to talk about these kinds of topics because they're in the wind. It's in the wind, what you're talking about. So I've even had a hard time, you know, with kind of laying the groundwork for this with people that like, do you even want to talk about all this? Or is that like, oh, there goes the neighborhood, you know, we're talking about money in the spiritual community. Let's face it, Duncan, if you go in the spiritual community that sort of deep end, they don't want to talk about money. And if you go in the money community, they don't want to talk about spirituality. That's funny. Yeah, right. Yeah. And the creativity is like the peanut butter between the two pieces of bread. It's what's lacing the whole thing together because we're, and basically we're making the whole thing up anyhow, which is what creativity means to me in the first place. It's like, we're making this conversation up. We're making up, you know, we made up these computers. We made up so many things, you know? Right. And now we're forced to play with them or try to get them to keep from taking us over or beating us up or whatever we're doing. But, you know, there's a whole made up dimension to it. And then within the made up world, there's a split between the spiritual and the temporal or materialistic. That's, in my opinion, that's inside the made up world. Yeah. It's not one is the real world and the other's not. They're both equally real and equally unreal. Yeah. And this, but to me, this is actually seems like some form of insanity. It's like the fact that there is a taboo when it comes to, you know, in all other jobs, you know, that it's okay to like, you know, negotiate a salary. But it's like when it comes to art and when it comes to spirituality, you are not supposed to like, even, even like, think about it or talk about it. And I mean, in what there are like genres of art where you can, you know, but in general, and I do understand it though. It's like, you know, I have noticed that if I get too caught up in thinking about making money or a paycheck, what you have, like, I remember, I don't know if you remember this or not. But if you like, I had a day job, which is a cool day job, but it's still a day job. And for three, I don't remember how many years, many years and four years, something like that. You had a day job? Yeah. I mean, yeah, when I first came to LA, I started working at the comedy store and I wasn't even doing stand up comedy. I was just, you know, answering the phones and then working in the booth and then I became the talent coordinator and somewhere in there I started doing comedy. But I wasn't, I didn't, I didn't even like, when I first started working there, I didn't, I wasn't even thinking like, oh, I'm going to do stand up. In fact, I was thinking like, that seems like kind of hell, but I wanted to be around comedians because I was always funny. And that was like, you know, Mitzi, the sort of mystical owner of the comedy store. That was my first conversation with her because everybody's like, you know, she was so fiery and so unpredictable that as a phone guy, everyone was terrified of that first phone call when she called because if you messed up transferring her, if you just sounded weird, if you didn't answer the phone fast enough, because you're in the bathroom, you would just get fired. And so it was terrifying. And the first time she called, she's like, oh, yeah, then you a phone guy. I'm like, yeah. And she's like, well, do you want to be a comedian? And I'm like, I don't think so. And she goes, well, you never know, honey. And then it was cool. But what I'm saying is that within that, there's this comfort because what happens is every two weeks you get this paycheck, a shitty paycheck, but it's a paycheck and you take it to the ATM and you put it in the ATM and you know that that's going to be coming every two weeks, assuming you don't get fired. So the moment you split off and become your own boss, that's not that you don't get that guaranteed two weeks, you're going to be sliding a check in that ATM. And that is terrifying. And so it's not like you can just go around and like make art and just slowly starve to death. You have to figure out a way to get the rectangle into the fucking ATM at some, you know, rhythm or you're going to go broke. And so this is where the poison of bean counting creeps in to the creative process. And this is where all these weird compromises can potentially happen. You know, and all these, this sense of like, well, maybe I'll just start making stuff that seems like what people want, you know, and, and, but regardless, I'm just saying a lot of people out there, maybe listeners, they have art. They want to be artists. They want to make a living from their art and they don't know how to do it. It seems like an impossibility. Yeah. Honestly, that's really who this upcoming book is for. And that's what it's about. And it's, it's from the point of view of having juggled, you know, in every conceivable configuration, those elements within my own personal life and, and also understanding underlying principles for each area. Because that in, in, in my experience, people get hung up, they get stuck because they don't understand the principles underlying the field of activity that they're engaging in. And that's true for spiritual practice. That's true for like music, right? You hear some guy playing the same four-note blues scale for the rest of his life because he doesn't understand that there's a, that there, you know, that's as far as he got with the principles of music and people have, people stalled out in business big time because they literally don't know kind of the principles that are underlying the activity of business. And that, that's where if you look at the underlying principles, they're shockingly similar. That's what's interesting about it. Everything has machinery to it. You know, like you could be a great guitar player or you want to be a great guitar player, but you don't know how to tune a guitar. Right. That's a, you know, and you go, you know, and, and, and you don't expand your, your, your principles study. So great business people, they really know, like they're very facile. They're most like a good, you know, a good guitar player. They just know their way around that arena, you know, and, you know, the, the, the principles are pretty much having to do with allowing yourself some freedom in every realm to just not know, you know, so that you can really be a good explorer, acknowledging that once you have some kind of inspiration, it's going to require discipline and fortitude and, and you know, kind of perseverance to really get somewhere with it, knowing when to let go. How about that one? Isn't that true for your creative process as well as just your practice and your emotional life? You got to know when to let go. So these are the underlying kind of, kind of things and, and where do you learn those things? Where do you learn them? How do you learn them? Well, you know, I don't, I guess it, it, it varies wildly. I mean, I, like, you know, I, I know personally, uh, like, I, I know that, like, from, you know, having a practice and then becoming more aware of like, just sort of hat, like habits, habituations, you know, I know you, you start, like, it's like, well, it's, it's like, so like, you sort of learn to like sit and you've learned to watch your mind. And then when, and then that, of course, when you're done sitting, that doesn't stop suddenly. You're still watching your mind to some degree. And so then like, I'll, that's when, you know, just when we started working together, that's when I started trying to learn to play piano, to read music and to make music. And because you said something to me about just what, you got to learn the scales first. And that really was cool because I would started thinking like, holy shit, I don't do that with anything. I always want to learn like the thing you learn last before the thing you learn first. And to then like that, I started studying just like scales. And then, then that led to a lot of realizations, which is the shortcuts. The ridiculous weird shortcuts I'm always trying to take, you know, like just trying to get around that hour or two of just practicing, you know, that's, that's simple stuff. Or another, another thing is, uh, hold on, you got some fuzz coming in or is it me? Did your fan come back on or something? Nope. No, nothing's changed here. Hold on one second. Okay. Sorry, y'all. Um, uh, or, or like, uh, here's one, here's a really good one, uh, not wanting to read the instructions. I don't know if you do that or not, but whenever I get any kind of new synthesizer, instead of just sitting and reading the instructions and learning how it works, I'll try to figure out myself. And it adds, I don't know, at least like seven months to the amount of time, you know? So all of these weird things like that, you just start noticing them. And then when you start noticing them, that's not enough. You can actually, I, I, now I just read the instructions. Like I'll sit and watch a YouTube video about how the thing operates. And then suddenly everything I'm making sounds 50 times better. You know? And that is the shortcut, actually. You know what I mean? The shortcut seems to be the way it normally, it's normal people do it. Yes. Well, I think there's a lot of variance in that and it's a spectrum. So you have, on the one side of this, you know, on the one side of the spectrum, people are like, really like to just feel their way into stuff. And you know, they tend to be more like feely type people. And the way on the other end is people who like to think their way into stuff. And you know, usually the feely people don't think so great and the thinky people don't feel so great. So every once in a while you meet somebody who's, you know, kind of got some balance in that. But more than that, you'll meet people who are on one side of the spectrum or the other to varying degrees. And you know, so I'm probably more like you. I don't like reading manuals. And on top of that, like, like, for example, I just got a digital scale to weigh my postage and it goes, it tells you a number and I'm assuming that's the number of stamps you need to put on the letter because that would be idiot proof. But it doesn't say anywhere on it that that's what it is. Right. So then it says plug it into your computer. It's got the wrong plug. And I'm already ready to throw the thing out the window. You know, I mean, it's, I think user friendly is a good, and it's actually a principle that I like. I think if you're making something, you should make it user friendly because you want somebody to be able to use it. Otherwise, why did you make it? Right. So you're saying in things, not just like in technological stuff, but in stuff that you're creating, you want it to be accessible. Well, yeah, I mean, and some of that is also spectral because some people like to make things that are a little less accessible. So the person has a little more of an adventure and journey to find their way through it. And I myself, as you know, I love that combo. I'm like born to eat in Chinese restaurants and, you know, at buffets and smorgasbord. I like the combo of like something that is esoteric, but somehow gets to the mainstream. I call it left center field. We're rolling. Yeah. Yeah. So left center field is a place where, you know, you feel there's a kind of eccentricity to the creativity, but somehow it's accessible to a slightly wider range of people. Yeah. I, yes. Now I want to talk about this because this left center field thing, it's got a bunch of levels to it. One, everybody knows, or not everyone, but one, you know, one of the terms for Tantra and certainly one of the terms for magic is always the left hand path. And so, you know, from a magical perspective, this is like the, this is where you kind of veer off into the land of the occult or widening the lens a little bit to look around, like to maybe look in places that are shadowy or that people don't normally go to, to reframe things from that perspective. But then also a really fascinating thing I have noticed is that if someone becomes really good at something, it doesn't matter if it's completely center field, it still seems to be magical. You know, like that, you know what I'm saying? So like, like, there's like, and one thing that I've noticed is that one of, one trick if you want to make up an excuse for not being funny is you can decide, well, you know, my stuff's just out there, right? And it's a great way to rationalize the fact that you haven't written a funny joke. So you, so what you do is you think, well, you know, this is like some Andy Kaufman shit. Like it's not, it's not even funny. Right. It's not just the way you, when you start moving into the land of the esoteric, you have to make sure that the reason you're doing it is because you're, it's a, it's a color you want to use, you want to use in your, in your, on your painting or whatever. And not that you're just doing it because it's easy to be mystifying or even a better way to put it is it's easier to babble than it is to make sense when you talk, you know, especially when you're learning a new language. I think that's one of the big traps for people is like, they get caught up thinking that they're like David Lynch or something, you know, or they get caught up thinking they're like the most profoundly bizarre artists that they've ever seen, but they don't realize that that profoundly bizarre artist spent so much time probably studying the very basics. Well, so that ties in with the business principle that, that you can talk about, which is in, in a creative endeavor, is it content driven or market driven? You know, in other words, is it coming out of just a spontaneous creation of what you want the content to feel like? And then you find a marketplace for it, or do you have a marketplace in mind and you're trying to, uh, to, to, uh, tailor it to it. And I use the example of rap. The first rapper record is content driven. Nobody even knows if anybody likes rap or will like it. And you have to then find and create a market for that. But it's such a genuine form of expression that you go, I got to do this. I got it. I got to talk over the music. You know, it's just, I'm making poetry and music at the same time. It's cool. I love it. I don't care if one other person likes it. I'm doing it. And then you find, it finds the market. The other thing is now, if you put out a rap record, everybody knows what that is. And the question is, is this a good one? Is this, you know, a kind of noteworthy one or a compelling one? So everything has, it's all spectrums. You know, that's, that's, that's what, when I look at things and everybody is always trying to convince you of one side or the other and it's life is spectral. Right. You know, that's just how it is. You know. Well, I mean, the thing is, like when you're saying the thing about finding your market, there's a nineties corporation hating, you know, person in me that hears that and it's like, fuck that man. No way. And also there's a, you know, there's this concept in standup, which is, uh, if you start doing standup that you like, in other words, like you go on the road and you know, when you're in a certain part of it, you look at the audience and you do this weird analysis and you, you have this option to like, all right, I'm going to do jokes that I think they'll like. This is called pandering and, um, your, it's, it's, your hackery is another word for it, which is that if you start, uh, you know, trying to like create easy jokes that you think the audience is going to like, then suddenly you are, um, basically a robot or something that just isn't that interesting. Now, if you look at like interviews with Jerry Seinfeld, you know, one of the most successful comedians on the planet, he, and like he does the same job. He just does the same set apparently. I don't know. I haven't seen him do standup, but, uh, he just does the same set at least in some interviews I saw and he looks at like the, that, that, the whole idea of like the art of comedy or like all that stuff. He sees it and like it's weird to him. So, you know what I mean? That's just, and that's, that's the spectrum of comedy is like on one side of the spectrum, you have people who are just, they're like, you know, they're not trying to do some kind of fancy thing. They're not trying to do some kind of remarkable artist. They're not even trying to like, you're not trying to shift the zeitgeist or some insane shit. They just want to tell jokes. And it's at its market driven because success is not in the quality or caliber, but necessarily it's in the success, the financial success of it. So, you know, you know, the expression they're laughing all the way to the bank, you know, right? They're laughing all the way to the bank while these like grubby art comics shake their fists from their fucking studio apartments. You motherfucker, you're a hack. You don't take the money. Don't take his check. He's a hack. And it's like, and that, you know, that is such a like bizarre perspective to me. And that's another thing you run into in the world of comedy. And it's really sad, which is you will stumble upon, you know, I used to call it the bitters like comedians get this disease called the bitters and you'll stumble upon this like bitter comic who has in their own mind, like basically they think they're fucking, I don't know, like the Galileo of comedy or something. And that their, their like comedy is so profoundly brilliant that the world just it wasn't ready for it basically. And so then they're watching all these other comedians doing comedy that they consider to be like hacky, getting rich and succeeding and they're happy and they're sitting there looking at that like, oh my God, can you fucking believe this shit? Look at this. This is like a sickness. And it's really, really bad. And it, but in always within it and PS, I'm guilty. I've done that myself in the earlier. But like within that is like this, this fucking year. It's, it's, it's the whole time that you're texting comedians horror at the fact that this comedian or that comedian is doing so great. You could have been writing jokes. You could have been working on something. You could have been like trying to improve your life in some way or another. And that is the, you know what I'm saying? So this is another way out of what I think is what, for some reason, what many people are trying to escape from, which is the moment where you sit down and start working. You know that. Why do you, what is that? Why do you think people are so afraid of their ass touching the meditation cushion, their fingers touching the piano for the first few days of learning to play the piano, or their pins touching the paper as they begin to work on some novel or joke or whatever it is that they're writing. Yeah. Well, as you're so eloquently, you know, speaking of this, of course, in a parallel check, I'm thinking, well, what really is the problem? You know, why is, why is this being expressed this way? And I come to the conclusion that we're not used to the idea of creation, spirituality, or even livelihood or relationships being absent of the notion of an eye. That's having that experience because when you look at where the trouble starts, it's like, I'm doing this, I'm doing that, you don't like me. I mean, the, the, the loss of the fluidity of process, which all great artists have, they just, you know, they just are flowing into the medium that they're exchanging with. And then if you can create that way, that's one thing, and it's very spontaneous, which is what we're talking about. But it's also fresh, and it's also going to have the rhythm of that person, their natural rhythm imbued into the work and their flavor and whatever you like about them is going to be in it. And, you know, it's kind of like organic or something like that, you know. And then if you can get that far, just to leave yourself alone enough, leave eye out of it enough to just play with it, play with the materials and create and if it's comedy or if it's, you know, painting or music or whatever, just play with the energy of it. Then once you bring it to the world to present it to others, then eye reappears again. Eye appears, is this good enough? Do you like it? Will you pay me for it? You know, and that is a whole another iteration of another dimension of the kind of confusion and suffering that goes on. And at the end of the day, it, you know, it could feel nihilistic, but you could say, none of it matters in a very profound way, you know. And it is interesting to watch artists get old, you know, and go, what are they going to cling to? It's like, what does it matter if your painting is worth $35 million and it's in the Louvre and you have worms crawling out of your eye sockets, you know, or your pile of ashes? So even though that could become nihilistic, it's still a powerful correction agent to see that the whole thing has some element of fabrication from day one. And so eye doesn't even have to be in the profound calculation. There doesn't even have to be a profound calculation. I made, I was authentic. I'm authentically rotting. Hey, hey, like, I wonder if there's, like, artists' graveyards. There would be some artists who are like, look at him. He was, he doesn't rot. He's not rotting like a true artist. You could tell his skin's not falling off in the normal, you know, in an artistic way. He rots like everybody else. He's a hack. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is a, I love that. And I, I mean, I'm not like that. Those kinds of like wins is to look at things through. I really like and, uh, but all, but the main thing is this is the, to me, the, uh, one of the crazy realizations is like, I, when you're, when anything I've made that I really like, it's like, I didn't make it. I don't know what it was or why it happened. And sometimes with a podcast, people like give me these wonderful compliments and I, I like that. I like that. But there's always a sense of like, well, hey, I'm sorry to tell you, but it's not me. I don't know what the hell it is. And, uh, and, and, uh, that, that is a kind of a relief. And, and, um, uh, and also it's like a good way to like press reset because you know, whatever the hell it was that you used to be making, it's, you know, that's all done anyway. Now it's right now. Yeah. Well, you know, I tell this story sometimes and sometimes I talk, you know, about experiences with, uh, my Buddhist teacher, Trungpa Rinpoche, but not from a nostalgia point of view. It's actually very heartwarming and kind of inspiring, but it's not. I don't want to pass through, oh, you missed that great time or whatever. It's happening now. So I'm totally cool with letting it keep reiterating, but there were a few classic moments and one of them was we were sitting eating and this almost had such a dreamlike quality that I, I can't swear that it actually happened. There's a kind of illusory quality to it, but this is what I remember happening. We're eating and there was hot sauce on a plate on the side, like a brownish hot sauce that looked a little bit like baby poop, which you now know exactly what that looks like. Sort of a light brown hot sauce baby poop and he took a toothpick and he's, he was a good artist and he made a likeness of me in the hot sauce on the plate. I mean, as strange as that sounds, he's been saying it now. There's me, a likeness of me carved into the hot sauce with his toothpick and then he just takes the plate and turns it to the side and the thing just drips off into nothing. What the, wow, that's so intense, man. Yeah. And it was all good. It was magic. It was very, you know, it was very grounded in a way and it was like kind of had, and I think that's true with really, really good teachers. Watch for the cracks, watch for the experience in the cracks. That's when you really, that's when you really are getting some, some good transmission, you know, and in the, they call it in some of the chance, the hidden life examples of your body, speech, and mind. And in my mind, that's, this is where a lot of teachings come through. They're hidden. They're, they're just very subtle, you know, and, and they're, they're in the cracks. So the message is, you know, clearly, you know, and he used to say, actually, you don't exist. That was something he said, he used to piss me off because of course I'm stuck with a sense of existing and trying to make the best of it, you know, and he just said it so many times. And if you look at it though, if you look at the Duncan phenomenon, it's very hard to pin it down. It is. For an intelligent person, you could really look into it and you go, I thought I left it over here. I don't even know who moved it, you know? Well, yeah, I mean, it's like, it's the, it's the last Santa Claus, isn't it? It's like you, you, you, I don't know if you, you, your parents did the Santa Claus thing to you? Not really, no. Well, they did it to me and like, I really believed in, I really, I mean, I was a kid. I believe this shit, man. I mean, I really believed it. The last Santa Claus. So like, I, like, I, like, uh, you know, the, so what we did was, and it was nice, we'd go visit my grandmother, and this was as I remember, and we, and what you would write your Christmas list, what you wanted on a piece of paper, and then you would burn it in the fireplace. And I guess the idea was the smoke or the ash made its way to wherever Santa Claus wasn't reconfigured itself into a list. And he'd be like, all right, yet another materialistic fucking kid. Let's send, send the plastic to him. And, and, but, but you know, I, you believed it. And, and so, and then I can remember just, I don't remember, remember, you know, it's kind of obvious, I think, as you grow up, you're just like, there's no fucking way, man. This can't be real. And I remember like, a dreadful feeling as I went to my mom and looked her in the eye. I was like, it's not real, is it? And she got this sad look on her face and was like, no. And then I'm like, and there's no, that means there's no Easter Bunny either, right? Yeah. The whole pantheon of bullshit holiday characters obliterated. And so, you know, and I, well that's Duncan, isn't that the heart sutra? Yeah, that's the heart. Santa Claus, no non Santa Claus, no form, no feeling, no perception, no consciousness, though I know, you know, toes and no nose, no tongue, nobody, no mind, no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, et cetera, et cetera. It's the heart sutra. It's, it's the kind of negation aspect of solidifying reality too much. Right. But you know, I mean, this for a lot of people, it's like, okay, fine, there's no fucking Santa Claus. There's no fucking Easter Bunny. Okay, I could deal with that. It's like that weird paranoid thing. People say first they came for Santa Claus, then they came for the Easter Bunny. Then they came for your idea of the American Dream. Then they came for your idea that your parents were actually adults. Then they came for your idea. You know what I mean? Like all that. And then finally it's like, wait a minute. But I'm an I, right? And then that's the one that's like, well, I think we might have to talk about this. Yes. You know, and this is where you're getting at, which is like, actually, I don't know that there's much of an I there. And now this is for some people, devastating news. And for other people, it's the best news you ever heard in your fucking life. Yeah. And it's both for each person too. Right. That's the irony of it. And it's expressed as avoiding extremes of eternalism and nihilism, because you can see how easily that could become a nihilistic statement. There's no I, there's no you, there's no God, there's no Santa Claus, there's no nothing. And then, you know, you stabilize and solidify that negation. So that's called nihilism, right? And then on the other hand, the other belief that it's all good, and it's all happening, and it's all you're being protected from something, and you exist in an authentic and primordial way as a self or a soul or an Atman or whatever you want to call it. That's eternalism. So both of those extremes have the capacity to create a series of successive delusions. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But in the, for me, the why I love it is this finding the middle place between these tears, because I think, you know, I think when they were talking about the fountain of youth, that's what they were talking about. The Philosopher's Stone or whatever, they were talking about that real, because the moment you realize like, oh, shit, I don't think I'm an eye. Then then you whatever's that then you can renew. Then it's like now like, wait, at that moment, you just you're dead. But also you're here. And then something in that afreshness can spring up where it's like, I don't have to be the thing that was creating the stuff I was creating in the past. I don't have to be that in fact, isn't an even a thing. I was just, that's just habit. And that that's to me is like, Oh, this is fan. This is the breaking of the egg when the little baby chick comes out. Except maybe I don't know what does the chick break open and a little another baby chick like climbs out of its chest. I guess you have to just keep breaking your egg or something. I don't know. Well, I think that's also why part of penetration has to be, there has to be some element of relaxation in it as well. And just see if you can, if you look how everything works, your heart compresses and then it, it's very hard for me to relax when I'm getting penetrated. Maybe you're doing it upside down. You're doing it the wrong way. You must have done something right though, because Forrest is here, right? Well, I mean, yeah, oh yeah, but it's even with that with Forrest with like, the other day I was having a conversation with a friend and he's like, your baby, making the baby wasn't that the highest magic? And I had to like stop because I was thinking like, well, number one, I didn't make the baby. And number two, I don't feel like I, I, I, I know that I was, I did like have sex and had an orgasm and made sperm that, you know, was fertilized an egg that made, I know all that, but it's like that my feeling with Forrest is the same way I feel about anything I've made, which is like, I don't know how much of that I was responsible for. How much I had control over. It just, it just happened. It, it rose and up. But I don't know how can like I much, I didn't exert myself. That's for sure. You know, it just came. It just is. Well, a lot of great creative things seem to be like that with, with the, you know, with the caveat that there's some discipline involved and somehow that's part of the equation too. It's not all just sliding down a mountain, you know, you know, there's some climbing the mountain and sliding down the mountain. And, and, you know, it's like, for example, right now, I bet you don't feel it's effortless raising a baby. I put my money down right there. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the action within it is not, I mean, there's effort, clearly there's effort involved. But it's like the big, I don't know how to explain it, except to say, I mean, I want to sound like disassociative or something like that. But it's like, I just don't, if we're, if we're sort of giving up the notion of the traditional notion of the self, then within that, you're kind of giving up the notion of cause and effect causality in the normal sense. And so to me, that's a freeing thing that even now just talking about, I feel more inspired than I've felt in some time. It's like, Oh, right. Oh, yeah. That's great. I don't have to be the thing making the stuff. Yeah. Oh, what a relief. It's a big relief. But egolessness, you know, if you really study like various traditions, but particularly Buddhism is not considered to be an accomplishment. It's a fact. That's great. So when people say, I'm going to get rid of my ego by working hard at it, there's a, that's part of the basic bubble delusion that you're in. Right. But it may be a necessary thing to relate to, but the recognition of egolessness is somewhat of an accomplishment. Wow. That's so cool. I'm going to get rid of my imaginary friend. I'm going to start working on getting rid of, I'm going to start getting rid of little Tandi, my imaginary friend who lives in a matchbox. My friend Michael Carroll calls it the Mikey show. It's the Duncan show. Yeah. I mean, and that, that's at the relative level, you can have the Duncan show. But when it turns into log peak winds up the crazy relative truth, then the Duncan show becomes unnecessarily painful. Yeah, you don't have to keep picking up your crazy show for new seasons, you know, we've been renewed for the millionth incarnation. Wow. Well, look, time flies by when I'm chatting with you. It's 150. I know you've got a meeting you have to go to. Thank you for being patient with my scheduling issue. And I'll see you, I'll see you this weekend at our workshop. Really looking forward to that, Duncan. And I'll check in with you along the way there. And, you know, I just want to say one thing. I meet people all over the place who are, you know, I've said this and I'm saying it again, because to me, it bears repeating. There's a lot of people out there listening to you and feeling where you're coming from. And it's a good thing. Thank you. I'm so lucky that that is happening. And I'm glad that I get to share conversations like that with folks. And I'll see I'll see you at summer, this weekend, David. Thank you so much. Okay, see you soon. See you soon. Bye. Bye.

Do you think that aliens are currently living with us here on Planet Earth? If you do, then you're an excellent company, because so do I, but more importantly, so does Robert Bigelow, the billionaire founder of Bigelow Aerospace, which is a company that just created the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, also known as BEAM. It's basically an inflatable bouncy house for astronauts that is currently attached to the International Space Station. He was recently interviewed by 60 Minutes, and this is what he had to say about aliens. Do you believe in aliens? I'm absolutely convinced that's all there is to it. Do you also believe that UFOs have come to Earth? There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence, and I spent millions and millions, I probably spent more as an individual than anybody else in the United States has ever spent on this subject. Is it risky for you to say in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens? I don't care. You don't worry that some people will say that you hear that guy? He sounds like he's crazy. I don't care. Why not? It's not going to make a difference. It's not going to change reality of what I know. Do you imagine that in our space travels we will encounter other forms of intelligent life? You don't have to go anywhere. You can find it here. Yeah. You could find it here. What does he mean? I don't know. Well, I've got some guesses, but one thing I love about Bigelow is he is not suffering from RTCS, a plague that is currently sweeping across our beautiful planet and has been for many decades. Reality tunnel constriction syndrome. Generally, it's a direct result of not coming into contact with the very important mystical nutrients that a person needs to have a solid spiritual diet. The moment that you end up not taking in your metaphysical, mystical vitamins is the moment your reality tunnel begins to constrict and pretty soon, like some kind of sad, emaciated, poor little puppy dog, you go scraping away at the festering demonic underbelly of the media and you start suckling at those black demon nipples and slurping up all of that rotten fucking data that tells you what to believe and what not to believe. And that's when you come down with one of the worst symptoms of RTCS, you stop asking the big questions because you think you've figured everything out. You think you know somehow some piece of you actually believes that you, yourself, with your one human brain, knows what scurries along the dark depths of the ocean floor. You know what's inside the ice of insulatus. You know what's hovering in the dark, distant cosmos. Way, way, way out in the depths. You've got it all figured out, man, and you know this is it. This is it. Skyscrapers, concrete roads. We've got traffic lights and police cars. And that's it, man, that's it. And anybody who veers outside of that where there's the government and the president and there's jobs and there's minimum wage and there's problems with health insurance and there's problems with war, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm not in a place where there's war. The moment you start going outside of that, that's where people who are deeply sickened by RTCS begin rolling their eyes at you. That's another symptom of someone who has RTCS. Eye rolls when anyone around them asks a question that they think they already have the answer for. The good news is a cure may be coming for this terrible plague, and that cure could be that thanks to the advancing technology that we have here on planet Earth, we may actually in our lifetime get some real hardcore data that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are not alone in this universe. And some of this data might be coming from the far, far, farthest edge of the universe where astronomers have been picking up something called fast radio bursts. Fast radio bursts are bright, unresolved, millisecond flashes found in parts of the sky outside the Milky Way. Unlike many radio sources, the signal from a burst is detected in a short period of time with enough strength to stand out from the noise floor. The burst usually appears as a single spike of energy without any change in its strength over time. Scientists are really interested in this right now because they can only speculate on what could be powerful enough to produce such an incredibly strong, quick blast of energy. What is it? Black holes colliding? Magnetars? Could it be a magnetar? An actual super powerful magnetar? Twinkle, twinkle magnetar You're only 20 kilometers But your three times as heavy as the sun Oh no Magnetar is the car That guy drives home from the bar He runs over three suns But he's having fun Magnetar eats your soul Out of a black hole Magnetar is like a magnetar Get on your knees for the magnetar Get on your knees for the magnetar Please call me back, magnetar Please call me back, call me back, magnetar Call me back That was Call Me Back Magnetar by Bill Cyanide, the dying guy The truth is these FRBs really have people scratching their heads We don't really know what they are They're super powerful though The burst from FRB 121,102 was emitted at a time It was first evolving on our planet Yet it was still detectable on Earth 3bn years later Indicating it must have been caused by some of the universe's most energetic phenomena Scientists calculate this eruption emits just for a millisecond As much power as 500 million suns Just think of that, a flickering pulse of energy more powerful than 500 million suns It's there and then it's gone It really got people scratching their heads And some people think that it might not be originating from a natural phenomena Like black holes smashing into each other Or a neutron star or God throwing his remote control at the TV Some people think that it might be coming from a very advanced civilization That is using FRBs as some kind of propulsion mechanism And one of those people is Avi Loeb Who is the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard And he's with us here today We're going to jump right into the podcast But first, some quick business This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Fulton & Rourke Fulton & Rourke is a men's fragrance company They produce solid colognes And what that is is these wonderful colognes that smell really good I actually wear them Usually I hate cologne Like if you get in the car or an elevator or somebody you just put cologne on You kind of want to throw them into some never-ending demon-filled void But in this case, Fulton & Rourke has created a really wonderful smelling line of fragrances That kind of remind me of what an alchemist might slather on his body Prior to trying to transmute lead into gold It smells mystical and good And most importantly, not overpowering It's subtle and sweet Incense-like I'm not a perfumist So I don't know the correct terminology for perfumes But I love this stuff And what's even better It comes in these wonderful metallic cases That have this really cool weight to them And they slide open between your thumb and finger And inside is the cologne that you can then put on your neck And go out and smell good But the cases look really cool So if you want to give somebody a fancy gift Like something you picked up at Westworld Then this is definitely the cologne to give somebody Most importantly, it just smells really, really good And you can travel with it They also have an exfoliating soap Which is wonderful So you don't have to use a washcloth It'll scrub those dry, dirty skin cells Right off your meat body And they have incredible shaving cream That GQ Magazine just named The best shave cream on the market today And I concur I love this stuff This is really wonderful stuff I don't advertise anything on this podcast That I don't actually use And I love Fulton and Rourke So if you want to anoint your lover's body With a fragrance that smells like it Was extracted from griffin feathers And placed in a magical container Made from the scales of a silver dragon Then go to FultonandRourke.com Offer code Duncan And you will get 15% off your first purchase Here, let me just stop the music for a second So you can get a little ASMR in here Listen to this That's the sound of a Fulton and Rourke Solid cologne container being opened up And it's like you just opened up a magical chest Of delightful smells Just open that up And then oil your lover down Oil yourself down I wouldn't be surprised if an angel showed up And joined you in a passionate three-way Fulton and Rourke Offer code Duncan You'll get 15% off Friends, we have finally transferred the store We've got a new merchandise company So if you go to the store at DuncanTrestle.com T-shirts, posters, and stickers Will be there for your delight Much thanks to those of you who can continue To use our Amazon portal Make sure you zing through that portal And check out some of the wonderful things You can find on Amazon Want to buy a great book? You've got to read The Lost City of Z If you haven't checked that out yet Holy shit, it's so good And you know what I'm realizing? I prefer flop books to ebooks There was a time when I was getting really into ebooks But I like holding a nice floppy book And folding the pages over And underlining shit that I'm never going to go back And look at It's just a lot more fun Why not order a flop book from Kendall? Just go through the link Located at DuncanTrestle.com And when you do that They will give us a very small kickback It costs you nothing But it's a fantastic way for you To support the DTFH Here's something cool that I just found out I'm going to be doing live podcasts At the RomDOS Open Your Heart and Paradise December Retreat Which is my favorite thing to do on planet earth That starts at the very end of November Tickets go on sale next week And you can go to RomDOS.org To find out more information about that Okay, pals Today's guest is one of my favorite things about podcasting From time to time, I get to talk to people That I normally would never cross paths with And I think Avi Loeb is one of those people He's the chair of the astronomy department at Harvard He has written many books Most recently from the first star To MilkaMeta Which you can find at Amazon.com If you live in New York City You can see him give a talk On these fast radio bursts That you're about to hear about in this conversation He is going to be at the Alchemist's Kitchen On June 16th Giving a talk about black holes And extraterrestrial contact And I'm sure a great many other things So widen those magnetars And send out as much love as you can To today's guest, Dr. Avi Loeb Dr. Loeb, welcome You have been, I guess, speculating that FRBs that are being picked up right now Could potentially be some kind of alien signal Is that correct? Yeah, but first we need to probably explain What FRBs are FRBs are fast radio bursts It's an abbreviation And these are flashes of radio waves That last thousands of a second At least one of them seem to originate From the edge of the universe That far we know But we don't know what the source is And there are thousands of them Every day across the entire sky And we don't know where they come from And so conventional astronomers Usually assume that they are related to stars And the conventional wisdom And some people believe that They probably originate from very compact stars Stars that weigh roughly the mass of the sun But are as small as New York City About 10 kilometers or so These are called neutron stars And some people speculate that Perhaps when they are born They have very strong magnetic fields And they radiate very brightly What we need is a source That is 10 billion times brighter Than any other radio source we have seen We have seen neutron stars radiate They are called pulsars They have a beam of radiation That sweeps across the sky And we see it just like fast radio bursts But it repeats again and again It's like a lighthouse However, those sources that we have seen Are 10 billion times fainter Than what we need for a fast radio burst Because fast radio bursts originate From the edge of the universe And so we suggested that perhaps They are not natural Perhaps they are artificial in origin Perhaps there is an advanced civilization Out there that is producing fast radio bursts Many of such civilizations And the question is why Obviously it's not useful for communication Because if you send a message Billions of light years away It will take billions of years To get a response So it doesn't make sense to send A very powerful radio beam Just for communication However, it occurred to me That since our civilization Is contemplating right now Using a new technology for travel Perhaps that's the origin Of those fast radio bursts And what I'm referring to Is a project called Starshot That I'm actually leading As the chair of an advisory committee Yeah, he's on the board The person that initiated it And that funds it at the moment Is Yuri Milner And he committed A hundred million dollars for the next five years To do a feasibility study Of a new technology that will enable us To reach to the stars In other words, the idea is to send a probe To the nearest star That will reach the star within our lifetime Now the nearest star is four light years away So it takes like four years to reach us And therefore if you want to get to the star Within our lifetime You need the spacecraft to move At a significant fraction of the speed of light Let's say fifth of the speed of light Would bring it to the nearest star Within twenty years So the question is how to launch A spacecraft at the fifth of the speed of light That seems like a great challenge And the only technology After studying it for a while The only technology that Together with my students and postdocs We came across that seems feasible Is a light sail The idea is just like a sailboat That is being pushed by wind You can push a sail with light When light bounces off the sail It will give it a push And what you need is a very powerful beam of radiation So the goal of this project Is to develop a very powerful laser beam That will be focused on a sail That is roughly twice the height of a person About four meters or so What's the sail made of? So the sail needs to be very light Because only then one can push it To a fraction of the speed of light So it has to be on the mass scale Of order a gram And also it will carry with it A gadget, a chip of electronics That carries a camera, a navigation device Communication device And so the idea is to have a gram scale spacecraft That is being pushed by a very powerful laser beam Of the order of 50 gigawatt Which is the amount of power that was used To lift the space shuttle So basically what you need is To give a single gram of material The same amount of energy That the space shuttle got In order to be lifted off the earth And you need to do it within a couple of minutes So the launch time is a couple of minutes And then there is a cruise that takes 20 years To get to the Alpha Centauri system The nearest star system So you're saying that if you blast this I'm sorry, if you blast this sail With this powerful laser beam You only have to do it for 20 minutes For two minutes For two minutes That's it Why wouldn't you do it longer to make it go faster? That's a very good question It would be easier if you could extend the illumination Over a longer time Because then you don't need a laser as powerful As you need in our case But the problem is The laser can be focused only out to some distance You need it to be focused on a few meters The spot of the laser needs to be Roughly the size of the sail Once you go far More than 2 million kilometers from earth This beam of the laser will not be focused anymore It will start diverging And as a result You can't really accelerate the launch Effectively the sail over greater distances Than roughly 5 times the distance of the moon So you have a limited distance Along with You can accelerate or launch this spacecraft Sort of like imagining a race Where you have a certain distance That you have to go through And obviously You need to do it very quickly So that you reach a fraction of the speed of light So you need to accelerate this sail very quickly Because otherwise it will traverse this distance Before you reach a fifth of the speed of light Gotcha So you're saying that Here on earth we've already discovered the potential For this being a way to travel through space And it appears that you have detected Possibly a civilization that Figured this out a very long time ago And it's producing a lot more energy Than what we would be producing here That's right So the idea is that we are now contemplating this technology It will take us a while, maybe a few decades To bring it to maturity But you can imagine another civilization out there You know there are billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy With planets like the earth around them And so you can imagine Even if a small fraction of those planets Have intelligent civilizations There might be a civilization out there That is much more advanced than we are They had a billion years maybe To develop technologies And so they already mastered this technology To a much greater level than we can imagine They can produce a much more powerful beam And so the question then is How would you see a signal from such a beam There would be some leakage Around the sail that is trying to push And as the beam sweeps across the sky It will appear as a flash of light For us when we observe the sky And so I was wondering Other flashes of light And perhaps these fast radio birds Are an example of such civilizations That was the suggestion that we made And this is astounding Usually when you hear things like this Speculations like this It's not coming from Harvard professors Isn't this a little risky For you to put out there? Yes, well it is risky In the sense that it's probably Most likely to be The origin of fast radio birds Is most likely to be much more mundane But I think we should keep it in mind The reason I put it out is because Even if fast radio birds are not Those flashes of light There might be others And people have to keep that in mind Doing science is often like a detective story You should have an open mind Because sometimes things you don't expect Happen to be real We don't know whether there is an advanced civilization Frankly, I believe that we are not special I believe that if we find life here on Earth It exists elsewhere Definitely primitive life And quite likely intelligent life At the level of intelligence that we have And perhaps even more And so just out of modesty I think we should be modest enough to admit That there might be technologies Far more advanced than we have Out there and we should just look for Possible signals from them This is just a sign of modesty on our side If you believe that we are really special That we are the only ones in the universe Then perhaps you are justified in ignoring the sky And just focusing on Earth And reading the morning newspaper every day I just don't understand how people can adapt To this point of view Given the fact that there are more planets Habitable planets like the Earth In the universe Than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth So just think about it It's a huge number And to contemplate the idea Or to believe that we are special Is really, to me, sounds more crazy Than to look at the sky in a search for flashes of light But that's kind of a burn to some of your colleagues Surely you probably work with people Who think that, right? Okay, so let me tell you that it's not It's actually more surprising than you expect I'm not just one of the scientists out there That writes papers and so forth I'm also chairing the Astronomy Department at Harvard So I'm the chair of the Astronomy Department I'm the director of two centers at Harvard One is the Institute for Theory and Computation And the Black Hole Initiative Which is the only center in the world That focuses on black holes So a lot of my work is actually A conservative mainstream But I do take risks Because I think that, you know Just like in investments Financial investments in the stock market In bonds and so forth You have to diversify your portfolio Because if you keep doing the same thing Low risk stuff You are unlikely to discover important things So it's always important And I advise that I give that advice to young scientists That there should always be A fraction of their portfolio Dedicated to risky investment Now the question is what fraction My advice is 20 to 30% About a quarter And then without that If we only play conservative We will miss some of the most exciting discoveries That we could have made And so just like investments Financial investments I think it's important to invest your research time In a way that includes some risks Invest 30% of your scientific career Into aliens I love it I wouldn't say necessarily aliens There are many other risky endeavors Sure And science is so exciting these days At least astrophysics I wouldn't speak about all sciences But astrophysics has so much going on That there are many avenues To risky investments And I can mention fewer I'm sorry Not to cut you off, forgive me One of the reasons that astrophysics Is so exciting right now Is because the technology emerging On planet earth is allowing us To have more refined ability To detect what's out there Is that why it's more exciting? Yes, there is actually a book That advocates exactly what you say That technology enables Discoveries in astronomy So that's definitely a very important aspect But if you look, not just about the tools If you look at what we find There were major discoveries Over the past couple of decades That are really opening new windows Into the universe So one of them is the discovery Of habitable planets Planets like the earth Roughly the size of the earth That are in the Goldilocks region On their star where liquid water May exist on their surface If the planet is too close to the star The atmosphere And the water would evaporate If it's too far the water would freeze Into ice And life as we know it requires Liquid water So you need to be in some zone Where the star is warming The planet to the right temperature Roughly the temperature of the surface Of the earth, room temperature And we Just over the past decade Discovered such planets That are in the habitable zone About a quarter, we know that a quarter Of all the stars in the Milky Way galaxy Have habitable planets Roughly the mass of the earth And so that's a very important discovery The next step would be To figure out if they have life And there are plans On how to do that Some of these planets are passing in front Of their star They are just oriented the right way That they pass in front of the star And when the star light Shines through their atmospheres We can in principle dissect their atmospheres And try and figure out which molecules Are in the atmosphere Is their oxygen Oxygen is a signature of life Maybe methane Or other gases So that's something that could happen within A decade or two that we will start getting Clues about the composition of the atmospheres Around habitable planets Does that fraud? Does it? The planets were discovered Around the nearest stars The nearest star is Proxima Centauri And it does have A habitable earth Next to it Wait, I'm sorry You're saying the earth The planet near Proxima Centauri You already know is habitable Yes I have some wealthy friends And I tell them to buy real estate On the planet If the value will only go up Hey, it just so happens I'm selling real estate on that planet If they're interested Give them my email The key question I should say We don't know if it has an atmosphere So Mars is habitable Mars would be considered A habitable planet It doesn't necessarily mean There's going to be waterfalls And jungles That's right That's right In order to have liquid water You need an atmosphere Because if you have ice And you just warm it up in vacuum Then it turns into gas Directly It doesn't turn into liquid To have liquid water You need an external pressure You need an atmosphere Some gas surrounding you And that's why an atmosphere Is crucial for a planet So Mars lost most of its atmosphere And as a result It doesn't have rivers But it could have had Before the atmosphere was lost The question is To why Mars lost its atmosphere I mean, there are several possible scenarios One is that Well, Mars is smaller than the Earth It doesn't have a strong gravity To hold on to the atmosphere And also It doesn't have a strong magnetic field To keep the atmosphere So the atmosphere may have been stripped By the illumination from the sun By the solar wind Right now Indeed, Mars is not habitable In the way that the Earth is But we don't know If the planet near Proxima Has an atmosphere And there is a way to find out Within a couple of years With a new telescope That will be launched to space In a year and a half or so Called the James Webb Space Telescope It could tell us The temperature contrast Between the two sides Of that planet That planet moves around Proxima In 11 days So it takes One year is 11 days For that planet You know, if there is anyone there They celebrate their birthdays Every 11 days 365 And the planet is locked We believe it's facing the star On the same side All the time So basically There is a permanent day side And a permanent night side My daughter I have an 11 years old daughter And she thought that it would be good To have two houses on such a planet Because you want one house Where you can go to bed It's a permanent night side And then the other house Or place where you can You know, during your work time Or on vacation You can go to You need to introduce her to sleeping masks Hey, I'm interested I'm sorry I want to know If you feel personally When you tell me this It is exciting But it's equally frustrating to me Because even if this Is discovered to be a habitable planet With an atmosphere and with water We're never going to get there Doesn't that bother you On some existential level The feeling of like It's almost like being on a Born on a desert island And then getting some Very rudimentary sketch Of some amazing city Somewhere on the mainland That you'll never see Doesn't it drive you nuts? No, I'm actually more optimistic than you are I believe that our civilization Will get there eventually It will take a while If we use the standard rockets The same as the Apollo mission It would take us about 80,000 years to reach that planet But since Now we're developing this technology For Starshot In principle, if we develop it To an advanced enough level We could launch More massive spacecraft That could potentially Carry Humans In the long term That will take a while But I think that If our civilization survives For another million years There is very high likelihood That it will spread around the galaxy And You think that our civilization Is going to survive that long? Isn't the general prognostication Worth working on? The problems that we have Between people are worse Than in understanding nature In physics I'm much more optimistic about The ability to develop the technology That is needed than I am about The solutions that we will find To human relations Word politics It's quite possible that Our planet will be destroyed by bad politics That's terrifying But isn't one of When I think about Once I interviewed Once I interviewed Some folks from Singularity University In San Francisco And they were talking about How they're interested in using technology To solve the big problems If you solve the big problems The little problems get solved Along with the big problems For example, if we can Create a technology that Can easily produce clean water Then we'll get rid of a lot of the diseases Just by cleaning the water Definitely Everything physical Can be solved by technology But I worry about the mental Aspects of life The politics has to do Not with physical objects It has to do with human pride Jealousy Hate and so forth These things cannot be cured by technology Technology can only exacerbate them The latest example is The fake news on Facebook The fact that you have better communication Between people doesn't make them better Yeah, because Trump It's just Trump tweets Trump tweets could cause the apocalypse It's one of the strangest things ever But one of the solutions One of the solutions Would be That You and the people that you're working with Managed to locate Some advanced civilization And you somehow Figure out a way to gather Information from them This is one of the That would be amazing To me it would feel like Cheating in an exam If we were to ask them to solve our problems We don't know what most of the Universe is made of It's called dark matter We just gave it a name We don't know what the substance is But most of the matter in the Universe If we ask another civilization It will feel like cheating In an exam It's possible they had another billion years To explore the Universe So they know much more than we do But we need their help They will give us a much better perspective Because we will feel as if We are part of one team Here on earth and there is much more out there And I think once you get That perspective The internal fights that we have Become less meaningful It's better for us To cooperate and constructively Work together To increase Enhance the longevity of our civilization I do believe that it will Actually lead us to a better place If we find evidence for others I should mention that Astrophysics Has many other examples Of exciting discoveries We talked about planets Just a year ago The first discovery Of gravitational waves These are ripples in space and time According to Einstein Space and time are not Rigid entities They are being distorted By objects around them If objects move There are ripples in space time That propagate out When you throw a stone on the surface Of a pond you get waves out When objects move in the universe You get gravitational waves They were never detected directly But last year An experiment Called LIGO Detected the first signal Of gravitational waves Coming from the edge of the universe From a collision between two black holes It was not only the messenger That was new But actually the message That it carried was amazing It was a message about Two black holes Two very compact Structures of space and time Colliding with each other Creating a storm A space time storm At the edge of the universe And those waves from that storm Reached us a billion years later And With our most exquisite Detectors we were able to detect them And it's Quite an amazing Fit Maybe you could help Explain this to me a little bit I read a little bit about this Apparently there are these things called interferometers That's what they're called Interferometer But the essence of the thing is These waves when they pass through Planet Earth It's not like wind blowing through It's like for a millisecond Everyone On Earth Was like Contracted and expanded a little bit Like the fabric Of time and space That is mind blowing to me That we are that interconnected With the universe That these types of events Happening so far away Are actually causing Our atomic structure To change Temporarily Yes, it's correct But it's a very slight change We're talking about one part In 10 to the power 21 or so It's really tiny You cannot notice that Through our bodies There are hundreds of Neutrinos that cross Every square centimeter Inside Every square centimeter Every nanosecond There are hundreds of neutrinos From the big bang that are crossing us We are obviously Influenced by everything But the effect Of those gravitational waves Of those neutrinos Are completely negligible They're not affecting us much The only thing that truly affects us Are for example cosmic rays Are very energetic particles That come from exploding stars At great distances And they can cause mutations They can affect The way that we Evolve as biological creatures I'm interested in that Can we talk about that for a moment Because I think one of the Wonderful things about your work Is the encouragement For everyone to think outside The box a little bit Where you can make the really big discoveries And when we're talking about This idea of there being other Civilizations out there Then we kind of create a potential Spectrum of intelligence Surely human beings Aren't the An example of the height of intelligence In an infinite universe Surely There must be some spectrum of intelligence I should mention to you that We had some other ideas of Searching for them For example we can search for industrial Pollution in the atmosphere Of other planets Just like we pollute our atmosphere You know there might be signs Of other industries out there And that is potentially feasible With the next generation of telescopes But doctor don't you think that If you know Even looking for you know When we look for smog Facing these super advanced civilizations On our own Human Unfolding On our planet That's right Our imagination is limited By what we see around us And it's possible that nature Is much richer than we can imagine And that often happens To be the case when we make new discoveries But If you want to guide yourself In the right direction It's best to imagine what you see around you Because You know we can't do much better Another thing that we see around us Are city lights And one of the papers I wrote Five years ago Was to ask How far can we see a city like Tokyo for example Suppose there is a large Space craft That shines as brightly as the city of Tokyo Turns out that you can see it all the way To the edge of the solar system With the biggest telescopes we have right now So when I asked an astronomer Someone that discovered A lot of objects at the edge of the solar system I asked him Have you checked whether they produce Their own light Or whether they are just reflecting sunlight And he said why would I check It's obvious that they just reflect sunlight Those objects that I find Many times people have a prejudice They believe they know the answer Before they check it And in the case of artificial lights For example you can tell If there is an artificial source of light Because as it changes its distance From you It doesn't get Fainter as fast as it does If it reflects sunlight And so People just make assumptions That heavy objects fall faster Than light objects You're talking about your idea In the Kuiper Belt Kuiper Belt Right, that there could possibly Potentially be Artificial light coming from there And we just don't know because we've just been assuming That we're seeing reflected light That's right But has anyone tested this? Have you tested this? After you spoke with your colleague Did anyone begin to do Your calculations to determine If this light is reflected Or artificial? Not yet I'm still looking forward to An undergraduate student That will want to do that with me And that would be great We haven't yet done it yet The technique to figure out If it's artificial light Or reflected sunlight Is just by seeing how the object Deems as it moves away from us Because reflected sunlight The amount of light Intercepted by the object Goes down as it moves away However, if the object produces its own light Then The light, the source of light Stays the same as it moves away And so you can tell the difference between the two By monitoring how faint does The source get as it moves away from us I have to ask this This is way out there But I get to do that because I have a podcast Because we're talking about this Something that is Astounding to imagine That there is a civilization sending out These incredible bursts of energy To propel their ships through space But Couldn't there be the potential For Advanced civilizations To communicate with us In ways that don't match Our current understanding Of how we communicate with each other And this is something Are you familiar with Terrence McKenna? No, I'm not But I completely understand Your question and I agree with it Go ahead. In other words You say, okay, cosmic rays They can affect our evolution And if we're talking about A civilization that is so advanced That can propel a massive ship Using some God knows where it's getting the energy from Then Couldn't it equally be possible That an advanced civilization Could in some way or another influence Cosmic rays To produce The biological life That it could Send out pulses of DNA influencing Rays that could actually Sort of grow life from Potentially habitable planets Or is that crazy? No, this is a very Interesting question Well, first of all, I should mention that With respect to this hypothesis Of fast radio bus, we calculated How much energy is needed And you need roughly the amount of energy That is intercepted by the earth From the sun. So that is The reason that we suggested That it might be Interesting because a planet like the earth Collects enough energy Per any time to power These beams of radio waves But coming back to your question This is an excellent question There are ways to Not only affect the biology on a planet But also in principle Terraform a planet A planet that was not habitable Could become habitable Work on it if you do some engineering And that could be done In the form of Introducing an atmosphere to a planet That didn't have an atmosphere Or illuminating it Or directing starlight on it With big lenses Or all kinds of possibilities There is a way Of affecting the evolution Obviously of life on a planet From a distance It's also possible that they don't care about us About the creatures Like we are Because we are so primitive It's just like you walk down the street And there are ants on the pavement And you don't really care about them You step on them and you move forward I try not to step on the ants I try not to step on the ants But also When we're talking about Earlier you were saying We have to use what we know as humans To understand what's out there Of so below If we're talking about a super intelligence Out there One thing that I think about Is how I If we were together And I somehow Pulled a puppy dog out of my pocket And put it on the table We would both start playing With a puppy dog That's something we would do You would tease it a little That's fun to do This is an example Of a hierarchy of intelligence Because on one Into this temporary spectrum Of intelligence we have you Then much further down Is me And then there's the puppy dog I once said that I would Sometimes When I'm speculating about a super intelligence And maybe this is naive I like to think of it as more Than just like look at those little ants No need to interact with them I would think that if we were intelligent enough Then when we looked at an ant It wouldn't just be an ant anymore We would understand It's quite possible That they're looking at us They have not Interfered in any of our affairs Over the past thousands of years Right I'm sorry I'm sorry to cut you off I'm sorry just right there May I stop you just right there The assumption is they haven't interfered With our affairs And a lot of us think Actually They have been involved With us but the way that they've been Involved with us is in You know God I'm sorry to say this Please forgive me you are a Harvard professor Please forgive me But a lot of us think they've been Involved by a decade alex And that Scyvenes Mushrooms Caicha in the case Of m samen The Diemethyltreptomen These states of consciousness They produce What's interesting about Them is people who go into these states Experience similar things Yes well you see I'm a scientist It's not so much The title that I have at Harvard But the way I treat Evidence is I want evidence to be reproducible Yes And scientific in the sense that Independent people will agree on the evidence But this is what's interesting If you can produce such evidence From any experience doesn't matter That is reproducible and that many people Will agree provides solid Proof then that would be fine But so far we haven't seen such a thing Doctor come to New York And I will produce Evidence That is reproducible I'm talking about the quarters that I'm Going through On my daily routine I understand The other thing I should say is that If we succeed with star shot It's possible that once we send the spacecraft Outside the solar system We will get a message To the stellar club Right But we've been I'm sorry to keep going back to this doctor I will stop Because I know this is maybe outside of What you specialize in But this is one of the Fascinating things that humans do And I think it's A very important Maybe one of the most important things Is to gaze out into the universe And say is anyone out there It's the first thing We should be doing that But also what's interesting Is that we do Have these compounds That when people ingest them They do come Into contact with An intelligence and you say Well this needs to be reproducible verifiable And what's curious about it If you look into dimethyltryptamine Especially you will find a similarity In these experiences And it's absolutely I know It sounds so insane But the problem is A lot of us you consider ourselves Explorers in this realm We're kind of like the lunatic explorers From The time before we knew what was in the amazon And so we come back From these states and we tell these stories And people hear them and it sounds insane And yet People are Reporting contact In these states of consciousness And I just have to say If there is an advanced civilization And it's interested in communicating With Biological life that has reached Some level of consciousness It might choose to do this In a way that doesn't involve Technology Well maybe I would not exclude that But by the way You know it needs to be Very dense that one can look at And Demonstrate that That indeed it provides New information that was not known before And you know it has to pass Scientific tests Well this is and isn't this the interesting Problem because it's like I for example As I'm not aware of their being On planet earth right now A video Of someone's dreams And yet Everyone it's inarguable That dreams are a phenomena that really happen Right And so in the same way We have and we are getting It's really curious you know because we are Beginning to understand how these psychedelics Effect the human brain and I guess The essence of it is this In the same way that you are saying This person told you Why would we ever look at that Why would we ever we know it's light Reflecting in the same way It feels like there is this Overlooked Element of human experience That Is innately Alien which is the Psychedelic experience and yet because We don't have the gauges yet To measure what's happening in there Outside if we could do MRIs We know there's a kind of super connectivity Happening in the human brain when people are on Silosybing or LSD We can't project these images yet And From the scientific point of view If you ask people that are In the medical sciences and so forth They would say that your brain Is going through something but it has nothing To do with the world around the brain So it's not like A scientific detector like a telescope Looking at the sky and collecting it Right but doctor What we are saying is maybe there is some communication That We're being affected by cosmic rays On a daily basis Neutrinos are zinging through us All the time so there is a And I don't know that you would call that data It's kind of chaos Pouring out of time Interacting with us at the atomic Level That's how we understand it right now But who knows what those are Who knows if like at every moment We're being washed with Information that the human brain Is able to pick up on When it enters into a kind of refined state Of consciousness and all the Mythologies of people Who have been contacted by God, the burning bush The millions of stories These are just kind of a primitive A primitive Description of Contact with some kind Of superintelligence It would be fantastic If that happens to be the case And I will be the last one To say that a particular Path to knowing more About reality should be excluded I would say This should be explored And scientists should find out If there is something in it Doctor, this is your job You as part of what you do Should Consider Taking ayahuasca Or some kind of psychedelic For someone like me When we take psychedelics And we lay back and close our eyes And see these incredible patterns Geometries It feels a little bit like a chimpanzee That managed to get into the Cockpit of the space shuttle You're looking at something that is Completely ununderstandable But for a mind like yours To enter into that state of consciousness Even if you come back from that Reporting, you know, that's just Some kind of like biological Shift in the way that we Process information in the human brain It's not aliens you hippie Go back to the fish concert hippie Even that It would be a great gift To this particular field Of research, but I think A mind like yours going into That state and seeing These patterns that are So profoundly And impossibly beautiful You might be able to extrapolate from that Something a little bit more Than folks like me who are like Well, we should put that on a t-shirt You know, you might be able To see deeper into it and I think That it's interesting That it's interesting That you haven't had a chance To experience No, I haven't because you have to realize That my Brain is probably the most Important organ that I have In my body It's sort of like the muscles Of an athlete and I You know, if you go to an athlete and say Well, this will enhance the strength Of your muscle, you don't take risks Very often on those things Because that's the most important Thing for you and But anyway I'm sorry, but with psilocybin If you look at the research right now They're saying It is the safest It's the safest psychedelic And if you look at the work That's being done at Johns Hopkins And the research That's being done into it, I think you will find That even though I suppose there is some risk It's Highly improbable That something would happen to you That would in any way shape Or form Effect your ability to Process information In the way that you have trained yourself to I don't know Look, I'm just a podcaster You're a Harvard, forgive me Again, I feel embarrassed to even mention this to you But This is one of the things Terence McKinnon said Is that we have these I don't remember, somewhere in South America There's one of these incredible telescopes Gazing out the sky To try to pick up data from some Advanced civilization where right underneath That telescope Mushrooms are growing If you take them You will immediately have contact with Something profound By the way You keep Mentioning the fact that I'm a Harvard Professor, but I grew up on a farm And That was plan B If I didn't get tenure at Harvard I would go back to collecting eggs every afternoon And Growing up Vegetation That's an incredible thing to me That someone You have a wild life At the age of 24 You got a PhD You were Inducted or brought into some kind of Elite group of Physicists in the Israeli army And It's When you think about yourself How do you think You ended up in this situation When did you realize I'm a genius I'm basically a genius Well, I haven't realized it yet And my wife keeps My feet on the ground I watch the dishes Every evening And I think I just I'm actually quite surprised That I have ideas that other people Other scientists did not have before me Because they seem to me so Straightforward and Coming from common sense And that's why my papers Appeal to the public because I tend to think the way that Anyone thinks I don't regard myself as Particularly unusual It's just that I was lucky enough To succeed in Getting the job that I have And the most important thing It's not the title, it's the fact that the job Allows me to continue doing what I enjoy doing I mean I wouldn't enjoy Being on a farm But I enjoy more the creative Work associated with science And so the fact that I'm able To get paid for what I enjoy doing is unusual Most people in order to make a living They work on something they don't enjoy And so That is the thing I'm most grateful for And I don't think of myself As very different From anyone else It's just that it surprises me When I look at When I write a paper That this was not done before The fact that some of my ideas turn out To be original is really surprising It's mysterious That other people do not think the same way Why do people are afraid? This has to do As nothing to do with me It has to do with them But it also seems like There's so much risk in your field When it comes to Outlandish ideas Somehow I guess you've avoided When I've talked to other scientists Before and they feel like There's the risk of Being ostracized by your peers That's right I don't care about what other people think About me If I have a good idea And it looks exciting I don't care what their precautions may be If someone will not give me a prize Or will not admit me To some society as a result Who cares? I really am driven by The novelty of the ideas And whether they describe reality And trying to figure out what reality is like It's not about showing off It's not about celebrating Status Things like that It's about trying to understand things better That's the way I operate I'm very straightforward in the way That I Speak with people I never manipulate people That's one of the reasons I'm also department chair For so many years now I was asked to continue for another three years So people What they see is what they get with me I'm not trying to fool anyone Wow It's a beauty It seems like when you look back At the beginning Of science Scientists were out of their minds Like Newton Was Kind of obsessed with the occult That's right And didn't I spoke to a high school A few months ago And I said that being a scientist Is just like staying a kid Throughout your entire life You can allow yourself Not to know everything To ask questions, to make mistakes And that's horrible as a scientist Because we don't understand many things Right You maintain your childhood Look at things You inquire, you try to figure things out Most of the adults They operate differently They think about their own image The way they appear to others They want to acquire prestige To acquire money and so on And that causes them Not to admit mistakes Not to admit that they don't understand something As a scientist We have this privilege On a daily basis Just focusing on the things we don't understand Things that we can make mistakes And we can try and figure things out It's work in progress It's a learning experience I think that's interesting To me, I was reading about how One of the... You have come up with some incredible ideas One of them blew my mind Which was The idea that In the earlier days of the universe There was the potential For space itself To have enough warmth In it that Everywhere was kind of Had the right temperature for life Did I say that in the right way? Yeah, so if you go far enough Back in time The universe was sufficiently warm To have room temperature Everywhere Was room temperature But only for 15 million years It's just 15 million But how did you... Before we get into that The origination of that idea in your mind Because In an interview that I read It seems like this happened over... You were at dinner or something? No, I was actually... Most of the ideas come to me in the bathroom When I take a shower Because that's when nobody interrupts And so I took a shower that morning And it happened... Then I thought about this And then I realized, oh, it's Thanksgiving day I won't be able to work on this for the entire day Because guests will be coming in the afternoon And I told my wife I really need the morning to work it out You know, and If she can give me that morning Then I'll take care of the dishes And arranging everything in the evening And she gave me that time And I sat down and wrote the paper And within a day I finished I mean, the same day I sort of Wrote it up And send it out I should say that my wife I now realize that I have a lot of good ideas In the shower Two days ago She went to the supermarket And brought me These Notebooks That never get wet That you can write on the showers That's a great idea Because otherwise there is a risk That I'll forget the idea by the time I dry my seat That is... Oh God, one day I'll be such a genius That I need waterproof notebooks in the shower What a beautiful thing to have happen Have you had a chance to Go into a flotation tank yet? No I think this is something that you should consider exploring Because You know what these are, these float tanks There's no light That can get in There's no gravity It has a high high buoyancy So you just float In nothingness As long as you want And it seems like This would be the ultimate version Of a thinking cap for you If the shower works for you Yeah, it's just... The farther I get from people The better I am In the sense that I have time to think for myself About things The shower is one of these escape routes for me Because nobody would bother me then Let me ask one last question If you did happen To Come into contact With some kind of alien intelligence If you guys Do pick something up And you realize this is the real thing What would be the process In disseminating that information To the rest of the world? Well, this is an excellent question And there is no formal Process as of yet And this is something to be thought about Actually by astronomers There needs to be some procedure By which you notify someone So maybe the White House You notify An international organization But nothing like that exists There is nothing right now Because people think the chance of that happening Is really small Actually, we had Steven Spielberg as a honorary Degree recipient at Harvard A year ago And I told him about We are searching for potential Signals from ETs And he said I ask you please The first signal that you get that looks real Please call me first Let me be the first to know about it Wow! So obviously Steven Spielberg after making his E.T. movie is very Eager to know Can I be the second? Sure, why not? But it seems like This is something like U.F.ologists and people The conspiracy theorists are Concerned about this because they think that Oh, but Look at the leaks that come out these days From the White House and everywhere else It's really hard, it's very difficult To keep such a secret I don't believe In any conspiracy of this sort Especially among scientists Who are not trained to keep a secret What would the danger be Of just once you get the signal And discover Whatever that discovery may be Hopefully one that we make That you will make in our lifetimes What would the dangers be Of just uploading it to the internet And letting everyone know at once That we've made contact The only risk is If these are hostile If the civilization is hostile If we transmit a signal That tells them about our existence That's the only risk I don't see any other risk So I think the information should be free to the public That's my opinion If it's just a matter of collecting information Because you never know There might be someone that will be able to decode The signal in a way That other people do not It's actually a challenge similar to Breaking a code sometimes Because we don't know their language And in principle People that work for the intelligence Could figure out Much more easily using the software They have trying to decode Any signal like that So I would be very much in favor Of allowing the public At large to look at it And perhaps someone will figure out What it means Wow, doctor This has been an enlightening conversation I'm so grateful, thank you for giving me an hour I'm on Memorial Day If people want to find you How can they find you? Do they have to enroll In one of the most elite colleges on planet Earth Or is there some other way to Be taught by you Yeah, so Well, first of all, I have a website They can just put my name Avi Loeb on Google L-O-E-B is the last name at Harvard And they will see all kinds of things That they do and research that they do I will also visit New York City On And speak To the public at the Alchemist's Kitchen On the 16th of June, that's a Friday at around 7 p.m. So anyone that is in New York City Is welcome to go there Beautiful, I have all the links At dunkintrustle.com Thank you so much That was Avi Loeb everybody And you can check him out if you're in New York City At the Alchemist's Kitchen On June 16th Much thanks to Fulton and Rourke For sponsoring this episode Remember, go to FultonandRourke.com Buy some of their sacred Colognes Annoint your lover with this sweet smell And if you use offer code DUNKIN You'll get 15% off Anything you buy on the website Thank you for using our Amazon portal Thank you for your continued support And for listening to the DTFH Today's Hare Krishna $1500 Beacon Always Building Other sale and clearance prices Exclusions apply
194^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Talking Stones with Danielle Bolleli Transcript and Discussion^2014-09-13^Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. You done goofed, God. You've convinced yourself you're a human again. You think that your name is something that can be uttered through the end of the feeding tube you use to chew up hamburgers. You're trapped. You're in a gravity well. You forgot it was a dream. And now you're taking everything seriously. You don't realize that you're like the prodigal son. Wandering through the great wilderness having forgotten that your birthright is not lacking limitation, but is in fact the storehouses of heaven. You're an angel that passed out from drinking too much. Or you're like a high powered businessman or woman who like all high powered businessmen and women from time to time like to drive down to Culver City and get the shit spanked out of them by a dominatrix. That's you, God. And the great S&M dungeon we call Planet Earth. Enjoying the experience of not having to control everything for once. As the great dominatrix of life inserts her high heel deep into your immortal rectum. But when you're tired of it you can always leave the dungeon. Just don't forget. How are you going to enjoy being in a dungeon if you think you can never leave? That's the secret message in all religions. That we're all God getting the shit kicked out of us by a very talented dominatrix we call Mother Earth. I just want to remind you as the weekend approaches that you've got a terrible case of universal amnesia and whenever you're ready to have that dark lady's fist removed from your aching asshole, she'll do it. All you got to do is say please. It'll happen. Trust me. You're going to wake up to your true identity eventually but you don't have to do it until you're ready. That's the whole point. Enjoy the flogging. And when you're ready, towel yourself off, give Mother Earth a nice tip and head back to your cosmic skyscraper and start creating infinity again. Because it's fun. This is Duncan Trussell and you God are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast and this song is for you. You wrote it when you were John Lennon. I'll say it again. God is a concept by which we measure our pain. Yeah, pain, yeah. I don't believe in magic. I don't believe in aching. I don't believe in Bible. I don't believe in titles. I don't believe in Hitler. I don't believe in Jesus. I don't believe in Kennedy. I don't believe in murder. I don't believe in my truck. I don't believe in Gita. I don't believe in yoga. I don't believe in kings. I don't believe in Elvis. I don't believe in Zimmerman. I don't believe in Beatles. I just believe in me. I just believe in me. Yoga on me. That's reality. Dream is over. What can I say? The dream is over. Yes, David. I was the dream we've had. From now on I'm not born. I was the warmest. But now I'm young. And there's some difference. We'll just have to carry on. The dream is over. God, I love that song. And boy, do we have an amazing podcast today with Danielli Bollelli. But first, very quick business. Guys, did you know that our t-shirts are back in stock? If you went to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour Shop and you found the Ron Regi t-shirts were gone, they're all back. So if you want to get a really cool t-shirt designed by the mystical artist Ron Regi, go to DuncanTressel.com and check out these shirts. They are encoded with sacred mystical symbols that not only represent the amazing interplay between the limited you and the universal you, but these shirts are also special magical wards to not only prevent the evil eye, so that the next time whichever witch or wizard or shaman or cursed being is giving you problems shoots you the stink eye, instead of that dark, poisonous dart flying into your shockers and turning your day to shit, that dart will bounce off, I'm rubber, your glue style, and go flying right back into whatever goblin or bridge troll tried to bring you down. And when it enters their dark, slimy, oozing, cankerous, leper-like, death body, it will transform them into an angel, and they will make love to you for hours and hours and hours.

That thing needs a big fat French kiss by the Supreme. Let him feel it guys. Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Danieli Bolleli. Mr. Bolleli, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's been how long has it been? A while. I don't even remember. It's been a while. You left the country. I did. Five weeks in Italy. That was glorious. What do you do when you go out there? Lay on the sand and stare at the sun. No, I went to the mountains. Mountains was awesome. I was up in the Dolomite mountains. I lived here because I grew up in Italy and yet there are so many places that I don't know right around the corner. It's a trip. You go one place and then you go 10 miles away and it's completely different. It's like visiting another country or something. You really have to walk every step of the way you find something different. I love it. Isn't that wild when you realize that the universe that you thought you were existing in is actually just a tiny little fraction of the places you've been your entire life. It can be like that. You've been your entire life and you just had no idea that there was a huge expanse close to your house or that there was a meditation group you'd never heard of or that the history of the place you never knew. I know. It's a trip. There was just down the street from my dad's house. There was this church which, you know, churches are not exactly my typical hangout spot but I walked in for the hell of it. It was like the most psychedelic thing I've ever seen. It was beautiful. You could sit in there and just trip out. I can only imagine what it would be like on mushrooms because it was the intricacy of the art and the stuff on the ceiling was amazing. I don't need to care about the Catholic Church to appreciate that that was an insanely beautiful place. Yeah, that's right. People forget that. That's another example of just shutting down, closing off and mostly it's probably out of fear because it's very difficult to accept the idea that beauty emerges everywhere, all over the planet and that your resistance is actually the thing that's hiding it, not whatever the specific modality of the institution that's exhibiting the beauty. No, totally. Because it's funny, you know, you know me about religion and yet pretty much every other day as I would take a walk in Milan, I would just stop in the church, spend 10 minutes there, sit down, kind of like unwind and I was very thankful for that and you can just walk into your thing, nobody's bothering you. It's very quiet, it's silent, it's beautiful and then you walk out. How old is the church? You know, I don't even remember that one. Italy is funny that way because it's like, oh, this is a relatively new building. It's only from 250 years ago. Well, that's something really interesting about cathedrals and churches. I'm sure you know about this. How in the stonework are symbols that have nothing to do with Christianity but have been placed there by people who are following a much older religion. You've heard of that? Of course. That's one of the things that's interesting about religions is that even though different religions may absolutely hate each other, they tend to all recognize some power spots, which is why when somebody come in and conquer the previous group, they raise their temple and put their own temple right in the same spot because the idea is part of it is a statement of domination, but part of it is a statement of, well, there's power in that place and we want to tap into it. So you guys were tapping into it for your own weird stuff, but the power is there. It's an energy. It's kind of like, you know, like the cathedrals in Mexico City are right above the Aztec temple where you, even like stuff that look like secular and it really isn't like Mount Rushmore, they, is it a trip that they blast these mountains to put the faces of precedents in this iconic American sculpture where in the spot there was a Lakota sacred land where these guys acknowledge it as their sacred mountains and so on and so forth. Wow. And in a way it's like you're appropriating the sacred that's there. You all have different ones. They all acknowledge that the sacred is there and then each one wanted to put their own thing on top. It makes sense because if you look at every single other form of energy in the world, there's certain areas where there's more types of energy than other types of energy. Yeah, absolutely. A lake, there's more water. When you're in a forest, there's more trees. When, so yeah, the earth does have varying degrees of ways of expressing itself energetically. So it would make sense that there is a more ethereal, ephemeral, mana type energy that people who are tuned in can feel and know that those are places to construct these temples. I remember a couple of times I did road trips from California to South Dakota. So you know, you travel through a hell of a lot of forest, right? You go through Montana and you go through all these places where amazing, beautiful, natural places. And I remember getting to the Black Hills in South Dakota and objectively they don't look any different. You know, they are nice trees, big mountain, cool, whatever. I've seen it every step of the way between here and California and yet the energy is different. It's like, wow, I can see why people say this is sacred. And if somebody asks you why, you can't really put your finger on it because there's nothing that screams, you know, it's not more visually beautiful, it's not more anything. You know, you don't see it but you feel it. And that to me is a trip. And this is what they call a vortex. This is when you hear the term there's vortexes in Sedona or when you if you've ever, I know of a place where I used to be very skeptical about vortexes. But there is a place that I know of which is the hippies who are there call it an amplification vortex. It's not a some places it's like a positivity vortex where there's this sacred sense of a kind of loving presence. Some places it's a negativity vortex where you just it's like that feeling where you go to a place and you think this place isn't right or what they call a cursed land. But some places are just it's an amplifier. So if you go there, you have to actually modulate your doses of psychedelics based on that knowledge that it will amplify whatever energy that you're putting out. And if you if you ignore that, then you end up getting you'll end up taking what would be a regular dose of mushrooms. And it feels like you've taken five times that amount because it's doing something to amplify the experience. So I do believe that these places exist. Yeah, I mean to me it's not even a matter of believe it's like you feel it right is what you said, even in forget even places, even if you walk into somebody's house, you see it for walls, decoration art, whatever, but one place that looks pretty much like the next gives you the creeps and the other one feels awesome and you feel happy in that house, you know, and it's like there's nothing in the walls that's telling you this is a cooler place than the next. I mean some places, yeah, but a lot of cases is not like that, right? It's like they're objectively you look at it and it's like this looks like a nice home, so why do I feel like I want to slaughter a puppy right now? You know why do I get bad images in my head? Right. And it's like let's get out of this place. It's time to let's save the puppy and skip this place. Maybe the puppy sucks. Yeah, maybe that's always a possibility. The energy, the shifts in energy that exist on the planet, there are people who claim to be able to tune into that and they get work doing that. These are people who use dowsing rods or people who tell people good places to build and bad places to build. It sounds insane when you hear it but look at a bird. How does a bird decide where to nest? How does an animal decide where to create a den to hibernate for the winter? They have places they like to go and places they don't like to go. Something's moving them in that direction. In the same way that birds, when they migrate, it's some kind of magnetic resonance inside their little brains. So it makes sense that humans also have the same capacity to understand or to feel energy fields that maybe haven't quite been picked up on by science yet. Absolutely. I mean there's so much that we don't know and don't understand that to me this is not super natural. It's perfectly natural. It's just that we haven't figured out how to explain it yet. That's right. Yeah. Nothing crazy. It's life. It's nature. It's what it is. It's like to me even the fact that when we meet people, most people silence that voice but everybody has that thing that makes them drone to somebody and make them recoil away from somebody else. Again, not based on purely rational factors. Based on an energy that you pick up. That's right. Now that's a tricky one though because so many times I have been in a bad mood and gotten around somebody that I've met for the first time and then decided I'm getting a bad vibe from that person. Because you are projecting. You know, I'm the one with the poopy diaper and I'm thinking that there because I can't see the poop in my own diaper I think oh god they've really shit themselves. They're disgusting people and then I quickly realized that that's the filter that I'm putting on my own identity and that I'm looking out through. So how much of that it's a tricky place when you start getting into sensing energetic fields because you really do have to be adept enough to determine how much of the way a place feels is the place itself and how much is the energy that you're transmitting. You're making shit up, absolutely. And part of that is you really boil down to building a track record. If you realize that time and time again maybe you, I don't know you meet somebody and you're like that person has whatever that may be and you talk to somebody who knows them very well and you're like fuck that's exactly right that's exactly what's going on with that person and you're like oh I am picking up stuff if you do that on a fairly on a regular basis then you're like okay I'm usually there's always the time when you may be off but usually I'm not projecting too much crap my exception to that rule is hot women you know I'm usually pretty damn good when it comes to picking up things from people even fairly I mean very specific stuff sometimes like you know I'll see one guy and I'm like nice guy but man he drinks too much and the person next to me just goes blank like how the hell do you know that I'm like I don't know I'm making shit up but that's what I feel when I'm around that guy but then hot women who hold different stories because suddenly I'm like she's really sweet and nice human being I just want to get to know her more and you know my radar goes completely off the charts because suddenly it's like I want some of that which means that once won't come seeing your perceptions go to hell you don't feel anything anymore you're making shit up can't you go underneath the want though can't you just identify that part of your psyche is just being the mating impulse and then sort of go even go underneath that and be like oh okay I see this is the part of me that this is the genetic or deep part of me that wants to reproduce and then you go under it because you know I think that's like one of these like sad burdens that really attractive people have that they can't really complain about because people will be like yeah poor you but I think it must suck to be like a super attractive woman because you end up meeting bullellies and you have to start trying to do the filter yourself which is like how much of him likes me as who I am and how much of him is just trying to fuck me and that sucks doesn't it because when I'm around you I don't there's no part of me that's like you're my friend because you want to fuck me right man oh man I hit it so well I can't believe I pulled that off that was great but that's a shitty thing I think that people have to go through you know it's like that would be so that could put you in a really like paranoid world most of the time I'm okay with it because I'm not so starved for sex that I'm like suddenly I stop really looking at things for what they are and I'm just projecting but then you know there's always the time like there's a bunch of times when I see some women that are objectively super hot but I don't even like them physically right because the vibe I'm picking up is so like sure that yeah I mean I guess in some purely if what you look by objective standards of beauty you are hot but you're not really hot to me it doesn't speak to me there's nothing there there's no resonance yeah it makes me feel gross just to think about it like I can't separate in that sense I think I'm more the stereotypical woman in that regard where I can't really separate the emotional who you are as a person from the pure physical I kind of have a hard you think that's a feminine trait well that's the stereotype I don't know if it's a feminine trait or not but that's what people say well outside of gender I think you can it's weird how you can like take masculine and feminine and remove it from you know whatever this person's genitals are and like just say well there are traits that are considered to be masculine and there are traits that are considered to be feminine and those don't have to do with the person's meat body is looking like which is a weird thing because in nature you know this must be endowism endowism aren't there sort of attribute like certain places are attributed to be the yin certain places are the yin one is masculine one is feminine can you talk about that a little bit of course yeah the whole yin young business is many people misunderstand it as good and evil assigning to duality a qualitative difference not qualitative at all it's day and night is one good and one evil no they're just different energies right it's like hot and cold it's all relative it's not that one is neutral it's up top completely it is what it is it's an energy and there's it's opposite and in that regard so they have the whole masculine and feminine hot and cold dark and light all of this difference as seen as completely complementary like they work with each other and excess of any one thing is bad no matter what if you take anything too far it's not that it's bad in moral terms it's bad because you lose balance because you go so far one way and the structure of life is not based that way the structure of life is based on a constant mixing of this opposite energy that are dancing back and forth and that's what's at the roots of all of life if you can figure out the timing of that dance you can flow it well if you don't figure out the timing of the dance you keep smacking your face against the wall because again not because what you are there's anything good or bad about that particular amount of more assertive energy or more yielding energy is because you're using the wrong and or you're using a certain energy at the wrong time in the wrong context so in that sense there's no wear a t-shirt in the winter right exactly it's like it's not evil it's just stupid you're gonna be called right exactly it's just but it's just the way things are built yep that's precisely how it is so I kind of like that because to me the whole duality that usually people have of you know heaven and hell god and the devil that kind of thing there's always a fight between them the yin yang duality is more of a dance I mean to me the daoist symbol the yin yang is like a sexual symbol almost you have this yin and yang just grinding into each other and just doing this is not explicitly sexual but it's pretty close and to me I see that more in life than the opposing view of duality now if that's not stretching my yin yanginess I actually see both at play sometime there is also an element of good and evil in certain occasions which is also part of but not not taken to the extreme how it's typically done in most philosophy religions and so on where everything is about drawing a line in the sand and you're either on one side or the other and that's how they decide what's good and what's evil to me most of it is situational it's like if you're raising kids right is it good to talk to your kids and reason with them? of course it is but there's one kid on that one day that doesn't really respond to that and if in your head you have the idea that oh you should always talk to your kids and reason with them and never have a more assertive tone well that idea is sweet but not this time this time with this one kid no you need to be a little more assertive if you think that being assertive and pushing kids a lot is the way to go you may be right some of the time and other times you're just an asshole and you need to tone it down and instead be much more mellow and more is none of these things are right or wrong they're right or wrong in a context that context equals for a certain energy for that particular balance of any young you bring that forward great you go by a recipe of how you think it's supposed to be in all situations well you'll get it right sometimes and you'll horrendously screw it up others what is the is there a term for being in tune with the Tao or being tuned into this sort of to the tendency of things to work out instead of the tendency of things to become imbalanced I think one of the metaphors that they use the most is always this metaphor of water and so that ability to flow with the current in a way that the term itself flow which we even use in almost ordinary language outside of Taoism you hear a lot about somebodies in a state of flow is like everything they do is right they are on and they are in touch with it all I had this metamistical experience intertubing up in Zion National Park and I was floating in the intertube and it's beautiful up there and I was floating in the intertube going downstream and I realized that everything the river was doing was the exact right calculation to move my intertube down the stream and if I just let go the intertube would just get around stuff in the moment we've thought this before but holy shit man when you suddenly look at it and realize that river doesn't have a nervous system there's no brain it's not like Einstein it hasn't practiced a river is never practiced it just does it perfectly a river is exactly the right way and that tendency we're almost all water anyway so we're made of the same perfect stuff when you just let it do what it does it's perfect that same perfect tendency that's the thing if you start tuning into that instead of the micro or minutia moments that happen in any rivers excourse maybe there's a time where the river overflows its banks or maybe the river is a little low maybe the river sometimes a beaver dams the thing up and it looks like it'll never flow again but it always ends up going even if it dries up completely there's always going to be the tendency in that place for a river to exist because that's just where rivers go so tuning into that that sort of bigger picture instead of the little picture it really does alleviate some of the drama it comes from believing that this state that you're in will be permanent absolutely that's the thing about Daoism and about life that nothing is permanent everything is in flux everything is in motion to me in fact I don't surf but the metaphor of surfing is perfect for life because it's all about those tiny little adjustments that allow you to adapt yourself to the wave and not fall if you do it right you're less and you're constantly you're always slightly off balance you're a little too far to the right a little too far to the left and you constantly tilt it back to adapt to the energy of the wave you know how to do that you know how to flow through life you don't know how to do that you become food for the fish which is also flowing through life in a different kind of way well no that's the thing though you're always flowing through life and you start recognizing that here you are a kind of mutant river that for this little bit of time gets to wander around and be a person then you understand that no matter what you're part of a perfect calculation that's unfolding and everything that it outputs is always perfect and always purely harmonious and purely resonant and that includes your inevitable inevitable the inevitability that you're going to be some form of fish buffet of course that's why there's a flow a more universal way of looking at the flow kind of like what you're saying sort of the Ram Dass teacher you know can't you see that everything is perfect type of approach and then there's the human flow which is I still have an ego I still like things to go well rather than not for me my view of what well is and I'm going to figure out how to flow within the boundary of my human ego well that's what I like the Ram Dass perspective because that they don't say therefore go into some bliss bliss state and ignore the pain they say Maharaj would said he loved pain because it showed him Larry was still stuck and that feeling that we call pain is actually quite often that the moment that the river of our lives gets trapped on some particular gets pushed up against some particular boundary or rock or we begin to resist the way that the thing is flowing that's what we call pain or it's the river identifying itself with one piece of this totality and thinking this is all there is but it's when you start having those human moments which are inevitable and constant and realize like here I am god damn it I thought I was this tiny little part of the river again I forgot not only am I an entire river I'm an ocean I'm an entire universe for that one little fucking second man I was really really glued into that spec of temporariness that I've decided is my human life that's beautiful in itself the ability to switch back and forth purely in your human ego driven self well you're missing out on the bigger aspects of life but if you're always up there you can't really live a human life as an individual either it's like there was an hilarious twitter exchange between Deepak Chopra and Rogan oh great I didn't miss that Chopra wrote something he was long ago but I remember because he was so funny Chopra wrote this thing that was very you know I forget I'm paraphrasing but something along the lines of once you become enlightened once you become conscious whatever that was all your problems shall disappear there shall be no more problems something like that Rogan replied well if you're enlightened by somebody kicks you in the balls you still got problems he was hilarious he was like he was the perfect yin yang yin yang gets weeding to each other exactly it was perfect that beautiful back and forth aspect of it it really is so delightful to go into the dream and out of the dream and into the dream and out of the dream but it's even more delightful when you start recognizing that it's not so much a circular pattern that's happening where the same drama patterns happen and then the same awakened patterns happen but when you begin to realize there appears to be a kind of spiral happening which is that every time you come out of the dream it's a little better and every time you go into the dream it's a little better because you're evolving and that is a I think one of the great gifts of being a human being is that you get to experience not just the cessation of suffering but when the suffering resumes the suffering has an entirely different flavor and as that back and forth happens in a state of mindfulness the flavor you realize is becoming sweeter in the same way that grapes when they're fermenting transform into wine and I think that's the gift of spiritual practice yeah it's not designed to make you I mean some people argue that and that's where I have a difference in it it's not designed to become something other than human to be completely removed from the human level and to live in this pure ethereal dimension up in the clouds to me the real mystical experience is that the Zen approach it's like ordinary experience but one foot above just that little tweak in perception where you still can live in the ordinary world in three dimension in going out and grocery shopping and taking care of business and all of that at the same time your perception of reality is just tweak that enough in the world but you also have access to a different way of looking at it that's more in tune with the stereotypical mystical experience again that to me is Yan Yang which is taken too far the what people call mystical become escapist and remove from being able to keep your feet on the ground and what people call practical and being realistic is that completely and lacking salt to some degree so again even that to me is a balance and the balance does not mean 50-50 a balance changes with each situation sometimes you go into one energy real deep but you always know your way back you need to sometimes dedicate yourself 300% to that one thing you go into it you have this deep mystical experience you spend days, months, years whatever in one approach but you're also able to tilt back and bring it back to a place of balance yeah exactly you don't want to be a junkie in any form and you don't want to be a it's so easy to from personal experience I can say that the easiest thing to convince yourself that your cowardice is mysticism and that your fear based aloofness is some kind of form of renunciation of the world because these little matters are of no importance to us because we are the universe yeah it's an easy trap to fall into and I've fallen into it before and when you come out of it it's really fun because you realize like oh god the thing that I was avoiding was in fact my guru and the time that I thought I was spending with my guru or in a state of higher consciousness was me turning my back on the thing itself because it's the pain and the suffering that is actually what skull... you know man I just heard this great I love going to record stores and buying going to the spirituality section they have all these great old records man a lot of cool yoga records you can find but one of these records is this guy I don't know too much about him Ananda or something if you google search him and find out that he like drove limousines or had a I don't know a goddamn fleet of private jets filled with drugged up nude hippies please don't get mad at me don't throw the baby out with the bath water it really is just something I found in a record store but he seems really smart and he told this wonderful story how there's in this temple the idol there's this idol and in front of the idol there's this rock and the rock and the idol are having this conversation the rock says the idol what's going on here man we're made of the exact same thing and you're getting milk poured on you every day perfume, fans people are bowing down to you what is going on, why are you getting all the attention I'm sitting here a lowly little rock and the idol says well you see you chose to be that and the rock says what are you talking about and she's like well at one point you and I were both the same rock and the sculptor came and he and he began working on us he broke us into two pieces and he started chiseling away at you first and the moment he started chiseling away at you you screamed in pain and the sculptor stopped thinking you were possessed by a demon and then began chipping away at me and I thought well there must be a reason that this sculptor is chipping away at me so I waited and the sculptor uncovered within me this form of this deity which was always here the sculptor found it but it required a lot of blows of the hammer for me to get here and you avoided that and so it's that you see in life to the moment the scary thing happens or the bad or whatever it is we run away from it and quite often we don't run away from it consciously we run away from it in the direction of some form of meditation in the direction of chanting in the direction of listening to audio books about thinking oh no no no I'm not running away at all but really it's like no you just gotta face the fucking sculptor's hammer because once all that impurity has been cleansed from you then you become an immobile imaginary deity that hypnotized people worship you don't want to take it too far speaking of rocks I'll tell you a funny story that I read there was this one anthropologist that was tripping out visiting a Ujibwa guy like this tribe from sort of great lakes are North and US after Canada you know I don't get it you guys seem to think that everything is alive and that everything has a spirit kind of the anthropologist said do rocks have spirits and this guy said well some do some do what does that mean you know how can you tell it's like well some rocks talk to me and some don't of course why don't you know that that's so cool yeah well and this is the this is the question when you talk about an animistic universe or if you've ever been to a Hare Krishna temple you should definitely go if you've never been especially go to the morning services they have them every morning right around 4am and I went to one in Italy believe it or not well I was in Italy I was my daughter was you know of course there's the music and the clothing and the sounds on a sensual level there's so much that passes through your senses that they're such a big compared to that's why Catholicism to me is in some way not from a theological standpoint but more attractive than protestant stuff because there's the incense and amazing churches the beautiful stuff not just some do talking it's juicy but yeah my daughter loved it she was like thought the Hare Krishna experience was so much fun it's amazing and if you get yourself up early you're already going to be in a psychedelic state because who the fuck wants to wake up at 4am but if you manage to get up you know call it there's Hare Krishna temples everywhere I'm not recommending becoming a Hare Krishna I'm not and I don't like I'm not a fan of organized religion in any of its forms it's a little too sticky for my taste but that doesn't mean that you can't go to a Hare Krishna temple and many people there probably don't like organized religion but if you go to a Hare Krishna temple very early in the morning you should try it sometime there's one in Culver City if somehow you manage to wrench yourself out of bed I've only done this once I've only woken up at 4 in the morning maybe five times my life I try to avoid it if I can't but when you go there what you'll see is the devotees sort of greeting the rising sun that's really what's happening is there chanting and expressing all forms of gratitude for the fact that a new day has emerged into the universe where they get to be at least in the process of falling in love with God or the universe or whatever and these are rare people because they wake up at 4 in the morning every fucking morning who are these people what are they you're already around really interesting different beings than most people you encounter every day unless you work in some kind of job where you have to wake up at 4 in the morning but you know that's a different game altogether anyway man when you see them looking at the deities because they in the Hare Krishna temples they have deities of Radha and Krishna, Jaitanya all the various elements of Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga when you see them gazing at these things you see them looking at something like it's a person and then when you start looking at the deities depending on how open-minded you are how stoned you are then you will begin to see like oh this is not quite just a statue and then the question that comes in your mind is well what am I witnessing here is it alive am I seeing a projection of the consciousness of the devotees reflecting back from this inanimate object is it just a mirror for consciousness am I seeing a reflection of my own consciousness am I seeing possibly a reflection of the highest potential in me being bounced off of these forms that super smart people manufactured because they represent an archetypical energy that exists inside of all people who the fuck knows but definitely sometimes rocks talk to you not that, yep and I like it better when they talk to me rather than when they scream in demon posse fashion like the first time don't hit me with the hammer that's never particularly fun yeah, no and usually that doesn't happen thank god unless you're like really, really high but I think that this is the component missing from the catholic church and from all varieties of yoga is the there's always a general rejection of the intoxicated state not in all the time but a lot of the time at the base level when you run into people they'll always say hands down you would never come to this place under the effect of an intoxication you would never come to church on Sunday stoned out of your mind you would never go to a temple having ingested some amount of psilocybin but there's a whole school of thought based around the idea that not only should you do that but it is the way the stuff started in the first place and that component got lost or left out well I mean that's the thing why your organizer religions usually are not too fond of direct experience because once you experience something directly you yourself you don't have to depend on a dogma you don't really have to depend on them in a way you're an individual who can join the community but you have your own individual experience that does not bode well for an organized religion that's why to me is like even the Jesus story there's a story that I use all the time when I teach Native American classes where I when I do the Native American history course there's one thing that I bring up about that about the whole story of Jesus and how it's perceived from a shamanic context there's 1800s 18 this one tribe and they tell them all about the gospel and this one guy is getting really into it so the missionaries are like cool you know we're making a convert this is working and by the time they are done the guy just look at them and say I like Jesus he's just like my grandpa and they're like no let's try that again you know he's like Miracles and this and that and the other and all of that and he's like yeah I heard you the first time he's just like my grandpa you know how your guy went off for 40 days in a desert fasting and praying well my grandpa went on this big vision cast and just like your guy after doing this he had all these powers you know he never really did all the miracle business before because you know he went on this big vision cast he had this powerful experience acquire these powers so my grandpa you know went out gained his power became an amazing healer they would bring in people were half dead he would bring them back told people to be nice to each other just like your guy you know Jesus good shaman good medicine I love that and and that's the different between an organized religion and the tradition that encourages direct experience you know the Jesus experience in that sense is something that maybe not every human being but many human beings or some human beings could have access to God I love that it's so liberating to hear those things you know there's a verse in the Bhagavad Gita the person attached to the flowery words of the Vedas is like a person who drinks water from the well when it flows everywhere right and it's the it's like organized religion is like someone trying to sell bottled water in the middle of a field of fresh spring water and it's just there for you and they don't want you to know that they don't want you to know it they active that's where it gets creepy but they because built into the game they're playing is almost an active attempt sometimes to keep you from recognizing the one simple truth which is you don't need to do anything via another person right you do need to do something you gotta pick up the phone you can't call somebody without a cell phone you gotta pick up the phone but that's why to me on one end there's that devious aspect of somebody who's really trying to push it because there's power there's a lot of kind of dark games that you can play acquiring power over people yeah but then at the same time there are there's a line at the door of people who are knocking at somebody to say please direct me in life I don't want to think about it too hard because the whole problem of the yin yanginess of it all is that it requires you to be really sensitive it requires you to be constantly paying attention to be aware to be able to shift to the right a little shift to the left to keep that balance you know is not a dogmatic state you have to adapt it to the situation every moment and the situation is constantly changing so what it requires more of all is awareness is being alive is paying attention is sensing the subtle changes that are taking place for most people that's way too much work can you just give me a list of I do this I'm good I stay away from that you know there's good and bad I follow one I avoid the other the way I can do that in all context in all situation and I don't have to think so damn hard because it's a pain and plus if I'm the judge of trying to figure out what's exactly the right balance who that's a lot of responsibility on my shoulder I don't like it just tell me what to do please right right and that's like that's when the good teacher that's like in all the Zen stories where someone gets whacked with a cane precisely it's like not the way it works motherfucker but the the tendency for people to do that is an okay tendency because you learn growing up and there are there are teachers we need teachers for everything and so there's spiritual teachers and there's real spiritual teachers but the real spiritual teachers always inevitably get you to a place where you're like oh well it's nice knowing you you know and it's a fun goodbye you know it's a fun goodbye because they know they've done their job the moment you realize you're done they've done their work because now you're back at that place where you're not projecting your own intelligence on another person and maybe they have systems to get you there but God knows I think the smartest people are the smart people do not want to have power over somebody else because it's like eating at a McDonald's when you could be eating at a really nice restaurant like really smart people I think have connected with this much greater something much greater than somebody thinking there's things much greater than people thinking you're special how about the idea that the entire universe is in love with you think about that the entire fucking universe is madly in love with you it's crazy it's crazy when you say it it sounds crazy you know when you're a kid and you see a movie there's a beautiful woman in the movie who did I get a fucking crush on when I was a kid I had a crush on she ended up being a lesbian she was in like 70's movies and I can't remember her name but I had a crush on her man and when you have a crush as a kid you're a little girl you end up getting crushes on bands and you put their pictures all you have Justin Bieber everywhere and you start fantasizing about this idea that you know if I just met Justin Bieber if I just met whoever this beautiful person is I think I'd have a shot and maybe you start writing them letters or maybe you start whatever you just have fantasies about it but it never happens of course maybe you get arrested because you're a fucking psycho stalker that impulse that is the impulse of bhakti yoga that is the impulse of falling in love with the universe only the difference is you will be reciprocated the moment you start moving in the direction of recognizing that we are in a living field of consciousness that for whatever reason the game it's playing with us is a game where we're limited and it's unlimited we don't quite know it's there yet though we've smelled her perfume from time to time and we felt we felt something that has given us the impression that she or he is there and you could start waking up to that more and more and more and suddenly you begin to realize like oh holy shit this universe is the thing having the dance with me I'm the yin it's the yang or whatever I think that's real man you're rocks alive and talk to you universes are alive and talk to you and usually what they say is I love you so much I love you not in that creepy whispery way that's how I say it I love you, I'm following you you can't see me fuck you psycho universe every breath you take no but it's real man it's real and that's why by the way you guys are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour who else in the world would have ever told you that Justin Bieber fandom is a form of backty yoga you can only hear it here well it is and whatever you're doing you know if you're like any kind of infatuation you currently have out there whether it's with, whether it's requited love unrequited love, whatever it is whether it's with a video game whether it's with a job dream, whatever that attraction is you must understand that that is the embryonic beginning phases of what is called backty yoga and that feeling is not something to be rejected but to be cultivated and this is where you come into the land of Tantra when you're with your lover and you start having sex with him or her what you do is you start you know as part of the practice you recognize you're having sex you are having sex with the living universe you're having sex with the breath of God you're having sex with matter animated with spirit you're having sex with a perfectly harmonized combination of quantum particles that are vibrating at a frequency that allow them to hold form and channel a identity that you consider to be the person you're having sex with and that conduit is in fact connected to all of time and space and so you literally you're making love with time you're making love with the universe that's Tantra, that's Backty and you're just a few steps once you get there all you've got to do is pull back a little bit and realize that the way you have sex is not just by putting your penis in someone or someone being entered by a penis the way that you have sex is just what you said Montseor it's the way the yin and the yang spin together in that eternal pattern and it is very sexual it just doesn't have to be with people it can be with your dog I knew you had something like that if you want to experience God fuck your dog, that's what I'm saying that's in every religion that's what's hidden in every religion that's the secret truth of the Illuminati it's written in the core of the sun if we flew into the center of the sun there would be a little stone block when every language says just fuck your dog that's what I learned that you finally revealed the truth that I've been trying to hide for so long from us just say it! and by the way I'm a little worried because I've seen your dog and it's really small so I don't know about it's not the size of the dog it's the wag of the tail I see just kidding obviously don't fuck your dog what do you think about these solar flares you heard about this? I heard I left it a third I didn't go anything I don't know sometimes when I start seeing stuff that can destroy the universe kill me ruin everything I know after a while I'm like ok I already seen five of those this week I don't want to see another one because it depressed the fuck out of me after a while so I was just curious I mean there is something I don't want to be evaporated by a massive blast of nuclear heat from a from a star but there is a something hilarious in that moment when all the world leaders Obama Putin just realized that all their ridiculous machinations all their stupid ideologies are just no you're just getting turned into gas right now by the star that you've been floating around but no it's basically the sun shoots out these things called flares which are these massive explosions of energy and generally it shoots them out when it's not not in the direction of the earth but when it shoots them in the direction of the earth the earth gets bathed with this high powered energy and the aurora borealis lights up the satellites have problems radio like short wave radios fuck up and my conspiracy theory above top secret self thinks that they could also cause earthquakes or there's some part of me that's like well we are the sun where the the sun brings us to life so does that mean when there's solar flares there's going to be also flare ups on earth of riots and war and earthquakes and that kind of stuff because it's just too much energy and when too much energy gets applied to a thing sometimes it sparks and unfortunately here because the way we express ourselves is through conflict more than love the sparks emerge in the form of conflict when some more advanced planet maybe it would be when the solar flare happened everyone would be celebrating because it always meant that there would be 7 new inventions some amazing thing because we were still in a stupid caveman when is it supposed to hit well it's already we're already getting bathed it reaches its peak tomorrow if you live in the north west you can google search this guys if you live in the north well this I'll try to put this up today if you live in the north west and you're listening to this on Friday the 12th of September and it's sort of like the middle of the country look it up I don't know anything about this shit look it up or just look up at night and if you see something it's the aurora borealis and if you don't well you're not in the right place that's you should do weather for TV why do you need me just look out your window dummy is it raining well it's raining man do you uh so what are your what's your plan with this dowice this dowice lecture series what's going on with that am I allowed to talk about that so you have a lecture series on dowism right now I was um I put together like 16 short topics each lecture is like anything from like 15 20 minutes to 45 roughly put 16 out of them out there so there's the whole series about 7 hour plus covering all the things about dowism that makes sense to me that click that are to me the key foundational concepts of dowism and then applying them to life you know because the whole point is not just oh great now I know how to talk about dowism and cocktail parties for the fuckers is about um also being able to apply this concept just to make your life better plain and simple so I put those out and um them and I had fun people seem to dig them so far so where are they if you go on my website on danielebolelli.com there's under the store there's the only thing up there is the dowice lecture series man you should be doing those all the time you should be doing those constantly that that is such a brilliant idea to start putting that stuff out there that was fun and dowism is really such a uh so is so wonderful because it undercuts all the symbols that the ego resists you know I like I'm at the point now I'm 40 I've smoked enough weed taken enough acid done enough had enough heartbreaks where I have no problem believing that a blue skinned cowboy could be god and I have no problem believing that Jesus could be god and I have no problem believing that my girlfriend could be god I have no problem believing that you could be god but that took a lot of probably like it's probably took it I felt my bike was not as a kid got a concussion right I'm not saying that's necessarily like a properly functioning brain right but what's cool about dowism is it cuts underneath all that bullshit and it's just like whatever the externalization of this general universal principle is irrelevant if you tune into this simple subtle idea yeah because at the end of the day all of this stuff is very practical it's very it's kind of like what you were saying is you don't put your shirt on in winter you freeze it's not while dowism may seem really complicated and subtle and weird the application of it should make life simple if it's not designed to complicate things it's not designed to be super complex system it's designed to make you awake it's designed to help you read the situations in front of you and respond in a way that works better for you rather than getting you through more drama and heartache and maybe sometimes even that's part of the game and you need that and that's also gained in young businesses when the goal of everything is easy and flow well sometimes you need not to balance it out so you know all of this is about balance and you know a bunch of times people that ask me over time because I always talk about dowism because I dig it to me it's not even about I like this strange Chinese philosophy to me that's the language of life that's just is a perfect explanation for me for how life works so I use that all the time and people are always asking me you know I recommend and there's a bunch of stuff out there that I like and there was always something for me for my own personal perspective missing like I love love love Alan Watts but there are a few things where I can see how certain people don't respond to the kind of language that Alan Watts write in or stuff like that there's you can read the Dow Le Ching but which translation and each translation as it's so after a while I got tired of replying to people with well you can check this but read this but and I said okay you know fuck it I'll do one thing that at least I can not necessarily that I think is the best thing ever done about dowism but at least I can stand behind because it's my thing you know I can it encompasses what I get out of dowism for me so if you're gonna ask me the question I can direct you there because that's my take on it you know yeah that's great man we need that we need that I mean Alan Watts is awesome I love Alan Watts and life changing but come on he doesn't have a sexy Italian accent he doesn't know how to kick fucking ass he smokes cigarettes Alan Watts didn't know how to Alan Watts wasn't a didn't know martial arts he didn't have a black belt that's the thing that's funny is like people respond to different stuff right so it's like somebody the best person in the world will speak in a certain language will have a certain certain characteristics that will attract some people and turn off others that's right but warriors are always cool man especially when you're not one or like like I wouldn't I'm not a martial artist so whenever you're around them it's always cool because it's like you guys have an active practice that manifests in a very specific a very specific set of skills it manifests in a very in a really cool way and that's that's on the surface is considered violent but whenever you run into you guys always peace always this kind of balanced stable emanation I think that's really cool man instead of the I like it when people walk the walk not that Alan Watts didn't walk the walk he's fucking awesome and he had his own way of doing things you know and his audience was a more was like a kind of like academic super like intellectual kind of dry audience where like I love what you're putting out the signals you're putting out are juicy and like and connected to where we're at right now in the ocean of time thanks man that's I'm gonna hug my teddy bear and blush now high praise I love that you bring a teddy bear to every podcast of course the teddy bear is I always have to bring it up because it teddy bears are sweet just today I was dropping off my daughter in kindergarten she just started and a little later I realized that I was walking down the street all holding a giant otter not the actual animal the stuffed version of it I was getting some strange looks I had a pink backpack on my back and I was holding this giant otter I felt perfectly comfortable but yeah that's a thing that like one of the many things that gets ripped away from us in adulthood is we're no longer allowed to cuddle inanimate objects you can worship a fucking deity you can pray to a cross but you're not allowed to clutch a soft bear at night everybody should have a teddy bear I think it's we should launch that as a new trend I think you got the name of your of your next book well okay so where can people find you and this lecture series on Taoism so danielebolelli.com that's would be the easiest thing that's the where you find a lecture series on Taoism and other information about me Drunk and Taoist podcast you can access it from there there's its own website Mr. Duncan Trussell has been a guest multiple times already and that was a blast too I'm sorry the last time man I was

knew you didn't have much time so I just grabbed my sandwich I was running outside with my sandwich probably also running away from the guard saying hey you stole it no that wasn't it no but I was

Tis I Duncan Tressel and thou art listening to the Duncan Tressel family hour podcast. And last night my sweet brothers and sisters I was visited by the Lord in the form of a marijuana lollipop and the Lord said to me, It was brutal and it made me think. You know you're having a really intense marijuana trip when you start like referring to the Bible but it made me think of this verse from the book of Corinthians. So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord. Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup for those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ, eat and drink judgment on themselves. If that isn't an accurate description of what having a bad trip is, I don't know what is. And it really lends credence to John Marco Allegro's theory that early Christianity was actually a mushroom cult or was using mushrooms as a kind of sacrament because if you take a plant medicine as the kids are calling them these days and you do it in a kind of frivolous way, it may pan out and you'll just have a fun, relaxing, cool, awesome night or you might get invited into a special classroom with marijuana or whatever it is that you're taking. And every single one of these plants, they have their own personality. And marijuana, if marijuana feels like punishing you, it is a true motherfucker. I went through the whole gamut of the bad trip from my own insecurities emerging to a kind of hard realization of moments in the last few months where I've been a prick to going through like business obligations that I haven't fulfilled yet or emails I needed to make or phone calls I need to make to physical pain, like my feet cramping, a feeling of like shit. Having a heart attack or something. And then as I'm sort of half falling asleep, I actually saw like a hell realm, just this endless, never ending kind of fractal of shit, just constant, never not literal shit, but like, you know, icebergs made of screaming faces and melting demonic skulls dripping into other melting demonic skulls. This was a powerful lollipop and the thing that I used to pull me out of it was this verse from the psychedelic experience, which is a translation of the Tibetan book of the dead by Timothy Leary, Richard Albert, soon to become Ram Dass and Metzner. And it's basically a guidebook for tripping. If you're some, if you're a psychonaut, if you're somebody who takes psychedelics a bunch, definitely, definitely put this book in your arsenal. So here it is. I just want to read a little bit of it to you, but this is a tool that you can use the next time you find yourself falling prey to the marijuana terrors or whatever particular terror you have induced upon yourself by taking some psychedelic. Oh, nobly born, listen carefully. You are now entering the second bardo nightmares. Recognize them. They are your own thought forms made visible and audible. They are products of your own mind with its back to the wall. They indicate that you are close to liberation. Do not fear them. No harm can come to you from these hallucinations. They are your own thoughts and frightening aspect. They are old friends. Welcome them. Merge with them. Join them. Lose yourself in them. They are yours. Whatever you see, no matter how strange and terrifying, remember above all that it comes from within you. So the next time you find yourself deep in the marijuana terrors, I invite you to use this tool. Who knows? Maybe it'll work or maybe it'll freak you out more, man, because if the demons come from within you, then that makes you a hive of demons. We got a great podcast for you today, my sweeties. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. I used to have a friend, but a web designer chewed off his face. If only he'd used square space.

It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. It's been done. You know that we are kind of like freaking out right now a little bit over politics, because we keep getting in these great political conversations. You're kind of terrified or you were saying that you spent a lot of time digging through the various news feeds. Right, right. Yeah. I do this like a, I have like a 1984 hour of hate where I just like straight up just hate read all this shit and just get angry. And then I'm like, what am I doing this for? What time do you do that at? What time? Like 3 a.m. when I should be, you know, decompressing or like trying to just like meditate or go to sleep. But I'm like, no, no, no, you're going to get hateful before you go to bed. What is that? Because I do the same thing. I don't know, man. I find like a, what I will do is I will go fishing for the worst thing I can find. And then once I find it, I will, that's when I go to bed with this nugget of horror that I didn't fall asleep thinking about. Yeah. I'll like look up to sing on banin or just like sit and disbelieve at what's going on. And then I'll turn it off and then try to like go over the, I'll be like, well, you got a lot of good things coming up. It's like so hard to like find positivity in my own life when I'm like, well, everything else is going to shit that I feel guilty for like enjoying myself and my like small piece of the pie. You know what I mean? I, I grew up with a ton of Catholic guilt and everything. So I think that's just my MO to like, you have to feel anger and like shame and, and your race Catholic. Yeah. And no, yeah. Oh yeah, man. Yeah. The Catholic, what is that about Catholicism that it teaches you shame is a good way to feel. It is this thing, anything that brings you pleasure is wrong, you know, like a man died for you. So you owe him your life, you know, and like any good thing, it's not you, it's him. He did it for you. It's like, Oh shit. That's such a convoluted. Do you still, but no, no, no, no, I mean, my, my journey with like religion and Catholicism is so fucked up and just incredible, incredible amounts of shame and guilt, like crippling. And you know, that's things I've had to like kind of take a machete to and like I'm going through the jungle and cut through like when you were a kid, is that's where it started? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like my, my dad died when I was younger. How old? So it was eight. And so it was like a thing of, you know, everything happens for a reason and it just so happened that like I accidentally found the spice channel like two weeks before he died. So I had this affirm belief that it was completely my fault that this dude died because of Catholicism. You know what I mean? I mean, so God to punish you for watching the spice channel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally believed that for a long time. Didn't you have anyone to talk to about that? Who the fuck am I going to say that to? Your mom? You know, no. Oh my God. It was, it was like a completely tragic death. So it was like a thing of anytime anything would get brought up at all. It was just massive sadness and tears and everything. So it was like, dude, do not bring that, especially as a kid. If I was sad, all the adults around me would get sad. So it was like, whatever you do, man, do not get sad. Fucking you're the fun guy. Everything's good. You know? I just had to hold that inside. You know? You were taught as a child that the thing that created the universe was so vengeful that it kills fathers if their kids watch the spice channel. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's what I thought. And, and I, you know, I mean, when I was little to punish me, my parents, I did this like picture Bible, my parents would take away my picture Bible. Like I loved Jesus, like I loved God, like I loved, I loved going to church. I would try to get the communion before my first holy communion. A couple of times I would just go up and follow my dad. And then I wouldn't leave the priest until they gave it to me. You were fearing the call. You were called to the priesthood. I mean, when I was little, I wanted to be a priest. I was like, this is what I'm going to do. And then, you know, the day my dad died, I had a dream that he died. And I woke up and I was like, God would never do that to me. God would never do that to my family. And then boom, he's dead. And I'm like, what the fuck? When you had the dream this was right before it happened or after it happened. Right before it happened. So you actually had a premonition. Yeah. For real. Yeah. Was it similar in the dream? No, he had just died. And my, my, his aunt, who we all called aunt, sis, she died the day before. So like that morning I woke up and I was like, dad, don't go to work. He's like, no, you know, you're just upset that aunt sis died. I like begged him. He's like, no, no, no. He took me in and was like, look, got baseball practice after work. I'll come home. You know, I was like, okay, I go to sleep. I had that dream and I woke up and I was like, oh, thank God. And he had called the house that morning too to talk to my mom and I was like, oh, God, it was just a dream. Thank God. You know, and then my mom was a teacher's aide at my school and she got this call and she like left. She ran out and then this girl came up to me and goes, uh, are you Ian? And I go, yeah. And she goes, your mom had to leave because your dad got hurt at work. And I was like, yeah, dude, this fucking first grader told me, I'm like, Jesus Christ. Yeah, man. So then all the, like the, I had to, I had to go to like the principal's office and like, no, no, no, everything's fine. It's fine. I had to go to aunt's sister's house to take care of things. I was like, oh, okay. And then they came to get me out of class and I was like, oh, I know what's up. You know, the whole way, my grandfather and my mom picked me up and my grandfather never shut up a day in his life. Just like in talk, talk, talk, loved him, Poppy, the best. And we wrote home in complete silence. I was like, I know the deal. You know what I mean? That is heavy, man. Yeah. You have. It's not just the spice channel as much as you had a authentic premonition of a thing that you couldn't stop. Yeah. God, have you ever, have you had premonitions since then? No. I mean, my dad and I were like abnormally close. When I was born, I was born 27 days premature. I was three pounds, 11 ounces. I'd live in an incubator and I was in the hospital for a first month of my life. And every day, my dad wrote me a letter and, you know, every day before he left for work too, from like five, six until he died, he wrote me a letter before he went to work. Just like on legal pad, you know, just like a fun little thing. So I have these stacks of letters of him and we have tons of home videos and I found tapes of his that I would play when I was older and then I'd get into the music. If I liked it, I'd find an artist and I'd get into music that way. So I got to like know him in a way without him being here, which is incredibly grateful for. And I found like journals of his when he was, you know, like 24, 25. And but I have all these things, but it's like, you know, I just, he and I were absolutely so close that it was almost like this thing of like, I knew in a way his soul was going to leave his body. And I don't know if he like something from him came to me to tell me that. I don't know, but it was, it was like this, this wild thing. Well, there's a lot of theories on that. I mean, one of the interesting, one interesting thing is that his sister died the day before he did his aunt, his aunt, right? So you get these like, you get the concept of the soul cluster. You ever heard that before? So it's idea that beings incarnate certain beings incarnate together over and over and over again. So that's a soul cluster. And sometimes when one being leaves, the other one quickly leaves too, for some reason, they're connected at that level for some reason. That's why you'll hear a couple like death in threes or whatever. Or is it like a couple dies like, yes, yeah, yeah, where they just leave together. They decide to go or, or even, um, Princess Leia and her mom within the same day, they both split. Well, yeah, I had, I had felt guilt about that too. Like, do you really even love your dad? If you can live your life without him, you know, like I would think about that, you know, and also my dad, he had like a very dark kind of morbid sense of humor than the night before he died. We're all at aunt's sister's house and he's like, boy, you better hope I go before your mom. Cause if not, you're going to be in for a world of hurt, you know, cause he was like the disciplinarian and my mom was very like, here's a presence that you won't be upset, you know, and, uh, wow. Yeah. Do you, uh, do you feel like you still communicate with him at all or have any connection with him? Yeah, you know, I, um, for a while I, I, I, I really found solace in like booze, you know? So I felt like the only way I could, the only way I could ever like a moat was if I got so drunk that finally things could come out, you know, and nobody likes that. Nobody likes the sad drunk or the guy that's like drinking with you and then turns he was like, do you think my dad's proud of me? They're like, we're just playing kings. Like what's the matter with you? You know what I mean? It's your turn for the waterfall. Why are you bringing up your dead dad, you fucking asshole, you know, but like I would like drink to like get up the courage or strength to like call out his name or, you know, I'd like write to him or whatever. And, and, um, you know, thankfully now I found that I don't need to do that. And, um, you know, I, I, I, um, you mean you don't need to drink. Right. Right. Right. I don't need to drink to like tap into my emotions. You know, I've, I've, I've really worked hard at like trying to be an emotional functioning human on my own without having to find something to inject into my body to make me, uh, feel like it's okay. How many, how many years have you been sober? I'm coming up on two years. Uh, I've, I've been trying since 2008 and I'll get like, I treat it like the gym. Like the second someone's like, Hey, you've been losing weight. You look good. I'm like, no longer need to go to the gym. You know, like the second I make any progress, I'm like, dude, you can handle a drink and I'm like dying for the vodka, you know, but, uh, that's so, that is so scary to have that alcoholism is such a fascinating thing in that you, it's, it's a form of demonic possession. It's like, that's why they call it spirits because it takes it away. Yeah. Oh wow. That's so wild spirits. That's right. But I mean, it has a, it's interesting because in like a cult mythology, the concept is, if you can control a spirit, then you, you can use it. You can actually use it to do things, you know, you can make it do whatever. This is the oldest story in the book, but if you can't control it, if you do, if you conjure a spirit and you, for whatever reason, don't have the ability or the whatever, then it'll always fuck you up. Yeah. Well, that's the story of like Led Zeppelin with Jimmy Page and black magic. He got into black magic and apparently like something went wrong with these spells he was doing. And then all of a sudden Robert Plant's son died and then John Bonham died and it caused like this huge rift in the band because it's, I think of it as like magic as kind of like multiverse piloting. So you, if you do it right, you can jump into a timeline that is more in tune with what you think happiness represents. But if you do it the wrong way, if you let your ego guide you into the timeline that you think you should be in, oh, that's where you can start fucking up and you can pop into timelines where shit like that does start happening where degraded timelines or sometimes I think that you can like, okay, this is a really weird concept, but the idea is no such thing as time. So we're all in this evolutionary process that's happening over the course of countless incarnations, cycling, cycling, getting maybe that's why you had the premonition that your father was going to pass away because you've lived this life so many times that you, that part of the record has a little scratch in it because there's trauma and it like transcends time and space. And so when you get close to that, every time you reincarnate, you have a dream or some sign or some moment or something like that. But so the idea is that every single one of these cycles, you get a little better or you get a little worse, hopefully you get a little better. And then so that means that at some point already existing, if there's no such thing as time is some enlightened version of yourself and that you can call out to that enlightened version of yourself and it'll start pulling you towards it through like the various possible timelines to that point. In other words, we can not only improve ourselves with a goal in the future, but we can actually pray to our past selves and send good energy to ourselves in the past. It's totally, by the way, I've proven all of that. I'll show you my charts. Yeah, man. Well, I mean, that's the thing. A therapist tried to get me to talk to my past self, like my child, Ian, and I immediately put up this fucking block. I was like, not fucking happy. It was like a group, two of my best friends, we used to work in a sober house, I used to live in a sober house. And then I ended up working in one and these two guys, I was friends with very funny comics as well. We all went into this thing together and they're like writing letters to themselves and I'm like, this is a fucking happening. I got up and walked out. I was like, uh-uh. But in not letting that fear dictate me and walking through it, since then I have been able to look at that child and look at him and talk to him and I guess send like positive forgiveness back to him in a way and that's helped out tremendously. And like every time I've tripped mushrooms, I do have this thing of like cyclical, sometimes I get in this cycle of, it all goes back to cycles, like something of like reliving, regenerating in a way like, I don't know, but I can relate in a way to what you're saying. Yeah. Well, this is Nietzsche is the one who came up with this. It's the idea of, he's got a crazy name for it, but it's something return that, but essentially the idea is like deja vu has happened because you've lived this exact same life an infinite number of times. Like basically, I guess another way to put it, it's, you know, about Nick Bostrom and simulation theory, the essence of it being the odds are more that we do not exist in base reality than the odds are we exist in some simulated reality because the odds of being in a species that is the first species in the universe to simulate reality perfectly and then go into that simulated reality, which is what seems to be happening, what we're going to be able to do soon. The odds are far greater that that had already happened and that part of going into the simulated reality is a wiping away of the realization that you're entering into the simulation because to know you're in a simulation is to in some way impair the experience, the power of the experience of the simulation. So for example, if this were some training simulation, if you were say a young God and this is a training simulation, then for you to be in a training simulation and know it's a simulation, you're not going to understand the impact of your actions on other people at the level you would want something in a deep training system to experience something that was going to have a lot of power at some point. So anyway, that's the idea is we're doing this loop over and over and over and over and over again until we fucking get it right. And then the moment you get it right, you're dead meat. You have a heart attack. You go skiing and run into a fucking tree and you're free. You sort of transcend and you can you can act. You don't have to die, but it is always considered death. I mean, that is in Christianity. Jesus said that over and over again. You must die to this world to come to know me or ayahuasca. It's always death or mushrooms. You always feel like, shit, I think I'm going to die. Or yeah, or I mean, it is about the death of ego, you know, like, like the smashing that ego at any time I I have, you know, like an uptick in ego where I try to take my will back. That's when like shit goes haywire, you know. So it's like, ultimately, I want to smash my ego. I want to smash any semblance I have of thinking that I'm above anything else. Yes. Yes. Oh, see, this is why this to me is the usefulness of marijuana. Because when I get if I eat marijuana and get stoned enough, anything I've done that's egotistical, anything I've done that's based on elevating myself over someone else or being a selfish fucking cunt is the marijuana is like, look, yeah, oh, look. It's like suddenly realizing you've got like the worst acne breakout or something. I don't like it. I think you feel evil. I'm like, I get it away. It's the worst. Yeah. You feel, man, where you need to take a really long, hard look at yourself and you're forced to realize, oh, no, you didn't have to hurt that person. You definitely didn't have to say that. Why did you say that? Yeah, yeah. Why do you think you fucking said that to that person? Why did you act that way? Yeah. And then you try to worm your way out of it like, well, I was tired. Right, right, right, right, right. You were just a dick. Yeah. Yeah. So I like that because it gives you a chance to improve and to crush your ego over and over again. How do you, what are your, what tools do you use to, if you start getting a case of inflamed ego syndrome? Um, you know, I really, uh, positive self-talk is like a incredible tool that I've come to use because I have just this record of negativity in my head, you know, like reliving my past or obsessing over things or, you know, you'll never this, you, you aren't that. And so I got to like kick the shit out of that and just be like, you know, your, a lot of times I'll just even be like, you're here, your feet are on the ground. You only have control of things that are like two feet around you, you're in this moment, you know what I mean? And, and trying to find gratitude in my life and realize it like the only, like in, in a way, Catholicism is like the only reason things are here is because of God. Anything you do is, is because God did it for you, you know, like, thank you God. But like really I have to, I have to think like for me, like the only reason these things are happening in my life is because I'm sober. And the only reason I could be sober is because I, I could be honest with myself and being honest with myself today is something that I couldn't do, you know, five years ago. So it's like that is something I got to be grateful for, you know, because it's like a super power. Yeah. Being honest with yourself. Yeah. It's really, really difficult. Yeah. It really is. Isn't it? It's one of those things where, you know, it sounds so fucking easy being honest with yourself, but yet it seems like the mind is constructed to trick itself. Right. And especially with social media, you can be fucking live in a million lies to trick everyone in your life that like you're living this wonderful thing. And in reality, you're just a fucking scumbag, you know what I mean? Like it's, it's fucking wild, man. And that trips me out to like thinking about like what you put out and what is truth and like at, at what point are you just brutally honest with everything or do you have to have some sort of, you know, aura of whatever that you put out there. And so I get tripped up in that, but if I can just be like, if I can be as much as who I am or who I think I am and try to be that guy, then everything else is inconsequential. I don't care about putting out this image of like, well, you, you know, this, this or that, like if I'm just true to myself and it's taken me so long to find myself, if I'm just true to that dude, then everything else will fall into place and it's not my timeline. If I try to control like I need it now, I gotta get this nail and it's like, I'm gonna end up fucking it up, you know, so I just got to try my hardest to be who I am, a fucking little while dirty dick dude from Delaware and just fucking, you know, treat people the way I want to be treated and just be funny and fun and be appreciative for the little shit I have and everything else will fall into place. If I try to, you know, one up someone or be, you know, big daddy fat dick, then it's like not going to work, you know, what do you pray, no, I used to and I, I talk, I talk to something out there, but I don't get on my knees and say like a formal prayer. Oh, no, you pray, I mean, talking to the thing, yeah, this is the, I mean, so when you talk about, okay, well, I'm grateful for my sobriety and I'm grateful for this amazing ability to be honest with myself, which truly is an incredible, that must be incredible, an incredible relief. Well, yeah, it took a while, live in lies and not being true, you know, took a long time. Like an example, what's an example of a lie you are living? Man, for most of my life, I hid this from everyone and just recently I've, within the past year, I've been honest, but I'm like kind of gay, like, you know, like, like I'm more bi than anything. And I hid that from everyone, including myself with and all that shame and everything because I thought, you know, I got all these dead relatives upstairs and they're looking down on me and they're pissed off, ashamed. And really when it comes down to it, my, my dad loved me and all he wanted to do was for me to be happy. And you know, I was just so worried, I come from like a small area. So it's like, if I told these people these things, they turned their back on me and I already lost, you know, I experienced loss when I was younger. So it was like, no matter what, don't lose nothing else. How did you know you were, how long have you known you were bisexual? Ever since I was a little kid. Oh, wow. So that is a, so, oh, that's truly living. Oh, that is one of the primary definitions of, fuck, like hiding your sexuality from the world and all the associated shame and the gods. Wow. Yeah. So now you're like saying it on podcasts. You're completely open. And now I'm like, you know, I don't fucking care because it's not worth my sanity of like living this separate thing and like hiding it and being like, you know, and, and also too, the main goal for me is to be a good comic. And in order to be a good comic, I got to be truthful. And I was just tired of not being fully truthful. And the only way, you know, I had to be more truthful in my personal life in order to grow on stage. Yes. And that's like the most important thing to me is, is being a truthful, honest comic. That's what I saw, man. When you were up there is you could feel that honesty. That is there. And it's so powerful. The, and what you just said, by the way, you know, people say you don't give advice about comedy because they wrote, but fuck, man, if that isn't one of the most profound statements, which is your personal work on yourself, taking risks in your own life and being honest with yourself and opening up to other people, how you actually feel is a risky fucking situation a lot of the time. And ever, but if you don't do that, I was talking to this comedian J London and he was saying, you know, your personal life, it leaks out on stage, you know, so if you're like not, if there's something that you haven't addressed needs addressing than on stage, ooh, it will lose right out of you. They could see it in your eyes. I don't know what it is, but there's like a, there's a little imbalance. Right. Right. And, and crowds are fucking, the people that go to stand up shows are all at the same time so fucking stupid, but so smart in a way that they can intuit fear and they can know when you're a fraud, you know, and they can know when you're scared or you're not confident. They may be dumb and laugh at stupid things or like, you know, may just be like these idiots that are like, you know, out, we just, I love, just like, you got any racist jokes on this phone, but it's like, at the same time, they're so, they're like dogs, they can sense fear and everything. And, and if you're not truthful in that moment, then, then like, what are you doing? And the moment you are truthful in that moment, it is the kingdom of heaven on earth. Like there's nothing like it in the world when you catch the wave. Yes. And, and I think that's something that's easy to forget as a comedian is that every time you go on stage, it's a different way. It's what you're saying may be repetitive, but there's a whole, there's a metaphysical force. Yes, that energy in the room. Yes. Yeah. That, and that's that force, you could go into that force and ignore it and perfectly recite your jokes, hitting the punchline at the exact right moment, timing everything out and fucking bomb in the most insane way, like just go up in flames. Yeah. Or you can hit that moment and butcher your jokes. Yeah. Fall all over. Just fuck up your punchline, screw everything up and have the greatest set of your life. Yeah. And that is an easy thing to forget. It's such an easy thing because it's an invisible force, man. Yeah. And that feeling is in every moment. It's just on stage. It's more amplified. Right. Right. Yeah. But the ability to tap into that is something that, you know, like, it's like, uh, you know, that book, The Giver, you ever read that? No. It was, uh, this book I had to read in like grade school. I'll never forget that this boy sees everything in a black and white, everything's black and white, but there's this old, old man, the Giver and he starts working with him and he's the only man that can like see color. And there's this moment where he tosses an apple to the boy and in the air, he can see red. And I feel like there are these moments where everything's in black and white, but I get these little glimpses of color and I'm like, fuck, yes, hold on to that, fucking keep working and then everything's going to be in color, man. And it doesn't stay forever, but the moments that it does, it's like, those are the things you got to hold on and work for. That's right. That you have to be, you know, you have to, you have to, it's good to be, at least to acknowledge it in some way or another, whether to yourself or to somebody else and to be kind of scientific about it because it looked deep into that. Like that's something I don't do enough of, which is when a good, a dark moment, I like dissect, cut into pieces, look through every component, fixate on the darkness. But the great moments, you're just like, God, that felt fucking great. But what you need to look deeper into it and understand what was that. I'm positive that you can, you don't have, you don't have to be a stand up comedian to surf that wave of energy. Right. Because Jesus Christ, man, there's like entire months of my life where I'm faking every single thing I do. Oh yeah. Yep. Just going through the motions. Just going through the motions. And then there's some moments or a day where you're like, I'm in it. Oh, you're like, you're like a, you're like a fucking hyena on the planes, just chewing it. It's those months worth it. You know, that's what you got to hold on to and be like, all right, I'm in the shit now, but I'm fucking going to come out and I'm going to be that hyena that's fucking running after every goddamn gazelle. I don't know why I use that example. Not exactly like animal people associate with joy. Nothing happier than a hyena wallowing in a corpse of a rotting elephant. But that, that kind of visceral connection with the life energy where you transcend the depression momentarily or whatever the entropy is. Oh, I fucking love it. For me, man, it's prayer. I like to pray. I have various gods that I, or faces of God is a better way to put it that I like to pray to or think about or connect with. I used to be ashamed of that. Oh yeah. Well, because it's not cool, you know, it's not, it's like so cool to be like there is no God. It's like, no, fuck you. It's so easy to be like anti and against and too cool for fucking tapping into something. But I fucking love that, man. Like there's, there's something out there. I don't know. I'm too little to know what it is. And I have shit enough to say definitively if there is or isn't, you know, well, the experiment has, but it's the, so the idea is, okay, the question is, well, is there something out there? Is there? And I'm, I think there is. Uh, and then, then instead of like, okay, well, I'm going to pray to it in an ambiguous sort of way, you can start, there's actually a, a kind of science behind this process. It called Bakhti is what it's called. So it's the process of cultivating love for God is, is what it is. It's not like you just love God right away. You can't, it's, you can't love anything. Right away. Like it's most people don't, you can love your dog. That's a good place to start. Do you have any animals? Yeah. Start with the dog. You love your dog. Yes. Oh my God. Lucy, my baby. Yeah. What kind of dog? Congressman and Poodle mix. Oh, I got her name tattooed on my foot. There you go. There you go. You start with your dog because your dog is, um, your dog or your pets. Or there's always something that has within it. You know what love is. There's no question about it. When I think of my dogs, Gatsby and Fox, it's just, uh, I know what that feels. I mean, it gets right in your heart. Like you can actually touch the part of your body where you, when you think about your dogs, you can actually touch the part of your body where the feeling emerges. That part of your body is your heart chakra. That is actually the energy vortex that is called the heart chakra, which is where, uh, love happens or what happens through your entire body. But anyway, so it's like scientifically, if I can take a, if I can take a sample of something, even if it's a tiny little sample of a thing, I can use that sample to then begin to extrapolate bigger versions of that sample. So if all you need is one, another way to put it is all you need is a little spark to start a fire. Yeah. So from the analysis of like, okay, well, I love my dog like that. What if I could transfer that feeling to the entire universe? Fuck. Can you imagine what you would be like if you felt the way you feel about Lucy about every single moment, right? You realize that Lucy is just one pixel and a massive, never ending tapestry of love, but you've only been able to see the part of it that's Lucy. So that's Bakhti is the, it's trying to spread that out. I love it. It's, it's pretty awesome. Yeah. And it's very scientific. It's not scientific. Forgive me, scientists, but it's very organized. The process is really quite organized and it's intellectual. It's not a faith-based thing. It's just a kind of like, well, is there something bigger than me? Is there a creator force? Is there a personality to the universe that transcends the need for a body? Right. And then you ask those questions in a real way and see if you can find the answer. So start praying more. On your knees, get on your fucking knees right now and pray. Well, I mean, I think that's, uh, I mean, finding that love, I think we are in, and I'm going to sound like such a cheesesteak saying this, but I think we are in a very unique position at this point in time in history, where we do have a, uh, a job of in our, in our time on stage, it is our duty, no matter what, to make people feel joy. And, uh, I don't think that we should just limit that to the stage. I think that we should have that in all of our interactions. Like, who am I to, to, to take joy? I, I've lived my life very joyless. I spent a lot of years in anger or shame, depression, and it fucking sucks. So I know what it feels like to, to be shitty and to feel shit. So I also know what it feels like to feel overwhelming love and Bakhti. And, and, and, you know, so why not try to spread that as much as you can. You know, I, I, I just hate negativity so much. I hate people who's like, it's their MO to just be like, everything's awful. And it is, it is shit is bad, but there's so much good. Well, they're saying I'm hungry. When a person is like that, they're, that's just the same thing as saying I'm hungry, but they don't know that they're hungry. So they think everything's bad because they have an appetite for something. And they don't know what the way, the way to quench that appetite is. It's a, it's a, it's a really rough spot to get into, you know? And, but again, if it's like, okay, well, I can feel love for Lucy. Then, or I can feel love for Fox and Gatsby, then the question is how intense can that love get and how, what would happen to me if, if that love was intent? Is there a way to make that become increasingly amplified? And if you did that, then this, you wouldn't have to spread joy because, and you already are like this, whenever I get around you, I get happier because you've been working on yourself, you know, and you can feel it when someone's been working on themselves, it brightens up a room when you're doing the work, even if like you're like having little stumbles here and there or whatever. It doesn't matter if you're just making the fucking effort, any, any effort. It doesn't have to be extreme, even just a little effort of like working on yourself, everyone feels it and that's the spreading of the joy where what's generally happening with a lot of people is they've inside, they're a fucking callus, they're like a, the callus on a, on the foot of some fucking sailor, just like a thick gray mass, they're just, yet still they're like going around trying to spread love, but they don't feel fucking anything. They're just, and that's causes, that's a problematic place. But even if you are a callus, try to spread fucking love, it doesn't even matter, do what you can. Yeah, there's no, there's no, there's no one way, you know, as long as you're trying or making an effort, that's, that's so much more important than the finality of the product you're putting out, you know. Yeah, you just summed it up. That's it, because I'll tell you, the reverse, which does happen to people, the reverse happens to people where people become so collapsed in. I mean, it happens in the universe. We know when a star collapses, it makes a black fucking hole. Yeah. And what person will collapse inside so much. There are all these collapsed stars walking around. Yeah. And what's there, and if you think about it, what is their care, what happens when you get around them? Everything sucks because they're trying to suck you into that fucking darkness. They can't even help it. They're want, want, me, me, take, take, give, give, me, take, give it now, what, me, this is me, am I, no, I don't know. Everyone's out to give me a, suck, suck, suck. And it's the, it's really a fucking rotten place to get into, you know. So if you haven't fallen into that place yet, then there's so much hope. I mean, even if you are in that place, theoretically, there's hope, but there's fuck, man, we didn't get to talk about a ban. We, it's 453 right now. You've got a little bit more time. Yeah. I got like a 10, 10, 10 minutes. So very quickly, can you tell me what you were telling me last night about banning and the fourth, what's it called? The fourth fuck. It was a, the fourth return. No, the fourth, the fourth turning, the fourth turn. Okay. Tell me about this. That's right. So there's this theory that like, um, uh, so there was like the civil war reconstruction. Oh, wait, very quickly. It's banning is what he's Trump's advisor. He's, yeah, it's like senior advisor. Okay. Basically he's Trump's puppet master. Yeah. You know, it's, it's banning sitting on a golden throne with one hand up Trump's ass and the other up Sean Spicer's ass. And he's just putting on a puppet show for everyone. And remember worm tongue from Lord of the Rings? No. Oh fuck. He was like, there was a great king and, and like worm tongue was this like sorcerer who's always sitting next to him and like whisper in his ear and it was like, anyway, so banning is the great manipulator. That's what people are saying. So go, go on. So it's like this thing of there, there was a civil war reconstruction, great depression, World War two, and these were all massive events that in, in the aftermath, there had to be like a complete, there was a complete tearing down and then a like rebuilding and a restructuring. And so banning believes that right now we're in the process of this tear down that needs to be rebuilt and he wants to completely tear everything down and have a new order come up that completely destroys democracy as we know it. He feels that the first aspect of this was a financial crisis in 2008. And it kind of is true that after that, the Tea Party came up and these Tea Party insurgents infiltrated the Republican Party. So the Republicans had no other option but to listen to the population. They had no other option, but to listen to the people because the people were the ones that infiltrated the Republicans to get shit passed. And they ended up taking over and they ended up gutting like the Republican Party and now we have all these idiots there that no longer want to work along party lines are like, no, no, we're not going to go through politics. We're going to listen to the people. That's what we are. We listen to the people. But the people are idiots that just, you know, are screaming about these wild things and they're not realizing that no one gives a shit about them. Well, the people are, I mean, the people are confused, right? Yes, yes, yes, confused because they don't know what's happened. No one like the info that they're getting is coming from sources that they're not, for example, even this fourth, what's it called? Fourth turning. Yeah, I mean, we got to look it up to see if it's real because these days you don't know the fourth turning could have been invented in the basement of the fucking Huffington Post by somebody who's like, right, we don't know. So this is the entire country, right? Or the world right now is that we are, we are, it used to be the news happens. You hear the news and you're like, fuck, I guess that happened. Now you hear the news. You're like, well, what corporation is warped based? There's no trust. Yeah. And isn't that one of the first signs of fascism is that you don't trust. They make it so that you can't trust anything. You have to look to one person for like the real source of things. That's it. Yeah. That's one of the signs, man. I'm scary. Bannon's scary. So, but even so, if we are collapsing into fascism, then what better time is there to start this like personally trying to connect with being honest with yourself because really, you know, if the media is giving us fake news, who fucking cares? It's entertainment. Don't fall for that shit anyway. But if you're giving yourself fake news, you're fucked. Yeah. If the reports you're giving yourself are like, no, I'm all right. You know what? I'm all right. Yeah. I feel, I'm not so, I'm not so, you know what? I feel fine, even though deeper than that, you're like, oh, yeah. No. And, and, and also if it is going to shit and we are just tumbling towards destruction and whatever, I'd rather be, you know, like a dumb positive person who can hold their head high than just like this, you know, sad apocalyptic, you know what I mean? Sure. I'd rather just be like okay with myself and, and be like, well, you know, it took me a long time to get it together, but at least I'm on the way now, you know, and instead of just like, you know, the withering and wallowing, which I've done, I can't judge people for doing it because I've been there. You know, yeah, sure. And I mean, we all have, you know, yes, but, you know, it's, it's a, I mean, it would make sense that, you know, things go to shit finally when I find some semblance of, you know, like when you're crushing on stage, when you finally are getting your comedic voice in only six years, you're up there crushing New York audiences, and then the whole fucking economy collapses and it's devolves into fascism. Yeah, there's no more comedy left. I really caught the last crane out of town to nowhere. I think no, you'll, you will, you'll, we'll still need it in the camps, man. We'll need it in the FEMA camps. No, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I'm the thing is about it is the apocalypse is always happening. The moment the big bang happened was the beginning of the end. The beginning is the beginning of the end. Wait, what is that diva lyric? Yeah, the diva lyric, the beginning was the end of everything. So no matter what, it's the fucking apocalypse. Yeah, yeah. But you get to decide whether you are going to be the apocalypse and what more, what is more beautiful than the power of your own decision? You know, yeah, which might get taken away. But oh, no, they can't take it, brother. Not within ourselves. No, they can't take it. They you can't God, this is talking about a cheat. You can't they can't put out the light. That's the great frustration of the tyrant. They can, no matter what they do, they cannot extinguish the light. Thus, the fucking flagellation of Christ, the crown of thorns, the crucifixion, the never ending fucking brutality in the last days of that being's life, all desperate attempts from power to extinguish the light and nothing worked. Nothing could put it out. That's what's cool about it. You the moment you start beaming the light, decide to beam the light, decide to try to find the light to beam the light, you become a revolutionary instantaneously, unfortunately, because that's the world we're in. Yeah, where a lot of people aren't making that decision. Right. Well, I mean, like it's it's a I grew up like I was in love with punk rock and hardcore and scon everything in a there, you know, that whole thing is like punk is dead or whatever. But it's like, you know what, in in Brazil, in Mexico, in Iran, there are these underground subcultures of teenagers and like kids in their 20s that are putting on these secret punk rock shows where people are showing up en masse and all the songs are about fighting back and yeah, revolution. And it's like, no, it's not dead. It just moves, you know what I mean? And I feel like right now is a perfect time for people to come together and not destroy things violently, but to come together with thoughts and ideas and and and stand up and come together, you know. Yeah, love it, man. Yeah. Howdy, Krishna, my friend. Hell yeah. So much for doing this with me. Wow. Oh, of course. Where can they find you? Man, you can find me.

And now, the Leather Rose. You are listening to the Leather Rose, an exploration of the mysteries of the universe. Join us now as we unravel the secrets of time. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. How do you like that? That was a listener sent in recording. That was recorded. Let me see here. I was recorded by Jeff Gelding in the Santa Monica State Mountains. Can I give you a little advice, Jeff Gelding, if you happen to be listening to this? When I got into the game, I was smart enough to know not to send a bag of dog shit to the veterinarian and expect to get back roses, OK? That was shit. Honestly, we don't know what that recording could have been anything at all. And thanks for sending it in, Jeff. It was terrible. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to the Leather Rose right now. My name is Delco Scooch. I'm your guest host today here in the Leather Rose. And we're taking listener submissions all day, so keep them coming in strong and hot, good and fast. Today, my guest host, who's also the guest, but he's also simultaneously a host. You heard him pop up there a minute ago. And think his mic was hot. Yeah, but he did. So please welcome Monica Shaw Tower. Thanks for having me, Delco. I love the show. It's a real honor to be on. Now, just I just want to say this real quick. Monica can be a man's name. Yeah, no shit. You don't need to say that. OK. I just wanted to just clarify for the listeners. We know Orange Cube can be a fucking man's name. It's true. Whatever whatever whatever name you want to be. Some of the morning will be a man's name. Lady of the Lake can be a man's name. You don't need to you don't need to condescend your listeners. I don't know if Lady of the Lake could be a man's name. Sure it can. It's technically the word lady is in the name. Well, yeah, but it's not spelled like lady. Well, it's me like L E I G H T D Y. Yeah, exactly. L L E I G H T D Y. Look, I don't want to get into some semantic argument here, Delco. It's just any essentially it doesn't matter. You could call yourself fucking tripod. Tripod would be actually a pretty good name. Because especially if someone had maybe like a very large penis, you call him tripod. It's a cool name for a man. It's a cool name for a woman. It's a cool name for a fucking squirrel. OK, Monica. Fuck what you got it. All right, everybody. Sick of people fucking getting on me about my name. I love my name. I think it's a great name. I just don't change my name to Monica from Darrell. So you changed it from Darrell to Monica. Yeah. What was wrong with Darrell? Spirit of the Forest told me my name was Monica. What was wrong with Darrell? I don't know. I didn't even ask. It was Spirit of the Forest. What are you going to do? Interrogate the source of life on Earth? I said my name's Monica. I went home, came to the DMV, changed my fucking name to Monica. OK, Monica. You're on the leather rose and we have Monica here. We're talking about audible sounds that have been recorded in state forest across the world. Not state forest, but forest everywhere. We started off that listener submission. We're talking about sounds. Terrible. Now, you have an idea where these sounds are coming from. You're saying that these are crevices in the ground. They're opening up. And you say this is a giant mouth of the planet? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, you read my book, Mouth of the Planet, and this will all be completely clear as a bell. These cracks have been opening up. Crevices have been opening up. National forest and non-international forest. Non-national forest is really just a goddamn forest, you know. Right. No need to call it national. See, it's laying claim to a thing that was there long before your monkey ass came stumbling into the wherever and said that's a national forest. That's just a forest. No more national forest and you're a national piece of shit for claiming something that belongs to the totality of all things. I don't want to get into semantics. Hate semantics. I mean, I think you just did get into semantics. Let's get into semantics. The cracks are opening up. As prophesied by the seven prophets of Jeze, these cracks are opening up. And they're opening up in forests all over. All over the planet. And to call them national forest or whatever doesn't, doesn't make a difference. You're out there at night and I do not nude, not climbing in the forest. Find a nice rock face and then do nude free climbing under the full moon. It's my favorite thing to feel the dissipated heat of a stone. So you're talking about against my body like a lizard. I absorbed that last daylight heat and just hang there with a full moon at my back. And that's when the cracks will generally open up for me. And that's when the sounds will come out. Your first listener, whatever that thing he played, was clearly not coming from one of these night cracks or crevice. So let me just slow it down here a bit. We just downloaded a lot of information out there. So we're talking about the seven prophets of Jeze. Jeze. Jeze. That's Je. That's triple Z. Yep, triple Z. Okay. The seven prophets of Jeze. Now, many people have claimed that you have claimed to be the eighth prophet of Jeze. No, I did not claim to be the eighth prophet of Jeze. At least people are claiming that you've claimed it. I went to an ayahuasca ceremony at the Gary Ladin ayahuasca ceremonial center in Detroit. Okay. Is that the same as the Gary Sinise Foundation? No, very different. Though I do respect that foundation. I have donated quite a bit of money to that foundation. I've done a lot of volunteer work for Mr. Sinise. Me too. Very different though. Gary Ladin is a wonderful safe zone to take ayahuasca in Detroit. It's underneath the roller skating rink. Repurpose for spiritual ceremonies. That sounds wonderful. Regardless, I went there. That's when I was given the name Monica by the spirit of the forest. And it was insinuated that I was the eighth prophet because each of these prophets' names have Onica in them. So there was Sonica, Donica, Lonica. Tronica? Tronica. Spamonica? I've seen Spamonica all over the place. It was Har. Harmonica. Oh, that's what the... See, this is all kind of tying together a thread that we've had loose dangling around here for quite some time. That is, the name Harmonica is an ancient name. And it comes from the fissures of the mouths of the world, a gape, and screaming in harmony. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, well, you know, if you break it down in the language of Jeze, Har, it means sound of God. Okay. And Monica means from the crack. Now, a lot of people have said that this is what the shape of a taco was based on, actually. Absolutely. And that's why people like tacos so much is they're technically involving themselves in an ancient ritual of communicating. Harmonica and a taco are not that different when it comes down to it. That's correct. I mean, you trace the history of the taco. You follow it down. You've taught it down through North America and down into North American and the lower Brazilian Peninsula and into the lower regions on the Swamplands down there is where a lot of these full anthropologists are getting their funding from big tech, which they're then using to manipulate the masses into believing that foods come from places they just don't come from. We're talking recipes written in the stars not coming from the earth. You think a taco came from the mind of humans, but that's just what these transhumanists want us to believe. It's a bottom line, basic deep dish program. And you think you think these things come from a mind? You think somebody just thought up a taco human being? No, those are written in the stars. And that came from the people of Jeze, which are not terrestrial bound beings. And that's number one came from the crack. And that is what Monica means from the crack. And when I was given that name, Monica, it was not just that I was the eighth prophet of Jeze. As I was insinuated, I was the final prophet because there was nothing preceding the name. There was no Gil, Monica, Tach, Monica. It was just Monica. Tole, Monica, Bill, Monica, Brad, Monica. I'm from the crack. That would be the translation of my name from the crack. So people who are claiming that you claim to be the eighth prophet of Jeze are actually saying they're getting it wrong. What you are, you are the seventh prophet of Jeze. And you have claimed that. And you just did it. You just did it. He did claim that right now. I did only claimed it. I'm just going to be it. And I'm going to diddly be proud of it. And I carry the burden of it because there are no more people of Jeze. We're talking about one of the most prolific, powerful, scattered subspecies of humanity scattered throughout the entire planet. Gone in a day. Riding's eliminated. They used to have, you could go. They couldn't go anywhere without seeing one of the Jeze scriptures etched on a post or a tree. Gone in a day. You don't remember when you were, I don't know how old you are. You look young as hell. But for me, when I was a kid, it was just, you couldn't look at a J bird's ass without seeing some message from the people at Jeze. And then in a day, they're gone. We'd be digging an ant mound to my friend Billy. We'd get our, we had a special stick we'd use. It's called our ant, ant digging stick. And it had a real curved tip, a long curved tip, almost like a hockey stick that had been bent by moonlight. And we called our ant digging stick and we'd just go around and find the biggest mountain and swish it around on there. And we'd, we'd see ants and we put our ear to the ground and the ants, they wouldn't attack us or nothing. They would just start screaming about Jeze, Jeze, Jeze, Jeze. That was when the ants talked.

That was when the ants talked. Now again, we go back, you know, and when the day came, as it was predicted, there would happen the vanishing day. Before that, you got talking ants. You're in your kid. We didn't have this thing. You know, my my cousin had a beautiful child. Wonderful kid, Orney. Now they decided to have another because they're worried. Orney was going to need company. Wait, is it Orney or Horney or Orney? Come on. I don't know. Are you some Hollywood elite? I've got to ask. What are you doing over here? I'm in St. Louis right now. I don't even like that kind of humor. You're not going to be a child's horny. You're not going to do that. It's a question. It's a question. I know, but I know what you're doing. Don't do that. You know how someone sucked up into the pockets of the liberal elite. I'm not. Some words. I don't want to get into it. Let's just not do that kind of humor. I love your show. I love it a lot. And I've never I listened to it because the family is family friendly. Okay. Orney. My cousin. Orney. Not beautiful name. My cousin Orney. It's a wonderful name. Beautiful. Boy or girl. Boy or girl. What difference does it make? Well, what are you? Listeners are going to ask me. What are you asking with the census department over here? I'm going to get, I'm going to get roasted. All right. Now Orney, now they say, he's called me up. He said, we're going to try for another because we want Orney to have company. And I said to him, well, that's a new thing because when I was a kid, you didn't need company. You could go down to your nearest ant mound and you could have a conversation with a whole bunch of ants about anything you wanted to talk about. And then the vanishing came, the ants stopped talking. That's when the birds started flying. They're all ground based. You used to, if you wanted a bird, you could just snatch one up. People don't remember that. They all went up in the air. Day of vanishing. People don't remember that. The birds used to be a terrestrial creature for as long as I can remember. When I was coming up, we'd say, stay low like a bird and you'll find what you need. Stay low like a bird. Low like a bird. If you're hungry, you could just reach down as ground popcorn, what we used to call it. Yeah, ground popcorn. You have to go to the grocery store, this thing, go grocery store to get bird meat. You just reach down and pluck up a bird. They're all over your feet. Throw it on the grill right there. Feathers would fall right off. That was the, those were the good old days. When they say good old days, that's what they mean. And if a wind was blowing, my mama would say, just get lower than a bird turd. And we would duck down and hunker because we, you know, we all, I mean, that's the great division is when birds and turtles started to be separate things. Yep. It used to be the same damn thing. You get the, that was the, that was a good, I mean, they base the dark crystal off this, but not spoiler alert. I mean, I guess it's a dark crystal in reverse because the dark crystal, they kind of join up at the end and they're split in the beginning of this. They were joined together. You get these terrestrial, you know, tortoise like land birds. And then this split happens. Now you got snapping turtles in the lakes. You can't go for a, you can't swim six feet without getting a snapping turtle on your, on your, on your ass. Just snap down. So we get the splitting. You get the splitting. You got the birds split from the tortoise. You know, in those days, that's when you get the, the, the, the, the, the dolphin breaks into the, you know, this new thing we call it often. That's not a dolphin. They used to be combined with the shark and the seal. And they were brilliant, funny creatures, funny creatures. I would spend days at the beach with my mamma. We would just laugh in and laugh and laugh at the jokes that they would tell. They would do these special fart jokes where they'd make a cloud that was wrapped in a sinuous material and they would shoot it like a beach ball, like a fart. It's like a beach ball. Just poof. Now you've got these comedians, you know, they're trying to do the thing that used to just be a natural thing from the sea. That's why you went to the beach, by the way. Back then you didn't go to the beach because you want this thing or beer going out in filthy water and stuff. No. You went to the beach for a show and they would just come out and they'd do their fart jokes. It was family friendly fun. Now you're lucky if you laugh once when you go to the beach. More likely you're going to see somebody ripped apart by one of those sharks. They're pissed off. It got split off from its mother species. It's become a serious place. It's funny. Now it's some angry mouse under there just biting anything it can. This episode of the DTFH was brought to you by the Wizards of Boners over at Blue Chew. Blue Chew.

Now you said that vanishing was predicted. The vanishing has been predicted. I mean, this thing is written all over the, I mean, this is like, not only is it written about in the Bible, the suppressed Bible, by the way, you're not going to see a real Bible about whatever they're calling the Bible. Now this is a, this is a, he might as well read the shit stains of the pope smeared out on mummy wrappings. Cause that's what you got there. I'm talking about the real Bible. There was a before the vanishing. When you, you open up a Bible, your eyes would turn blue, vivid, beautiful sky blue from the potency, chronic energy is what we call it. Then the vanishing happens. And then you get this thing that I don't even know what it is. Sheruli. Gideon Bible. They put in the hotel rooms. Oh, the Gideon. So that's, that's, yeah. Wipe. Yes. So come wiping thing there. I should use that to wipe your calm after you beat off to that erotica they show for adult entertainment at the hotels. That's all it's good. This is a family show. Let's just keep it. I know. I'm sorry. Got a little off track. That's a little, that's a little blue. Yeah. You're working blue. Still this day. Cause it's reference to the ocean. Yeah. That's right. The original source of comedy on the planet is the ocean creatures. So funny. The original dolphins. Those are just the dolphins. I mean, that's when you have mermaids out there. By the way, speaking of blue, there's. Speaking of blue. I've seen some good breasts in my life, but nothing better. Mermaids breasts are just so good. That's what, yeah. Yep. That's right. I mean that literally in those days, you'd have to have your kids. You'd have to point and say, look, look up. Look behind. Just if a mermaid showed up and they're beautiful, beautiful velvety tits. Beautiful. I mean, I came to the point where I just couldn't ignore them. It's one of those things where you have to just look at it like a work of art. That's right. Just his beautiful mermaid breasts. They're just so perfect and so, so velvety is a good word to describe it. Velvety creamy. Sculpted by Poseidon himself. It's almost like a wave had stopped mid motion and formed into a pair of breasts. Oh, oh my God. I can tell you some bachelor stories. Ooh, some bachelor party ocean stories. Let me tell you, I could tell you some stories that would not be good. Why don't you tell one? Tell one. Well, all right. Go ahead and slip into one. Why don't you? I'm going to tell one in the condition that any children listening and have your parents hold you a year. Let me just say let me give a warning out. Hey, children, listen right now. How you doing? It's me. It's a Delco here. Leather Rose host. If you're listening right now, we didn't get to have Mamaw, that Papaw, that Grandma, that Mimi, that Dodo that you got laying around. Maybe even find the dogs big floppy ears. You got a big floppy cock or spangly around there. Just stuff that fur in your ear now, sweetheart baby. Cover your ear. It doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl. It doesn't matter if you're a girl with a boy's name or vice versa. Well, there isn't such a thing. Let me just finish. Let me. It doesn't matter if you got a name. It's almost exclusively used for women and you're a boy. It's totally fine. You're still growing up. You can be anything you want to be. It doesn't matter if you're a vice versa. Name's a name. You can change your name if you want, but you don't have to because, you know, you don't want to go against with what the spirit of the force instructs you to change your name to Monica. I challenge you to deny the force or quat. Go ahead and stuff those ears close good and tight like a broom in a broom closet. Cause we're about to, and dad, dad, if you're here, maybe tell the wife to just go inside the kitchen and see and count the, count the number of eggs you've got in there. Count the carrots. Count the carrots. Count the carrots. Count the hairs on the carrots kind of twice. Cause Monica here is about to regale us. Monica shot. I was about to tell us a little bit of what we call bachelor tale. Let's just say turn the radio down low and get close up to it cause. All right. All right. Let her rip. Why don't you let her rip? No, this is one of my dearest friends. God rest his soul. He is gone now. One of the many who were vanished in the land. But he was a wonderful friend of mine. Blitz. Translate. This man was in top weight lifter, just so you know, at our college and his body was unlike anything I've seen. Now you, these days you've got everybody all gooseed up on funny pills, greasing themselves down with steroid testosterone creams that they're God knows where they're even coming from. From what I hear, they're extracted from elephant balls and Indonesian elephant balls, drip and natural mucus. When they put that in capsules, send out the United States and these want to be weight lifters. They just slurp them down like they're eating tic-tacs. It's not safe. It's just not safe. Don't eat them. It's not good for you. God only knows what it's going to do to you. You already know it's shrinking your brain down to the size of a walnut. Most of these weight lifters, when they go in for their autopsies after they die, their brains have been shriveled up. Now I'm not going to get off track here, but let me tell you something, Blitz was beautiful. He was like a walking sculpted mountain. He was powerful and strong and his voice was deep and resonant like the bellowing horn blown by some Nordic shepherd in times long gone. How wide was he? Oh God, he must have been seven feet wide. I'm not seven or eight feet wide. His body, you looked at that body, it was like a walking rippling abdominal wall and some paradise garden that Samuel Taylor Coleridge might have written about, one of his epic poems. I bet you could shoot him with an arrow and it wouldn't go all the way in. I'll tell you, it'd be a lucky arrow and anything wanted to get close to Blitz's heart and that was the problem because there's only one heart in that man and that man had a deep and a Biden love for Susan Sancy. Now she was a biology student and her ass was rock hard. You could cut a diamond with that ass and I would have paid, I would have cut my feet off just to get one taste of insider crack, but you know, he was monogamous and everything. So I stayed away though. I was would have loved to just lay, you know, lay underneath them and just while he was hammering her and just lap against his cock and her tank. Okay. So we ended up, he did the thing, he asked her to marry him and I gotta tell you, he offered her a diamond ring that was, is like looking at something somebody must have harvested off of a magical moon beam. It was the stars were dancing in that thing as love was in there and he, he offered it to her, not just on one hot air balloon, three hot air balloons tied together and connected by planks and he walked her from one to the next because he had the grace of a circus acrobat and he had a love of the sky. So wide, but so graceful at such a rare combination to be so wide, to be so strong, but also to be graceful like a, like a little ballerina almost like a, I can just envision it now. It's like watching one of those tiny, tiny deer prance around with the hooves that are the size of a pinpoint that prances up a mountain. Oh yeah. That's a beautiful description of him. And on that day that he asked her to marry him, he was wearing tap shoes. Tap shoes. Wow. And the way he asked her to marry him was he got on one of those a two by four connected to two hot air balloons and he tapped down, tapped dance there and he reached down and underneath one of his pectoral muscles, he had, he had pushed that ring and he pulled it out and he said, will you be my wife forever? And she's cried. She cried so much that it rained and where those hot air balloons were floating over there been a drought. And she cried so much it rained on this farmer's field and that farmer was about to go bankrupt. And as he tells a story, he had actually gone into his barn and put a shotgun barrel into his open mouth and was about to squeeze the trigger and blow his brains out because he's going to lose his farm and it starts raining. It starts raining, I guess because these were human tears coming from love. They caused his crops to grow 10, 10 times as fast and 10 times more. And so he suddenly had a flourishing corn crop. And he made enough money to pay back the bankers, God save them. And he made enough money to get his farm back. Now I'm getting a little bit off track. I think yeah. Well, we want to talk about the bachelor party and the mermaid breath. Invites us to this bachelor party. Now this was in Santa Barbara. Oh, no, I'd never been to California. In fact, I avoided at all costs, but if Blitz told you to go somewhere, you would go. You would not say no to Blitz anymore than you would say no to the resounding sound of an angel calling you from the clouds. If an angel tells you to jump, you jump. If an angel tells you to do push ups, you do push ups. If Blitz tells you come to Santa Barbara for my bachelor party, we're going to the beach. You know what he means. You know what he means. I think he means, I think I know what he means. He means color me a whistle and I'm ready to run. Color me a whistle and I'm ready to run. And that's what we did. He went on the beach and it was the best bachelor party I've ever been to. It started off with just beach exercises. One of the great things that Blitz would do is he laid exercises and he had us doing these wonderful calf exercises that when the burn was so intense, it was a lower body workout. And it was, we were crying as we, as we worked our glutes out because we knew this is going to be the last, more probably one of the last times that Blitz led one of these incredible like, it's okay now. He was just such a friend. Monica. He was so beautiful. We don't have so beautiful watching him. Oh my God, just this wall of love. So he leads exercise and then he claps his hands and he had French moms had been hitting under the sand. They come up out of the sand and they're all holding champagne bottles and Chris with crystal glasses and they pour us all champagne and we're drinking champagne and you know what's next cause a smell of champagne calls the mermaids. Oh, it does. It does. And it's not just the smell of champagne. Let's face it, it's Blitz and those mermaids have been under there watching him lead this exercise routine and they've just, they're just ready to go. They're gassed up and they're gassed up. And you've never seen, I've never seen that many mermaids in my life. They come, you've got mermaids here, mermaids there. I guess it was the whole ocean was just filled with these voluptuous mermaids. They come up out of the sea pulling themselves, flopping those beautiful tails, pulling themselves in the sand. They're beautiful voluptuous breasts covered in sand like a dusted cookie at a picnic in heaven and we clean their breasts off cause they didn't want their nipples to get irritated and we spent the next three hours at the breast of these mermaids drinking the nectar of the sea and it was the most delightful. Yeah, I'll never see him again. We lost so much in the vanishing after it's, can we take a break? We can take a break. We're talking with Monica shy tower and we're talking about smoking from Poseidon's pipe here. When you do stuff, sometimes there's a problem and we've all experienced a different line of issues that sometimes will be a thing. Well, that's the story of the bachelor party. Well that's really incredible. I can just tell your friends you love them and make sure that you insulate yourself against magic that you don't understand because sometimes you know, you get that boomerang, it just whips around. People out there are throwing boomerangs and thinking they're not going to come back. But they're going to come back. It's the nature of the boomerang to come back.

Can you just before we before we close out here, could you talk just a little bit more about these these fissures and absolutely just a bit because we're talking we started here talking off about these sounds are coming out in the ground. Right. Now I'm afraid I got in the way. I know a lot of your listeners are probably excited to hear you play some of their sounds. They're recorded out here in the forest. Now the phenomena, you know, I was the first one to authentically document it. Now that's because I had made my way into the Bohemian Grove. Now the Bohemian Grove is known for many things. The hour rituals and all that's not really what's going on there. That's just party tricks by silly clown. What really with a hidden secret of the Bohemian Grove is they have a wonderful massive slate stone rock that rises up from the forest and this thing absorbs heat so much that a very rare lizard you can be found there that just they just cling to these rocks and absorb this heat and that lizard if you're if you're stuck if you're I used to be a long term vaping addict and these things one lick of one of these lizards and your addictive problems are gone. You're not going to go to the Bohemian Grove, go to that slate rock and take a lick on those lizards. This is why all of the world leaders go there. It's not because they're planning something or they're up to no good. It's because they're all addicted. All the world leaders are deeply and horribly addicted to a variety of substances. Mainly believe it or not. Nutri-Sweet. They just love it. Like that's a very bad thing. I've heard about that. I've heard about it. Messes with your hormones, man. Yeah. But Nutri-Sweet is delicious. I'm going to deny it. Everyone knows that. I love it. I used to pour the shit on my tongue. You can't resist. Wake up in the morning and just have your Nutri-Sweet stone or your bowl of Nutri-Sweet. Stick your tongue down there. Anyway, you go to this slate stone and you take your clothes off in front of it and you just climb up this thing and it's one of the most transcendent experiences. This will work with any rock in the National Forest. It's called Nude Night Time Free Climbing on Post-Summer Stones. Post-Summer. Post-Summer Stones. Post-Summer. Post-Summer Day Stones or Post-Summer Stones or just PSS. PSS. Post-Summer Stones. Yeah. The stones have been heated in the summer day and have been cooled down under the light of a full moon. You get your body against that, absorb that last bit of heat from the stone. You got to get the last bit so that when you're done, that stone's cold. You can't leave any of it. You want the last bit of that summer heat. To bring that into your body, you will hit a mesmer resonance, as it's called, a mesmer resonance field. The exact same resonant tone you get when you measure volcanoes or save a suvious was resonating at this tone right before it blasts those Italians straight to hell. You get this resonance going there and your body is resonating from that summer heat and that's when the crevices, the cracks will open up and that's when the earth will sing to you and you will hear the mysteries that are sung by the spirit of the earth, the one that gave me the name, Monica. That's a beautiful tale, Monica. Could you leave us with possibly a, just a taste of what that viscous vibration sound, so people, because obviously when the crack opens up and you hear that sound, that's unmistakable. But I think a lot of people might not know if they're doing it right because they don't know what that sound sounds like. Are you asking me to emanate? I'm asking you to imitate, to in-emitate Ace. I don't imitate. I emanate. Now, there's a lot of people out there who will imitate, but I, I emanate. Could you emanate that sound that we would hear that? You're not going to hear me imitate. You want, you want something, you want to hear somebody imitate. I want to hear you emanate. You go down to your local rodeo and find some, some brain, brain-addled rodeo clown who's been tap-danced on by one too many a steer and that, that you'll get an imitation of something. You'll get an imitation of the sound of old waffles flopping out of a pan against those. Oh, that sounds terrible. I want to, nobody wants an old waffle. I'm, I'm going to go ahead and emanate for us. Now I'm going to give you a warning out there. If you don't want your life to change, if you're not interested in upticking or upshifting, if not, if you want to stay down in your little cauldron to despair, if you want to keep your boat safely docked in the harbor of sorrows, while you find yourself eating a never ending shit bowl of mediocrity, then if you're interested in keeping yourself in the lower levels of hell as a hungry ghost with a long pencil neck and an infinite appetite, I would recommend that you don't listen to this because he's going to blast you right back into heaven. Kids take your, take the copper spangles out of your ears now and get a listen to this because you want to grow up fast. This is how you do it. You won't grow. This is going to grow you up. You're going to, you better get your pencil out and get ready to head over to the sizing wall because you're going to notice a shift today. And parents, if you don't want to go out and have to buy your kids new clothes, then I would recommend turning this off because you're going to go up a few sides. Oh yeah. You're going to go up a few sides. If you're interested in playing basketball, turn it up loud because you're going to be slam dunking. Okay. If you're interested in being able to safely jump on your trampoline, if you're up at that edge where you might be a little heavier and you're afraid you're going to go through, don't listen because this might be the thing that pushes you through that. If you're interested in being able to dig just a significant hole really quickly, then I will listen. If you want to, if you want to have the strength to just dig a hole quickly, to quickly dig a large hole, maybe for a job or maybe just for fun, either way, if you wanted to be able to do that, I would say listen up good. If you wanted to be able to, if you want to be, if you're, if you're having problems with like shelving issues and you can't get up there like the higher shelves, maybe you're somebody's hiding your cookies up there, you can't reach, you know, the steps to listen. They're going to have to find a new place to hide those cookies and there better not be digging them in the ground because you're going to be able to dig down there too. If you bought some shoes that are just slightly too big, but they're just too nice to return and you don't know somebody with that size, listen good because you're going to fill up those shoes just perfect right. Your toes are just going to come within a half and a quarter inch to the eighth inch to the tip. It's going to feel really good. I would say listen up if that's on your list of solutions to problemize. If you got like short sausage flap arms and you can't reach back when you get a scratch on your back, you listen because you're going to be able to, those arms are going to un, you're going to move on out and stretch on down and your fingers will extend too. That's good news and bad news. Again, if you're like someone who's got a glove collection for example, I mean, I'll tell you, this is something that actually did happen. It was really quite sad. Somebody came and we gave them this warning and believe us, I guess, or whatever, you know, hubris, but they came to one of my Monica from the crack retreats that happen every three months in Hawaii and I said, I said the whole thing here. Now as it turns out, they had a, one of the most highly rated glove collections in North America and all them size to their hand. After this, they couldn't put on a single single one, not a single one. That collection was more than just something to look out for them. They like to wake up as many of us do and put on their morning gloves and have their coffee. Nope. Couldn't do it. Well, I mean, that's all they say. You fill, you fill out a glove, you open the door. You know what? I'm wearing gloves right now. I'm wearing gloves right now. Mayor skin. Mayor, oh, that's a, that's a horror skin. Yeah, I've heard about, you know, this is all just great stuff. I've heard of the situations where people were unable to use the stairs and the next thing you know, they're going 30 miles an hour upstairs. I've heard of dogs that if funny enough, it'll slow down a dog. If you've got a dog that's moving too fast to pet, if you've got a dog that's just like, you can't seem to get a handle on it. It's got that soft fur, but it's just moving too fast. You have a dog listen to this and it's going to slow it down so you can pet that dog. So I would. Oh, this is all, yeah, this is like when, when, if you've got, and I'll tell you, man, this is the thing that it makes, you know, this is one of the most, to me, one of them, it's a, it tells us of the times. One of the most sad things right now is you got all these kids, their parents, they gave them puppies companions. They gave them these fast dogs and all they want to do is pet that dog. And all that dog wants is to feel the soft hand of that toddler rubbing against their fur, but the dog's excitable and the toddler compared to the speed of that dog is slow. And it's just your, it's like a Greek tragedy. William Shakespeare himself couldn't come up with some more sad, more sad than a fast dog and a slow child. And to watch those two things interact, it's watching matter and antimatter engaged in the infinite dance of sorrow that makes up our universe. Never the twain shall meet. Never the twain shall meet. This will slow down your dog. Monica. Now, if your dog's already slow, have him leave the room. You don't want, you know. Oh, it'll slow down to a, to a statue. Now that, then that will happen. I've crystallized many a dog from this ceremony. Now I'm going to begin. That was beautiful. My goodness. Gosh. Outstanding. What a beautiful sound. I hope all the listeners got everything they needed and the one out of that. And there's no negative effects. Beautiful, Monica. Well, I just want to thank you. Delco for having me on. It has been an honor and a pleasure. I think I was a little salty in the beginning. I want to apologize to y'all. It's okay. You now woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

So if you want to cut straight to the interview with the brilliant Aaron McGathey, just jump to 48 minutes. You'll go past all the commercials and go right into the interview. Good morning, my friends. It's me, Duncan Trussell. You're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. It is 8804 AM here in Los Angeles. I managed to wake up this morning at 6 AM, and I have pride over that, which shows the things that I've gotten a little, I've got the things are off track for me because if you're proud about getting up early in the morning, it's a good sign that you're being kind of lazy because the best thing to do is to get up early in the morning. Waking up early in the morning is one of the greatest ways to reset yourself. There's a lot of ways to reset yourself. Like running five miles is a way of pressing reset on your, on your body. Waking up really early in the morning and dragging yourself out of bed and standing underneath the beautiful morning sky and looking around at how beautiful the morning is to remind yourself that for so many months or years, depending on who you are and what you do, you've been missing one of the most glorious times of the day, which is the morning. Morning is the best time of the day. You know, you're not going to run into in the morning Kesha. That's why it's good. That alone is a reason the morning is a beautiful time to be out there. And yes, God damn it, I am going to talk shit about Kesha. I don't like her. I just listened to this awful song, this new cat. I don't know if it's a new Kesha song, but I had the terrible misfortune of stumbling upon this Kesha song where she's like dancing around. There's pentagrams and she's telling teenagers I should die. Basically it's a million times creepier than Black Sabbath because like Black Sabbath or any of the old death metal or heavy metal bands that you had to play, you had to play them backwards to hear kill yourself. Kesha just comes out and it says, yeah, just get choked to death on sperm teens. I don't like it. It's weird. I feel bad. Seems like she's, I mean, I know I'm going to sound like an old man here, but it really does feel like she's luring teens into like texting and driving. That's, that's, that's what it ends up translating. Like for Kesha, her noble idea of prancing around at night through nightclubs, giving hand jobs to bouncers and snorting enough cocaine to kill a fucking sperm whale, which essentially is what she is, is not what translates to a kid. For a kid, living it up probably just means driving their mom's Hyundai down the wrong side of the freeway while texting about how they're living life and obliterating some minivan filled with a family on their way to, I don't know, Disneyland at night. That's weird. I don't, anyway, the point is the morning is the opposite of Kesha. I wish more singers would embody the morning more than Kesha's version of the slimy, stinky, glittery, gross night where like people have sprayed on that awful stinking body spray all over their body and are just sort of like, I don't like going out at night to the, to, to like, to where people are really like have quote, having a good time. They're not having a good time. At least it doesn't feel like that to me. Anytime that I've been, you know, I just went through a spate of going out more times than I have in years. I won't go into details about it, but I ended up going out to, you know, I had to go out to clubs at night more times than I would have liked and it was, every time it was just this jarring, shocking experience and it always felt like I was having to like pretend that this wasn't just walking into one of those, when you see a nature video of a hole in the ground and they show the baby snakes squirming all over each other, that's just what that's what it feels like at these clubs. Like, I don't, when I was, when I, listen kids, when I was growing up, we didn't go, we wouldn't go drinking at clubs. I mean, sure, maybe you'd go somewhere and have a few beers, but if you were really going for it, you'd go to like some warehouse where people were dropping liquid acid into your mouth and using body paint to paint each other, torch, people swinging torches around and stuff. You didn't go to some bar and have a couple of martinis and bowl with people dressed up like they're from the 40s and then act like you're having fun, even though you can just feel the effects of the booze sinking in and you're just surrounded by people growing increasingly desperate because they're not going to have somebody to finger that night. That's not what we did. What we did is we went to places where it felt like there was a possibility that the universe was going to split open and aliens were going to drag us into some alternate dimension where we're going to merge again with the Godhead. You know, Sufi's dressed in robes, hanging out, people dancing in bizarre, intense patterns that seem to indicate that they had merged together to form some kind of universal, kaleidoscopic flesh being not fucking goddamn waiting for the valet while you're having to breathe some asshole cigar smoke and listen to people with alcohol poisoning yammer about how they have a great access to cocaine, gross fucking cashews, the Pied Piper pigs. Anyway, I sound like an old man. That's not the point of all this. What was I talking about? Here's the point. I've become addicted to this show called The Walking Dead and I'm sure you guys have heard of it. I actually watched all the various seasons of this show on and off. I sort of like tuned out halfway through last season just because I got bummed out by the small... Anyway, I don't want to spoil the show for you, but I usually download stuff to watch because I don't like watching commercials and I don't like watching cable TV. Watching cable TV is really creepy to me, but I do like it because it's creepy, but then I don't like it because it's creepy because cable TV, if Satan is the father of lies, then TV would be Satan's hypnotic cock just shoving its way into the brains of all those watching television and that's fun if you can see it that way. But if you don't see it that way, then I think it's a bit of a dangerous thing because you can end up sort of not even realizing that you're getting conditioned or programmed or dare I say brainwashed by one of the most incredibly hypnotic devices that has ever existed on this planet. I mean, it is hypnotic and that's what's happening when you're watching TV. It's inducing hypnosis and there's all these different phases like just watch yourself go into a state of mindfulness the next time you sit down to watch TV like really just sit down and watch the way your body feels as you begin to relax and your third eye opens up and you begin to absorb the information that's being slung at you by the television. Most of us when we're watching TV at night, we're also like using neurological lubricants to try to really like moisten ourselves up and get ready for penetration by the major corporations of the planet. So we're drinking or smoking weed. I don't know what you guys do. Maybe you're snorting ketamine or heroin but I doubt it but maybe whatever you're doing usually the ritual of watching TV for many many people also involves some kind of intoxicant and so you get nice and loosened up and you turn on the TV and you watch it and so there's these two phases these two things that are happening on every network TV show which is the induction phase of the hypnosis which is the story that you're watching you know it's the it's the actors it's the show itself that that induces the initial stage is very hypnotic because they call them actors but really what they are is hypnotists a good actor is a great hypnotist in the sense that they are so interesting to watch because they're all very symmetrical and they're all very they just have this like interesting quality to them that's what that's what makes a great actor they say you look good on camera you know they have a lot of names for it he's got it and what that it is is the ability to draw attention they're like these little attention magnets these little gravity fields that suck human attention into them that's what they do and it's awesome it's really cool to watch but that's why it when when you watch acting especially like on The Walking Dead and you look at the way the characters are acting you'll notice that the way they're acting is not the way humans act at all their movements are more pronounced their movements are hypnotic because that's what they're doing they're hypnotizing you so that you can get absorbed completely into the show and this is why people get really upset and mad and when there's a shitty actor on a show you know and what people will say is god man that guy brings me out of it and what he means is he brings me out of the hypnotic state that all these other great hypnotists have placed me into and that's an uncomfortable feeling you don't like that feeling you want to be drawn completely into the show until you experience at the very height a kind of ego transference where you're no longer even existing in your bedroom or living room but now you have completely merged with the show itself you are practically one of the characters and that is when you really begin to experience the kind of like the high of television which is this sort of you experience the loss that the characters experience and you experience the triumphs that the characters experience and now that's what makes good tv and good movies so insanely addictive but for this to happen for you to really merge with these characters it requires a fairly profound state of hypnosis so that's what's happening tv is hypnotizing you that's the first phase the second phase of this hypnotic induction is that in between the show you get these products shown to you you get all these weird products that they want to sell so now listen what if you're a salesman and you and you want to sell your stuff who would you rather sell yourself to would you rather sell your stuff to somebody who you had to go door to door and talk to them uh or would you rather sell your stuff to somebody who has already been hypnotized by a master hypnotist clearly the latter but the you know the former happens too and that's why a good salesman is also a good hypnotist because a good salesman will come in will meet you will size you up will analyze your weaknesses and your strengths and your insecurities and will begin to actually mimic and mirror the way that you are it's called mirroring they'll start moving the way that you move so that you begin to sort of experience that same kind of merging with the salesperson where the differences between you two are uh seemingly obliterated and then you're just this guy you know i you know what this guy really just seems like me i guess i will trust him so it's like it's the same idea but uh tv is a much more advanced way of selling stuff because they lure the human attention into this trap using this uh using uh shows and then once the human attention has been sucked in it it wants to stay there and once it's there and nice and big and dilated and open and gaping and lubricated and oozing then the corporations come and they shove their uh materialistic cocks deep inside of our consciousness and fill our brains with all these weird uh seeds which may or may not grow in fact the odds are that whatever the product is that they're selling on a tv show you're not going to want and uh the odds are more likely that you're not going to want it because the corporations know that they only need you know five percent of people watching to be interested in the product that's enough especially with something like The Walking Dead or a very popular show The Walking Dead gets 16 million viewers 16 million think about that 16 million people watch The Walking Dead now that might be a tough thing to really picture to visualize so I have done some math because I started thinking about this and I started thinking like well what would 16 million brains look like especially because it's a show about zombies so I google searched I did some research here the average human brain weighs three pounds so if we have 16 million people watching The Walking Dead and they all have an average size brain then you get 48 million pounds of brains which are being hypnotized by The Walking Dead now that comes out to 24,000 tons thank you Wolframalpha.com check it out it's a very amazing website 24,000 tons now that is to to visualize how if you if if you like hamburger meat is that a that's not a word at all but if you shoved all those brains together like you're making a hamburger that would be a brain that was half the size of the titanic that's a 24,000 ton brain 6,000 elephants that's a 6,000 elephants worth of brains or approximately nine olympic-sized swimming pools filled with brains being jizzed on by the walking dead and the commercials they put in between it so that's a lot of brains man that's 2.78 acres of brains like if you if you could stretch all if you spread all these brains out in olympic size swimming pools then you would you would have acres of brains like when you see the solar panel arrays that they have out in the desert it would be like that like you could fly over it with a helicopter and look down and just see this huge swath of brains only instead of like processing solar energy the brains are processing the energy that's being shot out of these weird hypnotic rectangles that we all have in our houses and another way to look at it is imagine the if you imagine a brain half the size of the titanic and then imagine that that brain was inside a giant pig think how big that pig would be that would be a huge fucking pig and that's essentially what's happening you see these corporations and and and the networks and and the government recognizes that the population of america is which is 319 million people or 957 million pounds of brains could be divided up into like kind of like a herd of pigs and uh with giant giant brains and so the idea is you've got to hypnotize these giant pigs for a lot of different reasons uh one reason you want to hypnotize these pigs is because if you hypnotize them in the right way it will cause their nipples to secrete uh this special energy which which is we call money so the walking dead gets this pig this giant pig which is all the people watching it uh to secrete out of all the various nipples on its body and these nipples represent all the different demographics so when you're watching when you're watching a whatever an advertisement for dr shoal's foot sponge or whatever it is and you're like i don't know never put that in my fucking shoe my feet feel great well that that's because that it's not that beam is not being directed at your particular nipple that that it's on this giant pig of which you're one tiny little pixel but then when you watch something else who knows maybe it's a commercial for the beautiful new ipad my god the glorious glowing sweet thin super perfect ipad and you're watching that you might kind of be like man you know what i wish i could afford one of those that'd be really cool that means that your nipple is starting to glisten the part of the nipple that you are on the giant hell pig that's being conditioned and controlled by these mass corporations has started getting a little wet like they're starting to get you into the idea of owning an ipad which is why they don't just show the product in these commercials they don't do that they actually they actually um show the product being surrounded by a specific lifestyle that's what that's what they show so when you're watching you all you'll see like my god look at these well dressed beautiful people and their lives they're so happy they're always so happy in these commercials the only time the actors aren't in a state of deep materialistic ecstasy in these commercials is when it's a depression commercial and even then they're doing great even then it's like they're going to be wandering around some beautiful parks surrounded by happy medicated people who are just sort of trying to get them to come to terms with the fact that they need to take some serotonin uptake reinhibitors so they can exist in a society where you can basically only move at right angles and if you um if you uh if you uh right angles in traffic i mean i if you want to walk in circles around your house you can but once you go out in the public it's like you you're moving at right angles friend stop lights and you're just essentially trapped and what could be compared to some kind of massive maze for uh the weird species that we are um and that might make you feel depressed and the answer to that is to take serotonin uptake reinhibitors of course not to not to experiment with psychedelics or to uh meditate you'll never see that on a commercial ever so anyway the point is you these products not only are when you watch uh these commercials are you being sold products you're also being sold an idea of what is normal they're showing you what is normal and it's really powerful like when you watch these things you really can't you fall into the idea like my god yeah i guess that's what girls are supposed to look like i guess that's what women look like and that's what women do and i guess that that's the ideal man is this kind of symmetrical cowboy who's like can't get his dick hard so he's got to take sealis i don't know if you've seen that commercial but his rugged symmetrical man now if you go out in the public and you look around you will see that the human species tends to not be beautiful i think we're beautiful you know i i think there is beauty inside of us not to sound like a fucking hallmark card but you know if you go and look around people are disheveled generally they're maybe they've like combed their hair or something but people in general they're just you know unique creatures with wrinkles that come from the the many hardships to be endured when you get shot out of a vagina into a dimension where everyone's gonna die but when you watch commercial man everybody is so beautiful and symmetrical and they're all wearing really nice clothes and man they've got it together aren't they buttoned up they are so buttoned up like they figured it out i don't know what they did i don't know what classes they took or what lecture series they went to but they have really gotten themselves nice and polished and fixed up their hair is perfect their eyes are sparkling with this glow that usually comes from love between them and their mate you know they'll show like a couple wandering into a car dealership and this couple i mean this is a couple that is this is a couple that hasn't been so balanced and in love since the huckstables this is a couple that is so perfect for each other like they it's an act of god that these two came together we're talking present like this is the same thing you see when like obama uh and michelle are together like my god they see they are so fucking happy this is like pure happiness and they're everything's working out they flip some houses i guess and now they're gonna go get into deep debt uh by getting into a strange bargain with a bank because that's what happens when you're buying a car so it's really weird because these like when you when these when this beautiful couple wanders into a car dealership uh they they they um they um they seem so clever they're always portrayed as like really clever like they know how to pick the right car this couple is not going to pick a car that doesn't have what they need to keep their family safe this couple is going to pick a car that is completely going to supply all that they need for their wonderful offspring so basically the car dealership is the the the evil car dealership which represents all the other dealerships that are selling other cars that are exactly like the car this particular dealership is trying to sell not only is that car dealership trying to rip you off it wants to hurt your fucking family it wants to hurt your family so you're clever these couples are always depicted as clever they're clever enough to buy the right car they're not clever enough to understand that they've been completely manipulated and sucked in by a massive banking cartel they don't realize that and most of us don't realize that because it all seems normal because we've been seeing it so much from the moment we were born you watch a car commercial and we get used to that weird thing that pops up at the bottom of the screen that shows the APR and monthly finance payment option fast talking weird guy and all this like fine print suddenly springs up in front of you that just seems normal that is not fucking normal see this is why selling cars this is if you wonder why like car commercials always come up on the on the tv why it seems like everybody apparently is in the process of buying a new car here's why selling a car is one of the greatest achievements that a salesperson can make because but not only are you selling a fucking car you're getting somebody chained into a debt contract and that is so lucrative you haven't just sold this product you've managed to like get someone trapped in a goddamn deal that they it's gonna end up costing them so much more than the car actually costs and they make it seem like you know no monthly payments for the first year it none of it matters because all that really is happening is you are getting into debt with with a bank and some of us can just afford to buy a car flat out but you'll never see that on a car commercial you'll never see the couple come in and say all right well buy the car here's a check for the full price of the car never will you see that because that is not what the car companies want the car companies want you to get into debt so that they can make money off of you having to pay interest on the thing that you bought that more than likely you didn't need at all because earlier versions of cars even last year's model man it's like you got to get rid of those fucking things into the year sale we got to get rid of these pieces of shit they're they're eight months old it's a it's a it's a really creepy devious thing and it's fun to to sit back and watch it all and know that what you're witnessing is the ongoing manipulation of a giant pig that consists of all the people who happen to be tuning into that show and what you're also seeing is not only are they trying to get that pig discreet money out of its poor little nipples they're trying to teach the pig what's right and what's wrong which is why these shows always have these kind of obvious morals where the good guy tends to win but what is a good guy a good guy is usually a guy who follows the exact same principles that happen to coincide with the the current laws of society so the idea is if you follow the rules and you follow the laws you'll tend to be okay in the end but if you don't then you're gonna end up getting your brain eaten by zombies or some various some version of that i mean the most extreme cases are the shows like locked up raw which actually like scare the shit out of you by showing what happens if you get caught uh with like you know weed in your pocket in the wrong state you can end up in a giant dungeon filled with rapists so tv is intense to watch and i know a lot of this stuff might not be new to you forgive this long winded rant in the beginning it's just something that's really gotten to me but uh here's what's here's the whole point of this thing 26 minutes in while i was watching The Walking Dead i began to realize that these characters in The Walking Dead many many many many of them were ex-military they keep bringing up the military the military the military and it's like there there there's tanks everywhere and there's like look i understand maybe someone in the military would be more likely to survive the uh zombie apocalypse but a lot of these people will say things like now i'm in the reserves it's just weird to me like i don't i don't know if the writers were like yeah let's populate this this world with ex-military people but there seems to be something a little more sinister there because the implication of that when you're watching survivors in an apocalypse saying that they're ex-military is that if you want to survive in the world the best thing you can do is join the military and that is creepy man that's creepy because even if it's unintentional still in the in the in a state of deep hypnotic induction as you're watching this if you're like a teenager who maybe doesn't have a lot of money then suddenly you're going to start thinking that a viable option for you is to join the military and not only is it a viable option but it may help you survive some catastrophic collapse now i don't know i don't i don't know if that's really happening uh i don't know if um i don't know how that would even work you know like what with the military contact the walking dead or would they give them money to in the same way that product placements happen with would that happen does that happen in tv because we know that this happens in like you know Jay Leno's show we know that Jay Leno during his open opening monologues will do jokes about Chick-fil-A or Wendy's or uh Firestone or you name it he'll he'll do some kind of weird joke about a product but he does that because he's it's a form of paid product placement and we know that we know that the walking dead uh has like cars like you know which car is the product placement because it's a car that somehow was managed to not get that banged up even though it's been running it driving over zombies so so or maybe it like survived somehow you know it's it has enough traction to like roll out of a pile of smushed zombies or something you know there's product placement there and and i think there might even be product placement in shows like eastbound and down like i i don't i don't know if you saw this it's not really a spoiler but in this last episode of eastbound and down kenny powers like goes into this whole weird thing about southwest airlines just like so obvious so we know that we're used to product placement in our shows and our movies so that the question is is there like deeper product placement because if massive corporations know that they can sell more product by having shows right in moments where these products are showcased wouldn't the greatest and most powerful corporation on earth which is the military industrial complex also know that by getting shows to portray um the military as being one of the sure fireways to survive the zombie apocalypse wouldn't they know that that's like going to be good for their for business wouldn't it be in their budget to do the same thing that other corporations do i don't know i really don't know i would love it if anybody had any kind of like information about this i um uh have been uh talking with this amazing investigative journalist named amber lion she's going to be on the podcast uh she's in a in a month or so but um i was asking her about this um and uh she uh because she's had like direct direct experience with uh you can you just google search her because her story is amazing but she's had direct experience with like news organization organization she's worked for slanting uh trying to get her to slant stories based on like apparently wanting to uh spread government propaganda to fix into what it fit into whatever storyline the government wants but i was asking her i know i was telling her about this weird paranoid moment that i had um about uh about the um with the walking dead and the in the constant reference to the military and she sent me this amazing article that was in rolling stone uh by um about cia infiltration of media it's by carl Bernstein and i'll have the link for that it's a very long kind of like complex article but the gist of the thing is that the cia actually uh has been proven it's been proven that the cia would hire journalists or have journalists working for them to spread propaganda so if the cia is getting into the news networks and this is all proven this isn't like crazy uh september 11 conspiracy theory stuff this has all been proven journalists have admitted doing it and have even said that they're proud of their work so if a government organization is infiltrating the news networks is it that crazy to think that government a government organization like the military would infiltrate shows like the walking dead to try to portray uh ex-military people as being more likely to survive which i may i think maybe they would be i don't think it's that far off but my question is is it something accidental or is it something intentional and even if it's accidental isn't it kind of fucking weird anyway isn't it strange to think that 16 million brains are absorbing this subliminal idea that if you want to survive there in the last episode it wasn't just survived in the last episode i remember someone saying i wanted to make something myself that thing you know that party line you know that if you want to make something of yourself you should you should join the military like that's the best way to really make something of yourself i mean watch any military commercial and you can see what the storyline is it doesn't show when they show commercials for the military quite often it'll show someone working in some kind of like weird air conditioned underground bunker with all these awesome displays that looks like they're in 24 or something like operating these cool computers and beautiful like beautiful you're basically in a spaceship and it's and you look great they don't show you pissing yourself uh as you as you as you try to push your friends and testants back into a stomach in military commercials usually i've never seen that they don't show that they don't show the reality of war in these commercials they show sort of this sort of very polished version of war they don't show what they showed in dirty wars which is a great great show that you should watch on netflix which is basically like from time to time little accidents happen in strange parts of the united states military will go into villages in afghanistan and just accidentally shoot pregnant women in the face uh they don't show that either so yeah i don't know i don't know i mean already i can already kind of feel the the some people out there like you don't support the troops yeah and i know people some people who are actually in the military listen to this podcast uh and i and i hope that i'm not depressing you but i think that if you're out there in the in the dust that you're more aware of what's going on uh than anybody else and i i have a feeling that you you recognize that maybe the commercials that you've watched about the military don't necessarily portray exactly what happens when you're at war uh and because what really happens when you're at war is you're you're either like apparently bored off your ass doing like basic like stocking shit and like i don't know like a lot of just like basic boring drudge work but uh also sometimes you're um you're killing people you're killing people i mean isn't that that that's kind of like the main idea is that you're killing people it's like you're a firefighter only you're not putting out fires you're putting out human lives that apparently are potentially destructive to the country that you're fighting for so it's like you're a firefighter of death or your i don't know you're in a life extinguisher basically so that's my weird rant hopefully there's some point to it hopefully it makes some kind of sense the essence being is the walking dead a fucking shill for the military industrial complex y'all can someone find this out for me is there a way to find this out can somebody investigate whether or not these fucking constant references to the military are based on the idea that people who have been in the military are more likely to survive the zombie apocalypse are they there because there's some kind of weird collusion between the walking dead and the fucking military are they getting money for talk for like portraying um care as survivors as being former military people i need to know someone find this out from it either way it gives me the heebie jeebies it's a lot scarier to imagine uh that that that that some show about zombies and the apocalypse is somehow a hypnotic tool for the military industrial complex than it is to him to to worry about zombies eating your brains that's for sure i mean in a way it is like a zombie eating the brain of this fucking giant weird poor hypnotized pig that's being suckled at by the demonic corporations of america that desperately want to get it in debt to the global banking cartels that have somehow in some weird gulliver travel way have managed to use their evil um contracts to uh tie this poor being down on the sand of debt which is uh the way many people find themselves after being tricked by the media you know you just end up coming to the realization like holy shit man i'm fucking deeply in debt to the banks through credit cards and motherfucking car payments and mortgages shit i can't even move i guess i'm a slave i don't know hope this wasn't too long a rant you guys uh it's just something i've been thinking about and i would really love to know if anybody has any information on the uh military doing product placement not just in the walking dead but in any shows and if you could find some good examples for me i'd love to talk about it more on the podcast but this is a great podcast today uh and speaking of spraying corporate seeds into your brain i'm gonna do my own form of satanic seeding but the difference is i'm not i don't weave it into my i don't it's not like i you don't know i'm i'm trying to sell you something that's the difference i get it friends people gotta make money i'm not i'm not saying like we shouldn't have businesses we shouldn't have corporations i'm just saying that if you're fucking subliminally tricking people into thinking that they should join an organization where there's a chance that they might get their fucking face blown off in a goddamn cave then that's weird dunker trestle family our podcast is brought to you by amazon.com is this bad am i a hypocrite should i not do

that's why tv's not like this this is different than i hope you recognize that tv isn't like this i'm not trying to trick you i'm not talking about how if you go to amazon.com you're suddenly gonna have a great family or your wife's gonna start having sex with you again just saying if you want to order some lubricant it's a great way to do it without having to go to a fucking ride aid and feel

that you don't have to go through that you go to amazon.com get it to your you could have lube there the next day see you won't hear that on tv i don't know guys maybe we should all just go live somewhere else somewhere else we're gonna live we're here i like this country i'm not saying this is a bad country i'm not even saying that we don't need a military i think we do we do you do need defense i don't i'm not pretending that the world isn't filled with dangerous factions of brainwashed religious fanatics i'm sure it's out there but it's also here too i mean there's a lot of brainwashed religious fanatics here too and i'm always gonna be on the side of not blowing people up if possible so i'm not against the military and i know a big part of the conditioning is that one of the great crimes is to like talk shit about the fucking military bill hicks had one of the greatest jokes ever which is uh i support the war i'm against i'm against the troops but i support the war very funny but yeah if you're on stage and even say the slightest thing that even seems remotely against the fucking military everyone just explodes in rage it's really weird that's part of the conditioning you know we're not supposed to point out the fact that a lot of the wars that are going on right now are wars that nobody would really vote for and in fact no one even fucking understands or cares about we're not supposed to say that it's weird not really weird it actually seems exactly what the government would want us to be doing coincidentally i would i would much rather have uh soldiers uh uh here back in the united states doing great works here and risking their lives out in some dirty dusty weird desert filled with freak cultists who only want to be left alone basically and are just pissed now because we've been blowing them up for so long so don't confuse me i don't want to get a lot of shitty fucking tweets from people somehow saying that i'm like i don't know anti america or something i'm not and and and being against fucking stupid wars makes you more of an american because you want the country to be better god damn i'd much rather the money being used to pay for all these ridiculous stupid wars to get plugged into people so we can go to college and and and get educated fuck it plug it into like making better goddamn raves happen i don't know manufacture some fin even better psychedelics that's what i'd rather have this military industrial complex money being used to pay for a new form of nasa that explores psychedelics how about that how about instead of a goddamn nasa we use the money from the military industrial complex to fund some kind of organization that explores different psychedelic mind states specifically the weird dimension you go into when you smoke dmt all right jump the shark just now i get it today's podcast oh i forgot it's also brought to you by short design t-shirts the favorite shirt of the military industrial

feels terrible welcome to the dougie trestle family our podcast thank you for having me thank you for being here yeah you came over and start we're just gonna start off on we're the right foot sure i want to hear about your bad mushroom trip in ashville north carolina all right uh well about a month ago uh i went with my friend kimber to ashville to see neutral mall hotel oh wow cool and uh and to visit with my little brother we're there for a week and i i haven't i've only done mushrooms a handful of times and when i say handful like a very small handful like four times right and i've always had a great time and uh and i've always been really careful i um i bought enough for me and my friend and was given like really explicit instructions on how to take them and how much to take and the day that we took them we we asked i don't know 10 15 different locals like where the best place to take them would be we wanted to go into nature and have a have a good time so we found this trail on uh on the Biltmore estate which is like that big Vanderbilt house and we we decided to take them there because it was like fenced in and safe and we could yes so we took very little we took like i don't know an eighth of what we have and just had a nice hike and everything was pretty and the colors were great yes um and we went back we had dinner and dinner was great we went back to our hotel and we had the rest of the mushrooms and uh the the neutral milk hotel show was part of this thing called the mountain oasis music festival which is a big electronic music music festival which is weird it's not neutral milk hotels in no way electronic music and neither of us really like electronic music like this is the last day that we were there and we had all of these mushrooms left over and i was like you know what let's just let's take them and go to the and go to the show yes you know this is i mean the lights that'll be great sure yeah not thinking where was the show it was in ashville at the uh cellular cellular center so you went to uh rave it basically yeah right before halloween okay the day before halloween so everyone's wearing costumes yes didn't think about that before we went so i my friend has done mushrooms more than i have and we kind of like we have like a like oh yeah we'll take them yeah that's a good idea and then i i took all of my half and she was like wait did you take did you take all of those i was like yeah well we fine so she did it too and so we walked we walked over to the festival and uh we were going to see a band cut copy which we both thought was a different band than what it ended up being which was this australian electronic music thing where where this guy is dressed in all white and i mean it's i i know i will be able to describe it accurately because it's it's through the i saw it through the through the eyes of of tripping but um when we got there i started to feel this really intense body high and somehow i like i thought that if you had if you drank orange juice that it would help you be less high yeah this is a classic mistake weirdly like it seems to be kind of up in the air about what what the effect orange juice has on tripping right so i so so kimber kimber grabbed her seat and then i started feeling i was five minutes ahead of her and just started feeling this really intense body high and the guys behind us were talking about bad trips so i was like oh i gotta i gotta get some some orange juice so i went out into the lobby and immediately like was having a hard time coping but was just telling myself like hey and it's the drugs yeah it's fine like you're not gonna be one of these people that freaks out just just know that this is the drugs sure and so i there they're all these different lines in the lobby for for refreshments and i i'm trying to find a line and the first line that i that i stand in all the people are talking i have a sensation that they couldn't see me like literally i was invisible so i was like oh i'll get in a different line and they were being really loud like people i think what was happening was people were standing in line and their friends were joining them but i was just like oh okay go to go to a different place but i was still it was still okay yeah i was like i just need to get some orange juice and then i went to this this line on the other side of the lobby craving for orange juice curious craving anytime generally but why orange oh well i thought i thought it was gonna make me less high oh okay it wasn't just like you were like oh i i'm sorry i oh no no it wasn't like oh i need some more no i like i gotta calm down i'm gonna drink some oj yeah yeah yeah which i really thought was just like a cure all yes yeah i think people get i think actually the there's so many various cures that i wonder which is a placebo and which is real going in either direction more high or less high like yeah orange is really amplify high does milk really soothe the high i mean i've had people tell me like at poison control centers when people come in having bad trips on weed i can't remember what it is they give people but i think it's like i can't remember it's like milk maybe i don't know it's something like some yeah yeah but anyway go ahead so so so oj i'm trying to find oj and i was i was fine i was fine i was fine and then there's there's one visual that like sent me over the edge standing in line and it's a day before halloween so people are wearing costumes but i started i started feeling i started like losing sight of the costumes like every you know the costumes every everyone looks like they're wearing a costume yes you know so it just anyway i'm standing there there's this guy who's um tall tall heavy set guy who's wearing i think he was dressed like a shower he had these he had these hoops around him and he was basically wearing what looked like a dress but it but it was like a shower yeah and he had these weird tattoos on his back and i looked at him and was really disgusted more than i would be nor like i don't usually look at people and feel disgust but i looked at him i was like oh i just don't don't look at that and then this woman came up to him who was also wearing a costume and they started making out in front of me and i just ran i like that moment nightmare moment yeah i i mean they just they looked like demons that were that were mating and i just was so grossed out reproducing demons this is this is jacob's ladder strobe light tail suddenly you look down and there's a tail rattling across the floor right yes okay so then you think they're demons i think they're demons i still need orange juice uh meanwhile kimber is texting me hey uh show's about to start you better get back in here or she or what she was saying to me was that she wanted me to come back in there because she was also having a bad trip but i thought that she was having a great time and that's why she wanted me to get back in there right and she and i was like i'm cool i'm just getting some orange juice and she thought that i was just getting the orange juice because i was having a great time so it was like the trip of the magi we're both having a terrible time but we're staying because we uh because we thought the other person wanted to so i i go downstairs to this to this lounge and i'm standing in line waiting for orange juice or i think i'm standing in line this woman comes up behind me and she's like hey like what are you doing what are you like i am i'm i don't know i don't know i don't know what i'm doing and she said i think she could tell that i was on something and like helped me out by saying okay like here's the line this is the line for this and i was like okay okay thank you and i've never uh standing in the line so terrified it it became my turn and i i couldn't talk and then eventually i was like orange juice orange juice orange juice and the one was like okay i just gave it to me and didn't charge me for it oh no so i take at this electronic music festival they set up all these different i don't know like in this lounge there's this giant twister board and their black lights and all these different lights because people are just gonna freak out yeah yeah so i i it was really hard to find i just needed to find like darkness and i found this this doorway where i just sat in this doorway drank this orange juice and then was having a hard time texting kimber and and tried to calm down and i had to i had a long way to go to get back up to her and i i in order to cope to get through this crowd i kept on repeating to myself you you're an island of good you're good you're it's it's just stay stay to your own island all the other islands they're not trying to hurt you you're you know that you're in trouble if you're tripping and you find yourself muttering any kind of prayer you're okay forget it oh i'm holding myself hugging myself mushrooms will nothing will induce prayer more than a bad mushroom trip that will get you praying so fast yeah for for safety and for guidance uh so so i do that i i get back to our seat the moment that i walk into this big space it's terrifying they handed out these uh devil horns to everyone because it was right before halloween and um i mean which wasn't the scariest thing the scariest thing was just everyone's everyone's face was terrifying and there was this man that was standing next to kimber like i was standing my seat was in between kimber and this and this man who my memory of his face was that it was this this melted devil face that his face was was literally melted together and i think he just probably was was just not a good-looking man but he had long black hair and this melted face and these devil horns and i was sure that he was the devil that was there to to watch me yeah so i'm standing next to kimber she's freaking out there are these two guys in front of us uh who are wearing all white and i said to kimber like they're there are protectors like it's fine we can get through this like they're there are they're they're protecting us from all this stuff that's around us um but then they left like the first one left and and we were both kind of freaking out uh except both of us didn't know that the other person was also freaking out we were both pretending that we weren't then we eventually i i realized like oh if if we're here when the concert's over we'll die because you know the not being able to cope with all those people and then just the chaos of everyone leaving like i really thought that we would we would die if we didn't get out of there so we left um and in order to leave like i was trying to help her out i was like okay we're we're bullets of goodness we're just going to bullet through don't look at anyone don't talk to anybody and uh we we got out we we got out of the concert and we're like okay great and i remember just thinking like hi i gotta look at something pretty i need to look at a painting i need to look at anything but it was dark and there was nothing around and people are leaving this electronic music festival and we're we're walking and this guy came up to us and he he just grabbed my arm not not like aggressively but just to get my attention he was like hey are you done and kimber and i stared at him like uh both like what and both is a what do you what do you mean what do you mean are we done i wish with like our lives like yeah and he just wanted our bracelets for the for the concert and he was just asking are you done with a concert right which still like even not being high is a weird way to ask for your bracelet well sure i mean because when you're on mushrooms i mean there's a lot of different ways to look at coincidence man but you could kind of look at it like mushrooms i guess the little less fufu way to say it is mushrooms bring you into the realm of the symbolic in a much more intense way uh than than you generally experience so you in the realm of the symbolic uh which is around us at all times things do mean much more than what they are on the surface are you done does mean much more you're seeing the it's almost as though like the deeper part of your mind which is just a web of symbols that makes up your subjective universe has emerged out of you and is floating in front of you in the form and projecting itself on the screen of occurrence so yeah it did mean more than are you done oh so we were taking these bracelets off and uh his girlfriend was there too and and his girlfriend to kimber said hey i'm like i'm like you because she thought that kimber had a shaved scalp and a long hair but she didn't her hair was just like pressed against her against her head but this woman like picked up her hair and showed that her scalp was shaved but we both were sure that she was about to like take off her face she was a demon yeah so it's like a demon and the demons lover coming to you and demons lover says the first the worst thing you could say to someone is are you done is it over are you done you know like you i'm like you this is like the same kind of conversations they have in that weird room in twin peaks the black lodge it's like shit that little backwards talking bastard says oh the next time you see me i won't be myself it's terrifying it's scary just looking at you saying demon speak elf speak you know demon speak or or angels speak because you can't forget the demons are a form of angel it's just a form of angel that has a little more uh autonomy than the other like singing or whatever the pig angels that only worship shit um so we so we got we got past that we had we had a little time where we were in this part of downtown ashville where we couldn't cross the street or go in any direction because every direction seemed scary and then we just we couldn't go back to our hotel because our hotel was this old department store and we were staying on the children's floor and it was already scary when we were sober so right we didn't go there but i i said let's go back to there's this little street in downtown ashville that's this really cute cobblestone yeah adorable street yeah yeah and wall street yes yeah yeah exactly so uh i was like well let's go let's go to wall street we held hands and just like kept on kept on going didn't want to look at anything everything everything was really scary and we get to wall street and this is when uh kimber and i started really like break down she she was pointing at like we we both i went we were we were tripping similarly but obviously because we're different people there are different things going on and we're passing by these windows and and she's we we passed by like a number 12 and she's like see look look the number 12 everything's gonna be okay and then i thought oh and then she was talking about like i don't know like big business and and you know and i my impression of that at the time was oh this is what somebody would say if they were pretending to be kimber like this is just like dumb like trip talk and i was and when she said when she said uh this the number 12 everything's gonna be okay i freaked out and i was like what what does that mean to you really the number 12 like does that mean anything to you and then i thought that like she was possessed by something yes and i started screaming at her to stop being so manic and and she's like well maybe you're just maybe you're just not as as high as i am and i was like i i i don't know but i'm freaking out and you need to calm down like your energy is so crazy and so we we calm down but we go down the street and suddenly everything's ugly it's not like it was when we first got there like we were noticing all these dead plants we sit on this bench and unfortunately a man with schizophrenia starts walking towards us yeah they it's almost like people with schizophrenia and sometimes people with really severe mental handicaps seem to be drawn to bad trips like moths to candles it's a very odd thing but they will get drawn into your orbit it's like they can sense it or something that somebody's kind of like not uh plugged into the um normal reality and they want to be around you for a little bit of comfort or something that's interesting well we ran from him and crossed the street and ran into this bar and when we when we went inside the bar my looking around the bar everyone looked like they were a family that was having like a private discussion which they weren't it was just a bunch of people sitting in a bar yeah and i said oh no i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i'll leave you guys alone to the bar like got the attention of the bar and said i'm so sorry and then um ran out and uh i screamed to kimber like the bars closed because i thought it was after two meanwhile it was like nine o'clock so i know i feel like i feel like my my story my story is boring but no it isn't i'm sorry you saw me look at there i was just looking to make sure it was still recording because your story is so interesting swear to god but isn't it sorry about that is it obnoxious to talk about uh like what happened when you were high no because i'm gonna fucking like wait till i wait till i tell you a little bit about ashville and wait till i tell you about the time i got possessed by demons in ashville great okay so we run into this bar we run out we we find this like this this little um window display that has some flowers and we call the one person that we know in ashville which is this bartender we met the first night and said we're so sorry but we need help please come help us wow and so he came and uh and and joined us and took us to like a quieter bar and we started to come down and feel better and uh and then but then this girl that he used to date ran into him and she she joined us and kimber and i were both like oh we can't we can't deal with it we can't deal with this woman because i said to her because she was just like really excited and i think she was on ecstasy or something like she was she was on her own journey and i said hey i'm sorry we're we're tripping and she was like oh my god and what what are you tripping on do you have it and i was like oh i can't i can't deal yeah yeah so that's that's it i feel like i'm gonna throw up really you need to go throw up yeah maybe what happened i don't know all right all right oh i took a bunch of green tea supplements okay go vomit and then we'll continue the podcast okay i'm sorry we're back you just that is a first the dry heaving in the middle of the you know eating supplements with an empty stomach is a recipe for puke definitely you get the you get that vitamin swoon and that weird feeling um you know what here okay let me tell you a little bit about ashville and because i grew up in i went to college at warren wilson right outside of ashville grew up in hinderssonville spent massive amounts of time in ashville took so much acid in ashville uh and and have had a demon mushroom trip in ashville um so uh i uh know a lot about the the occult side of ashville and if you google search the occult in ashville you'll get all kinds of crazy conspiracy theories because it's a very it's a strange little town and it's got its own vibe and its own power and right the the the the weirdos would always this is back in when i was there everybody was into psychic tv and everybody was into the kind of the occult that was being dispensed the occult information being dispensed from them and um people were really into uh people were there were really into practicing mat different forms of magic and different and there were you know into it they they were more committed to it than just your average person who buys a book at a bookstore or something like people are doing some really weird fucking shit out there and every what do you think that is it is it about that area that's you know i when i say weird shit i mean like you'd hear stories about these groups of people like there there was like a you know there were there were people there who had like code names where many of them like a lot of them were named like john and you there was a weird story once about one of them betraying the group and then the story of how they had duct taped into a chair and some house and like they did something fucked up to him like really like deep creep stuff out there up in the mountains up in the mountains because up in the mountains you're dealing with a lot of like um just a lot of weird energy and also the fact that the place was uh basically owned by uh the the Vanderbilt who started the Biltmore house and there's this like really weird old money that had popped up there because the Biltmore house is one of the i think it may be the biggest mansion or one of the biggest mansions on the east private private house in the country in the country so it's this giant sprawling house whenever you have like these fucking you know coral reefs that have been constructed by the reptilians there's always strange energy that floats around these reefs you know in the same way fish swim around reefs there's always weird energy and so the focal point if you're a freak in ashville drum circle hippy acid guzzling freak then you know that the focal point of all the weird psychic energy in ashville is that obelisk in the middle of town you saw it of course right looks just like this see behind me i have this poster i have an acrolean poster of baphomet and and right right here you see this obelisk right next to uh the this symbol and so and there's that obelisk right right there right now here's what's really fascinating right next to that obelisk is this uh did you see the angel statue uh i don't i must have i don't remember okay so let me show you something really cool this will freak you out uh look homeward angel i'm google searching because i can't remember the name of the angel look it's i think it's called the vance my more look homeward angel ashville statue hold on let me find this sorry you guys this is very interesting here's the one see dan and i went on a ghost hunting tour when we were there a few years ago and that was like the big the big thing okay so this is a statue right next to this obelisk right uh which is supposed to be dedicated to um uh what's his name the guy wrote look home word angel sorry guys i'm an idiot uh now here's what's really awesome if you guys i'll put a i'll put all the links to this on the website but take a look at this angel and then take a look at my sweet little demon friend behind me and notice the way that they're standing oh pretty interesting all the way down to the star on his head pointing up pointing down right next to the exact same obelisk what a strange weird coincidence isn't it they've constructed the identical occult representation behind me in the middle of their town or why why is that there if you know anything about the occult you know that what the occult means is hidden but it also means hidden in plain sight because what people like to do is throw the symbols out right in front of everybody so that the people who are in the know can see them and take some comfort in that and the people who aren't in the know just get to walk around like little hypnotized robots completely unaware of the fact that they're an amaze constructed by uh people using information that existed prior to the biblical flood if you buy into all this nonsense but and it is nonsense on one level on one level it's absolute complete bullshit but on another level it's as real as mountains or trees or gravity because symbols are such an important aspect of human society that they literally are the fuel which runs all of society and so he who controls the symbols essentially controls society and that's the whole idea anyway long and short of it is i was on mushrooms in ashville north carolina and i got fucking possessed by some kind of malevolent force and never has happened that happened to me before i would never want it to happen again right i was on mushrooms have been attacked i've been attacked by elves on mushrooms that i've never really had one like go and i've never had anything this fucking weird happened to me ever which was that i was at a goddamn low level mountain rave on mushrooms and this suddenly there was this like voice in my head that was like clear as a bell and and it was not my voice and it was saying to me go sit go sit down i sat down and it was like it was it was saying i want to show you this and then like i'm looking at my arms and all over my arms are these weird like runes or symbols or patterns or these strange fucking as though someone had just like some weirdo had tattooed all these things up and down my arm that i couldn't understand what it said and then this voice said to me and it was speaking to me not like Duncan but as a human it was saying and the voice was so droney and weird and exactly like sure this got plugged into my head by watching the last temptation of christ too many times or whatever i mean you have to understand i do not i believe in this stuff in the sense that i know that it i know it exists like i know it's real in the sense that people experience it do i believe it's something that lives outside of the ecosystem of the human mind i have no fucking idea but it's definitely a fish that swims around our brain caves it definitely lives inside us so the thing said to me uh you are glorious and sanctified it was talking about humans humans and then it was saying um uh then it was like go home and purify the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet like it wanted me to go and like open myself up more to it to understand it more i was freaking the fuck out i saw pentagrams everywhere everywhere i look just like just like an entire web of like not pentagrams like the drawings of pentagrams but this looked like the archetypical thing that people saw in their minds and then drew a pentagram you know what i mean like it's a thing that gave birth to pentagram were you by yourself i was with like pseudo friends you know i don't know i was with some group of like you know mountain druggies uh mountain friends and they're all freaking out mountain friends i was with my weird mountain friends and they're like and something was going on that night because people were crying they were like sitting there weeping and like holding each other i swear to god it was the weirdest weirdest night and so the long and short of is i've thought about that trip ever since then and uh i guess we have something in common and that we've both encountered demons in uh in ashville which many many people have many many people have come in contact with the energy that sort of floats and around that place and permeates that place kimber and i both have the same sensation we talked about it while it was happening where we were we both felt like the city of ashville found out that like wanted to destroy our goodness like that demons were out to find us like they found out that we were there like at one point after that are you done we were standing in this this small area and it their weird motorcyclists and all these different things that just it felt like like demons like oh we have we have uh i have to eat another cracker i'm so sorry what's the worst eat the cracker and i'm gonna go get this book because i want to read this little passage to you from this awesome book which is uh and also i want to calm my annoying dog down but i want to read this book which is a um i'll just go grab it while you eat crackers hold on okay so here this is a book that i really like called the uh psychedelic experience and this is a manual based on the debatin book of the dead written by timothy leary ralph metzner and richard albert now that's rom das before he became rom das this is when they were all tripping out on acid and they recognized that the there was an exact correlation between the experience of tripping on psychedelics and the different stages of death written about in the debatin book of the dead known as the bardos and so this book takes the debatin book of the dead and trans translates it into something that you can use when you're having when you're tripping because the idea is when you're using a psychedelic or they thought the idea was or one goal the thing is to merge in a unit of consciousness and completely drop the ego and become part of that great transcendental ohm that is timeless and which we're all ultimately apart go back to the godhead but in the process of getting to that place the mind sort of you know throws out all these like tricks and maneuvers and to try to like keep us distracted because their ego for whatever reason seems to not want to uh or seems antithetical somehow to that state initially so this is like different like passages that you you read while you're tripping and i will read this one friends out there um uh you have to be careful with psychedelics it's it's a these are you know it's a serious thing and if you do the thing that we all do i'm such a hypocrite because i'm from the first many years of my life i was the opposite i would i would i would take acid and sit in a shopping mall just to marvel at people shopping because it seems so weird and polluted but ultimately if you really want to use the tool that you can go really deep if if you use them in the right way but we all make the mistake of going to concerts on mushrooms the worst worst mistake worst it's like going and swimming in a sewer or something it's like skinny dipping in a fucking toilet that's what going to a concert on mushrooms is like you've dilated your third eye you've opened yourself up completely and you're just getting just you are third eyes getting peed on by the vibes of everyone around you essentially that's what the experience is and it's can be really bad if you cross paths with the wrong fucking shower curtain man all right here is here is um this is called vision seven the magic theater and and this is something that you can you can listen to if you start tripping out and seeing the demons or the elves if the voyager was unable to maintain the passive serenity necessary for the contemplation of the previous visions the peaceful deities he moves now into more dramatic that was your walk that was your walk in tranquility he moves now into a more dramatic and active phase the play of forms and things becomes the play of heroic figures superhuman human spirits and demigods you may see radiating figures in human forms the lotus lord of all dance the supreme image of a demigod who perceives the effects of all actions the prince of movement dancing in an ecstatic embrace with his female counterpart heroes heroine celestial warriors male and female demigods angels fairies the exact form of these figures will depend on the person's background and tradition archetypal archetypal figures in the forms of characters from greek egyptian nordic caltech aztec persian indian chinese mythology the shapes differ the sources the same they are the concrete embodiment of aspects of the person's own psyche archetypal form forces below verbal awareness and expressible only in symbolic form the figures are often extremely colorful and accompanied by a variety of awe-inspiring sounds if the voyager is prepared in a relaxed detached frame of mind he is exposed to a fascinating and dazzling display of dramatic creativity the cosmic theater the divine comedy if his eyes are open he may visualize the other voyagers as representing these figures the face of a friend may turn into that of a young boy a baby the child god into a heroic statue a wise old man a woman animal goddess sea mother young girl nymph elf goblin leprechaun images of the great painters arise as the familiar representation of these spirits the images are inexhaustible and many many fold an illuminating voyage into the areas where the personal consciousness merges with the supra individual the danger is that the voyager becomes frightened by or an unduly attracted to these powerful figures the forces represented by them may be more intense than he was prepared for inability or unwillingness to recognize them as products of one own's mind leads to escape into animalistic pursuits we gotta go to a bar the person may become involved in the pursuit of power lust wealth and descend into the third bardo rebirth struggles if the guide senses that the voyager is caught in this trap the appropriate instructions may be used that's on page 137 what the fuck is that i don't realize the instructions oh it's a you know this is the hippie shit this is where you get into like a poem you're supposed to read but name your trip with your friends you're never gonna you want to hear the poem you're supposed to yeah there's no one's gonna do this i mean this is like people were much more open minded back then but when you're tripping with your friends try to be like hey i'm gonna like do you mind if i read a poem do you actually yeah okay guys if you're seeing demons here's what you listen to okay all those having bad trips right now you're being attacked by demons is for you don't drink orange juice and relax oh no bleed now remember this is all from the Tibetan Book of the Dead this is meant to be read to dying people originally this this thing that they're saying here when you're dying you experience the very same thing where you are suddenly in the presence of spirits or demons or angels and you know the idea of the Tibetan Book of the Dead the idea is like don't get distracted you don't have to be reborn as a human again you can transcend and experience peace for infinity if only you don't keep falling for the fear bait that drives you back down into the human body for so after count for countless incarnations so here it is if you're tripping out of them all this is for you oh nobly born listen well you are now in the magic theater of heroes and demons mythical superhuman figures demons goddesses celestial warriors giants angels bodhisattvas dwarves crusaders elves devils saints shower curtain men making out with their pig girlfriends and sorcerers infernal spirits goblins knights and emperors the lotus lord of dance the wise old man the divine child the trickster the shapeshifter the tamer of monsters the mother of god by now i'm just freaking out because they're telling me all these different names that i hadn't thought of the moon king the wanderer shut up man trying to watch the wall bro the whole divine theater of figures representing the highest reaches of human knowledge do not be afraid of them they're within you your own creative intellect is the master magician of them all recognize the figures as aspects of yourself the whole fantastic comedy takes place within you do not become attached to the figures remember the teachings you may still attain liberation well i don't know if that's gonna work i mean i wish i would have i wish i would have had that when i was tripping though i think like i definitely like came out on the other side the that's funny like all the as you're reading all those different people i'm thinking like oh that was that bartender and that was that guy that was covering himself in glitter yeah and isn't it cool because it's cool because what you're seeing is it's like you're when you're tripping it's like you kind of like your brain is vomiting out symbols and you and and if you recognize that it's just a product of your brain uh or your of your of your deeper self then it becomes much less frightening than when you start thinking like oh my god all my friends are demons because that's a very common experience because what really what you're seeing is you're seeing the demons that live inside of you being projected on the screen that is your friends right and then you start recognizing like oh my god i'm the light shining from the lighthouse of my being is like tinted with darkness or weird colors and that's why the world can sometimes seem so sinister to me and that's you know that's the idea is liberation is realizing like oh i can just remove the film from the lighthouse and then the colors that come out won't look like they're in a horror house on halloween let's eat some mushrooms no i want to try it i've done my trip mushroom trips man i am how do mushrooms mix with uh supplements mushrooms man they are rough mushrooms are rough man you know give me some good old-fashioned lsd like why do i have to eat that's less rough than my for me it is it's more manageable mushrooms are like mushrooms connect to you with it's are more likely to connect to you with this living teaching spirit that wants that wants to give you you know like tarence mckinnis said uh so i'm going to misquote it a little bit but he said something along the lines of there's no bad trips there's just the feeling of learning too fast you know where you're get you're getting too much information fed into you it's such a massive accelerated rate you're growing too fast because you're not scary because what you think you are generally is not what you are at all and suddenly to wake up to to what you really are is a form of death and nobody wants to experience that right it's much more fun to be like you know to to live on a certain level of reality that you're prepared the year that you've it's it's you know it's it's like the story of like how you cook a some evil story about how you cook a frog you know the story of how you cook a frog it's like you like to cook a frog this is an e whoever came up with this stupid fucking saying should be arrested but if you want to boil a frog slowly turn up the heat and the frog won't jump out of the pot it'll stay in the pot until finally it's too hot for it to get out and then it'll dissolve and that represents yoga that represents all the all the forms of learning that involve a slow progression into the dissolution of the south whereas psychedelics are like just fucking throwing the thing in a pot of boiling water and yeah and and melting it right away that's the experience of the bad trip is the pain of the dissolution of your ego no thanks i'm happy with where my ego is at i do it's it's funny like i i mean i i i know i know basically nothing about um about the psychedelic experience i say as i'm looking at your your book um but i do feel i do feel different in a in a good way since that happened like that the whole like island thing and like as i was coming down thinking about because because of like all of my projections and like all of my anger and the and and being so angry at kimber at one point even like she really wasn't doing anything like i but i was i was so so angry for what was probably three minutes but i just realizing that everyone needs to take care of their own island like myself as an island looking at myself in the mirror which is a terrible idea on mushrooms but doing that and and thinking like oh like i feel like i've been really overly concerned with everyone else's islands and how they're taking care of their own stuff and what about mine like mine's like falling apart i need to exercise more you think take supplements well so that's why you're taking supplements yeah yeah that's part of it well see this is why this is why when you you will hear people refer to psychedelics as medicine and the reason they call it medicine is because because it will the end result if you like if you make reentry in the right way which sounds like you did is that you feel compelled to live a better life you want to you know it's all generally it's always some version of like i'm gonna start exercising or maybe you know i'm gonna be more clean i'm gonna be more organized i'm gonna take more care of my body that's the end result and in this like when you how do you know that you're taking real medicine it fucking tastes like shit like when you're tasting real medicine you're always like you have this wincing like echinacea have you ever put echinacea in your mouth it's like no well that's like that's so when people hear that psychedelics are medicine they think oh i'm gonna take it'll be like climbing into a hot tub it's like no it's medicine it's going to hurt especially if you're a little out of balance which we all are the more out of balance you are the process of getting back into balance is it can be a little disconcerting if you begin to think that the state of vertigo is a state of balance when all of a sudden then a real balance is going for a little while to feel like vertigo yeah it's a really curious situation to get into but you know looking in the mirror is a bad idea people say that right yeah but it looking in the mirror is a bad idea if you don't want to learn what you really are right looking in the mirror is on psychedelics is a great idea if you want to see how your projection mechanisms are shaping your sense of self yeah which is why i did it like in the end it's like yeah i threw that out there like bad idea no you are wanting to learn yeah yeah and that was that was the moment when i like really i don't know felt i felt like i was time traveling but tell me what you saw well i what i said i was i was staring at myself in a in a mirror and obviously but i was we were in a not a not a bar but some kind of like i want to say speak easy but it was probably just a bar but it felt like this whole time you speak easy and i felt like you know that renoir painting uh where there's the female bartender and she's standing and there's a mirror behind her and well there's this there's this very like this is very sad painting by renoir um or sad depending on how you look at it and there's this uh this this it's forget what it's called it's very it's one of his most famous paintings and there's a woman that's that's standing there and you see her patrons behind her and you it's famous because you get the feeling of like all the i don't know it should be called like the male gaze this this painting and it's one of my favorite paintings but i i felt like staring at myself i went into the i went into the bathroom saw myself in the mirror and i i was i was really scared of what i saw and then kind of like i was like you know what let's pull it together and then looked at myself in a different mirror staring in this mirror i felt i was thinking about that woman and then i was thinking about i don't know i don't know how to articulate it that's not really like the most profound thing that moment but what was more profound is what i'm talking about like feeling just being really excited by the idea that i get to i do have someone who i get to totally take care of and i get to decide what she does and what her life is like and that person's me and not and not my you know not my boyfriend and not kimber and not like i i can be really sometimes i a lot of the time i treat kimber like she's she's my little sister right and it's not fair she doesn't do that to me at all and she's she's got her shit together she doesn't need anyone to like boss around but i find myself like i i sometimes i feel like we're similar and so things that she does that things that that really irritate me about myself or irritated me about myself like years ago i'm i get really angry if i like see that or anyway but that was like it was a really important thing yeah just like laying off that's a great thing to learn it which is that the idea that you that you know you're going to make things better by changing the people around you right is generally wrong not all the time though like sometimes people around you need as they say in the shining correction they need correction but sometimes that's rare but it is true sometimes but but generally it's more like if you can like adjust the part of yourself that is is needing things to be different than the way they actually are then suddenly the things around you that we're bothering you don't bother you at all because you don't even see them in the same way like when you have a cold when you don't have a cold you don't think about the cold it's gone because you're balanced so yeah that's you're right and that's and that's i think that's one of the great gifts that psychedelics will give you is they tell you stop stop trying to rearrange all these fucking puzzle pieces swirling around you because this puzzle that you can't solve it it's yeah and besides it's like the thing you're really trying to arrange is coming from a projector that's inside your heart anyway and once you fix that get the dust off the projector in your heart and you won't see it on the screen of your friends you know yeah oh and dealing with random hate that was another hate thing anger yeah well just um not not from me not my random hate but just dealing with trying to understand why someone would well i'm thinking about this because this happened this morning like i have an alert on my phone whenever someone it's like half the time that someone tweets at me i get it on my phone the other half i don't but at 4 a.m i had left my sound on and i woke up to a tweet that said uh hey um erin megatha you make you make a harm in town really hard to listen to uh please stop and stop more often oh something like that and i was just like uh and for a very long time just like lied in bed and i was like what is this the fun person yeah what a fun what a fun person and then you know i i don't know if you do this but like when that happens like i find myself going through their pictures i mean like who is this person and like why would they do this i'm like but but thinking back to i thought back to my to my trip and to my to my thing and like even if i don't know like even if even if she's right even if like i i'm i'm the most annoying person in the world or i ruin people's lives or whatever which i don't think is true i it doesn't matter so much or i don't know i mean that's that's stupid because obviously the reason that we do shows for audiences is because we went to give something to somebody or yeah no no no no i know i'm firing the idea here's the idea the idea or not enough to the idea something that whenever anything so you some you know some absolute boring human on the internet randomly shoots an arrow into the ocean which and the arrow is this stupid series of words that lands in your brain now the idea is uh instead of like thinking about the person who shot the arrow whether or not they're right or wrong and instead of even thinking about the arrow itself what it's composed of i'm taking all this from this like buddhist story about a king getting shot and uh have you ever heard this story no king's walking in the woods and he gets shot by an arrow and uh and falls to the ground and his servants come to him and say we have to take this arrow out of you and he's like no no no make sure that there's who find out who shot it what if there's other people in the woods waiting and they're they're going to shoot us again and so his servants run out and they find a hunter who accidentally shot the arrow thinking he was a deer and this were completely safe it's this hunter who made a mistake and and they're like we got to take this out he's like no wait find out what the arrow is made of what are the feathers made of because of what if it's poisoned what if he'd poison anyway the whole point of the thing is the tendency uh to to sort of try to identify the thing that created the reaction the thing that created the reaction in us right right so that so we push away these questions who is this guy let me go through his instagram well let me see who he knows do i know him is there a way i could try track him down i'd like to i'd like to kill him instead you peel all that away and then you just look at the feeling that it created inside of you yeah and you sit with that feeling and you watch that feeling you watch the anger you watch the sense of uh uh insecure whatever the various form is that it causes to emerge inside of you and you'll realize quickly that they didn't cause that feeling that that feeling always exists under the surface of your mind and that the arrows are the thing that draws it to the surface like when you put steak on someone's head he's got a bot fly in his head and the bot fly will poke out the parasite now i'm gonna throw up on your mic yeah you gotta pull you know so the idea is we pull the bot fly out and the arrows won't bother you anymore so when you get so when you really if you the idea is if you can dissolve that structure that's already inside of you the next time you get the shitty twitter message or whatever it is it won't do anything right there'll be no effect so how do i so so does that involve just coming to terms with why that made me feel bad or what do it's not why it's it's it's it's it's coming to terms with how it made you feel so it's sort of like why it made you feel bad is irrelevant is because the idea is this is where you get into mindfulness where it's like somebody does something shitty to you and it will make you angry or it will make you disappointed or it will make you whatever uh and so what you do is you forget i'm reading i'm listening this awesome pima children lecture um and what she says is so forget the storyline and anytime you go you go back into like what caused the feeling you're getting back into the storyline and getting back into the storyline is what keeps the feeling happening again and again and again you know like when you're laying in bed ruminating over a fight that you may have gotten in with somebody and you find yourself you know thinking about the fight over and over and you realize that what really what you're doing is a kind of emotional cutting you're like you know what i mean like every time you rethink about what happened you feel that same feeling and then you think about again the feeling comes back and you think about it again the feeling comes back so the idea is forget the storyline okay and just watch the feeling okay so it made me feel unwanted so i just so now what so now you sit with that feeling it's not a now what now it's just like you the feeling of unwantedness like where is it in your body right oh physically actually like in my in my test in your heart it's and it always is in the heart and then like you realize oh so now you can if you wanted to play around with that you could say oh it's clearly like what i'm experiencing is like my heart chakra it's like the part of my it's making me feel the part of myself that is incapable of loving anyone regardless of the way they're acting like really what you're feeling is this kind of it's reminding you of this numbed out part of yourself that's that's interacting with a part of yourself that isn't numb at all and that's it's like a cramp in your heart when i like i could think of like uh when i'm really mad it's always right there and if it feels like a muscle cramp it's like you know when you get a foot cramp it feels like that almost where it does feel like cramping down it's and so it's like uh instead of a dilation it's uh what what do they call it when someone's eyes turn into little pinpoints when their pupils turn into little um contraction right it's a contraction so what it's doing is it's causing a contraction of your heart chakra as a form of defense mechanism because when your heart's really open then that's where you can get you feel like you can get hurt the most so it's almost like the same way as when you see a sea creature and you poke it with a stick and the sea creature like sucks in on itself and closes off to try that's all that's happening you're poor little sea an enemy living inside of your heart is being shut down by the twitter arrow blasted from some asshole hipster and fucking wherever i don't get it i don't i mean i mean i understand what you're saying we're just thinking about firing that off i don't understand it storyline now you're in the storyline i know i just i can't like i can't get over it and then when you think about the storyline it keeps causing that thing to every time it starts opening up again it keeps it makes you keep fucking uh shutting down and it's like the foot thing about the storyline is how most of us spend all of our time driving around contemplating like that fucking bitch i can't believe she didn't understand how much i really loved her heart shutting down heart shutting down heart shutting down until finally forget about the stupid story yeah this surface level dust on the eternal nature of yourself because that's all it is it's like this eternal being infinite being of love wearing sunglasses and fixating on a tiny little speck of dust on his interdimensional sunglasses or her look at this dust this fucking dust blocking my vision all the time take off your sunglasses or wipe them off right yeah at least um all right so let's draw a tarot card all right i've never i've never done tarot card so try to understand about your bad trip okay and i don't know anything about tarot cards so we're gonna use i know a little bit they're based on the kabbalah okay but um or these are this is the alistair krully thoth tarot deck and all you have to do is consider your trip ask maybe i don't know i'm shaping what you can just draw a card and then we'll see if that card has something that it can illuminate about this trip that you had in ashville okay all right so i'm so i'm um thinking about whatever you want just probably random placebo effects completion so the card is uh this is uh the four of wands completion looks like a bicycle wheel well no you'll notice that this uh on this uh we'll see a familiar friend if you look at the spokes of the wheel the goat of it oh yeah i see your buddy well i was i was gonna see see the see the bird and the goat and the okay so completion four of wands let's see what we've got here completion four of wands that's a great card to get out of a of a trip for sure um completion four of four of wands four of wands these are very beautiful tarot cards and they're really thought out in the way that we just use them as like would be scoffed at by anybody who was really into this stuff so okay here we are the tree of life okay the four of wands here we are the four of wands represents chesed the power of condensation growth and stability standing in the structural discipline of the four the work is done the plan was successful the fire is settled and rains over its realms fires the element that stands for at zulah the world closest to divinity and through the card and though the card might talk of every possible endeavor a job or relationship and intellectual research it is most likely aiming at something more spiritual this explains the upcoming of the card in such seemingly inappropriate situations like big family troubles or failed business projects here by the card shows us that we've learned a lesson and the failure in the profane world was just what we needed to achieve more spiritual maturity seems to work with your trip yeah so the completion of my my ego death it's the understanding that you're maybe you're that you're learning that instead of trying to rearrange the people around you you need to start working on your interior internal self there you go cool so there we go hail satan just kidding some people think tarot cards are evil it's so funny it's like it's so weird how creeped out people get can get by this stuff when in fact it's just like just beautiful ways it's just screens that you use to sort of see the deeper parts of yourself projected on the world you know it's not really the occult it's just seeing what's in you all the time right that's interesting i i started saying before like when we when the when the mic was off that i was really i was really surprised by how many devils and angels i saw when i was tripping because i don't i don't ever i'm not worried to i don't consider myself like i don't know how do i say this i'm not i grew up in a really religious family but i was never afraid of the devil and i was never i never thought in those terms like i don't know no it it's you know yeah like i like i never like had any association with a goat of mendez which is what or mendies however you say which is what this being is behind me but when i was tripping i saw it everywhere and so it's like i think it's kind of like um you know this is where you get into coral young and the idea of like we have we do have an ecosystem of symbols inside of us and even if you weren't even if your conscious mind wasn't uh drawn towards the story of the devil and the story of god some deeper part of yourself adopted that as a way to understand the universe because you're defenseless when you're a kid and they start pouring that stuff into your brain you're defenseless you know let's see so you see your or or or that's just that's a kind of like sad way to look at it a deep way to look at it is that these are like actual atomic components of the human psyche that manifest all over the planet in different symbols but the symbols all represent the same thing right so here we have the devil maybe in india you might have mara the god of death who tempted um who tempted buddha or maybe you have some uh you have uh and the ramayana um shit what's that god that fuck there's an evil demon king that tortured the hanuman anyway the point i can't really i can't remember his name anyway the point is there's a lot of symbols for the very same thing and and and but that thing is what exists primary to language in the human brain and then it wears the the outfit of the symbol and so that's why when you're tripping suddenly you see these symbols because they're always there just under the surface right i wonder i'm about to see my my dad in a couple of days for thanksgiving and my dad is a my dad's a preacher and i wish i wish there was a way for me to talk to him about this stuff can you not no he's so um he's so anti-drug in a really like extreme way that he would he would be uh just very upset by the other mushroom it's so sad that our preachers are against drugs it's just the worst our shamans are like they're it's like it's like people who are supposed to be starting fires afraid of uh matches is what the fuck right yeah it's like you're you're afraid of a goddamn thing that by the way you know your whole religion is probably uh represents mushrooms you know about this there's the you've ever heard of the book by john marco allegro called uh the sake i think it's john marco allegro it's called the sacred mushroom in the cross no i don't know how christianity started off as a mushroom cult and they use ancient murals from churches where it shows in the garden of eden it shows the tree of life as a silica as a cubensis as a mushroom have you ever seen these pictures yeah i don't i don't even talk about yeah so it's like it's so weird that these fucking preachers they get so far separated from the original truth of the religion that they're teaching that they don't even understand that the sacrament that they're supposed to be ingesting is the fucking mushrooms that's also my dad's just personal background because of family history or whatever scared of it because of heroin and stuff and the addictive drugs he he uses in the category of drugs he just piles everything except for coffee and probably alcohol right stays in some other category yeah yeah i don't know how are you doing i'm great i'm doing great yeah i feel really good i'm i'm overcoming a cold which is really nice and i feel pretty good thank you for asking i don't know i'm great i've i'm getting it's i'm a weekend a single life getting used to that again how is that you know it's it's i gotta say it's it's not that bad right now and uh i'm i'm actually kind of like disconcerted because i expected more of a sort of um generally when i get out of a relationship i don't know but it's been kind of strung out right so yeah this was a kind of bumpy bumpy ride so i think it was sort of you know i'm a little embarrassed by the way it ended and i wish that i had uh been a little more like kind but uh it's not one of those cool breakups that you brag about like what no i i'm just kidding but just like oh yeah embarrassed by the way it's like no one's like hey i gotta tell you oh yeah this breakup was great we went we went dancing listened to classical music gave each other roses kissed each other on the cheek my heart was filled with love and we both went dancing into the horizon not even looking back at each other was wonderful like those breakups uh i get that i get when people when people tell me that like they had a really great un-messy breakup i hate it it's not yeah no shit it's like i mean un-messy like i guess i've had breakups that are that are un that are un-messy in the way a dog getting euthanized is un-messy or like just falls asleep it just turns into a lifeless bit of meat that used to be some glowing fire of love like i've had that or sometimes they in like a car accident where you're like standing in the street looking at your dead family screaming at the sky or sometimes you know you never know yeah but yeah this one this one wasn't it ended it was it ended in texting which is always bad like it's a text end was it like a heightened text end or was it like was the to the conversation build to a breakup or was it do does that question make sense the conversation built to a breakup yeah okay so it was like a string of it wasn't like good morning and then it wasn't exactly good morning it was like it started not great and then it just sort of like spiraled into like a breakup and and you know if you're if you're if like if things are that bad that is text string will cause a breakup like fucking thing was in it was over that's a that's a thing that's already dead uh so maybe that's why i don't feel so bad but um i don't know i feel good about it and i feel um uh i don't know i keep waiting like every morning i wake up kind of with this wince like okay am i gonna get slammed by depression and regret today over this and it hasn't happened yet like i'm because you know sometimes like you'll have a delayed effect right the poison won't start interacting with your body until later but nothing nothing nothing that's great is it good good so yeah it's good that doesn't mean i'm a sociopath no i think it means that you probably already dealt with the the pain like in your back and forth like in the in between stage when you were feeling regret or you're feeling bad or you were because you you were you were sad you were upset i think you the last time this happened yeah i was wrecked yeah so you did it you did it then you you already mourned the relationship it sounds like this last thing was just a you you were just trying you know in a way maybe maybe you guys were both just trying to make yourselves uh not feel any pain just have a have a final like let's let's let's remember why this wasn't a good thing yeah right like let's like i mean it was it's my you know it's it's this is my fault because i ended i mean i i i basically begged her to get back together with me after i'd broken up with her last time like i would say literally not bait like literally i've been there that's what let's let's just say that i a lot of restaurants wondered why the asshole was crying like a couple of dinners ended with tears for me as i tried to express my regret yeah so that was dumb uh that's the worst i've been there that's what's a bad bad selfish place to be selfish selfish selfish and you you gave me advice earlier when you're like don't what are you doing don't give it time don't contact her and i just sort of the thought well i'm just gonna do it and i did it and so that was i think that was a prime mistake that was a mistake but um i don't know was it a mistake i i don't know i mean are you i mean if i if if if her feelings didn't exist i'd say no it seems fine you're doing great i mean you did wait you know but i mean how's she doing do you have any idea like if she's i don't know wrecked i don't know yeah i don't know i i do think you know you know it's that's a it was kind of a selfish move but maybe but that doesn't mean that it was bad or anything that doesn't make you bad we all do selfish terrible things no one no one is a good person when it comes to like love and how are you so good at this this is in your podcast this is like you're like legendary for is someone who's like a relationship oh counselor how did you get so good at this do you have time by the way it's yeah oh i don't i have plenty oh it's it's uh 228 oh i'm good yeah yeah yeah so how do you how did you get so good at this um well thank you um i i think when i was a kid like i didn't have any romantic relationships until pretty late like 17 and i mean like any sort of like crush or i had crushes but like no like no childhood romances or anything and i from a very young age we came like really i really was obsessed with relationships and why people fall in love and why people choose certain people and so when i was really young i would go to the library a lot and and check out you know dr spock books and so but that's that's a child ring who am i thinking of um um dr ruth sure she's good at it yeah like it started with that and then i i got really into body language stuff and college and the art of flirting and because i didn't because i didn't understand it because no one liked me and so like i had to i really wanted to to get good at it and then when i started having relationships like my relationships have always this is kind of unfortunate and in some ways it's it's fine it's fine because you know i can't change it and it is just my personal history but my life like always my relationships have been like the most important thing in my life always yeah and i mean i dropped out of college for a boyfriend yeah like my my whole everything is is trying to not let my relationship be the most important thing and to not let boyfriends be the most important thing and so you know when i as as an like in my early 20 have you achieved that goal not letting my boyfriend be the my relationship be the most important thing um i think that i've become more i'm more balanced now i think that i'm it's not i'm not as manic as i used to be in that area like i used to just like i i mean i i've done i've done some really like shitty and crazy things in relationships and i've always i'm never i'm not a moderate person and so my my struggle or like my my my journey and i think kind of where i am now is that i'm i'm more i'm okay with normalcy and with like with my boyfriend now like luckily dan is so dan is obviously so smart and yeah like he's able to for those of you don't know uh Aaron's boyfriend is dan harmon who is on the podcast before the last one so right yeah so he's like even though like he he has all these like crazy tendencies like i do like he has presence of mind to say to me like especially in the beginning of our relationship like hey like he's also 12 years older than me and that helps him saying hey look everything's fine you are you are having this like this really extreme reaction because you're putting this relationship at the at the center of your life and it it shouldn't be in the middle it should be around the the the perimeter wow you know smart yeah he i can't do that yeah it's it's hard um i relationships for me always become the golden cow it's like they become this giant idol with glowing eyes that lives in the middle of my brain and i am just constantly bringing offerings of fear and time and and anxiety to the thing and it just eats it up and eyes glow brighter and it's like no matter what i'll be walking along a path beautiful day with my dog completely alone yeah everything's just the garden of Eden and this thing in my brain is just like bring me fear are you'll lose your love you're losing your love today it's the worst how do you not do that i i i really feel like maybe it's better for me to just be alone because i because i think maybe i just have this malfunction where there's no i don't think so i think i mean i don't i don't know why that happens because i do that i do that too like i'm getting i'm getting better at it but i mean it doesn't take a lot for me to be like everything in my relationship is great everything's fine we live together we have a dog yeah everything's fine but i will it doesn't take a lot for me to be sitting alone like working on something at home and i'll start to think uh god like why i mean does he does he love me i don't know like think about that thing i i don't know i don't know if he loves me at it oh and then i'll just spiral and then i'll send him a text that's like some crazy text like why did you do and he's in the middle of work he's like what am i getting this this crazy this crazy text and i don't i don't know i try to figure out like why that is but that doesn't really help me cope with that part of myself but it's probably and i don't know if you had a similar experience but like i like i had a really rough relationship with my mom growing up and then she died when i was a teenager so i don't i don't i don't want to say i have an abandonment issues or anything but i'm always testing somebody to see if they actually love me that's what i do and that and inevitably the test fails right yeah i can convince somebody yeah don't fucking love me at all because the idea is you're like god damn it just show me that you're gonna love me no matter what i do right that's what you want that sense of embrace like god damn it just like just fucking don't try to teach me a lesson just give me a just show me that i i'm i i'm fine yeah that's what you want yeah and they don't understand that and they shouldn't have to understand that it's not their job to understand that they should be able to they should expect non-gamesmanship they should expect things right on the level i suppose but i mean come on what planet are you living on we're all insane right i think like for me the thing the thing that made the big difference is uh changing how i what i think a relationship is and that's like dan dan being 12 years older and having and and and being more wise than i am has is really he's really taught me that a relationship like i realized that the way that i was seeing my relationships was was this this intense dramatic back and forth this big story this opera like and and and i was i was choosing people that were doing that and i was i was i was doing that and starting all the this this stuff and not necessarily like starting a drama but even like it's dramatic i mean something that i do that i've always done is is is give really extravagant gifts and not i don't mean like gold but i i mean like really intense gifts like i published a book for dan last i was there it was awesome right yeah so that was so fun and i love that but even even that and that's that's a fun thing but always for my boyfriends i've always i've always done that i've always and and that's even that is like bringing drama or like bringing like like making the relationship this god you know so in the same boat oh my god i mean i'm usually a broke piece of shit and i'm not able to do anything for anyone but this last one yeah man it was like yeah big big gifts and it's another test too it's a test like hey i i spent hours and hours making this thing can you accept that like does that do you still love me is that can you handle my love yeah like it's it's a or it's just a way because you want to like it's a way like you give them this nice thing not because you want them to be happy with the thing that you're giving them but because you want something out of them you're like trying to juice them for something right that's selfish so weirdly it's this selfish gift giving because really you're not giving them this thing because you're like hey you know what i think you would really fucking love this ipad i'll make you so happy to be able to use it you're thinking like if i give you this i bet you're gonna really love me more yeah trickery it's trickery it's trickery of the most basic sore it's so sad i mean i i know that dan listen to your podcast like that that uh i mean that that book gift was like that came from a really came from a good place i definitely i wasn't thinking about your book oh no no all i thought when i you were giving the book gift to to dan was like my god if i could only experience one that much worse this kind of love from anything on earth one yeah i i uh yeah it came from a good place but i certainly got off on knowing that he was going to look at it and be so and i and this is also i mean i did the same thing with my parents have done this like with boyfriends everything just like hey like like i'm fucking amazing yeah look how i put together this thing and i and i spent all these hours it's the same thing like with my cakes or anything else like i just need and and this is this is like a this is this is a standard like kids kids that were rewarded for being quote unquote gifted or like excelling in school and i'm always trying to recreate you know the writing contest i won in the third grade or right you know because my parent that's how my parents like showed their love for me it was anytime that i like accomplished something cool like that or was or when i was like put in a gifted class or like bumped up a grade or like that was that was the that's where i got all my love but the thing is the trick is to to to really think about what what you think a relationship is because it's the the better thing like better than high drama and better than like showing up in the middle of the night or breaking into your ex-boyfriend's house which is something that that i've done yes um that that was that was my time when i had i had broken up i broke up with my boyfriend absolutely destroyed him and then he started dating someone else and then i was like gotta get him back yeah and i still had a key to our old apartment and broke into the apartment just because i couldn't get a hold of him and i had to convince myself that something was wrong and there was like another girl there it was so embarrassing um you can hear about that story on my podcast episode episode of steve green my ex-boyfriend um that's so wild that you had him on your podcast i did not listen to that episode we hadn't talked in five years there'll be a link to that episode if you go on the comment section of this podcast just click on the link and you'll see a link to the to that podcast but it's it's so cool to like to to redefine what you think a relationship is to just oh this is this is a partner and this is somebody who if if you start thinking i think what saved me was was Dan saying look we're going to be together forever like i said that very early on like very sweet very sweet when we would get it and you can't expect that from from everyone to say that to you because it is like kind of like it's a strange thing comforting and sweet though really he knew exactly what to say i mean that's such that's exactly what you want to hear it's like yes yeah yeah what a relief thank you maybe like i think it's possible like if he hadn't said that to me like if dan and i ever broke up for any reason i i think that the the next person that i was with you if you imagine i'm going to be not in a way that you like stop noticing what's going on in your relationship but if you are with somebody who you really like and you assume in your head that you're going to be with them forever you really chill out when it comes to needing certain things from them and needing drama and whatever because what's better than all of that crazy drama and getting back together and breaking up and like that emotional high with so much better than that is being able to sit and like read next to them while they're playing a game or just just be with somebody where you feel like you're just you you're you're totally yourself with this one person who's like your teammate like that that's so much better than any drama and whatever that's you know what you just described you just described uh spirituality yeah you just because the difference is the idea is like in in religion or in if you can get over the idea that this is just one little incarnation that you're going to have and understand that you are an infinite being that takes on the clothes of so many countless bodies and that you have that you can just give up the idea that in this little body you're going to take over the planet and transform everything into some kind of garden of Eden that you're going to be the most successful thing or the happiest thing or the richest thing if you can just drop all that drama then you can really start enjoying life instead of trying to like you know make life enjoy you yeah yeah yeah that's cool man i see i love what you're talking about it but there's still a little piece of me that hears that and thinks uh boring i want the drama you know i want it but i'm getting sick of it but i want it but i say well you'll still you'll still get it like you still like no matter what you still get it at the beginning of a relationship no matter what it's just like that transition that's the hard thing that transition that's the hardest yeah it's really hard and it's confusing because you you when you transition from like getting like first getting to know someone and everything being really exciting and i had a really hard time with that with dan because when we started dating like he he was so he was so into me and like told me he loved me really early on and it was like so sweet so sweet and so sweeping and exciting and and he like i've never felt more worshiped so then when it when that when it transitioned from that to just being normal i really was like oh he doesn't love me anymore like what is happening like do you not do you not like me is this not like what's what's going on and like getting getting over that was a big deal but now it feels like i'm i'm almost there i'm almost like i'm almost cool you're almost sober basically like you're just you're talking about getting over an addiction to a specific type of drug which is your brain secretes in the beginning of a relationship and then yeah

198^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Catherine Powers Transcript and Discussion^2016-10-28^Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hey friends, it's me, Duncan, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Let's start off with a trivia question. Who out there can identify this commercial? He documents the facts and it covers what people were never willing to talk about. Stonehenge, a visitor fashions a wire antenna in the shape of an ancient Egyptian symbol. He points it at the stones and a surge of power rushes into his arm, knocking him unconscious. Was it all in his mind or was it much more than that? Do you remember what that's from? If you do, you're old. That's from Time Life, Mysteries of the Unknown. It was a series they released, an amazing series. I had a subscription to it and that piece of the commercial really stuck out to me. The idea that there were places like Stonehenge that had extra psychic energy that would somehow shoot into a coat hanger, that was kind of mind blowing to me and made me want to go to Stonehenge. I think I actually asked my mom if we could go to Stonehenge just so that I could hold a coat hanger in front of it. But I do think there are certain places on this planet that have some kind of unquantifiable metaphysical energy surrounding them and people have different ways of describing these places. Some people call them energy vortexes. Some people call them haunted. I think one of the best descriptions of this phenomena comes from the movie The Shining. I can remember when I was a little boy that my grandmother and I could hold conversations entirely without ever opening our mouths. She called it shiny. You know, some places are like people. Some shine and some don't. Some places do shine, friends. I've been to a few of them. One of them is a place called Varanasi. It's in India and Varanasi is known as the city of burning and learning. It's where millions of Hindus are cremated every year and their ashes are thrown into the Ganges River. If you go to that city there's a never-ending smoky barbecue smell which is the smell of these people being incinerated and there is an undeniable energy at Varanasi. When you go there you feel like you're in some kind of surreal dream. Everything seems kind of familiar but it also feels like you're on an alien planet. It's really one of the most beautiful places on planet earth if you can get used to the fact that you're constantly inhaling smoke from bodies being incinerated but you don't have to go to Stonehenge. You don't have to go to Varanasi if you want to experience one of these places of power because they're everywhere and they're not always surrounded by ancient cities or neolithic monuments. Sometimes people have constructed bars on top of them and one of these places is known as the Florabama. The Florabama is a roadhouse in Perdido Key, Florida. It's very close to the border of Florida and Alabama. It is frequented and sung about by various country stars and I don't know what would happen if you stood in front of the Florabama with a coat hanger but my guess would be someone would bring you one of their bushwhackers which is way more powerful than any kind of psychic energy currently being emanated by Stonehenge. These drinks contain thousands of bottles of rum per drink and they just taste like sweet coffee things. They're dangerous and wonderful. We wandered into the Florabama during one of their free bingo sessions. They have bingo at the Florabama on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays between 1 and 4 o'clock. In this particular bingo session was being hosted by a woman named Catherine Powers and she was really funny and really fascinating in telling all these crazy stories about Willie Nelson and hanging out with Merle Haggard. She was really funny, really entertaining and as I was throwing back bushwhackers and enjoying this bingo session as though I were watching some really great comedy show, I realized that she would be the perfect guest for the podcast. After she was done calling bingo, I walked up to her, told her that I had a podcast and asked if she would be on it the next day. She agreed to do the podcast and then she pointed to a poster on the stage behind her of a country singer named Freddie Powers and said, do you know who Freddie Powers is? And I didn't and she said, well, today was his birthday and I just want you to Google search him when you get home so that we'll have something to talk about tomorrow. So I went home, Google searched Freddie Powers and discovered that I had accidentally wandered into the floor of Bama on the birthday of a legend who had recently, just a few months before, left this universe. Here's a clip from a Freddie Powers song. You pick me up off the ground You never one time let me down You put me on a natural high And I can fly I can fly That's Freddie Powers everybody and that is from his album, The Country Jazz Singer Collector's Edition. Freddie Powers produced Willie Nelson's Over the Rainbow album and he also wrote a bunch of hit songs from Merle Haggard. Freddie Powers ended up getting Parkinson's disease and Catherine Powers stayed with him to the very end and this interview today is really a love story about an incredible romance that happened between two truly amazing human beings and much thanks to the floor of Bama for allowing me to record it in your magical establishment. We're going to jump right into this interview but first some quick business.

bender and if it's true then we are the surviving members of many different sorts of human like creatures that used to frolic around the planet until we the homo sapiens figured out a way to wipe them

long have you been in charge of bingo at the flor abama actually i am basically a fill in i fill in for them ever from time to time and um so it's just you know i'm not really a regular on the bingo but i pretty much have had it for the last couple of weeks and i'll have it for the first part of next week but then i head out to colorado um we'll be doing a little tribute out there for my husband freddy and then on um november the 19th i go up to nashville for the final service wow which they'll be paying tribute to freddy mack nasty powers because on april the first freddy was famous for having a dirty joke night at john rich's house which is up on mount richmore at the top of a love circle there in nashville tennessee do you remember his favorite dirty joke oh my gosh he had so many dirty jokes it was unreal any come to mind um oh let's see the what about him um he asked it was the preacher it asked one time he said is anybody in here ever seen a ghost and this guy in the back room raises up his hand and he said great well is anybody in here ever had sex with a ghost that guy holds his hand up again he said well come on down here and tell us about having sex with a ghost he said ghost i thought you said goat that's a great okay that's cool but you you you um when you were doing the bingo show we walked in yesterday and uh you're so funny you you seem like a performer yourself and or like you you have been performing for a really long time yes i have um actually uh like i said i started out in modeling and um so i did a lot of that and then well how long did you model for well i basically on and off pretty much in and out my whole life but um when i got out to south lake tahoe i became what they called a ring model and so which was basically i was on the floor and i was assisting the auctioneer or if they had a boxing match i would get my five and a half inch heels and walk around and do those you're a ring girl i'm a ring girl you had to you had to hold i hold you up the little round one yeah i have a question about that okay because i know maybe people see that and they think that's easy but to me i look at i think that seems terrifying because it is very terrifying especially when you're in a bikini and you've got five inch high heels on and the first thing you you don't want to do is fall down yeah up there on that stage so yeah you're walking around and you're really kind of nervous but not to mention you're cold too right yeah the air conditioned those places yeah so you're standing back there and you're freezing to death and you gotta go out there yeah so you were a ring girl when was this uh let's see it would have been let's see what was it about 87 and 88 87 yeah yeah so where were you living when you were doing that that was south lake tahoe south lake tahoe yes i actually um was an auctioneer and a model for a fashion show called the ritz fashion show and so that's where i kind of went from there and took some courses in some commercial acting and that's when i started getting in and doing a few of the little movies and commercials so you started auditioning for stuff yeah what what was the class you took it was it was actually just a commercial acting class right because i was involved in where was it it was in reno nevada okay through the nevada casting agency i see and that was who i was signed with so you started going out on commercial auditions movie auditions yes i did a few commercials for the casinos and stuff like that right and then um like i said i've been in several different movies of course i started out you know for extra it was like in the pink Cadillac i was an extra in that and moved on up till i finally got me a good little part there in the ty cob story with tommy lee jones wow like i said i'm probably the only person in the world that can actually say they've been shot by tommy lee jones how how many did you have to audition for that or was that friends you had no i was um actually with the nevada casting agency there at arena nevada so i got hired on a lot of things and actually you know i've been there and working with them for so long that i made it up to first call so whenever they had anything to come in i was on that first call list so i had the first call opportunities when did you meet freddy how did how did all of this oh god that is how did you cross paths well that's kind of funny because i was actually dating his son's best friend whoa but um we weren't doing that great and i do we weren't gonna be a last but and um so his son's best friend yes at some point brought you well actually well actually what happened freddy jr had walked in one day and he said hey this is my dad's new album well he ends it to me of course i looked at the picture and the first thing i did i went that's who i've been looking for my whole life it was just absolutely gorgeous and i always to me i always i grew up saying that when i'm with my man i want us to look like a good looking couple together right and i was like he and i would look real good together so you had you had an intuition yeah i i did i fell in love with him on that picture and then one had you heard of him before i'm not really you know i my father had that was what was so funny my father was a huge fan of my husbands at the time freddy so that's what was so funny but um actually freddy jr came in one morning and he said hey my dad just called and invited us up on the house both of y'all want to go well of course my mind was like yes and i just got a brand new camaro and i went we can go in my car so we went up and it didn't take us but a few minutes to realize that he and i was a team and wow we have been a team and we were nine days short of 31 years wow so this you had a moment on a houseboat yes with a legend yes where you fell in love i immediately i hung on every word i was just clung to him all day long and he actually at the time had another girlfriend oh no she was a jazz singer out there and rino and i really didn't think i'd have a chance with him but it was funny because he started coming to my fashion shows okay and he was but the deal was is he was bringing a date another girl well on that houseboat did you did you guys kiss or anything or was there no actually it was one of those things that that evening we've been hanging out all day together and we were going to get up to the marina to get some more beer and on the way back he reaches out and puts his arm around me and he said you know i think you and i'd make a great team and i just melted i was just like but then all of a sudden i looked up and there was my boyfriend at the time standing on the boat so i kind of had to act like i didn't even hear what he said and ignored it and all that but every time he came into lake tahoe i was there i i would manage to sit beside him i didn't care if i had to move his girlfriend out of the way i was sitting by him there was just no way to stop this no way to stop it he and i was meant to be together and we were together how long before that happened how long before he broke up with his girlfriend and you broke up oh it was probably just a couple of months a couple months and he uh he was actually we had gone to a george strait concert and um freddy had taken several of us and we was all standing backstage and freddy said well i've got a booth out here he said if anybody wanted to join me well nobody was saying anything and i went i do because i was like this is going to be my first time to be alone with him so he and i went and sat out front and um he started of course people were coming over and getting his autograph and all this stuff and he looks over and he goes and by the way this is kathryn quarry and at the time when it was kathryn quarry and um so people started looking at me as if i was somebody and they started getting my autograph cool they thought that they had recognized me and this going oh yeah we know who she is can we get your autograph nobody knew who i was did he think that was funny oh yeah he thought it was funny and um so we that night was our first night to get together and he invited me up to the house both that weekend and we were together ever since and so when you guys got together when you fell in love he was already oh well oh yeah he was already a well-known star and matter of fact at that time murall haggard was wanting to take a break from the road the road and so freddy still wanted he had a band and he wanted to keep him working so he needed a booking agent well i was already in that casino realm doing these fashion shows so i kind of knew all of the entertainment directors all up and down the circuit so um i told him i said hey um i can work on booking you and i thought this was another opportunity for me to get to be a little bit closer with him so i actually started out and i became his booking agent he must have liked that you had just found out about him that you weren't necessarily a fan no i wasn't my like i said my father was a huge fan when i called my dad this is so funny because i called my father and i said daddy you're not gonna believe where i am and i said i'm sitting here on the houseboat with murall haggard and freddy powers and he was like he got all excited and he was jumping up down saying oh baby girl i'm so happy he said that would be just like me getting to meet my heroes and he's going on and on about how they were his heroes but he ended the conversation with but my baby girl you keep your little ass away from them because my daddy knew all the stories about murall and freddy and all the women womanizing and all that listen as a father it's like a combat it's kind of the worst thing that can happen is that you hear that your daughter is on a houseboat with your heroes yeah but you're there your heroes that you're going to keep yourself away from them because these are outlaws yeah i mean they're oh yeah these are legendary oh absolutely partying outlaws absolutely definitely it must have been a bittersweet moment for your dad yeah yes and but of course my dad when i finally took him out to meet my parents um they fell in love with him and everything but the funny thing about it is well let me ask you really okay what was that like the drive over to to bring him to meet your parents that must have been a really cool drive it was a very cool drive but at the same time it was nerve-wracking because um my daddy was very old-fashioned right so living with a guy to him was called shacking up right so i'm i knew we were going to my parents house and we were going to be spending the weekend at my parents so i was really nervous because i didn't know how it was going to work out sure but the sleeping arrangements was going to be so when we got there and that night we started talking to you know my mother was like okay freddy we've got your room set up over here well i knew right then i was going to have my own bedroom and freddy was going to be back there my little brother's bedroom so i so i knew i didn't question it and i didn't say anything but the next day my daddy was really cool about it he goes well i know you two been living together he said i guess you live together here too so the next night they let me sleep that was freddy yeah that was the acceptance yeah it was finally the acceptance yeah what if freddy think of it i mean this is he's a you know he's a touring country legend and he's come to visit someone's family and now he has to sleep in a separate bedroom that must have seemed really funny to him well he thought it was but you know what freddy was he was still from those old-fashioned days himself so he had a lot of respect for it and all that yeah and he had a lot of respect for my father even though he was older than my father wow and that was a funny story because freddy had led me to believe he let somebody else tell me that he was 49 at the time i was 31 and i'm going 49 31 that's not a big deal what's the number you know but it wasn't until i went to a doctor's visit with freddy that i found out that he was actually 54 wow and when his nurse came in and said oh freddy you've got a birthday coming up next week october the 13th 1931 and all of a sudden i looked over and i went my daddy was born in 34 so my husband was actually older than both my parents too late as too late i was hooked eyes and love and there was no going back you would have fallen in love no matter how old no matter how old it did but you know even when freddy passed it's amazing because freddy passed and yesterday would have been his 85th birthday that's right and he passed away three months ago he did not have a single wrinkle he had every bit of his hair and all of his teeth and so at 85 people were still or 84 people were still walking in and freddy didn't look much older than 60 wow so when we got together i mean people at that time was thinking that i look like i was 15 and he looked like he was still in his 20s and 30s that's something that's always confused me and i know people say genetics but you run into people who and i don't know how if i'm just assuming if freddy was friends with willy nelson oh yeah i'm assuming he didn't he wasn't necessarily like a sober fellow right he freddy yeah well actually you know by the time i got with him um the whole partying days they kind of basically were over um yeah he and moral haggard and willy and all of them did go through the the cocaine days but one day i mean when you say cocaine days yeah i bet us mortals can't imagine what that's like well you know in the in the mid 80s i mean that was basically the drug of choice sure pretty much everybody was doing that but it's on it's not it's not just the drug it's that here is someone touring with people who at the time and still are considered basically human gods like you don't willy nelson yeah haggard these are that's the top that is the peak of the pyramid yeah and so to to to be in that vortex of people writing songs for them yeah you are also a human god and so when you say a cocaine period i don't think anyone can imagine what that must be like to be at the center of that yeah it was it was a pretty wild one and but um the deal was is one day moral haggard walked in to freddy and they were both getting ready to do a line and moral looked at freddy and he said freddy he said you know when you do that stuff you're an asshole wow and freddy looked back at moral and he said well so are you so they decided right then they blew that those two lines off blew them off the table cool and decided they would never do it again so they didn't ever get that stupid yeah yeah matter of fact freddy always said that if the government had a never lied about marijuana he said chances are he would have never done cocaine right he said but when the government lied about marijuana and had everybody thinking that people were going mad and yeah you know killing people and all this stuff off of marijuana and then the first time he tried it he realized that that was not so then of course because they lied about that well then he figured well heck they must be lying about the cocaine right so of course they got into that cocaine and freddy said actually it was really the worst thing in the world especially for men because you got all the women but you couldn't do nothing with them right yeah yeah it is a paradox in that way and it is a stupid drug ultimately it really is definitely and he does he called it the biggest lie and um actually like I said freddy and I have a book coming out along with our co-writer by the name of jake brown that will hit the shelves in february of 2017 and it's called the spree of 83 and the stories are all about freddy and murl living up there on those houseboats and there's some commentary in there from willy nelson and people like uh john rich and people like that so what was the houseboat like the houseboat our houseboat um because a lot of people say that they lived in a houseboat together well no it was actually two two separate houseboats murl hangard had his three-decker houseboat it was three decks actually on his second floor was where his hot tub room and it almost looked like a you know a hooker's room with all the red and the white you know the lace and all that and then he had um a crow's nest that he built up on top and the only reason he built that is because murl had tried to put some side rails along the side of his boat well it made it too wide so of course they came in and um forest rangers and all that and told him that he had to take the guard rails off well murl being um he was what you call you know kind of defiant and rebellious and so when they made him do that he ended up taking the boat taller so he put the crow's nest on top that's so cool but the one thing about our both our houseboats is we had ours was a 57 foot houseboat and we also had um 80 gallons of solar hot water on top cool and it's also was freddy was known as the only aircraft carrier on the lake because freddy had built an ultralight and he put it on pontoons well living out on the lake you had to have a place to put your airplane so they ended up building a hydraulic lift on the back of freddy's boat freddy built an airplane yes he built an airplane while murl haggard sat there and watched him what yes what incarnation are you having right now this is crazy yeah you are living on a houseboat next to murl haggard and and your husband was your husband at the time yes no we wasn't at we weren't married at that time just just but basically but soulmate your soulmate yeah was making an airplane he built an ultralight airplane um well freddy had always been interested in flying and always wanted to fly so he built this airplane and it was called the natural high and um cool now this is based on the song yes the natural high the song natural haggard yes yes yes which was a number one so freddy would taxi that airplane up to the back of the houseboat right up on the hydraulic lift and then they would set that airplane right up on top of the houseboat so freddy was what they called the only aircraft carrier on lake shasta and the name of his boat was the ussf boat wow and murals was known as the hotel troubadour wow but we also all had fishing holes in our living rooms so when we wanted to fish we didn't have to go outside and sit in the heat or in the rain we would just pull the plug up out of the middle of the living room floor and sit there and fish did you have a tv there oh yeah so you could watch tv and oh we sat and watched tv and fish one time they had a bass tournament out there it was a murals haggard bass tournament and the night before a friend of mine cindy thompson and i was out there and a thomas and um we were fishing and she was on one end and i was in the other end and all these guys were warming up fishing in the middle well cindy and i was catching all the fish and these guys weren't catching anything so the next morning i grabbed my rod reel and i was going to go out there and fish and this guy turned around and he goes oh no you're not he goes you get back in the kitchen where the women belong not knowing i had the fishing hole in there so of course i did i went back in there to my kitchen per se yeah pulled my plug and i sit there and i ended up catching the biggest catfish of the day so it's like go ahead send me to the kitchen where women belong i still out fish you that isn't how dirt how i would just think how messy does it when you pull a fishing doesn't it flop all over the floor well no because we had it all sit up you know we it's it was all nicely set up wow so yeah that sounds like they called me they called me ellie bay out there on the lake because i was one who loved to feed the animals so i'd go around and collect everybody scraps all day long and then i would go over to the the other side of the cove and feed the animals well i also had all these trained fish every night i could drop my light down in the fishing hole and these fish would come up and they would almost come the carps would almost come right up out of the water and take the fish food right out of my hand wow so it's like i had my trained fish and i was like you can't catch it in my trained fish how long did you live in that houseboat i was blessed with it for about three years but freddy and murall lived out there for good eleven half twelve years twelve years and his idea was it in the beginning it was murals matter of fact murall was already living on the houseboat when he had met freddy and murall ended up buying freddy a houseboat he and freddy had got together was this is i'm sorry this is after freddy wrote a number one no no no at this time so he just recognized matter of fact at the time murall wasn't even familiar with freddy's songwriting he knew freddy as the guitar player and the funny story about it is freddy and murall actually met the first time in 1961 and at that time murall haggard was not the murall haggard we knew him today he was a bass player for a gentleman by the name of win stewart so he was playing bass for win stewart and freddy was playing down the street and freddy was a dixieland jazz band and it was called the powerhouse four and it was three banjos and a tuba yeah everybody goes three banjos and a tuba so murall was going down and listening to freddy and they were taking turns they kind of got to know each other throughout the war it was actually a 13 day gig and they was going back and forth well at the end of that 13 days they went their own separate race they never stayed in contact they didn't get back together again until it was actually willy nelson because freddy was actually one of the first persons to ever get radio play for willy nelson on a song and it was called heartaches of a fool so freddy was actually the first person to record and get a radio play for a song for willy nelson and then he ended up producing the somewhere over the rainbow album so it just so happened and this is about 78 79 um willy nelson was playing at harrah's murall hagar was playing across the street at the at cesars and this was all up in south lake tahoe and freddy was playing down the street at a little place called the lake side end well willy had um called freddy and murall over to come and join him and hang out well by this time now murall hagar's famous now when freddy first met him in 1961 he was just a bass player so they sit there and they started visiting still not realizing because murall was making the connection neither was freddy because now freddy was no longer playing banjo he was playing guitar and because freddy had incorporated his banjo style into his guitar now they don't know they've met so murall really liked freddy's style of rhythm guitar playing because it was very unusual and it was hard driven well how unusual well like i said he and it incorporated his banjo chords and banjo licks and that banjo riffs and everything into the guitar so at the time murall was wanting to learn to play lead guitar he was a rhythm guitar and he wanted to be able to play lead so in order to do that he would have to of course have somebody that could play rhythm as good as him if not better and of course that's where freddy came along so after a couple of days of being up there in south lake toa playing together and if you murall told you the story he would say they played for 16 hours yes they didn't stop playing they didn't stop playing and then all the sudden willy looked down at the clock and realized it was time for them to go back to work it just seems like freddy had this effect on certain people that was he he really did and um and i guess he would freddy would always contribute that to a gentleman by the name of paul paul buskert paul buskert um actually it was the mentor for willy nelson and freddy powers okay so they both contribute their style of playing and and everything to paul busker and everything what's the everything well it's like the style of songwriting basically the instrumentation paul buskert he was a big fan of a gentleman by the name of jango rinehart okay and so i don't know if you know anything about jango rinehart i do a tiny little a little bit well you know that's a plan that was what paul buskert was really that's jazz right that's that's that yeah and so so jango rinehart precedes busker yes so jango jango rinehart was the busker what busker was to powers that's absolutely the truth yeah this is the lineage right it's the lineage it's coming down so you know naturally when merle and you know he like i said he wanted to learn to play lead so having somebody like freddy rhythm guitar it was what he was looking for so for the next few months freddy and merle were taking turns driving back and forth catching up with each other in south lake tahoe and redding california that was where merle's houseboat was up on lake shasta so after a couple of months of doing this and see they still have not remembered they met each other in 61 yet crazy so merle says to freddy said freddy why don't you get you a houseboat move up here and live next door to me said i'll put you right next door because merle on the marina there was the silver thorn resort and marina well of course freddy looked at him he said merle i'm not as famous you i don't have the kind of money you got right but merle looked back at him and said well freddy that's the one thing i got and so 85 000 later merle hager to bought freddy a houseboat and parked it right next to him wow and um i mean that to do that merle recognized oh yeah inside of freddy oh yeah was something that yeah that was going to end up making a lot of great songs for him and that well like i said freddy had already produced that album on uh willy nelson the somewhere over the rainbow album and merle really liked that album and so that's what got him interested when he first met freddy first time he met freddy the first thing he said was i like what you did on willy nelson somewhere over the rainbow album so of course that gave freddy you know the confidence to be able to sit down and visit with merle and feel like he was a part of it but it was actually they were up on you know merle was playing you know working on learning how to play lead and freddy was playing rhythm for him and they got to talk about songwriting and so merle had asked him about you know songwriting and freddy had actually started telling him about some of his bad experiences because the first song freddy ever had recorded or that he had written and had recorded was with a group called the wilburn brothers and this was back in 1953 okay well the name of the song was called nothing at all and freddy said he must have titled it right because he got nothing at all and then he got ripped off he got ripped off and he got ripped off of another song called there she goes so it was so before before we keep going i'm curious when did freddy start writing when well actually freddy's sister got him interested in writing freddy's sister had already had some cuts by people like haint tomson and um eddy arnold and so freddy thought well i mean i can write too so freddy come from a family of seven children right all seven children were equally as talented and including their mother and their father their their mother with their sisters was a part of the vaudeville days back in the vaudeville shows and his father was a fiddle player and a dancer he was a tap dancer you know so freddy you know the entertainment of the music career came back when you know he was born with it was it did his family perform together uh yeah they had a family band in the whole nine yards oh my god that's you know and that was the one thing that we you know when freddy was diagnosed with parkinsons i kind of looked at him one day and i said you know freddy i said you gotta realize that you coming from a family of seven children and the lord only chose one that he gave fame and freddy became famous doing exactly what he loved to do playing music writing songs but then freddy was the one stricken with parkinsons and i was going freddy i said you could look at it this way god gave you the fame for a reason because he knew someday he was going to give you this parkinsons and he knew he could make you an example so even though freddy had been diagnosed with parkinsons even when he lost his ability to walk he had lost his ability to play guitar but freddy never gave up he's still even when we would have to i would carry him out on that stage on my back put him in the chair we would have to literally tie him in that chair so he could still sing and tell his jokes so and the very last performance that freddy had was here in 2012 and it was during the frank brown songwriters festival and he was basically at that time losing wind and was having a problem getting the words out but because he was such a legend here and been playing here for so many years and people had been a follower of his when he would fall off in the middle of the song or in the middle of the line the audience would pick it up and they would sing it foreign and um yeah i'm sit here and try not to cry but yeah it was the um it was a really beautiful final show for freddy how or why how does sound how is it that someone who is afflicted with something like that well well i think you know being an inspiration and um knowing that there was other people out there just like him and his of course freddy's first thought when they said parkinson's immediately freddy thought you know this is it it's over i'm going to give up but then when he realized they didn't have to give up and he could still keep doing what he wanted to do as long as he could so then that's when freddy became not only an inspiration in music but an inspiration in life because once freddy got out there and continued to go out there and be on that stage like i said even to the point of being tied into a chair so he couldn't continue to perform all of a sudden a lot of these young musicians that had been diagnosed with parkinsons was coming out of the woodworks and a lot of them were picking their guitars back up sorry he got choked up and um not letting it get them down so that gave freddy that made him drive even harder to go out there and still perform and show people that just because you've been afflicted with the disease does not mean that life is over you can keep going you may have to change the way you do it but you can still do it and so that's what he did yeah yeah that is amazing matter of fact he actually wrote his last song was down here on this beach um freddy has a little protege by the name of mary sarah who was actually on the voice last season and um freddy knew that it was going to be his last project so he produced an album on mary sarah and he called in all of his big time friends so he had taken this virtually unknown and called his friends and talked to men to do and duets with mary sarah so we did a 13 album i mean 13 songs on this one album with all these big legends doing duets with mary sarah and it was people like murall haggard and willy nelson and ray price what's the album called it's called bridges and it also has dolly pardon and tanya tucker and even deal sedaca is on their withers so um but like i said that was freddy's final project with mary sarah but he also wrote his last song was down here on this beach with mary sarah and a gentleman by the name of mark sherrill who wrote the oh red for blake shelson what was the song oh red oh oh dreamin it's called dreamin and um and actually it was a song that ray price when um he had he when he realized you know how sick freddy was and everything ray price and this is even after he had already been diagnosed with cancer and all that himself he said i got to do a freddy power song at least one so we sent him the song dreamin and he loved the song but ray ended up getting too sick and he passed away before he ever got to cut the song but it was called dreamin and and it still to this day has not been recorded by anybody besides mary sarah wow so i just to be with someone that long to have found a soulmate oh the love of my life and for that to go through that with someone where did you find your strength oh him because i you know it's kind of funny because i did i was not only in love with this man but i was also a fan i always laughed and teased and said i was his number one fan and i actually had a t-shirt made that said i'm freddy powers number one fan and um i just felt it was more important to actually pay my bills and but to keep fueling that bus and keep freddy out there on the road we were still going out with moral haggard trying to keep him out there we were going out with big and rich i mean i did everything i could to keep freddy is active is what i could so my strength came from wanting him to live not only quantity but a quality life still trying to do what he loved to do oh yeah you know freddy and i really did go through that period of of the anger and the depression of course you know he was depressed because he couldn't do the things he always did and i was getting depressed because i felt like i you know i i felt like i was almost in a trap situation i wanted to be able to do what he wanted to do but we couldn't and but like i said we learned how to do things different um when freddy first started losing his ability to walk i got to where i was his feet so i would prop his feet up on mine because he wouldn't i didn't want to see him go into a wheelchair yet so i would prop his feet up on top of mine and i would walk him leaning up against me with him walking on my feet and then it got to where you know i actually had to start carrying him so i would carry him like a baby and um just cradle him in my arms and carried him everywhere i go i've even walked all the way out there on my beat on that beach with carrying freddy on my back piggybacking him so he could go out and sit on the beach but i loved him i still love him and i will love him to the day i die um i always say that there would be no there is no seconds to him and any man who would want to be third i couldn't love him because i couldn't respect him enough to be settling for third so i'm going to be happy just hanging around with my friends getting to be the grandma and being with my grandkids because i did have to sacrifice that time with my grandkids and everything to keep freddy you know and out there as much as i could this was he passed away four months ago yeah it was um june the 21st yes it's been almost a little over three months ago and it's just so beautiful because you know we knew right away when you were doing bingo we could feel this love coming out of you well talking about him i what i say and i tell everybody right now um i consider everybody my therapist so i open the show by telling them that they are become doctors of the day and they are going to be my personal therapy and my therapist so and it does it is my therapy because when he first passed of course it was very hard i didn't want to get out of bed i didn't feel like i had a reason right um we had this you know really strict routine where i would get up in the mornings and first thing i would do was have to go in of course and take change him and then i would give him his medications feed him his breakfast brush his teeth get him dressed for the day and then every three hours throughout the day i was giving medications and in between that was either feeding or changing or whatever so i had this routine that i lived by for a little over eight years so of course when he passed it you know it took my breath away and i was like i don't know what to do and i don't know how i'm going to do it and i laid in the bed and and i was very blessed because um melissa here at the florabama called me about calling bingo and it was just like a new day for me um i get up now and i have a reason to get up i come here and i have fun i get to talk about freddy and our lives together and i get to go have away free prizes i give away free stuff all day long i like doing that it's the coolest you do it every day or yeah it's um monday through friday from one to four it is so fun really is and where do you get the stuff to give away they give it to you um yeah um the florabama gives it and but here lately i've actually been pulling out of my own personal stash i have a lot of um promo pictures of murray haggard and willy nelson of course and freddy and um i even had a few of george jones and stuff and so i've been giving away a lot of headshots of those guys as well as cds i just like i said i pulled from my own personal collection because i i feel like i if i can give them to a good home i know they've gone somewhere good where do you think freddy is now oh freddy is in heaven right now he is in heaven along with murrell and ray price and george jones and i'm going to tell you the lord is getting one of the best concerts he could have ever had if he can keep them from getting in trouble what do you think heaven's like well you know what i read this one day and it's one of my favorite sayings heaven is like we're all dogs you ever loved before come to greet you wow so one's enough that's right so if you got someone up there it's they're coming they're there they're to greet you do you do you feel him now though do you think when oh i feel him it's like i have to tell you yesterday was freddy's birthday it was actually it would have been his 85th birthday and freddy was a pilot like i said and i was actually a pilot in training he actually made me go and take a uh course a crash course in landing because i was flying with him a lot so i ended up taking my flying lessons and all that so freddy always wanted to get to go up in one of those flight simulators yeah so yesterday for freddy's birthday i got to go out here to the naval base here in pennacola and i got to go up in the blue angels practice simulator and i got to fly and so i felt like it was freddy's present that he gave to me and he was sitting there with me the whole time and when you say that you don't mean like you imagine you could feel him oh i could feel him there and matter of fact i hit that was so funny because um i'm sitting there you know with the instructor and i'm flying and he asked me if i wanted to fly under the bridge and so i'm actually in this simulator i'm flying all around predito key so there's the theo bar bridge down here and he asked me if i would like to try flying under the bridge and at four first i was like i don't know and he said willy said i want to tell you i haven't had a single student that did it and under less than five times attempts i did it on my third attempt a hundred feet off the water i'm flying under the theo bar bridge so it was so cool and i could feel freddy jumping up and down and so excited with me that i just succeeded in doing something that everybody else took at least five tries to do and i did in three that's so beautiful and it's so beautiful you did that on his birthday yeah it was on his birthday yeah it was like i said it was something he always wanted to do how'd you get in there well luckily i've got a navy pilot right here that goes to church when we matter of fact we have a super cool church that i'm a part of here at the florida oh the florida has a church right here at the florida on sunday mornings this tent out here becomes a church it's called worship on the water and it is a no judgment zone you can come as you are you can sit here and have a bloody merry or drink a bush wacker which were famous far around here and have some eggs benedict while you listen to a sweet message from pastor dan and hear some fabulous music matter of fact we took the old song it's called smoke on the water we changed it to worship on the water so we get down here at church wow that's really cool is it so this is what what type of christianity it's christianity well actually um of course we're christians but we're it's a non-denominational and um that was kind of you know freddy and i both got involved in the church freddy when he first got sick you know freddy's always been a believer he grew up in a christian home but he didn't ever really go to church or anything to him it was they like going over to the church of god and getting down underneath the church and listening to all him and going crazy up there and singing and stopping the feet right so he really wasn't a church goer but when he got sick his sister norma his baby sister who's a wonderful christian lady she um was worried about freddy and she wanted him to get saved so um we were living in this um rv park there in austin texas called the la hasenda and they had a church there so we started going to the church there and freddy decided he wanted to get baptized so freddy actually got baptized in the swimming pool at the la hasenda rv so the video on youtube on your youtube matter of fact they have the freddy powers pavilion there and we actually have picking parties there but it was kind of sad because 10 days later after freddy was baptized he ended up in the hospital in nashville tennessee on life support and of course i'm standing there over him crying and begging the lord not to take him and all of a sudden freddy barely opened his eyes and he looked at me and he said mama i'm not going anywhere i just got baptized wow and sure enough freddy came out of it and i brought him down here out of the hospital they said that he only had two to three months on the outside we lived across the street here at the florabama yacht club and our bus for three years freddy lived three years so to tell you what the beach life would do to you it extends your life it extends your life and we lived here for three years they had us nosed in right up here on the bay side so freddy could watch the dolphins and see the boats and when the blue angels would fly over he could look at his windshield in his side view mirror and i mean window and see the blue angels so he had a wonderful last three years of his life i would the customer service here would come over and help me get freddy out of the bus i would bring him over here and um the musicians here they would at least play at least one song to freddy one of his own songs and you could always see even though he couldn't speak you could see that twinkle in his eyes and um but yeah freddy loved this florabama so we came over here as much as we could till it got to wear the last couple of months um i couldn't even hardly pick him up get him out of bed without it hurting him so he ended up the last two months of his life he wasn't able to get out of bed that's a rough two months oh yes it was for you for you but oh god yes it was when you think about i mean of course for him yeah but the caretaker the that it seems like caretakers whenever i am lucky enough to encounter them they somehow have aren't aware of how much they have been doing yeah for years until it stops until it stops and is it are you realizing it now oh yeah it takes my breath away like i said all the time when i'm like i said it was hard to get out of bed i didn't feel like i had i almost really felt like i had no reason to go on right but um but the florabama here and the church here they've been really good to me and they have stuck through it with me and they're there with me all the way so i owe a lot to this florabama yeah this is a good place it's a great place it is a great place and it is a family here yeah i can feel it it's the energy here is real and it's such a positive vibe when i saw the church sign i wasn't i honestly wasn't sure if they were being serious but now i see oh yeah it's the great church you gotta come and check it out sometime it's a great church and we have a lot of fun how do you connect with god in your life i start out the very first thing every morning when i wake up by thanking you thanking him for the life that he's given me and thanking him for you know everything he's going to do for me in my future i can you know i after what i've been through with freddy and i see the need for people to know how hard the job is but if you love him you'll want to learn how to do things and i have actually you know i learned how to take some things like my one of my foster daughters i call her my foster daughter we kind of adopted each other she's a nurse there and muscle shows joy davis and um she would tell me things and show me how to do something but i always seem to find an easier way to do it and so i can see myself going around hopefully teaching people how to live with someone in a condition like this and how to make it easier for both of you and not only have quantity but have a quality life together right and that's such an important thing to teach people and i and i and i feel that that is the direction that the lord is sending me in i feel it very strong and like i said i've got this book coming out freddy should be out on this book tour with me but i'm going to be going out on this book tour and that's going to be a lot that i'm going to be talking about have you thought about working with a hospice or starting your own hospice um well that's something that joy um and i have talked about and we've talked about the one thing is the different needs it's like the hospice is there and they're there to bathe them and they're there to um sit with them they have things like that but having someone it's like my car would be dirty and i needed my car washed well i couldn't just call you know from somebody from hospice to come and do it so trying to find somebody to come and wash my car or go to the grocery store for me um even doing you know getting little pedicures and manicures you know they're laying in the bed they need their fingernails done and their haircuts and things like that so you know that's something that we would like to see is doing hospice care but providing all the things that are other necessary things that are not normally provided right do you have any plans to get this going yeah we've actually seriously been talking about it on this trip to colorado that's going to be one of our major things that we're going to try and see about talking about putting together um do you have a i guess twitter is a way people could reach out to you if they have any ideas well actually like i said now i have the freddy powers twitter twitter yes what's that what's that's at freddy powers yeah it's at freddy powers and then of course and then i've got the freddy powers facebook and i have my own facebook which is kathryn allen powers okay cool so you can link me up under kathryn allen powers and sure i'd love any suggestions we would love it all so one thing that i have asked people in the past on this podcast and uh i'd like to ask you to wrap it up okay but actually it's a question for you and a question for freddy okay which is so there's i guess it's going to be two answers which is what is something that people listening right now could do this week to make their lives better richer fuller to become more of a human if you if freddy could give people out there just any words of wisdom what would those be and what would what would those words of wisdom be from you actually both of us would say open your heart to the lord and the one thing that we always say is when somebody asks us you know or says something about you know i don't believe in the god or whatever it's it was always both of us would go back and say well how's your life been so far right and it's like well if it ain't been that great or you'd like to see it better why not give god a chance how how do you open your heart to the lord talk to him read his word try to believe i mean you know our deal was is believe that's that's always we even had t-shirts one time that said i believe and just start with i believe what if you don't you know i have listeners and i i know people who when i've said to them oh you should try praying you know it's a really what do you have to lose it is oxygen ultimately you know but if it works great but if it doesn't uh well you know you figured out the prayer doesn't work for you but the that you know the thing with belief i even personally i want to believe i read the new testament the crucifixion of christ the resurrection of christ when i hear that i think that is just it's so hard to believe that so if do you pretend to believe do you still you know how they say fake it till you make it do you sort of pretend to well you know i you know that could be a strategy that you could probably start with but you know when you sit down and you actually read the stories you know it's it's like it's a beautiful story and somehow in there you get this desire to want to believe and so i have people who say well do you believe that you know moses you know open the sea and all this stuff and i'm going you know what i prefer to believe because if you believe then therefore you've got hope right so i just it's crazy i mean you know i've just i just read this fantastic book called something like the soul of christianity or houston smith and it really is beautiful and but as i'm reading it i just keep thinking like i i want to believe this but you know i i really can't so right sometimes i can but sometimes i can't so in those phases of can't believe which for a lot of people that phases their entire life right what prayer would you suggest for them to pray don't don't don't get me on that one i like i said i'm a christian and and i read but i'm not gonna be able to tell you which scripture to go to because that's one thing i'm not good at no not read a prayer like were you always a christian well yeah i was i was actually born and raised pentecostal okay so and matter of fact you can actually go on youtube go to worship on the water and put in catherine powers i'm testimony and you could pull up my testimony and i'm basically taught the one thing that i learned growing up in pentecostal you know and all that um of course when i got old enough i didn't maintain that relationship i kind of you know kind of walked away and i went my own direction but the one thing that i learned is that i really did not have a relationship with god right i knew of him but i didn't have a relationship so it's building a relationship with god right when you start feeling and talking to him it's like you start feeling his presence and then you start having a relationship right so it's building that relationship with god is what i realized at this point in my life that i need that relationship with him because having that relationship with him does give me hope and without hope what do we have hopelessness that's right now can someone just say something like god i don't believe in you are you out there can you say that as a prayer absolutely you know and it's like you know it's kind of funny because we sit and we'll you think about they always say that you could be on your deathbed and you could be an absolutely horrible person been a rapist and a murderer and a pedifier and all this but all you got to do is ask god for your forgiveness to forgive me and if you really believe that and in your heart and you're really asking in your heart to be forgiven then you're forgiven well people say well i don't want to be up there when you know somebody like that they have that's not fair right but you know what god it doesn't mean that everything and everything in life is going to be fair you know that's cool so so anyone anyone doesn't matter what it doesn't matter and if you strongly feel him in your heart and you believe it in your heart and you ask for forgiveness you shall receive that's what he says and that's what i believe thank you so much for coming on this show it really is an honor to meet you and to challenge you thank you thank you and i'm

199^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - DEREK WATERS DRINKS HISTORY Transcript and Discussion^2013-09-27^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Praise, sweet Jesus. It is autumn. Thank God. Fall is here. It's hit LA at last. The evil dragon of summer has been blown back into oblivion. No more hot, sweaty days, dripping sweat onto my dog. No more assholes and shorts with 7,000 pockets forcing me to witness the horror of their hairy calves. No more awful, hammer-like blows to the brain from the satanic summer sun. No more beach invitations. I didn't get any beach invitations this summer, but I wouldn't have gone. I'm not a summer man. I'm not a summer person. Haven't been for a long time. I only liked summer because it got me out of school. That was the only reason I liked it. Nobody in their right mind can really enjoy a hot summer, not in reality. There's the romantic version of the summer, which is that you go down to the beach and paddle around, watching the seagulls rise up into the sky, floating around on a raft, swimming around in a pool. But the real version of the summer is you just try to escape from the heat, depending on where you live. Maybe if you live in some temperate place, it's okay. But if you live in a place like Los Angeles or Texas or any place beset by the horrors of global warming, then you scuttle like a cockroach out of the light and into your house. And not everybody has central air conditioning. I have a little portable air conditioner that I would push into a room because I live in an old house and it would just turn into a kiln, where you're just constantly sweating and the air conditioner is barely beating back the heat. I know it's not cool to not like an entire season, but I don't. I don't like having to wear short sleeves. I want the option to wear long sleeves. I like wearing sweaters and I like that. I don't want to have to be forced to throw on some dumb short sleeve shirt and then go waddling out into the heat like a pig climbing out of his pig chamber. Whatever pig's sleeping. His pig hollow. Staring at keyboards, watching sweat drip down like salty rain. Is it so hot in your house that you actually have to have a towel near your keyboard to wipe your brow when you're trying to write letters? Or whatever you're trying to write, emails? It's a mess. Summer is a fucking mess and it's gone. And that's a victory for all of us autumn people, all of us fall people. Everyone who's a fall person right now feels a sense of victory over the oppression of summer and of the summer devotees, the disciples of summer, worshippers of the sun. They worship the fire god. They walk around in their short shorts with their little colorful little shirts waddling around with that summer glazed eye. That gleaming look of joy, completely unexplored joy. They don't even know why they're happy. It's because the sun has boiled their bird brains and they don't know what's happening anymore. All they see is the blue sky and the sun and they like the smell of sunscreen and then they go hobbling down to the beach and lay in the sand trying to ignore the fact that what they're laying in is just a thick coating of dog shit and baby pee. No no no summer, you're gone. Thrown wherever, I guess in some parts of the world at summer right now. I think in Australia summer's just kicking in. Well I'm sorry friends, but I like the fall. If you like summer, it's fine. I know I was just a little harsh on you here, but if you like summer, great. It must be nice to have watermelons for brains. You're listening to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. The year is 2013. It is almost October. Many of you are getting to enjoy leaves changing. That's nice. In LA it's not really like that. We just get a nice, there's a nice wind blowing through today. The sky seems a special blue. In the summer the sky is not the blue of the fall. In the summer the sky takes on this, the blue of a black tar heroin addict's eyes. It's a kind of milky, diluted thing that should be pretty, but just seems like death. But in the fall, things get the right color blue up there. And the fall things come into this nice, sweet, crisp focus. No longer is this guy the blurry blue of somebody who's been doing that new Russian drug crocodile that makes your skin fall off so that you're just a heroin addicted skeleton thing convulsing in your nasty Russian cot. It becomes the blue of the Dalai Lama. It's the blue of Sufi poet's eyeballs. You summer people with your margaritas and Jimmy Buffett greasing yourself down with sunscreen because the very thing that you love so much is just trying to give you cancer. Parading around in your short shorts where everybody could see the jut of your pussy lips smacking out of the tiny little pants you decided to wear. Well, that's okay. It's hard to enjoy the aesthetics when you're baking under the hell demon of summer. It's hard to enjoy beautiful women wearing no clothes and wandering around when it feels as though you're a frog that's been thrown in a soup pot. Fall is here. Fall, now you can listen to Nick Drake and feel normal again. Now you can wear hoodies and pretend that you're a monk. We're going to play some Nick Drake right now to bring in the fall. It's good up in the clock. As simple as a cactus, steady as a rock. I could be here and now. I would be, I should be, but how? I could have been, but what are these things first? I could have been, but what are these things first? I could have been your pillow, I could have been your door. I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more. I could have been your statue, could have been your friend. A whole long lifetime could have been the end. I could be, oh so true. I would be, I should be, through and through. I could have been, but what are these things first? Oh, one of these things first. I could have been a whistle, could have been a float. A real life gift for her, could have been a boat. I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock. As simple as a cactus, steady as a rock. I could be different here. I would be, I should be, somewhere here. I could have been, but what are these things first? I could have been, but what are these things first? That is one of my, that's my favorite Nick Drake song, hands down. You've never gotten into Nick Drake, definitely check him out. Any of his albums, though I recommend Way to Blue to start off. That's an introduction to Nick Drake. You can get that on Amazon.com or iTunes. Boy, we have a great podcast for you today, but first, some business. If fall were a t-shirt, then that t-shirt would come from the Angels at Short Design T-Shirts. ShortDesignT-Shirts.com is a company located in Thailand that produces shirts for the sophisticated lover of the fall. These shirts aren't really made for the summer, man. They're not made for people who like to inhale paint thinner and finger their dogs while watching Nancy Grace through the wee hours of the night. These shirts are made for people who like the sound of violins blowing through the breeze of some shady forest. People who drink from rustic fountains while singing to the pans dancing nearby. ShortDesignT-Shirt is not the shirt for a summer person. It's not the shirt for a person who loves nothing more than spraying sunscreen and jizz into their mouth while pouring lemonade on their blistered sunburnt ball. ShortDesignT-Shirts are the type of shirts that you would wear as you were pouring the freshly sacrificed blood of an autumn goat into the open mouth of your new pagan child. ShortDesignT-Shirts is a shirt for the man who loves the autumn. A man who loves the gentle sighing singing of the forest as the river runs through it. That secret spiritual sound that whispers of a time when all the summer people will be nailed to crucifixes made of popsicle sticks and hung upside down. ShortDesignT-Shirts.com I invite you to go there, celebrate the fall, worship the lord of the forest, bow down to the great hoofed wanderer who wants nothing more than for the wildlings to arise again and reunify, spilling the blood of all those who have oppressed them for so long into the rivers, feeding the great forest with the death of those who are already dead. ShortDesignT-Shirts.com It is the t-shirt of Loth Lunaris, the lord of fall, the one who will come again all praise him. ShortDesignT-Shirts.com If you go to ShortDesignT-Shirts.com and put my name in you'll get 10% off of these wonderful autumn shirts. These shirts are not just good for wearing while you're alive. I would also recommend having your entire body wrapped with them before you are taken to the sacrificial pyre and burnt so that your ashes can be scattered to the winds and blown back into the open mouth of the great watcher in the woods, the one we all love and the one we will all return to again, the one who will devour the horrors of summer and shit out the sweet cold glory of winter. It's fall and ShortDesignT-Shirts is the best way to celebrate this fantastic season. And anything that you buy, they give us a tiny little percentage of it. It's an amazing program that Amazon does. I've said this before, I kind of don't understand it. I guess I do, they get publicity, but it seems like everyone already knows about Amazon.com. But for those of you who somehow don't know, those of you who have just come out of the coma you fell into in the sewage tunnel underneath the overpass that you climbed into in the mid-70s, it's a web service that has everything. Anything that you want you can order from Amazon. For example, today from Amazon.com I just ordered an adapter for my iPhone so that I can plug my iPhone into my car. And a few days ago I ordered a laundry hamper and today I ordered the new Rom-Dos book, Polishing the Mirror. What's super cool about Amazon is they will, for only a few dollars extra, you can order stuff and get it the next day. So it's an amazing service. If you're the type of person that I am, the type of person who doesn't like going to Target and being surrounded by the reminders that we are all transforming into one giant glob of plastic and flesh, then Amazon.com is a way to avoid that reminder and have a nicely dressed delivery man bring you a brown box filled with whatever you happen to order. It's super fun, gets super high and go on Amazon and order stuff late at night. You'll get cool little presents that come the next day. It's like Christmas all the time with Amazon and I'm not just saying that because they give me a percentage of what you order. It's like all the products that I advertise on this show, it's something that I use all the time. And I seem to be, my usage of Amazon seems to be increasing. The more I realize that it keeps me away from that plasticky air that you have to breathe when you go to the giant stores that are sucking the life out of our planet. Oh, I hate them. I don't really hate them. Speaking of not hating corporations in this podcast, I kind of talk about how we have to stop demonizing corporations and I don't want to spoil this podcast. It's only one little piece of it, but I just want to clarify something. I recognize that corporations tend to take more than they give, especially to their employees, which is I think the greatest tragedy of all, is that a lot of the employees like the employees of Walmart, they don't get paid enough. There are some corporations that do pay their employees a living wage and so there's examples of corporations not being completely sociopathic and greedy. But anyway, you're going to hear me talk about how I think that corporations, that we can't demonize them anymore, that we have to apply the same embrace that we apply to whatever internal demons that we have, the same kind of acceptance and loving attention that we apply to whatever dark fragment of hell is stuck in our psyche. We have to apply that to shit we don't like in the external world too, and I don't do that all the time. It's something I'm working on, so I just don't want to seem like a naive consumeristic shit shill when you hear me talk with Derek about corporations. Know that I am not a person who, by now if you've been listening to this podcast, you know I'm not a person who loves corporations. Outside of Monsanto, I hate all corporations. I think Monsanto is a good example of a wonderful company, a company that you can get behind and support, because they're working on the environment, they're actively working to transform archaic, boring vegetation into something that's more palatable to the modern human's tongue. But we all have work to do on ourselves. Human beings are corporations, if you think about it, you're the corporation, you're the incorporation of everything you've ever experienced mixed in with your understanding of those experiences, mixed in with all your memories, mixed in with your DNA, mixed in with the temporary cyclone of meat that makes up your body. So that's a corporation, and just like a corporation, there's parts of you that probably aren't necessarily helping the world. And a lot of people who are much smarter than me say that the way to handle, the way to change, or the way to shift the darkness, to convert the darkness into something positive is not by hating the darkness, not by shaking your fist at it, not by labeling it as something malfunctioning in the universe, but by treating it the same way you would a crying child. Don't shake the baby, love the baby, be patient with the baby, and accept that the baby is as much a part of nature as anything else. And as horrific as it may seem, and as scary as it might be to accept, corporations are as much a part of nature as flowers are. And though they don't smell good and aren't something that adds beauty to the world, they're there. Crocodiles don't add a lot of beauty to the world either. I'm sorry for those of you who think, I mean, I think there's a primal beauty to a crocodile, but if one's climbing around your backyard, you don't want it there. But it's still part of nature. So that's a pre-apology for whatever I say about corporations coming up, though I don't clearly remember what it is. I do remember thinking that it's going to, it would upset some people because it would seem confusing. There are other ways you can support the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast.

Today's guest on the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast is one of my longest friends in LA. We started doing stand up together way, way back in the murky primordial past. This is before there was tar in the tar pits. He's a great friend of mine and he's one of my favorite types of friends because he feels more like family than a friend, which I guess is what a real friend is, family. And what I mean by that is that he's a sort of person where I might not talk to him for a few months, but whenever we reunite, it's like we start off from exactly where we were. There's no weird sense of being disconnected from each other. And I think that's true friendship. He's a hilarious person, a brilliant comedy writer. He's got one of the most unique comedy minds out there and it's the mind that produced drunk history. If you haven't seen that, stop listening to the podcast and go to YouTube and Google search drunk history and you'll have many, many hours of joy ahead of you because you're going to want to watch them again and again and again. Basically the premise is that he gets people drunk and they talk about their understanding of history and then he reenacts it with famous people. I was lucky enough to be in the Tesla episode with John C. Riley and Crispin Glover. He also has a show, the show got picked up, so it's been on Comedy Central for a season, which is amazing and hopefully there'll be another season. Now everyone, please open your hearts to my friend coming back to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour after a brief hiatus, the great Derek Waters. Hello friends, it's me, Dunkin' Trussell. You're listening to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast. I have just destroyed 16 minutes of a fantastic conversation I was just having with Derek Waters, creator of drunk history, comedian and one of my very close friends who's kind enough to not punch me in the face for evaporating this great chat we were having. It was a great chat, but I guarantee you we're going to have another great chat. See, that's a friend. A lot of people wouldn't do that. They just walk out. You're really a fan of people that are just like, you don't want to fuck this. No, that's not true. People would just do it, but anyway, I'm very sorry. Don't be. Derek, holy shit, I don't feel like we got to repeat crap that we already said. No you don't. Creator of drunk history, Comedy Central series, everyone loves it. I constantly see tweets about it. Tweet after tweet after tweet. So you're following me. I think I stopped following you. Because I tweeted about drunk history. You tweeted too much about drunk history. Launched drunk history Duncan. I love that you have managed to get your own show and I love that something that started in your head and started as just shooting stuff for the internet is now like an atomic bomb blasted around the entire planet. This is something I'm really interested in man, is this spark of inspiration and how the spark of inspiration, if you're smart enough to hear it and then follow through with it, there is the potential to create a kind of subjective wildfire through the neurology of all human beings on the planet. Because drunk history, it's a global thing by now. It's everywhere. How many millions of people have seen it? I don't know. How many millions, by now statistically. I don't know. The number of people. Or the internet. Yeah, all together. I don't know. The statistics are that by now, so many people have seen drunk history that there is a 95% chance that someone got strangled in front of drunk history. Drunk history is probably the left. I have thought about that. Like I'm like, I wonder who's dead that like the show. Is that fucked up? Like I'm like, you know. People in their hospital rooms, people on their laptops watching it as they like drift, drift into infinity because they're trapped in some cave in and they decided the last thing they wanted to watch was an episode of drunk history. It's just nuts. Yeah, like something that I didn't even want. I did not want the internet. It was in 2007 when internet comedy, I thought was judged only by hits over comedy. And that's why I made that show at UCB called LOL where it was like instead of seeing the word LOL, why don't you show your ideas, your shorts and see if people are actually laughing or being nice. Because now it's all like what what LOL was is what now what fave and like is like on pictures. Right, right. A lot of it's like, LOL circularly call me back. You owe me a phone call like, right. See, I'm watching your stuff. You didn't even look at the picture. You saw like my name and click like, but what I'm getting at is that it was just an idea like, oh, this could be funny. Like, yeah, that I didn't think obviously a TV show. And I never wanted to do a TV show because I'm a comedy nerd and snob that I'm like, it's a five minute idea. I do not want it to get old and it's the worst type of comedy or like, why did you go that far? Yeah, you should have just walked away. And so I'm so lucky to be making TV show and I'm lucky that I got to make it the way like I wanted to make it. But that is a crazy thing, man, to think about. And look, you're using the term luck. I do. I do think so. I think I'm, I know I'm extremely lucky. I think there's a singing like there were a couple of things. I'm 34 and I moved here when I was 20. I left when I was 19. I lived in Toronto. I was thinking right before I left to try to be Chris Farley. What wish, what would I wish like I'd heard and like, there was one thing that I like, luckily I had a good upbringing. Like I was always raised to be a good person and have manners and I really still believe that that is key. But the other thing is perseverance of like, don't fucking stop. There's so many times where like, shit just gets thrown at you that you're just like, what am I even doing? Like, if you want to fucking do something, you do it, you know? And I just think, and I'm also stubborn as hell. Like, I'm not doing something unless I like it. So now I'd like our old conversation. This makes me know. This is so much better. The whole conversation or just whining. I was whining. This, this what you're talking about then. So it's not really luck. It's, it's you're talking about one manners or, you know, empathizing with other people, which is very important. I think that just is heart of like, whatever you want to make, whatever you want to do. Like, if you actually like, are caring about other people and not being like, this is my demo reel. This is my one man show about how like, my dad was nuts. Or, I don't know, making shit that's not just all about yourself and making shit that like, oh, I've never seen that before. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not even talking about drunk history. I'm just saying like the general idea of like anything to make is like, what's the point of it? Well, the, the point, what is the point? Is it, is the, does the point devastated thing? Like it's the, the moment you start, you know, I'm sure when you first recorded a drunk history, you know, it was just for fun. Right. Yeah, that's all it was. It was in just for the LOL show. And I just showed it and did not want to put it on the internet. We had just, I had just done a pilot with Bob Odenkirk named drop, Simon Helberg, really big bang theory named drop. Yep. And we put that pilot on the internet and there were so many like racial, like there were just really mean comments. And I was like, why would, why would I do that? The only reason I did it was because it was a realization of that time where I was like, fuck the internet blah, blah, blah. So I sent it to the daily show, sent it to Conan, sent it to Sarnit live and hopes like maybe it could be like a monthly schedule, one of those shows. Yeah. Nothing. And then put on the internet and front page of YouTube. Remember when that was important? Yes. Yes. Front page of YouTube. I remember that. Yeah, man. Front page of YouTube. Now it's the front page of Reddit. Is that right? Yeah. Is that the new YouTube? Oh yeah. Getting on the front page of Reddit is a huge deal just because it ups the viewership. But so that's an interesting thing, man. I just, what I'm really curious about right now or I've been thinking a lot about is the space between when a thought or an idea comes into the mind and wherever it was before it comes into the mind. That's sort of. It's always there. I truly believe that. Always in your mind. I do believe that. I don't know. Are you just thinking creatively or anything? Well, I'm thinking like. An idea to do something. Let's take drunk history. At some point you, I don't know. What is the, do you remember the first time the idea came into your head? Yeah. I was with Jake Johnson. He was really, really drunk. We were both really, really drunk talking about music. And he was really passionate telling me a story how Otis Redding knew he was going to die when he got on a plane. It all goes back to Otis Redding, who's always been my favorite, which serves as these weird other things about Otis Redding in my life. But he was so passionate about this story that Otis Redding knew he was going to die. He looked at his wife and he was like, take care of yourself, baby. And she was like, how will Otis you take care of yourself? And he was like, no, baby, I'm serious. And Jake was so sincere. And, you know, when you're drunk, but that sober part of your brain's like the same true. And I was just like nodding and smiling. But then I just, I kept picturing like Otis Redding, like looking at me being like, that didn't fucking happen. Don't listen to this. So that was the idea. And then I was like, I mean, that'd be cool to reenact that. But if people get drunk and talk about music all the time, what's something people don't get drunk and talk about? I thought about history. And I just kept picturing. I still can see it. It was this black and white image I had in my head where like an actor came in as John Wokes Booth to kill Lincoln. And he was like really hesitant of saying, like, I'm going to kill you, motherfucker. Like, or whatever. Like being almost, this is really artsy fartsy. Like I always picture it as Jopeto and Pinocchio of like, the Pinocchio has to do whatever Jopeto like says. So I know that probably makes drunk history not funny anymore. Well, no, I mean, I don't, I don't think so, man. I think, but I think that that, so you look at like this thing. There's a moment in time you identify this moment in time as like something it inspires you get inspiration. You realize this is really funny. And then you start exploring that idea now. So it's like now this thing is like in its embryonic phase inside of you. And you're given these visions when that stuff starts happening. I know exactly what you mean. You get these quick flash bulb images of a thing. I don't think everyone does though, Duncan. And that's why I think about the creative mind where I'm like, those people, they're like, how do you come up with it? Like, well, you can too. Like, but I don't know if every brain has that part. Like, I know my mom and dad don't. I know a lot of people back home don't. Like what, what kind of brains have those things? Or like, all of a sudden you think of something and you're like, whoa. Right. It triggers. What is that? That is the big question. And I think it, I think every brain can do it, but it starts with you have to have the inspiration. Well, the inspiration and also simultaneously you have to have the desire to allow the, the inspiration is a seed. And your imagination would be the soil. And then the thing that you create is the flower that grows out of it. So you have to, first of all, identify the difference between good seeds and bad seeds. And then you have to have the, you have to have the patience to let the thing germinate inside of you and go into that kind of open state. Right. You know, when you're thinking, it's a weird, for me, I just sort of go into an open state and wait and then hope. And then if I'm lucky, bam, there'll be a thing like a, like a flash. And then, okay, that's probably something worth exploring. And then, and that's where you have to have the guts to explore the idea further because a lot of the times those ideas, they don't seem good to anyone else. They're not going to seem good. Right. And you, and you're the only person that's going to know. So you have to try them. Yes. You can't like throw, because when people are like, do you think this is funny? And they say like, no, like, do you think that that really makes them think it's not good? Right. They just want to get it out. Yeah. And it's like, or if you say like, it happens all the time, like, excuse me being in a restaurant, like, what's your favorite thing here at the restaurant? Oh, the roast beef sandwich. Okay. I'll just get the turkey club. Like, I don't know if that makes sense. We should go back to comparing stand up to fucking. We will. We'll get there. This is so much more interesting because I just like following, following the track of this thing because here you have an idea. You're hanging out, drunk, fun night, then the idea flash bulbs into your mind. You see it in a more vivid way. And then from there, what happened? Yeah. And I do believe in inspiration that all comes like in a thing is like, then I was like, oh, Jake, do you want to get drunk and tell that story again? Fuck no. I don't want to do that. So then I came in and like, okay, what else can I do? And I knew Marquette Gliardi is like the smartest man. That's a dog. That's my dog. That's a dog. We're back. My dog was returned to me. That was the sound of the barking. Great dog. So what I'm trying to get at here is the what happens when you fully allow a thing to grow through you. And that's what I'm interested in talking about with drunk histories because now you've got the flash bulb idea. You talk to Jake. He doesn't want to do it. You talk to, what's his name? Mark. Mark. Mark. You talk to Mark. And then I got to call Jeremy to shoot it. And that's the, that was the shooter director. Uh-huh. Yeah. Right. Bring your camera over. I have this idea. We're going to shoot Mark talking about Alexander Hamilton. And this is just still just for, you just, this seems like a fun idea. Right. And just the idea of whatever he says we're going to reenact. Right. And then that's the first drunk history. Yeah. And so then over the course of how many of you shot on the internet? Uh, eight, six. Six. Seven? Because there was a 2.5. I think seven. That was the Ben Franklin. There's two Ben Franklin's. Oh, I see. Yeah. So you shot seven of them and then were you pitching it around or did someone approach you about it to, to do the show? Oh, on TV. Oh, are you okay? Excuse me. Yeah. It's okay. Quick burp. Uh, it was a, man, what the fuck happened? I think Jeremy and I talked about doing like a movie where I'm going across America learning like history of it. And I was just like, it's going to get too old. It's going to get old really fast. Right. I just started watching shows of trying to think of like just how the fuck can the show work. And I just really wanted to broaden the world of history that make history just really great stories that it wouldn't have to just be Thomas Jefferson stories. You know, that it can be stories about Patty Hearst and just good stories. Right. And then like, well, what's the through line? And then there's a really great show. I'll always give credit to those. A huge inspiration. One is Stephen Fry in America where he's going across the country. But he, he kind of gets away with it because he's British, you know, and every dumb person loves to help someone out that they feel like they're really, really helping out. Yeah. Um, and, uh, yeah. So there was that show. And, uh, so there's this guy, Louis Thoreau that you should really love him. He's the best. Amazing. He has these crazy, crazy documentaries where he went and hung out with the Phelps family. He went to Israel, hung out with the, um, the, the Jews there that are the expand, I don't know what you call them, the expansion. They're, they're expanding their territory. Yeah. And it's really intense because he's one of those, he kind of reminds me of a Verner Herzog a little bit where he mildly or majorly editorializes in this super subtle way. Like he does have an opinion about what's happening. But he doesn't go in in a Michael Moore mentality. He goes in very even keel and goes, you know, like with, um, the church, the Westboro church, like God hates fags, like asking like, so why, why do you have this sign? You know, like just very curious and accusatory. Um, anyway, so there were shows that like inspired, inspired of like, um, things like we wanted to do and then just pitch this idea. And originally the idea was, uh, I said, I was, you know, I said at 30 years old, I've realized I don't know anything about my country. So I bought a short bus. I'm driving across the country to find out what happened. Cool. That was how we did the pilot. And then they were like, um, what's broad in the world that it's like just a history show and not a personal journey, which was a really smart move. Yeah. I wasn't that. Um, so yeah, that's sort of how it started. God, it sounds so weird talking about. Why? I don't know. It's just weird. It is weird. And, and, but I think it's very inspirational for people because, um, it's very inspirational for me because it matches my understanding of the way the best things come to fruition, which is usually they don't start for any reason. It's just suddenly a thing has come into your mind and you want to follow it through. But I do believe in that 16 minutes that we lost, there was something that I will recap is it's about when we talk about meeting people that know who they are. Yes. And it's the same exact thing of stuff like this. If it knows what it is, if a person knows who they are, like, you get it. You're like, whether I like think it's the funniest thing or no one's like, Oh, I get it. Like, just committing to like, this is exact. I know exactly what I'm doing when you work with someone and you would like are comparing that to someone's like, I don't know, you know, just go out there and have fun. Like, okay, that's not going to work out. Right. If someone's like, this is exactly like my idea, do what you want with it. But this is the tone, you know, I think it's just, and I humbly think that's why it succeeded because it's stuck to the tone of like, this is exactly what it is. Yeah. So you had the guts to, and also by getting something on TV quite often, they'll try to destroy the tone. They won't do it intentionally. It almost was party time history hosted by Carson Daly. Are you kidding? No, but it would have been great. Well, there was talk that we're going to have to change the name. Party time history. That's what I was like, well, it's not going to be party time history. That's part of the thing, you know, when it grows through the, what you're talking about is when you're creating anything that you publish, what you are doing is you're creating an energy form. Well, you have the initial inspiration, which is this energetic form, what you call the tone. Then you're encapsulating it into whatever the form of the thing is you want it to be. A poem, a work of art, a canvas that you paint, a TV show, you're capturing that energy inside of the pill. It's almost like a pill. That's what the thing is. And then you're sort of replicating it and reproducing it when you get into TV. And, but ultimately the final destination of all this stuff is within the minds of human beings. That's where it, that's where it ends up. That's where it goes to live or to die. So it's a really curious thing to me, which is that what has happened when you have inspiration is that there's this initial energetic feeling that grows into you. Where it comes from, who the fuck knows? Maybe it's a combination of things, who knows? But then that energy gets transmitted into millions and millions of minds in the ultimate form. And that is magic. That is wild magic. It is wild magic. And I'm going to go off for one second just because I compare what you just said to, I always talk about music when people are like, Yeah, well, they ripped that off of that and that was ripped off to that. This goes back to the same thing is what blues music was, was black eyes that had gotten the shit beat out of them and learned how to play guitar and didn't sing to rhyme. They sang because they had something inside of them that they wanted to give. And when people compare things to be like, Oh, that was that like, Oh, it's compared to something because it came from someone's heart. Like, yeah, that's why it was good. Yeah, because it wasn't trying to become a success. It wasn't trying to become anything except for what it is, except for what it was, you know, of like, if you have an idea, people always say this of like, Oh, the good ones will always be like, I got to figure that out. I got to figure that out. Like, the good idea, the things that you struggle with, it's like, it's okay, not every idea you're going to have is going to be great. But I guarantee you every idea that doesn't work will somehow work into the idea that does that I really do. And what the fuck do I know? I just at 34 just like, I've been very lucky, but I do believe like in the create the trust in the creative brain of like, don't fucking do something that you here's a really great quote. My grandfather, who always be my hero, said a great line right before he died. I was asking him like, not like the classically, what's the key to happiness? Just what's something good to remember, grandfather? And he said, you'll always know when you're doing something right, you always know when you're doing something wrong. Wow. It's that simple. And it's like our trust of like, our instinct, every human being, no matter who you are, where you were raised, who you are right now, you have an instinct of if you're doing something right. Or you're doing something right. Or you're doing something wrong. I can't believe that happened. Well, did you see any signs that it wasn't right? We're always going to do something that we know isn't right. But we should try to avoid that. What do you think that that rightness is? Do you think rightness is instinct? I think we'll never know exactly like that. What's right to us might be wrong for someone. But if you have a good heart and instinct, like, well, this is right because I'm actually going to do something good. Like it's helping that person and it's helping me. And I don't know. I think your instinct says it all. We know. We just like, we know. And if it doesn't work out, then we just failed at doing something we believed in. That knowingness. What is that? What is the knowingness? What is that part that knows when you're doing something good? I don't know. Because is it the good? Is it like there's like a, what if there's a, sometimes I wonder if there's, if what we are is just good. I think we are. And then we sort of, when we say we don't do something, we say we're not doing right. And what that really means is we're not being ourselves in the sense that we're, we, we've sort of decided to be some other thing than we are. And then that sense of not rightness is a feeling of not being in tune with what you actually essentially are. Yeah. Or doing something not for what the chore is, but for what the chore may bring. It's like, just do the chore. What is that from? I just said it. What the chore may bring. So yeah. It's not about what the chore may bring. It's about what the chore is. You know what I mean? Yes. For example, washing dishes. What is a, there's two experiences you can have with washing dishes. I haven't done that in a while. You got to try. It's fun. That's what you, it's a meditative experience. It's really, when you're washing dishes and you consider what you're doing, it seems like a mundane activity, but it's really quite amazing. Which is that you've got water pouring in from some reservoir that everyone in your city is connected to. And then it's, you can heat it. It used to be that you would have to like, you know, put the shit on a fire. It was very annoying. So you get this warm water running over your hands and you are transforming dirt or plates, these filthy plates covered in gravy or whatever you ate into their original form. So it's a very metaphysical task because it's a kind of analogy for enlightenment or for meditation. So when you're washing dishes, you're connecting to this essential source, which is water or exists. It's a reservoir everyone can dive into. And then you're using that to cleanse plates. So you can eat. So you can eat. And it's a very meditative experience. Well, that's one version of it. The other version of it is you just want to get it fucking done with and it sucks because you want clean plates and you want to move on to the next thing. Or you were told to. Yes. And that's what you're saying there, which is when you're looking at the fruits of your action versus just the action itself. When you're getting immersed in the action itself, it's always this beautiful moment. It's like going to a Jimmy Buffett concert in hopes that you're going to get laid. It's like you should just be going to a Buffett concert. It's true, man. Just embrace your parrot head. Can I ask you something, man? Yeah. Do people get laid at Jimmy Buffett concerts a lot? Do you think? Yeah, but they aren't awake. I think a lot of people get laid, but it's only one out of the two getting laid. I don't know. I have a really weird memory. I never went to a show, but I remember a friend of mine had a yuppie upbringing and his parents were watching a Jimmy Buffett live. And I was so disturbed by it. I guess it's that song. Fancy left. Fancy right. And there's some orchestrated thing like fans do when that song plays. Yeah. And I was really, man, I was probably like eight or whatever. I was young and I was so disturbed by how uncomfortable I was. And then I dated a girl when I was like 20 and she brought up Jimmy Buffett. I was like, do you like Jimmy Buffett? She's like, I mean, I'm not a parrot head, but I like him. I was like, what the fuck is a parrot head? What's your take on Jimmy Buffett? What do you think he represents? Corporation. I think he represents, you know, some of, I will humbly say that like some of his songs, I won't turn off of them by myself because I do think he has a good voice. Yeah. But he's congregated a class of assholes and has taken their money and they are too stupid to ever realize it. So he's kind of like the grateful dead for alcoholics. Yeah, I was gonna, yeah, I think. It's this sense of like, I'm only asking because on Sirius Radio, which I have in my car, there's a station called Margaritaville. Amazing. And it's all Jimmy Buffett shit. I would never leave my car. I will listen to that as an exploration into exactly what you're talking about because I like to listen to the lyrics and that quality of manipulation that's in the lyrics. That's what I'm really interested in is it is this, it's like, he really is pinpointing. It's like a market of recently divorced drunks who like to go to the beach. That seems to be his thing. It's sort of like, well, it's five o'clock somewhere. I believe that's one of his songs. It's just nostalgic booze music. But it's the classic like a songwriter that pitches that song to him like, this will be a huge song at TGIF for every place in middle America. And they're right. So I don't blame him. I'm just, I'm not going to join that troop of people that genuinely are entertained by him. And if you don't fuck it, man, they're happy. That's what they like. But I do think that's what's so cool about different individuals taste that I won't ever be able to relate to them. And I think maybe that's why we both gravitate towards like, man, can you imagine just like this helping you sleep at night? Jimmy Buffett. Or just like going to like shows, like people like, look, I've been to close to 20 Pearl Jam shows. I get teased about it all the time. I love them. But really quick about, and I get teased about it, but there's a genuine love I have. I like the Grateful Dad. I take brutal, brutal beatings for that on a daily basis. Yeah. But there aren't any black lights in here and you don't have like a dead head, like a phone case. You know what I mean? There's people that like to tell you it to bring it up. Like, I'm into the dead. That's why I have that dead sticker on my car. That's why I drive a Volkswagen bus, you know? And then there's people that just, no, I actually like the music, you know? I'm not going to wear a Pearl Jam hat. Well, I think you just think it's funny how like when you gravitate towards something that amassed, is it already amassed enough attention that it's considered to be a thing? You're judged on it no matter what it is. But you're talking about like the Grateful Dad, Jimmy Buffett, Pearl Jam. They're all attention magnets. I agree. And I do, sorry. It goes back to what I do think in the same way of an idea that instinctually, us as human beings, one of the biggest reasons why I think anything becomes successful is because individuals that hear it or see it feel responsible that they discovered it. And once that is gone, that there's no discovery in something, it's like, that's old. Right. Oh, you're just finding out about that? Right, right, right. God, I have it. It's like bootleg tapes of Grateful Dad. Like that is probably really exciting. Maybe not now, but like earlier, like, dude, I got this bootleg. So you almost feel like you're responsible for giving it to someone else. You know what I mean? Yeah, you want to be in the early phases of the information distribution for some reason. The late phases of the information distribution or the atrophy phases. And those are the phases where we start saying they've sold out or they've corporatized. Oh, they're good? Yeah. Is that what you mean? Yeah. They just like did good? Yeah. So things of like putting, you know, a good band and then all of a sudden they're like doing, you know, commercials for Walmart. There's that, that I'll never stand by. The commercials. Just like, oh, they actually did sell out if they do shit for that. But yeah, but that again, no, that I like this idea of selling out, you know, I was just having a conversation with somebody the other night who his job is to go to bars and to drink. I won't say what, but he has a specific type of drink. Yeah. And just to make sure that that drinks on the scene so that people are, he's like a handsome guy. It's disgusting. So like it's so he like to make sure that people will know this is not not disgusting or not. This is a very, very prevalent thing. So when you go to a bar, especially like a hip spot, guaranteed some percentage of the people there are being paid to be there to order certain types of drinks. So the corporation has, it's an insidious way that the corporation makes sure that it can advertise while people are out drinking. If you watch the gingham size new video after gingham style, it's a series of commercials. It's a series of commercials now here, not to call you out, but think of it. Think of drunk history. Yeah. Is that selling out? It's sandwiched between commercials. So it's where, where is it selling out? Is it selling out when you put the commercial into the content itself or is it selling out when the content is bait for attention so that in the residual moments following and leading up to the actual content, someone is watching a car commercial? Why is it selling out? It's why is it, why is it considered bad to have a relationship with corporations that are helping to fund your art when the history of art is having a patron? There is throughout all of history, if you wanted to do art, you had to have a rich person give you money to pay for the art. So why is it selling out? I agree with you that that would be what I would like. But unfortunately, the little that I know is that it's not corporations that want to help your story. It's corporations that have figured out who likes your story and they can manipulate to buy a product. To buy a product? They're not, they're not behind the show. They're not behind that. They're behind who is. They're not even behind them. They're in front of them going, look over you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's, you know, there's everything's a business. I really think that if you realize that, no matter what you do, what you're like, oh, why do they, everything, everything is a business. And accepting that is just going like, oh, I see the business aspect of this, and I'm not going to go that way. Well, it's the question is why is the, why is it like I have one of the most brilliant musicians that I know that I, it's the most amazing music I've ever heard in my life. He won't let me play. He won't put his music out. Now that's, and he won't let me play it. Okay. That's different. It's the ultimate version of not selling out, which is to be, but that's not giving, you know, like the, I rather sell out than not like give, like, yeah, I, I exactly. That means he's making his music selfishly just for himself in, in hopes he's, when he dies, all these people are going to, you know, go crazy at what they found in his one bedroom apartment. I think he fears the, what happens when enough attention goes on to you. And then there's pressure of like, you might fuck up. And that's scary. Well, have you ever heard the term where there's attention, there's activity? No. No, that's a transcendental, that's a, that's a, that comes from transcendental meditation. Makes sense. And so, you know, for example, in your life, when you begin to worry over a thing, you're creating a kind of friction that will actually cause that thing to emerge more and more and more out of the background. Like for example, right now, everyone listening, I'm putting into your head the number 108. Yeah. 108. They've just visualized that. 108. You're going to see this number in a weird place for the next day and be like, what the fuck? How did he do that? Well, I didn't really do anything. I just activated a pattern recognition part of your brain that makes it so that when you connect to that thing, it seems, it seems magical or intense, but I've directed your attention towards this certain thing, which drew it from the background into the foreground. So where there is attention, there's activity. And in the, in for drunk history, think of the attention being given to it compared to say the attention being given to some, a bit of spray paint on the wall of the LA River that people walk by. Think of the attention given to it. Also, there's another interesting aspect of attention, which is that it's called the observer effect, which is that the very, apparently the very action of observing a thing in the quantum state seems to shift its state. So when you have a massive amount of attention being placed on any one thing, it creates a type of energy within that thing, which is why so many corporations desperately want more than anything for their brand to be in front of as many people as possible. It's almost as though the current or the connection between the attention of the human being and an inorganic object brings that inorganic object to life. Suddenly it begins to run through the subjective field of all these different human brains. It's as though humanity as a whole or the consciousness of humanity as a whole is an ecosystem and anytime a thing has enough energy or focus on it, then it begins to live within the ecosystem that is a totality of all the minds on the planet. And there's something about that that is frightening to people. They don't want, they don't want to bring things to life in the, in the, in the guy in mind. Yeah. Cause they might be told what they feel isn't good or and it might not be. Look at the fucking Holocaust. I mean, you know, somebody felt like that was a right idea. When I give my grandfather's quote, you always know when you do them right, you're always doing something wrong. Someone probably felt right about that. Yeah. A lot of people apparently. Yeah. So that's a spooky thing in the great echo chamber of minds that represents the end output of all media. There is this potential for, um, it's just spooky if you don't know, the energy is generally just for you, for drunk history, the energy is manifesting hopefully in just people laughing. Probably some people being like, this is disrespectful to this country. Yeah. God, that hasn't happened. One really quick. We might have to cut it, but I do just feel like it's on the same pattern for, uh, uh, the ideas and how to communicate your ideas and something that I really learned of like accepting everything as a business and just also understanding like, Oh, someone's doing something I don't want. Hold on. Hold on. Let me just see what do they want and then give what you want. My example is when the show was just about to come out, the marketing campaign was like my biggest, I like wanted to jump off a cliff. It was like Abraham Lincoln with a beer helmet and said four score and seven beers ago. George Washington with a keg crossing the Delaware. The worst is Albert Einstein writing, um, with a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand, uh, E equals MC hammered. And then the Richard Nixon with the liquor. And I just asked, I said, just let me talk to who's saying this is good. And when all I said was, um, I know you're just doing your job. I just don't want people thinking that I'm doing a bad job like I want. That's not the show. And they said, what we're doing, what our job is to make people go, what is that? Your job is to make a show that says what it is. And as soon as I understood that, I was like, you do whatever you want. Cause I was like, Oh, I know what they want. And they're doing that. That grabs your attention. So it's just whether you like it or not, just understand what the purpose is. What I like is the idea of letting go of this stupid hate of certain things, this, uh, this, um, non thought out categorization of certain groups as being the enemy and certain groups as being okay, which is something I'm very guilty of throughout my life. Oh, the evil corporations. How dare they people working. Look, if go, look at a fucking go turn on the nature channel and watch as a lion takes down a baby gazelle, watch the fucking brutality as you watch a pack of lions eating an animal that's not quite dead yet, ripping its stomach open, pulling its entrails out as the thing is bleeding desperately for its mother or something to save it from this awful into its life of running wild. Is that lion evil or those lions evil? Those lions are corporations. That's a corporation. It's a group of like-minded beings seeking sustenance, uh, from, uh, other living beings, that's nature. Is that evil? When does it become evil? Does it become evil when, um, if you don't need to eat and you're trying to eat more, that's what you see. I come from a family and my dad is a tire company and they're a small middle class business that's been around since 1926, survived two depressions. Yeah. And so the corporation I hate is Walmart of taking the small man. Those, that's the corporation where I think it's the lion that's already eaten and he's got enough, but look, look at Kudzu. And by the way, the lion would just keep eating if it could. The lion is not like, the lion is, it's based on like, I don't have access to enough shit to eat. Yeah. I would eat more. Nature always consumes more and more and more. Or look at the fucking hurricane or the tornado. I mean, you could say, well, you know, the difference is humans and, uh, no right from wrong, but the thing is when we're talking about a corporation, we're not talking about an individual human or corp. The person I, you know, a person who like works for many times people working for corporations as individuals, the individual component, they will think, man, I don't really feel good about some of this shit happening here. But they can't, they've, they're like, I have no power over this. And so the thing is a whole emerges as a, as its own being and beings in nature don't care about right or wrong or good and evil. They just consume. There's not a sense of what have I done here? You know, and, and so I think that it's important that it's more interesting to start letting go of that initial reaction. Oh, the evil of Walmart, the evil of Halliburton. The, I used to do this instead, just look at it as like, okay, the earth has produced this, this comes from the earth in the same way flowers come from the earth, the earth grows roses, the earth grows, Halliburton's is the earth evil. Is space evil? Is the precursors to the earth evil? Where's the evil? When you start sifting through it, trying to find the evil, you will find it's very difficult to find. It's almost, I feel like it's goes back to it's, you should be doing it for the chore, not for what the chore becomes, which is like, oh, we got to take, we got to start carrying beer now so we can take out those little small shops. Now, like I'm not going to rip on Walmart. I got a, we got a Best Buy right around the corner. Shit, man. I mean, rip by, you know, at this point, man, some people listen, this may have just like pulled parts of their beard out and fury that I'm not like saying that these corporations are evil. I used to do this. Where'd you get the target tattoo? I love Tar-Gay. Tar-Gay. No, I just think that it's like, the big change would start happening if people dropped their attachment to categorizations and admitted or woke up to the realization that they were all one thing. That's when the big change happens. The big change doesn't happen when we create the state of dualism, which causes this endless conflict that has been going on forever. If fighting doesn't do anything, accepting does. Right. And accepting, accepting what we really are. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. What we are and what someone else is. Yeah. I don't, I can't accept all the corporation. I don't know how I feel about it. I don't know how, I don't, I, like, I, you know, I've some, like, Raghu Marcus is a, this really brilliant spiritualist and meditator that I have on this podcast. And I will inevitably start railing against this thing or that thing. And he's always like, no, right there, there, there's the root of war. There's the root of predation. There's the root of everything that you hate right now. You are it, even though you feel like you're justified. Okay. Anger does nothing. Yeah. Anger does nothing or that sense of like differentiation. It's this thing of like, listen, we're earthlings. Some, somewhere in that conceptualization of things, somewhere in the conceptualization that we probably all emerge from the exact same thing. We all want the same thing. What, what do we want? I think find something that makes us sleep at night and to be loved. Love. Yeah. There's, there's no one as mean as they are, the more they want to be loved, you know, and, uh, it's just easier and harder for different types of people, you know, but why and why, because of how they were raised or anything that was in their head of like, Oh, I, I can't love because I had my heart broke or blah, blah, blah, but in the end of the day, we all want that same thing. It's just that we don't know how to get there. We have 12 minutes left. I want to talk about before one before. Yeah. Well, you said, let's see. It's, we have, uh, 10 minutes. Okay. I wanted to go back to comparing your comparison to having sex with, um, standup. But what, did you have something? Yeah. I wanted to ask, I wanted to ask you this. What, I just want to get deeper into this idea of the obstruction that people have when it comes to accepting love, you know, it's easier to give love than it is to accept love. I'm going to go in the comparison of your friend who's scared of putting that tape out of people hearing it. It's the same exact thing of, yeah, who doesn't want to be loved, but it's accepting love and then loving that no matter what that person is, I'm going to accept them. Um, and I think it's just the being scared to allow someone in, but then it's a different thing of like accepting love that, um, accepting love, I think is a lot easier than giving love for me. Man, for me, I, you know, like, well, think of like when people compliment you. Thank you. You say thank you. I thought it was a compliment. And you want to, I'm just saying thank you that people compliment me. You know, though, like a lot of times you might compliment someone and they're like, Oh, no, it's not. No, what? No, they immediately put up a block. Well, it's that great, great quote. Sorry, I need a power bar every once in a while is not to take anything personally. You know, it's that when someone says you're fat, that doesn't mean you're fat. It means they're dealing with something that they're being negative to you. But, and when someone says you're really good, that doesn't mean you're good. Like, yeah, how you feel is what matters and that's hard. Man, I just recently had an experience with this incredibly potent psychedelic called dimethyl tryptamine for the cops listening. It's totally a joke. I don't really do this stuff. It's a story. It's an allegory, but the, um, the, uh, experience was all of these. Threads, millions of them. I don't know. Millions of them came out of nothing, attached themselves to my body and started pumping love into me or pumping this kind of healing energies. Love was love. And right away I realized like, Oh, I, I'm blocking this all the time. I don't want it. Like I'm trying to hold this back for some reason. I don't want this level of embrace. So, uh, that made me realize, Oh, right. I get it. It's like the evil is really just not accepting the love. It's the thing that makes you push love away, but let it be clear. In my opinion, there is evil. There is evil. It's not that, Oh, if I just accept this, it doesn't mean it's evil. No, there is evil. I truly will always believe in good and evil. Well, evil is what makes you realize that if you're good or not, cause evil will always tempt you. I do believe that you believe that there's a, uh, like, uh, yeah, sort of a hundred percent negative gravity. Yes. And I don't, I don't look at it in life. I look at life very positively, but I do know that there's evil. There just is, there's people, there's things and also in ourselves that we could choose to do evil or we could choose to do good. There's this evil is an organic quality. It's, it doesn't exist in anything except organic and humans. It's, it's only exists in humans, right? Evil. Yeah. There's like not evil owls or there's no evil mice. Um, sure. I mean, no, I, I mean, unless the owl, what I mean is like, if humans get wiped out, if like, we all die of a plague tomorrow, where will evil be in the world? Jeez, you've prepared this one. Um, I guess it won't matter because no one could make a podcast back with there are no people. So at that point, so evil is a thing that exists in humans then. It's, it's, it's not a primary force. I think it's a mentality actually that I don't know an owl or a mouse's mentality, but, um, I do think it's something in the brain of like a choice. Um, and I do believe that there's positive and negative energy. Oh, man, energy is really what I'm not disagreeing with you. You go into a guy's house, you know, a lot of good friends we have, you go into their place and it's almost like a dating a girl. Like you're like, this is how you take care of yourself, right? It smells like shit. It's more, it's just negative. Like I'm not someone who carries an EMF meter with me. But you know, when you're going somewhere and you're like, Oh, Oh, I feel good here, or this person feels good. I don't know where I'm going, but I just know that like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It gets really tricky, man. It's, it's, but it's the best thing is life is like breaking bad. No one fucking knows what's going to happen. I know it's going to happen. I know the way breaking bad ends. You want to hear it? No, I don't. I do know the way it is. I'm sure they shared the script with me. I know exactly the way it is. And you're not going to tell me. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you your last podcast. I'm going to tell you right now. Fuck you. And we're back. So crazy. I swear that was going to happen. I told you. Oh my God, that's crazy. I mean, it's not crazy. I mean, isn't that wild? Knew it. Totally. Well, I know. Sorry. I love like I was ruined. People go to like breaking. People go to like breaking bad. Like you want to come over to this breaking bad party like, no. Yeah, there's going to be some douche. Knew it. Oh, yeah. Oh, you guys remember I told you that was going to happen? Yeah, Walt's evil now. Shut the fuck up. Derek, I don't. What did I not tell you? Stop. Whatever you're saying, if that's true, don't say anything else. A lot of people haven't seen the whole thing like me. So I'm still on season two. I don't know what the fuck's happening on that show. Who was it? Someone tweeted like what's going to happen is that he goes into witness protection and start. It's the beginning of Malcolm. Yeah, I've heard that. Who did that? But the spoiler for all of you, if you don't hear breaking bad spoiler, stop it for a second. But Walt is a robot. I don't even know if he's still live in the series. I haven't seen any of it. What? I get aggressive if you have missing the wire. No, we're about. I'm about to start watching. Oh, you did the weir. That's very good. It's my sweet baby. We're about to start the wire. Um, Derek, you are not evil and I didn't think that I just think that everyone has a potential to do either. Well, I think that there's a usefulness to that kind of thing. I know evil is maybe the wrong word. There's like an idea in your head that you're like, Oh, here's something I'm going to do. Do you really always go like, No, who is this good boy? Me or the bosom doing full? You're just like, Well, I got this. I mean, I'm going to go do this. Like, you know, I didn't want to fucking do your podcast, but I knew that you were really depressed and texted me that suicide note and I'm like, I should. You have to do it or I'll kill myself. I know you got to go, but I just, I have to say this. I just think it's a fascinating thing that you can explore in your mind. Evil, because you have to look at it like, okay, let's take the big bang and then follow it all the way through to the moment that human beings grow from the earth at what point does that energy transform from being just raw energy into a metaphysical force at what point does the, is it like curdled milk? Is when milk goes bad, is that what evil is? It's a curious thing to try to look to really specifically try to understand what you think evil is, because it may very well be that it doesn't exist. Any, it's just that you are blowing air into a balloon that isn't there at all. It may just be that there's, you never talk to someone that you just know is evil. I've talked to people who are depressed and I've talked to people who are sad, but I, God damn it, have yet to meet anybody who's evil. Really? I've heard they exist. I'd love to have a conversation with a truly evil person, but it always feels like down, down, down, down, way down deep down in that thing. There's a sparkling. It's mentality. I will say that that I should not say that I like there are people that are evil. There are though people that I'm like, I see what they're doing and I don't want any part of it. Does that mean I'm right? No, that means I'm going like I'm not on that team. I'm on this team. I might be like, I'm good. They're evil. I guess it's, it's a hard word and I don't want to be around a serial killer. I have no interest in being anywhere. Who's to say they're evil? Well, that's, that they really will. No, I know you're going to say like, no, well, who's to say is killing someone that maybe wanted to die? No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying underneath it all, underneath all the bad decisions. There's inevitably inevitable. You go to, if you give me the most evil person in the world and if I have a thing that can turn them into a baby, it ain't evil anymore. Well, no, every baby, Hitler guaranteed the cutest shit. I guarantee baby Hitler was super cute. You'd want to tickle the poor, sweet little thing. Give it if it was crying, you want to feed it. Yes, I always think of that. And I think of when I get frustrated with someone or I'm like, uh, whatever. I have a mentality where I'm like, oh, man, fuck them. I'm like, there's a mom and dad that really was excited when they were born. Yeah. And, and, and would be very sad if something happened to them. See, it really ruins it because if we can exist in a place with black and whites, it's much more fun because then we can justify our internal aggression or external black and white. It's all human beings that all have a heartbeat and have, you know, we're all, we all come from the same source. There's no one that wasn't born out of a vagina. There were, you know, no, I'm serious. There's no one, you can talk to millions of people. I guarantee you're not going to talk to one human being that didn't come out of a vagina, possibly a C-section, but I was, I was not a C-section baby, but I was the reason my mom got her tubes tied. It's the only way into this dimension, friend. And I'll tell you, um, the most important, what are the most important commandments in the New Testament? Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul and love your neighbor as yourself. That's a mind fuck because there's nothing in there that says, unless they're evil, we got to move. If they are love your neighbor as yourself, Asterix, unless they're evil, unless you're evil and then you go do, if you're evil, you love them like you love your, your evil self. It's a really curious commandment. It's a real co-on. If you think about that, because nowhere in there does it say, send drones to drop bombs on them. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul and love your neighbors yourself in Asterix, unless they are evil and then bomb them. Man, you, you want to compare fucking to stand up now? No. Well, we don't have time. You got to go. Let's save it for the next podcast. Maybe I can dig it up. Maybe I'll bring one of my evil friends over, but he won't know that I've claimed him. No, I, I do want to say, cause I feel like I, um, said evil too much. No, I've, I think about evil too. Sometimes I know. Here's the thing. What do I know anything more than you or anyone listening or anyone or fuck? No, every human being, I believe, whether you read a bunch of shitty books or a bunch of great books or don't read at all, that you have instinct, you know instinct and you can choose to listen to that or you can choose to ignore it and do something that is only out like to get you or like more money or something. That's like, that you can categorize that as like, there's like, maybe there just should be a different word than evil, like poor choice. You know what I mean? There's some poor choices you can make, but there's some good choices that you can make, but that's also an opinion. Lost life is a very hard thing to talk about. Um, all I really think is like, is just like, what you believe in is what you should believe in. I just have to say that I'm very thankful to the non-evil force of the universe that made us friends and they gave you a show. You are awesome and drunk history is, I love you too. And drunk history is so great, man. And the energy you're putting out there is really, really good. So it makes me happy. I, uh, I, yeah, all the energy things and stuff that I'm all about it. I'm all about it. And I do think that, um, or whatever, I'll tell you when we turn it off. I could talk about this shit forever. Derek's got to go. He's got a meeting. Yeah. I have to go to Walmart. Follow it. I'm late for my one hour photo at Walmart. Uh, man, I got, yeah, I got to go too, guys. I got a meeting with Target. So, uh, uh, this is the Dr. Trestle family, our podcast.

I'd swim the seas for to ease your pain.
200^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 436: Emil Amos Transcript and Discussion^2021-04-24^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, my dear loves. What you are about to hear is a super deluxe, hyper-zingered, double-quadrophonic, ear-blasting joy beetle launched out of the horn of plenty right into those sweet, waxy ear holes that have been one of the main receptacles for wisdom in your life. Oh, you are about to get a swarm of joy. Shotgun right into that trembling little brain of yours. That gelatinous, creepy, gooey blob of consciousness is about to get rained upon by the sweet, delightful, honey-flavored, linguistic storm, which used to be one of my favorite New Age albums of this conversation. Yeah, am I tooting my own horn? It's the only horn I got. This is a great podcast. Emil, my best friend, we went to college together. He has never stopped blowing my mind. We traveled to India together. We have been the streets of Varanasi. We have thrown Frisbees in Dharamsala. I think we threw Frisbees there, probably not. To be honest, I never liked Emil's Frisbee skills. I went there with my, David McClain, who's also been on the podcast. They're just more athletic than me, which isn't saying much, but God damn it, I just always felt super insecure trying to catch a Frisbee. I'm not gonna unload on you here. I'm not gonna have some weird breakdown here in front of you about my terrible dexterity when it comes to catching, flying discs, the weird ego trembling that happens every time. Somebody right next to my studio is incredibly unhealthy. I like to imagine that the almost constant stream of ambulances is always going to the same place and then sort of taking them to the hospital and then bringing them back. The point is, this is a great episode, and, oh geez, hey, waving at the firetruck. Good luck. This is a great episode, and is there fucking more coming? You don't wanna be annoyed by ambulances or firetrucks, you know, because anytime you hear a firetruck or you're hearing like, it's the worst day of somebody's life, probably, but that instantaneous like thing that happens when you hear it, the wailing of it, the beeping, you gotta ask yourself, is that necessary? Cause you know, if I were zipping by in an ambulance or police car, I would honk as much as possible whether there was someone in my way or not, just out of a combination of boredom and a sort of like Freudian ejaculatory desire, the beeping of the horn is like me coming, the great phallic symbol of the firetruck with its long ladder slowly rising up, that I'm climbing up and down, essentially making love to the fire with my hose. I would just honk all the time. Anyway, the point is I don't wanna be annoyed by firetrucks or ambulances. I wanna be the kind of person that spontaneously erupts with some kind of like compassionate heart trembling. They actually did a study that I read about where they were sort of examining the brains of meditators. By the way, anytime this happens, it's like one of the strangest ways that Western thinking interacts with spirituality, which is like, let's study your brain to see what happens when you meditate. But they did that. They got some Tibetan monk and MRI machine, played like the sounds of, I don't know, cats getting attacked, children crying, to see like what part of their brain is activated by sounds of horror, essentially like they did the clockwork orange thing, but to a Tibetan monk. And they found that the part of the brain that was activated is the same part of the brain that's activated in mothers when they hear their babies crying. Only there wasn't any kind of specificity to this activation. Just any sort of anything that indicated something was in trouble would activate this compassion center. I don't have that. When I hear a fire truck go by or an ambulance go by, I just feel like my ass tightens a little bit and I just think, fuck, somebody's probably clumsy. Isn't that rotten? I can't help it. It's like, what are you gonna do? It's the first thing that bubbles up out of the deep oozing swamp of my subconscious. I haven't gone down in there yet to dredge out whatever rotting corpse, whatever sad thing is sort of decomposing down there and belching out these swampy bubbles of selfishness. But I'm sure one day I will. One day I'll send a team in there and do that awful thing they do in lakes when they're looking for a body and dredge it up, vomit it out maybe in some ayahuasca session. It's pretty interesting, isn't it? I'm gonna get to this podcast, but it's pretty interesting that like there's apparently a difference in puking when you've had ayahuasca versus puking when you've had too much booze. Like when I've had too much booze and I'm vomiting, I'm not thinking like I'm getting my darkness out symbolically via this puke. I'm just, I've poisoned myself, but people who take ayahuasca and vomit, they claim some kind of like relief that goes way beyond getting the sticky goo of ayahuasca, which I've heard just tastes like absolute shit. And once after a show, somebody gave me a jar of something they claimed was ayahuasca, like a liquid in Tupperware. And I couldn't say no, what are you gonna deny ayahuasca? You should deny ayahuasca from, if someone just offers it to you in Tupperware, but I took it back to the hotel. I'm just curious, opened it up and smelled it. And it was truly the vilest stink, like probably the way like it smells underneath Gollum's balls. Just like you've found some spindly power-addicted cave goblin, pulled them out of the cave and just lifted up their balls and stuck your nose right underneath into the fungal mat that of like greasy goblin pubic hair and Gollum's sweat. It smelled terrible, I flushed it down the toilet. If you're listening, I'm sorry, but what was I gonna do? I had to fly, am I gonna try to go through the TSA with a Tupperware of ayahuasca? You can't even get water through there. What was I gonna do, take it that night? Buy myself in the hotel room, watch forensic files while communing with ayahuasca goddess? I flushed it and I did feel guilty flushing it down the toilet, I did. But then also I thought, why? Who do you think I am? I'm not a freak, I'm not just, I don't just slurp back ayahuasca. I'm not that free with my life. I'm not like the Hunter S. Thompson of ayahuasca. I won't even eat chocolate after five. We've got a great podcast for you, friends. Emil is such a genius. And in past episodes with Emil, we've talked about music and we've talked about our friendship, but I think this is the first time we ever really took a deep dive into a specific topic which is Camus and his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus. You should order the book if you haven't read it yet. Camus is a really interesting person who didn't identify as a philosopher. Apparently didn't identify as an existentialist. I found this out after this conversation that you're about to hear, because I was like just doing a little research on who Camus was, but he did write a really brilliant essay which is considered one of the great works of existentialism. He was friends with Jean-Paul Sainte for a little bit in Paris, I believe. And they had a, I think they probably had a pretty intense effect on each other. And so he wrote this brilliant essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, which I've been reading. And I haven't read it since I was in college and I believe Emil and I were in a class on existentialism together where we studied this book. And so this is a conversation about The Myth of Sisyphus, suffering, what I've heard called the great sad. I found that, I think on a subreddit with people writing about this thing that Camus called absurdity. And I love it, it's really wonderful. And especially as someone who enjoys studying Buddhism, finding these interesting places where the two connect, I love it. And that's what this conversation is about, but it's about much more than that. So I really hope that you will take the journey with us because if you stop listening to this halfway through, you will leave with a sense that your fire truck hasn't been jerked off to completion. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this. A big thank you to Upstart for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

[""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trustle""] [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trustle""] [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trustle""] Emol, welcome back to the DTFH. Hello. Yeah, boy, good to see you. Good to see you. This is sort of, I think this is gonna be different than our other conversations in the sense that we've got kind of a plan. And let me just introduce the listeners too. So I've been reading, I'm done with it now, but I spent, I don't know why I'm even doing this to myself, but I've been trying to get up at like 5 a.m. Cause my brain seems to be work, that's like whatever like brain damage I've inflicted from a lifetime of taking psychedelics. If that, I don't know if that's real or not, has, doesn't seem to like happen in the morning. Like I can really think clearly in the morning. So I've been reading Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus. And you are someone who has a better grasp of existentialism than anyone I've ever met. And so as I've been reading it, I've had all these like moments of wanting to call you, but it's like five fucking a.m. You know, only absolutely do that, I would seem insane. But yeah, so I, this is a, I just wanted to sort of talk with you about it. And I know we just talked about it, but do you want to introduce like the main idea in that essay by Camus, or do you want me to? I'd like you two because I want to know why you are reading it. Well, honestly, I have no, no real reason, probably the best reason to read it is for no reason at all. But you know, it was just on my shelf. I remember like getting off on it in college and then wanting to see like, why did I let, why is this stuck in my head? Cause I really don't remember too much of it. And so then I jumped into it and you know, it's amazing because basically the premise of the thing is that we live in a world of absurdity, meaninglessness, like just a kind of like, what does he describe it? He describes it as a thing that maybe you don't notice it at first, but then when you see it, you can't unsee it. So, you know, he kind of like mentions like the foreground background problem. You know what I mean? Like we're constantly on stage. We don't get to blend in like some nice placid shrub or something. And then also he talks about, and you know, again, this is Camus, French, no doubt on a shit ton of speed. And he talks about those moments of just feeling completely alienated from your home, your life, your universe, just that general sense of like, I don't fucking belong here. This, whatever this place is, is not for me. And so this is the confrontation with what he calls absurdity. And the essay is examining why you wouldn't just kill yourself if you experience that. And he breaks like the possible suicides into two types, physical and philosophical. And then it kind of wraps up with this beautiful idea that we live for rebellion. You know, like in the midst of the absurdity, you know, we're still, we're pushing against it. That's what we've got. We smile at the curse of the gods. And thus the symbol of Sisyphus, pushing the fucking boulder up the hill and letting it roll down forever. It's like, yeah, the gods cursed him to do that, but where he fucks the gods is he's still happy. That's just crazy. So do you remember it? Does that ring a bell with you? Yeah, I'm actually having like, I just had like a some sort of midlife crisis while you were talking. That was really weird. I just remembered, yeah, I just retrieved my entire memory of eighth grade. Like it's one of the great mysteries of my entire life and it disturbs the fuck out of me because I think I became who I am now in eighth grade. And every day I drive by my junior high school on the left. It's called Phillips in Chapel Hill. And every time I look at it, I can remember little bits of, okay, that's where that kid lived. That's where I would walk after school, blah, blah, blah. But I can't retrieve eighth grade. I can remember seventh grade. And as you were talking, I remembered like how I became myself. Really? What was it? You just fucking freaked me out. I don't know. That's wild. It's so strange. God, that was disturbing. So in eighth grade, I came back to school and I met this kid named Bear. And Bear was like sort of like my bodyguard innocence cause he was bigger and he had a Mohawk and huge boots and a bomber. And if anybody fucked with me, he would literally like stomp their face into a curb, you know? Wow. So we had this kind of like weird outside underdog bond. We never talked about it necessarily, but as I got into like hanging out with him more and more, he, I guess my life was changing. I became who I am now. And I, God, it just all came back to me. But so I'm gonna tell you why it is involved with this whole thing. So he was the first person that played me like the cure, you know? He was sitting in his bedroom and the whole universe is accessible to you through this friend's bedroom. Right. And so we got into, dude, it felt like that. And I know, I wanna hear if you had a friend like this, I'm talking about, we all had like certain best friends every couple of years and for the rest of our life, until we die. You mean like the friend that introduces you to new stuff? Yeah, but also the kid that like might've been like way more mainstreamy than you, but like still stayed up late with you and wanted to talk to you about your life and your mind. And like the deepest shit ever, right? Sure. God, it's like emotional, sorry. But so, so Bear was like my best friend and he tried to kill himself, actually. I had just gotten into Nick Drake because of Sebado. So, so Sebado covered Nick Drake and I went into the record store downtown and I said, who is it? Who is Nick Drake? It was so crazy. I mean, that was the beginning of a, the very beginning of ninth grade when that happened. And this guy, the guy across the desk, you have to understand like nobody had ever even heard of Nick Drake. So the guy across the desk said, Nick Drake was a songwriter from the UK in 1973. He, you know, blah, blah, blah, he killed himself, all this shit. And I just happened to ask the right guy. I just actually asked like a scholar just randomly. I still remember the guy's face. He ended up marrying one of my friends. Like that guy changed my life in two seconds and he'll never know, right? Yeah. And so I went home and I, and I ordered, or I like, I figured out how to get the Nick Drake box set and I opened it up and it said that when he killed himself, he had the mythosophist next to him, right? Oh, shit. Yeah. I didn't know that. That's crazy. So my little brain, my little eighth, ninth grade brain was just like, I don't know where I'm going in life, but this is like meant to be, you know, like I'm absorbing all this information that's way above my head. I have no idea what any of this is about. And so then it's like so funny, but when Bear tried to kill himself, I didn't know what to do because I wasn't deep enough to deal with it. Like I just didn't even know how to react. I didn't know how to like what to say. I didn't know why you tried to kill yourself. I had no idea. He never told me why he did that. And I, I was a shallow little kid. You know, I was, I was just like confused by it all. It was above my head. And so. But not shallow. You just like, how do you even deal with that? I don't think shallow is the right word. It's just, how the fuck do you deal with your friend trying to kill himself at any age? I don't know. I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't feel it. I had no reference point for it. And I was such a little idiot. This is, this is crazy. My mom or somebody drove me to the hospital, see him in his hospital bed. Yeah. And I brought him the myth of Sisyphus. Oh, God damn it. And I don't know why. I didn't know what the book was about. Do you think he tried to read it? How embarrassing. And I mean, it's just so funny, dude. I'm not sure if it had his the best gift to give someone who just tried to commit suicide or the worst gift. I just, that's when you were reading, or no, when you were describing the opening of the myth of Sisyphus, that's what came to me. I was like, oh my God, I retrieved all this information. It just fucking blew my mind. But it wouldn't be, you know, I would go all the way through high school, which was very difficult. And then I took a year off. And then I got to college. But even at the beginning, I didn't know I could learn anything that was even applicable at that fucking school. I was just so down on it and so checked out and wanting to just smoke my troubles away or whatever. And so my first teacher was John Casey. He was basically my mentor, whatever you call it. You get like a counselor. Yeah. And so I got lucky again, right? I got this guy who changed all of our lives. But he was not just my teacher. He was actually like a sign to counsel me. So if I had trouble, I had to go to him. I actually had to go to him. And at first, he just didn't like me very much. I remember his eyes. I remember his tone. He did not like me. Why? And I don't know. Again, I felt shallow. I felt like a stupid little kid that was kind of wasting time. He'd asked the class a question, you know, a philosophical question. I had no idea what kind of answer he was looking for. I just felt out of my element. We're talking about the first week I got to school. He was intimidating, that guy. Like he was very intimidating, very intense. Didn't he have long hair, mustache? He was like he had the like, you felt like you were around like part shaman, part like Taoist sage or something. And like he was just a genius. So there was that too. Yeah, there was like this, it's like he's part Schopenhauer. He's like got this grizzled, heavy fucking vibe. But then he's a Taoist sort of thinking master, you know, who had won the US debate championship three years in a row and then quit because nobody could touch him, you know? Yeah. So there was like this sense of like, fuck, he's like that dad, I'll never please. You know what I mean? Yep. And then somewhere in there, he decided to teach a class called existentialism. And you know, this is starting to be so long ago that I can't tell you the breakdown, the frame by frame situation where I discovered this and then it led to that. And I don't remember where Hermann Hess came in. I don't remember where Buddhism came in, but somewhere in those books, I saw that there was like a solution to everything I've been going through. So anyway, when I met you, that was when we were like trying to solve all this shit, you know? Yeah. So that was when things started to like look up, you know? Yeah, for me too. Yeah. So anyway, that's the story of how that shit got put in my brain and it was sitting there on the shelf kind of like the way you walked over and just pulled it off the fucking shelf, you know? Yeah. It's just sitting there and you're like, oh, on this day, as I experience the worst pain that you can feel, maybe this book on the shelf has something about that for me or something. Yeah. So here comes Kimu, right? And he is now your, he's like your older brother or something and he's gone through this thing too. And he's gone through it and he's kind of worked it out on paper. So you're like, holy shit, you can do this stuff. You can actually like apply your mind and like maybe potentially solve the fucking pain, you know? Yeah. And so when meeting you, we were both in a sort of race to get there, you know? We were like, dude, I need to fix this situation. Yeah. So that is basically all I was going to say. But it brought me to this point with you where like we wanted to, I guess you could say it was almost competitive, but yet you're like in the same arena together. So as hard as- Well, I was jealous of you. I mean, like you're like this like genius, like kid, younger than me, not by much, younger. You're like, you know, recording incredible music. But then on top of that, you're like, you were just digesting some of this stuff that all, I would say only now am I like kind of like able to wrap my mind around it. Because I don't, I think that if, if I was talking about it back then, I think I might have been a little like phony in pretending to understand it more than I did, you know? I don't, like, but you were like, you were like a sponge soaking it up. That was the craziest thing to watch. Because, you know, it's easy to read that shit. You could just skim it or whatever and pretend you know what it's saying. But there's a big difference. That's like swishing some medicine and then like secretly spitting it out. But there's a big difference in like actually absorbing it, you know, all the way through. And you, I saw you go through that. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Yeah.

Well, other night we went to dinner and you were like telling me the story of us standing in the woods and the snow or something. Yeah, when you were the first person to introduce me to Buddhism and I'm sure I may have heard of it or whatever, but the way we were on acid and you, and it was snowing and so you just said, life is suffering. That's called, that's called dukkha. And I'm hearing it because this is how dumb my brain is. It's snowing. So I'm like thinking to myself, what the fuck is it? I was trying to think of the classes you were taking. And I'm like, and then you go, the cause of suffering is attachment. And I'm thinking like, is this some kind of Eskimo tribal religion? Because I'm so fucking cold. But because you didn't call it Buddhism, I started, I took it in as in a much more pure way, like I didn't know what it was that you were talking about. And because of that, it was like you dropped this thing into my soul. It just went whoop in. And it's to this day, it's still rippling in there. Because it was a huge moment for me. But wait, before we keep going, what happened to Bear? I saw him in a Target parking lot once. And he was like, he kind of looked like a shell of his former self. I got the sense he was on some sort of heavy meds. And he had sort of abandoned all those sort of idealistic, ambitious, rebellious things we had been playing around with. He was such an important person because he never showed me anything. He never explained anything to me. But he had the cassettes of he had a guar cassette. He had a youth of the day cassette. He had a GBH cassette. It was like he was a walking black and white photo of an English punk with the makeup and the Mohawk and the safety pins. And you got to understand back in the late 80s, that was a pretty heavy fucking thing to front on people visually when you walk down the street. And I mean, I saw him break other skateboarders' noses in front of me and shit. Because he really was living. It wasn't a pose. It was like he actually felt that volatile. And I was a good kid that was scared of everything when I was really little. You know, like the idea of sex or the idea of alcohol when you're fucking seven years old or something. It's terrifying. You see your drunk uncle stumble in the room and turn on Playboy. The whole thing is like, you're just like, dude, not only is this stuff not intended for me, I don't even want it yet. I don't understand it. And so when meeting him, I guess, was interesting because I had to think more about who I was and like my behavior and what it said about me and my vanity and my kind of like, I don't know, my protective shell that I had. It's like he didn't really have that as much. And it went to some logical conclusion where he imploded. And I still don't know anything about that, why that happened with him. There was some darkness in his family. You could definitely sense from his father. I don't know if it was just a genetic history of depression, but that's all I can really tell you. I don't know where he is at, but I feel like he was in Asheville because that's where the target was that I saw in the parking lot. Isn't that weird? Trying to make sense. Maybe, yeah. So anyway, it's so entertaining for me to see you want to go back to that stuff. You don't think there's any unconscious divining rod that's led you back to that book? You think it really is arbitrary? Oh, no. I mean, no, I don't think it's necessarily arbitrary. I think it's like a nice sort of, like approaching it after having spent a long time doing as deep a dive as I have been able to into Buddhism. It's this nice kind of like, it's a balance or something. It's cool to see the Western mind seemingly discovering some of these ideas without maybe even coming into contact with them. I mean, I'm sure Camus must have heard something of Buddhism, but that's like, so I guess, not to like get too like annoyingly technical here, like in, this is like the main thing I wanted to talk to you about, which is, so in Buddhism, you have this, the first noble truth, which is generally translated life is suffering, but actually the real translation is there is suffering, not life, there is suffering. So it's a general sort of, acknowledgement of this kind of sense that humans have that things just aren't great here. And the word, as I've heard, it translates into, one of the ways it translates is wobbly wheel. It's like riding a cart with a wobbly wheel here. So this is a place where we are constantly thwarted in our attempts to basically, in the most dire sort of articulation of it, there's no pleasure here. And if you do find even the smallest bit of pleasure, then that pleasure is not going to last. And thus is really just a kind of pain. And whereas in existentialism and Camus, sort of articulation of this problem, he calls it absurdity. And the confrontation with absurdity, but that's what I wanted to ask you about. Do you think it's the same place that they've both sort of tuned into and given it different names? Yeah, I remember being really frustrated that the existentialist, the French ones especially, just didn't talk about Buddhism much. They just never mentioned it. So I remember reading book after book after book in, I guess it was freshman year or something. And just always kind of waiting for somebody to draw the parallel and explain the parallel. And they never really got around to it much. There are isolated circumstances, but one thing you have to remember about those books and about those guys in the 40s is that there's a lot of like dated sort of detritus from that time. And when you try to get into a book by Sartre, especially compared to Kimu, there's like a pretty heavy sort of chip on his shoulder. He feels like he's coming into a cultural situation and he's like, I'm not asking you guys, I'm telling you guys, there's no God, right? Yeah. And you can feel there's this hardcore agenda. And you have to think that at the time to sell a book, there was a certain sense of marketability that they were addressing, but they also had a war to fight against traditionalists. Right? Right. So Kimu and Sartre coming into the battle the way they did and kind of wanting to put their name down, put their flag down when you're young and you're reading those books, it's a little weird, because you're reading books from the 40s and shit and you're like in the 90s. And so our life is just completely has a different pace to it, the debates of the day are completely different when the Clinton was in office. Yeah, we're downstream. We also were downstream from if you want to call it work or whatever that they did. And because of folks like them, for better or for worse, it did change where we're at right now because of their philosophy sort of making its way into just about everything. Right. And you sort of as you're reading it in college as we were and as you are now picking up the book, you're kind of thinking about all the background and the context of the situation because you're like, Jesus, these people were rock stars, like straight up rock stars. And like nobody's like that now in philosophy, you know? I mean, honestly, if they were, I wouldn't know about it because I'm still reading the classics. Like, I don't know, I wouldn't know. There might be someone out there frothing at the bit or something, but I mean, that's what's so cool. That's what's so fun. You know, I never could get into Sartre, but somehow I just love Camus because like there, you know, Sartre seemed more like, I don't know, like a cudgel. You know what I mean? He was brutal. Whereas Camus, there's a similar brutality, but he's got like this nice poetic sort of like, it's, you know, velvet glove thing happening. You know, it's like really pretty and it's like, but also, you know, really intense to read. And there is that exertion, that extra exertion in there as he like pushes back against cultural forces that we don't have to push back against so much these days. Exactly, you know, yeah, like everybody sort of has always thought of Camus as like the softer, almost like more like some sort of Leonard Cohen figure, you know, in the trench coat or something poetic and romantic somehow. And then Sartre is more like Johnny Rotten or something. He's just gonna spit in your face, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I don't want Sartre's weird toad spit in my face. But Camus, it's like, you know, he's like giving you, he's like, he's put some, you know, he's got some sugar around the medicine, but not much. And, but again, I want to get into it. So I want to know what you think. Like, do you think it's just too much of a generalization to say that the first, the duke is synonymous with Camus' absurd absurdity? Is it the same thing? Did they both like pick up on the identical problem and or not? Am I just trying to like make two things meet that don't belong together at all? No, I think in the end, one would have to admit that they're almost, almost identical in a way. And there's certain reasons why I think I could say that with confidence, but the differences between them, I think you could immediately somewhat write off as semantic, like lost in translation things, right? So even if some of it's written in French or Nietzsche's in German or, you know, the Buddhism is like completely not, like you said, I mean, it's not life is suffering. Like those are, those are insane connotations that a lot of hardliners get wrong, almost like somebody who watches too much Trinity Broadcasting Network and takes Jim Baker at his word or Pat Robinson or something. It's like some of those people really need it to be self-flagellating. Some of those people need it to be, you know, they need to hate themselves or whatever. So they'll like take the connotations and they'll twist the knife into them and they'll make it a really negative kind of thing. But I think that John Casey, our sort of our mentor in this department, he would often say, you know, you can be black hat, but there is a white hat option at all times. And that's part of the nature of absurdity is like, you can see this in a more optimistic light, any of these tenants, right? Yeah. So, but I think to understand what those guys were trying to bring to sort of the, literally those French coffee shops or like young people, they were trying to, like the Beatles, they were like the Beatles were trying to say all you need is love or whatever. Yeah. They were trying to bring a certain paradigm shift, right? And so where Sartre and Camus meet in the middle is, I think that they wanted to develop a world in which you can judge people by and or talk to them about the sphere of their personal responsibility, right? Yeah. And this goes back to what you were saying about, they had to establish a talking sphere in which heaven didn't exist because traditionalists and religious people could weasel out backwards of any philosophical conversation with them because they had heaven and things like these devices, right? And that's what Camus called philosophical suicide, which is the act of weaseling out of the problem of suffering by doing this weird extra math to produce some potential relief in a fantasy realm was just the same thing as killing yourself because you've essentially, I guess, anesthetized yourself or diluted yourself or produced some kind of like obvious, sad, silly, lazy mechanism where you could imagine that you're, I guess, procrastinating you just think that you could like, you're playing this like wild pretend game that, oh, well, I am suffering because this is what God wishes for me here on earth. But when I die, there will be some great reward. Or he, his critique of Kierkegaard was Kierkegaard. And again, I would have to go back and read Kierkegaard to really understand his critique. And I really enjoyed the part when he's like just smacking around various like existentialists. It was really, it's really funny. It's like a diss track. You know what I mean? It's like a form of diss. But it's like with Kierkegaard, the Kierkegaard is saying something about the confusion is the sign of God's omnipotence or something. Forgive me, Kierkegaard experts out there. Like, you know, Kierkegaard is saying, and thus faith is the only way to connect. It's like, are you confused? Great, you've witnessed the power of the divine. And so now all you need to do is have faith. That's it, the leap of faith. And Camus was like, that's suicide. That's sad suicide. And then he talked about who's Cyril. And that was where I went and looked up who's Cyril and tried to understand it and couldn't at all and couldn't understand the critique. But it was a similar identification of there being some sort of imaginary mechanism that you could use to sort of, I don't know, numb this problem of suffering. Yeah, so yeah, and clearly any sort of religion that created a reason for your suffering that involves something you can't see in a fantasy realm was just a sad way to avoid the problem. Right. I think when you read Sartre, so partially I'm trying to tell you in a way, like Sartre's not as far away from the things you like about Camus, you might think they're like, they're kind of joined at the hip in this war that they're trying to sort of put down their defense line and say like, listen, you can't really make this, you can't budge us back. This world in which it looks like we're trying to rip away your God. We're trying to say there is no God. They were sort of the harbingers of the God is dead thing because they were standing on the shoulders of Nietzsche, but they were like, they really made it a cultural war to destroy the notion of God. And it looked really punk and it looked really a cervic and it looked really offensive. Yeah. But what they were trying to do was establish a world in which we can have integrity. Yes. So they were working very, very hard to try to explain how an individual in the modern world can have integrity. Integrity, which is something that Shakespeare and a lot of people worked on, tried to put forth, but you can't really have integrity or strength of character when you're just a subordinate pawn in this massive story that you're referencing that's called the Bible or something. If you're standing on the street corner, we did many, many times and had arguments with pastors and Hare Krishnas. I mean, that was one of our fucking favorite things to do on a Saturday, essentially. Yeah, well, either argue with each other over it or find someone else to argue with about it. Well, because it's a really fun argument to have. And I think it's especially fun to have when you're like, not that like, I think now that I'm like 47, my experience with suffering is double what it was when we were hanging out. Not that the content or the form of suffering might change, but the content kind of stays the same. So I have a different feeling about it now than I did back then. And I think it's so important for people to really like stop ignoring the reality. If you're suffering, I mean, isn't that kind of what Camus was saying is like, all the, forget the God stuff. It's just like, why are you ignoring this? It's not making it go away. You're still suffering. Whatever method you wanna use to ignore it is not working. The only way to like, and please correct me if my interpretation is wrong here, the only way to really be alive is to look this thing right in the eye and stop thinking that tomorrow all of a sudden it's gonna change. Cause it's not, at least it's not by ignoring it. You don't- Well, what you're talking about is to get to the point you're even talking about, like you said, we're sort of downstream from these things, these frontiers they had to argue, but to get to that point, they had to first establish that you're alone. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they had a lot of trouble doing that because back then, you know, popular culture was still, I mean, I've heard still, somebody's tried to tell me like America's still something like 85% Christian or something the other day. I'm like, that can't be, is that possible? Well, I mean, I don't know. I, you know, I love, I listen to Christian radio, I learn a lot from it. I love a lot of it, you know, but then every, you know, every once in a while, you just realized like, usually it's like the person, or like the preacher is like, you know, it's all, you're anytime you're like hearing anyone talk about Christianity from a pulpit, you know, usually it's like the personality of that person is warping these wild ideas in a way that fits there, what they think is cool. You know, there's something I love when you hear like Billy Graham or the hardcore preachers, who are just like, it's not what you want it to be. I mean, it's like you want it to be all like, this is that and sweet. It's not like that at all. You're doomed and there's only one way out. Whether or not I agree with that, it doesn't matter. But something about, I think that is where it's kind of adjacent to what these people are addressing, which is like, it's just not, here's the bottom line. It's not the way you want it to be. And, oh God, I'm listening to this Chogium Trumper Rinpoche audio book called, I think it's called Smiling at Fear. And it's like, it's exactly what we're talking about. Like what he's saying is, he said, many of us feel like we've been very bad girls and boys and that feeling is resulting from our inability to face the true landscape of what we are and look into all the dark corners. Because you know what I mean? Like, there's like the reality of what we're like, we're imperfect beings. I think that's what gets translated in Christianity's original sin. And, but people do a lot of work to try to ignore those parts of themselves. You know, and not, there's a lot of like, especially these days, it's popular to be a kind of exhibitionist, confessionalist or something. But that's not what he's talking about, you know, the cool stuff like, you know, yeah, you know, I was a sex addict or whatever, you know, but like, no, the real shit that you don't even want to admit to yourself about yourself. And, you know, the reason that you're so, that many people are constantly terrified is because they haven't done that work. They don't know what they are. You know what? You remember one thing you used to talk about that I loved and maybe you could talk about it now is the thing that happens when you're standing at the edge of a cliff. Do you remember that? I do, yeah. Can you talk about it? Well, you gotta tell me, finish the anecdote the way you remember it. The anecdote is I remember it as you would talk about it. Yeah, this cool way of talking about how you're standing at the edge of the cliff and because you don't really know yourself, there's a type of fear that appears inside of you. Some inkling of dread where you think, am I about to throw myself off this cliff? And, you know, the reason you think that is because you don't know yourself that well. You don't fully understand who you are and that blind spot produces within it the possibility that you really might jump. Am I wrong? Is that? No, it sounds familiar, but I have absolutely no memory of that. God, you were so good at talking. I remember the first time you were saying, I was like, oh my fucking God, it's so true. That extra sense when you're standing at the edge of a cliff, it's not, people say, I'm afraid of heights. It's like, you're not really afraid of heights. You're afraid of yourself. Wow. Because, you know, because you don't know that if right at that moment, that thing that in the past has made you do the things that you regret will appear and you just jump. And so it's, so in Buddhism, that's what I love, especially love like Chogyam and Trumpa, because it's this invitation to, and I feel like that's in Camus too, to like look it in the eye, stop running, stop running. It's time to look at it. Oh, well there, you just hit it on the head, didn't you? You just basically, the two most similar things about existentialism and Buddhism would have to be that, right? It's all about literally like, it's anti-escapism. Yes. Like if there's another way to the synonym for those things, it's anti-escapism. That's it, yeah, yeah. And I do think that's where like, people get really confused about Buddhism is because they, I don't know how many times I've been criticized for even talking about it. Like, what are you gonna just sit on the sidelines and not do anything in the world and meditate your life away? Like, you know, people who've never spent any amount of time with it. And, you know, like they, first of all, they're like, oh yeah, cause it's super fun to fucking meditate. You know what I mean? Like, oh boy, it's like getting a massage every time I sit still, it's so great. That's why everyone loves to sit still. That's why the whole world is so slow. You know, but yeah, it's, to me, it's like these two things are this, you know, it's an invitation to at the very least spend a second turning around and looking at the thing you've been attempting to evade. And like, I don't know, have you ever had that thing happen where you're like, I don't know, maybe you get in a fight with your girlfriend or like you, you do some particularly, like the wretched side of you comes out and there isn't reconciliation and you go off somewhere and you sit down and you're looking, you know, at whatever sad, lonely landscape you're sitting in and you're realizing that, yeah, again, you've fucked up your life. And instead of trying to like make it better, you just think, yeah, this is me. And then in that moment, there's this sad, like, I don't want to call it redemption. You know what I mean? But in that moment, it's like you make contact with yourself again, you know? And it isn't, as I say, it's not a good self. It's not the self that you would want painted in your oil painting that someone did of you. But it's like, oh, right, this is just where I'm at. Whether I like it or not, do you know what I'm talking about? Like, they're almost just that. There's a kind of liberation that happens in that moment. Oh, I totally agree. I totally agree. I mean, I think once in India, me and David were having breakfast and I don't know, it was one of those times where for some reason you were somewhere else and I don't remember where you were, but we were sitting across from each other and I had one of those moments where I realized we were talking about writing and music and how nobody was ever gonna pay attention to us and we were screwed and I realized in this moment, like, well, we could always just be terrible writers and terrible musicians. I mean, like, there's nothing stopping us from being a shitty version of that. And it was like this breakthrough. I remember thinking like, well, I'm just gonna do what I'm gonna do, either way, you know? But I think maybe for the people who are listening, who have never, ever looked up existentialism and never, ever, or always found it too obtuse or unnecessary or something, it does seem like you've hit on a kind of bullseye in that there's two issues we're talking about. One is anti-escapism and the other is the nature of absurdity, right? So those are two subtly different dynamics that you could definitely find in early Buddhism, easy, right? Sure. I mean, for me, the easiest way that I like to talk about it, kind of in my mind to myself is the Twilight Zone episode where they're all trapped in a box, which is based on no exit. It was kind of the greatest Twilight Zone episode of all time in my mind. Will you remind me of it? Cause I can only vaguely remember that one. Yeah, it starts in a black box and a ballerina, a drunk hobo, a soldier. And I think it's like a sort of like a band, like marching band player are all, they all wake up, oh, and a clown. And they all try to philosophically approach where they are. Is this the one where they all fuck the ballerina? That's Edward Peanussan's four, but. I can't go ahead, sir. No, it's just, it's awesome because Rod Serling basically took no exit and he just kind of filed it down into like a 26 minute long existential essay on TV. And part of my point here is like, these were the first times that popular thought had to wrestle with these things. Yeah. Because it wasn't a basic open part of the everyday dialogue for people. And that wasn't an amazing thing that Rod Serling did, obviously, is he would insert pretty complicated philosophical aspects of the greatest thinkers of all time into like a digestible little piece of television that anyone, a kid or a wine mom or anybody could just immediately start grappling with. Yes, yes. I mean, change the world in a way, you know? And so anyway, the reason why he did that, the reason why he put those characters in that room is because he, like Camus, was trying to bring us all to a common scenario that we can all address about absurdity and aloneness, right? Yeah. So you have to kind of use like a little bit of a thinking exercise to sort of draw this out. And I guess that's why you and I, when we were arguing, we would always draw a scenario for each other. Like, not literally on a piece of paper, but we would always say, okay, you're standing on a hill. Do you remember how we would always do that? Yeah. So hilarious. You would be like, okay, you're falling from a building. You're just telling me, don't think about the fact that I'm gonna hit the pavement in a second. Yeah. Do you remember that one you did in the house? I don't remember that one, but it definitely seems like it's in my wheelhouse because I do like the falling from the airplane. Honestly, man, I think that I was just, oh God. I feel like I was just in my journal writing something about falling out of an airplane. Well, I mean, there's nothing embarrassing about it because what you're trying to do, you're speaking to another person just like Socrates was trying to talk, do you know, to Heracles or something? You know, whatever. And one person was saying, like actually everything's made of water and you have to fucking come to the motherfucker toe to toe and be like, dude, that's ridiculous. And this is why. You can't just say no. You've got to break him down, you know? Yeah. And so the beauty of you that day in existentialism, like you kind of like yelled out, you know, like it was almost you versed the class that day, I feel like. And this is one of the only things I can remember from that class, but like Casey was sitting back just fucking laughing, you know, he was loving it because you were emotionally moved and cornered like and you kind of you are only saying something that represented something you were going through. It's it was an abstract to you. Do you know what I mean? And everybody else in the class was like, they just didn't see that it's this is about real life, dude. This isn't about what people wrote in a book and the tests coming up and all that shit. And so when you said, I'm falling from a building and my body is turning and I see the pavement and the fear is so profound. And you all you fucking assholes in this class are trying to tell me just forget about it. Just like meditate in midair, right? Yeah. And I just think that that is at the base of it. The beginning of the birth of a great thinker or the birth of a great artist is somebody who's emotionally cornered or put in a situation that they have to grapple with. They have no fucking choice. Yeah. Yeah. This is not an academic thing. You know, I wasn't picking up these books because I was like, I want to be a rich writer or some bullshit. You know, it's like I'm picking up these books because I've got a problem, you know, and I want to try to figure it out. And these people had it too, or they addressed it, you know, or maybe you had always had some kind of, you know, you'd always had this this problem, but you didn't even have words for it. You know, maybe you didn't. And so some I think maybe that's why sometimes when people meet Camus or meet Buddhism, certain types of Buddhism anyway, they get mad. They get defensive. They withdraw. They're not interested. I just don't want to talk about it because because it's too. It's like suddenly there's like a kind of a spotlight appears. And it's showing you this this thing that you all already knew was there. But maybe you thought it was just your thing. You know, you didn't you didn't think it was literally like the what it is to be a human, you know, and maybe that's too much or something. I don't know. I mean, I do think that's like the it's a lot. It's a heavy thing to hear some of this stuff for the first time or for just yesterday. I'm always getting I'm always getting like sort of spun by it, you know, like the you know, what it's show him. Trumpa says is related to the falling thing. He says the bad news is you're falling. The good news is there is no ground, you know, so it's like even worse in a weird way, you know, that's that's the angle that he's taking is like you don't really have a self. That's the problem, you know, like you don't have the thing you think is so solid and real. If you spend time really looking at it, it becomes at the very least sort of like foggly see-through, certainly not consistent or continuous and definitely like, you know, changing all the time. You know, if you're you know what I mean, not not not the maybe not some like the way he puts it is just like and somewhere in there, you find you find the strength to confront that reality and then somewhere in that confrontation, I think that's where. Trumpa and Camus maybe meet, which is that where there is something good here that's not that's real, not fake, real, real, real, fundamentally good. It's just good. I don't know if that's what Camus rebellion was. No, you're definitely, you know, you're definitely right. It one thing that people don't like about existentialism is that all of the words they chose to use at that time all had negative connotations just semantically, right? So everything was like your forlorn or everything's like you're abandoned or you know what I mean? And yes, we'll have a really bad reaction to that. And I think that's just almost you can just consider that a translation issue, you know, is it? Is it a translation issue? I mean, it's like, fuck, I'm going to look this poem up right now. Let me see if I find it. While you're looking it up, I would say that it's partially a style thing. And we know this now because, you know, Camus said that he wore that trench coat to imitate Humphrey Bogart. So the style of that time was film noir, right? And what is what's the revelation that film noir brought to the history of cinema is that there's no way out and the hero dies. Yeah. So there's no like there's no Hollywood victory in film noir. That was what was so special about it. So like the the hero maybe kills the villain and gets the girl at the end, but he's already drank and poisoned. You know, it's like it always ends like a Dostoevsky novel. So I think some of that was the style of the time was like the frontier of of literature and and and the sort of maybe like where World War Two was at, you know, like. You know, I'm not an expert on World War Two, but obviously a lot of existentialism was just taking from the slang of the era, you know. Well, this is OK. So this reminds me of it and I don't think I mean, maybe it is slang, but this is a spiritual, I'm sure you know it, because it's been covered a trillion times. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Do you know this one? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I feel this will make me países. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child a long way from home a long way from home. Sometimes I feel like I'm almost done. Sometimes I feel like I'm almost done in a long, long way from home, a long way from home. True believer, true believer, a long, long way from home. I'm so sad. You know, like that because that's the that's, you know, this is to me like the this is the reality where you might have a mother. But like humanity, where is our mother? You know, I mean, you can say, well, it's the earth or whatever. But like if you and I love that, I don't mean whatever. But, you know, there you must at some point face and you will or your dad, literally, the the the the literal reality of not having a mom anymore. You know, not having a dad and then what and then what? You know, like and you have to and then you're in that place. I think Camus talking about it's unrelenting, unfixable. What are you going to fix this? What's your plan? You're going to bring your mom back to life. What are you going to do? Well, you can't introduce your your child to your mom. Well, no, that's not going to change. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I can and I and I believe that there's some possibility of like, you know, connecting and I do have a form of spiritual suicide in that regard. But if you peel that story back and don't let yourself do it for a second, which is something another thing Trump says, which I love, which is disown that for a second, disown it. And just deal with that motherless child feeling as it is. Somehow, somehow you find this drink in just it, which I don't really understand. Yeah, no, I believe in that. I mean, I've experienced it for sure. Sometimes I think that's actually analogous to Peter Kropotkin in the birth of anarchism, too. Really? Because yeah, because he wrote that book, Mutual Aid and what he's basically saying. I mean, this is so shooting from the hip. But the reason why it's important is because it's not only, I mean, a similar similar time period, a similar movement, in a sense. But it's he's saying you can make laws and rules for people. But the spirit of human beings is good and will win in the end. And is what actually drives our behavior. Right. Yeah. So he's making this huge wager that like you can tell people what to do. But they're going to do it, you know, they're going to help their fellow man because people are actually just built that way. They're good. Yeah. So in a sense, he's he's got some sort of spiritual understanding there, you know. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, it's the same. It's the same brotherhood of Kimu and saying, you know, put away your fantasies. Put away your escapism. You're going to make it through this. It's OK to love life on earth, you know. Yes. That's what I like about it. Just that. And it's also it's the reason it's OK to love life on earth. Isn't because you have like, you know, and again, I'm not trying to to disintegrate or demean theism because I am theistic and I love it. I pray every day I pray I love it. But also I practice this kind of disowning of that for a second. And in that, you know, again, you know, in Buddhism, it's called the poisoned era, which is like you tell a story, you there's some, you know, pain. And then you tell this long protracted story about why all this must be happening to you. But if you just deal with the initial as it isness of the thing, instead of telling yourself some crazy story about it, it's like you get a first second, you get to live in a new place, you know, like it's it's it's like, you know, in that moment, you aren't a long way from home. It's just, you know, you didn't realize that you were running away from your runaway. You know, you are a runaway running away from home because the home is that thing when you just hit it as it is. It's pretty cool, man. It's a really it's a really interesting way of living, you know, and in it, I don't think it necessarily has to like disintegrate the possibility of God. It's just saying, well, OK, but here's this is what's happening now. You know, like, OK, let's do God or have God. We know that you can have existentialism and God at the same time because of all the great Christian existentialists that actually pioneered the thinking from the very beginning. I mean, Kierkegaard himself. So so in no way do I want anyone ever to feel pushed away by our language. And I and I think most people know that neither of us are anti anything, most likely, you know, they probably already know that we don't have any great grand allegiance necessarily. But Christianity can be used by its practitioner to reveal oneself. And Christianity can be used to escape depending on what their intention is, right? Right. So it's just like anything. It's it's, you know, it there it can be used for the wrong intention, at least. Shooting from the hip, that's one way to say it. But I think that we both have these this addiction to philosophical scenarios, which maybe just means, you know, we're from some sort of long karmic line of philosophers. But it's just a great way of like these talking points. I can I can give you a model and you can just fucking break it down and show me why I'm just my thinking error is perverting the way I live. You know what I mean? Yeah, man. I mean, yeah, that's it. And it is that it's like the world. The I think the world deserves. Deserves you and deserves you to be in the world as it is. And that that that place is so wonderful because it's everybody wants low population density. You know, like people like to go out into the wilderness and be alone. And it's like that aloneness, it's you don't need to go out in the wilderness. You know, it's it's right there for you. And there's something really, really. Really beautiful in it. But God, it's like. You know, I get why nobody would want to go there. And I get why people are, you know, and I don't mean it in any kind of condos anyway. Why people like fuck that. I don't want to think about that stuff. I don't want to think about my own the reality that I'm going to die. And I don't want to think about the reality that my parents are going to die. And I don't want to think about the reality that like all the bones under Paris that can move definitely fucked in the catacombs. You know, Camus fucked in the catacombs, right? Like if you had to bet, I would bet a million dollars that he fucked in the catacombs against bones. But the point is you just have to deal with it, you know, eventually. That's the thing, like you will have to face it eventually. You will have to. Well, that's that's when I got cancer, my mom died and my dad died. All my philosophical rambling, it was just like, what, what was that? I didn't know what I was talking about. You know, suddenly you're like laying in a crater. You're like, oh, right. This is what they meant. And, you know, my friend was reminding me in man's search for meaning of something that I completely not only forgot, but when he told me for I remembered it and then I realized I'd rewritten it in my own head. But Victor Frankel was talking about these people in Auschwitz who were going around saying, don't worry, we'll be out of here in two months. We'll be out of here in two months. And they had all this hope and joy and then like two months would pass and they were still there and then they would just die. They would kill themselves or they were like, you know, just get sick. And I guess he was trying to make the point of like they weren't facing it. Head on. They created this idea of a put of an escape right around the corner. You know, that's a pretty good metaphor for like in the beginning, when you were trying to explain Buddhism and you were trying to explain how pleasure is a form of pain, that's that's kind of what they meant, right? That that yeah, you can have your fantasy, but it will lead the logical conclusion of your fantasy will lead to heartbreak, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, except when you get to that, I mean, that's the problem. It's like, but when you get to the heartbreak, you're going to invent maybe another thing so that you don't. So you're like, OK, OK, but, you know, this next thing is coming. And then you can sort of imagine that you've put that heartbreak off a little bit instead of just like, all right, fine. This is what it's like, I guess. I'm in a world that's like this and it isn't like the fucking book I read when I was a kid, it isn't like it's this. And, you know, because I'm, you know, having had two kids, I have to confront what I did. You know what I mean? Like I invited these creatures into the world. And from and like, I have to really look at that and think. Is this a world that you would want to invite two of the most beautiful, sweet things that you've ever witnessed in your life into? Because if you can't say yes to that, what the fuck did you do? You psycho? Like, are you out of your mind? Why would you do that? You know, you can't you have to love the world if you're going to have kids here. But you don't want to love some fantasy of the world. You have to love the world as it is, you know, and think, OK, I'm introducing my children to this place as it is, you know, and maybe that's why I'm reading Camille. I don't know. But that would make perfect sense because you you are by having children like making one of the strongest statements that a human being can make to them. Yeah, yeah, bringing them in, you know. Yes. And it is a statement for sure, I guess. I mean, it's like, because I have to like, because I know I'm old, I'm old. I'll be dead and they're going to have to deal with my me not being here anymore. And you have to ask yourself, is it worth it here? Do you ever heard like there's actually like people who are proponents of like, do you know, I'm talking about the people who are like, then you shouldn't have had me, you know, or like the there's a whole yeah, yeah, movement around it. I think is it anti-natalists or something? Anti-natalists, you know, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, Frederick Brennan, who I just interviewed in that Q documentary, he talked about how he had a lot of like animosity towards his folks for bringing him into the world, knowing that he would have to deal with the body that he's in, you know? And yeah. And but I don't think that you can even before you can decide whether or not, you know, not just you should have kids or whatever it may be. You really you have to like come face to face with this shit, you know, and decide like, do is it does anything? Does is it worth it? Is it worth it to be here at all? Like, is it worth it? Or is it just like a tremendous, terrible, endless series of never ending complications leading to a kind of confusion and then you're dead. Well, yeah. And in addition to that, whether or not you decide if it's worth it or not, you still live this life as though it it was just a dream to, you know, like, as much as you make this great grand statement that you love it or anything, it still eludes you, you know, it still kind of pulls away from you and never lets you totally understand it and grasp it, you know? Yeah. Yes. Yes. It's so intense, man. It's so intense. You just like you're you know, like you're having that wonderful night. Or you're having that, you know, every day I have this with my kids where I'm just like, I can't grab. I cannot grab this. There's no way to hold on to this. You know, there's no way to hold on. Like the last last night I was talking to Aaron and I was in my in the dumbest way possible trying to comfort her because Dune, the little one is like been keeping her up. She's breastfeeding. And so I said something on the lines of like, well, don't worry. Because he won't be this baby for a long. And she's like crying, like, why did you say that? I was trying to make you feel better. And then I realized like, oh, God, is there a worst thing you could say to a mother who's like in this beautiful like garden of Eden experience with his brand new soul? You know, but and I heard tears are like holy tears because it's that recognition of like, yeah, you can't hold on to it. It's but also isn't. Emil, isn't that it that you want to hold on to it? Doesn't that say something about its worth or value? Yeah, I mean, maybe. Maybe that's why they made the Twilight Zone just like a black box, because, you know, that's not it wouldn't be philosophically stark enough if it was this beautiful Charlie in the chocolate factory and fields of flowers that they lived in. They had to put them in something that was just kind of bleak, you know, because when you examine consciousness itself, there's a conundrum there that it's almost never been solved in itself. But but the world as you experience it, this this all the dopamine that you're talking about, that's like flowing into your brain, all those happy feelings. I mean, that's that's another that's another dimension. We we maybe we only start to question our reality when that is gone. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, we're just left alone with no serotonin. Yeah, oh, God, left it low with no serotonin. Fuck, that's gotta be a song. That's right. When you're when you're in chemo, you know, that like, didn't you sit and think daily? Didn't you think? Why am I going through this? Because there's no serotonin. There's no, you know, you're just you're just blank. And there's just this sort of when you're nauseous consistently like that, there's you have to wonder, why am I staying alive? Well, yeah, yeah. And, you know, weirdly, that's that stuff. That stuff is so is like such as I would never wish it on anyone. I wouldn't want to experience it again. It was radiation, not chemo. Thank God. But weirdly, that stuff is like has this mystical quality of novelty to it. And like you are kind of you've been torn completely out of the life that you thought you were going to live. And in that, there's a strange accidental form of liberation or something that's happening. And then you expect that's, you know, that's the cliche thing. And I think there's an actual country song talking about the phenomena of like, I didn't feel like I was alive until I like started dying, you know. And or another way to put it is, I don't mean to keep quoting Turgenturbo, but he said, you know, generally people will start meditating when the bell rings to stop. You know, in that moment, you're there. Or and or another way to put it is, you know, you get lost. And all of a sudden, you know, my friend and I went on this fucking hike up in Pizca, we got lost. We turned the wrong way and like right three miles in the wrong direction. And and that the sun was going down. And all of a sudden you're like, fuck, I got to start paying attention here. And then you're there, you know. But it's for me, it's the those moments are more like. When when they come, it's like generally not something extreme is happening. It's just like that. It's a weird moment of like, what is this? It's my I have a I have a friend. She she's going through a divorce and, you know, all of a sudden, like everything that she thought was permanent is gone. And it it's not fixable, you know, it and she's grappling with that and permanence, you know, I don't know, man. I don't know if that was the cancer. I gave me that no serotonin feeling. But I've had it. I know what you mean. Like you're you're forced if you're forced to like. Get into the philosophical realm when you don't have ice cream in front of you. And, you know, things aren't working out and you're just like things are flat. That's why Rod Serling has you in that black box. You know, there's no there's nothing else to think about. There's no distractions, right? You know, yeah, now that I think about it, I heard this crazy thing that one exercise they do in this type of Buddhism is they put you in a fucking trunk. They just put you in a trunk and lock it. If you're just in the darkness for a long time. And yeah, yeah, it's one of the ways that's like forced meditation. All you're just in your mind stuck. Yeah, yeah, you're in your mind. But then you have then you then from that, that maybe the deconstruction of the mind itself starts happening and and in somewhere in there. Who knows that at this point, it's it's mainly hypothetical for me in the sense like in my meditation, when I'm like, you know, when you start realizing the kind of wavering nature of the self, for me, it comes in like very small moments, you know, generally, I'm just lost in my thoughts. And then I'm done meditating, you know. But yeah, it's a it's a curious it's a curious thing, man. I I really love this conversation. I, you know, but and I think it maybe it's appropriate for it to not have any kind of conclusive ending, you know, to just kind of well, I'll tell you what, like, first of all, I don't know if if you felt like I even started to answer your question because we're sort of just like getting going. I think we could do another hour on anti escapism as a as a concept between Buddhism and existentialism. But I think we could do another hour after that on just the component of absurdity. But if if you wanted to. There there's something I've always wanted to ask you a little bit about just just if you want to close on it, you know, I'd love to. OK, well, there's this to illustrate absurdity because we really didn't get quite there. Like if we really if you were reading a book on this, we would be in the introduction still. Yes. So. But but basically to to sort of introduce the concept of absurdity to some degree, there was some kind of Alan Watts style scenario or model that he would draw up for his listeners. And I don't know if Alan Watts said it and I read it or if you said it to me in a conversation in college, because I know that you said a version of this because we would talk at such length about these different examples like from the Bhagavad Gita or just examples, right? Like, yeah, about the nature of being born into this universe. And so one of them is this kind of cliche, really old cliche. I think it's Hindu about God becoming lonely or bored, which bored is the more existentialist word, maybe, but from Heidegger or something. But but then lonely might be more of a Buddhist word. And it says that he God smashed himself into the 10,000 pieces or something. Yeah, to to create a universe, this universe in which he would be entertained. Yeah, or have a family or have, you know, create that not one thing, create a thing where kind of like you having children, you know, creating a system like where there would be love reflects reflecting back on him, you know. Yeah. So does that I'm going to say one more model, but does that is that one of the older cliches that you remember hearing from? Yeah, yeah, okay. Was it was that exactly it? Or was there other aspects of it? Because I know I think it is Alan Watts. I think like Alan Watts's version of it or one version of it. I heard is kind of like this like kind of funny bouncy, like, you know, if you could do anything, then you would, you know, make a planet. And then maybe you'd put life on the planet and then maybe you would make the life evolve and then maybe you'd make a million planets and you put the planets all over and then maybe you'd make another universe and another eventually, though, you would think to yourself, I wonder what it's like to not remember I'm God. And so at that moment, you would forget your powers and you would find yourself in a kind of limited state. And essentially it's like the programmer going into their simulation and also giving themselves some kind of amnesia so that they could purely experience the simulation that they had created. And then implicit in that. Articulation by Watts was what could sound delightful, which is that eventually you remember, oh, I'm God. But then also there's something sinister that I don't think people catch on to in it, which is like, I guess I'm God jerking off. Like, you know what I mean? Like I I create this like incredible universe so that I can then have like some masturbatory experience of interacting with my creation, experience all the ups and downs. But inevitably I return to my same bored self and then I do it again and again and again and again. And again, and that in Buddhism is called samsara, the endless wheel of suffering. And it's a it's a point of contention among people who are really into like magic because they're like that's such a dismal way of looking at it. You know, like, you know, you're you're that's dismal. That's a depressing way to look at it. What's wrong with matter and interacting with matter? What's wrong with reuniting with the Godhead and remembering your divinity and using that power to sort of multiply your experiences and. Whereas in most and especially this sort of Buddhism I'm studying, it's like, well, OK, do that. Keep doing it. Just keep doing it as long as you want. Eventually, eventually, you're it's not going to work anymore like any other drug addict. And and then maybe that's where you experience that black box moment. Doesn't matter that you're a person or a god or whatever, you're still you're just there you are again. You know, now what? Yeah, that that was the example I was leading to essentially. But I think I can't remember if this is Alan Watts. But I mean, of course, everything when you say the word Alan Watts, I mean, the when you say that name, you're just basically saying. A guy translating, you know, Hindu mythology to you is not. It's not like he made any of this up, you know. Yeah. But so he's just he's just reporting to you something he read in a book and and what he read was something like. God is I picture it almost like maybe this is from the Bhagavad Gita. I can't remember you have to tell me. But like, like, it's almost like God is sitting on a meadow and is just bored and wants to watch a show. So he multiplies himself into two and the other entity sort of performs like a court jester. And at some point, yes, he forgets it's a show and he starts to get really invested in the story that's being presented and that's the forgetting that he's got, but starts to get, you know, maybe spiteful against this other form of himself or gets too involved. He takes it too seriously, whereas he forgets it was kind of all a game. So that's another form of the story, right? Is that he wants to play a game? The Leela. Yeah, it's yeah, that that is it. That's definitely I mean, there's all kinds of crazy psychedelic you know, versions of it and specifically in like the Hare Krishna mythology, but all over the place. Yeah, it's like all these cool sort of like the breakdown of it is almost mathematical and it's in here you do run into the a split that happens between I think what's broadly referred to as bhakti yoga and then what gets sometimes referred to as like impersonalism. And so the distinction between these two is one is eternalism and one is nihilism, essentially. So like one version of it, it's like there's this like you aren't anything at all. You know, maybe what, you know, in other words, like, yeah, well, maybe you think you're God or you're some progenitive force. But if you have any kind of. You know, that force is changing enough that at some point it's like, what is it even the same thing it was before? You know, and then on the other side of it, you get eternalism, which is which produces this really problematic reality, which maybe I'm just being too like non-nuanced with it. But, you know, the idea is, is like, well, what is a God? I mean, let's really think it out. Like what is a Krishna? Are there atoms in it? Does it age? Can it change? Can it decide to truly not be a Krishna or is it stuck? Is it a non-changing thing? If it's a non-changing thing, it's almost a disastrous like a combination. You know what I mean? Because you have this thing that's just like a perpetually and eternally stuck as it is, and it likes to do its thing and it's going to do its thing. But it's always going to do that thing. And then that's just a kind of it's eternalism. You're stuck, you're trapped. And so that's why I like the idea of like being born as a God as as exciting as it might sound to somebody like living in a limited earth form. You know, it's actually like you don't want that to happen because you're going to live a lot, lot longer and you're going to have all kinds of distractions and you really aren't even going to get to a moment of thinking like, wait, I'm alone because you're so infinitely distracted. You know, basically I look like there's a comic book. It's the funniest fucking thing. I wish I could the preacher. Do you remember the depiction of God in it was this adult thing that's like, I mean, it was like this, like it was like a love crafty and grotesque thing, you know, and and so yeah, that's that's. So again, it's like I'm not trying to diss the gods or anything like that. I love the gods. I love Krishna. I love Channing Heart Krishna. I think is a, you know, again, it can be misused, but Bhakti yoga is is at the very least an acknowledgement of relative reality. Right. We can fall in love. That's true. And to fall in love, we need other people. That's true. I mean, yes, you could fall in love with the world and all that stuff, but come on. You know what I mean? What are you going to do? Like is like the vast infinite universe going to like give you a blow job? Like, can you lick it? Can you lick the butthole of the universe after having delicious wine? You know what I mean? There's like a, it's like relative reality is that it's real. It's like to dismiss it as like an illusion or whatever is like, well, remember that time where that kid was telling John Casey, there isn't anything and he threw a piece of chalk at him. That's so good. Yeah, I think, yeah. People, they focus so much on God, like what is God? What does he look like? What? What is his job? What is it like, you know, where that is kind of seems like a unintended side effect or like tangent. What it seems like the story of God, all these stories that we're talking about, it's more an illustration of how to explain your own disconnection from yourself and or the universe. Yeah, right. So inside that disconnection is an early exploration of what is consciousness. This incredibly complicated thing, you know, like people say that we still don't understand how the cilia works inside of our ear. That the mechanism of the ear is so incredibly, incredibly subtle that we can't really repair your hearing. Right. Isn't that weird? I mean, it's just we can't even understand the mechanics of it, right? Yeah. Well, that's like consciousness is beyond that. It's we don't understand the mechanics of it. We can't see it yet. We don't know how to draw a model of it. You know, and so these guys were initially just trying to sketch it out. And a lot of these books they wrote that are sometimes maybe vaguely incorrect or, you know, flawed, or we're just early attempts at trying to scientifically get at consciousness. And, you know, Sartre, many people know said that his father, his philosophical father was Descartes. And Descartes said, I think, therefore I am. Right. And and John Casey told us that it's a little known super obscure fact, but that Descartes was was terrified and extremely disturbed to his core about if he was alive or not. Okay. So the man who said, I think, therefore I am said that because he wasn't sure. He was insecure, so he was just like trying to like reassure himself. Yeah, he was he was trying to figure out if he lived inside a dream. Yeah. So he's doing it philosophically, academically, right? He's doing it for the king in the court and he's hired. He's the hired thinker, right? To sketch out what is philosophy and integrate some of the church's thinking for the day and for the time. Right. He was he was hired to do that. But in addition, as he goes down into the nature of consciousness and starts recording what it means to be alive, he finds that privately, he doesn't understand it. And the more he thinks about it, the more it eludes him and the more scared he starts to get, right? Wow. So at night, he would, this is what John Casey told us, literally drink from a barrel full of water that he filled with tar. Because in his idiotic primitive early mind, he thought that that tar would glue his mind to his body or he would. Holy shit. Yeah, it would close the Fisher, right? It would close the that chasm. Yeah. So this guy, who's essentially, you know, experiencing a supreme form of mental illness, not necessarily, I'm not saying he was mentally ill, but he's grappling with this thing that we still today in 2021 are just barely beginning to start to understand. He's he's one of the first like scientists that's sitting down with the saying he said, Okay, so where can I start? And every time he starts trying to get into it, he's like, we know nothing. We know, fucking, am I even here? You know, he's got like this palpable grasp on the dreamlike quality of consciousness itself. So what happened was Sartre tried to take the beginnings of his work and pull it into a very technical breakdown of how consciousness works and the different component components of consciousness. And that's what he called the in itself or the for itself. And he got really technical into it. So if you actually, if you got into that part as of Sartre's work as a thing that could calm you down and like, like, let you start to understand what your mind is doing in every moment of every day, you could start to see him as a more benevolent character that's trying to help you, actually. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, yeah, I see you're saying the only way the only reason I was telling you about Buddhism is because I was in a corner, I was in a black box and I and I was like, how what am I going to do? What am I going to do? And I was panicking, right? So I was grabbing these books because I was like, there has to be a hole in the wall, which is essentially what they do in the twilight zone. They keep trying to like get on each other's shoulders so you can climb up climb up to the top. So these books were my were my like, you know, my my hooks in the wall, right? Yeah. In that sense, the reason why you experienced what I was saying is so such a pure distillation was because on the one hand, I'm not reading the books for any academic pursuit or because it was something outside of me. I was like, essentially trying to write the book myself too, because I was like, I'm recording with music, I'm recording this process of that, that I'm in that's just like Descartes, I'm having a panic attack, I'm losing. I don't know if I'm even real anymore, you know, like Ram Dass disintegrating. And then you're over here in the snow, you know, thinking I'm talking about Eskimos. And you're on acid too. And you're experiencing this with through the prism of your own struggle to understand just the sheer pain you're in. And so it's it's like when great music is made or or a great, you know, thinker like boils something down into something just so insanely tightly articulated. It's because they were driven there by a situational curse, you know what I mean? It's it's because they are in that position. And the key to absurdity that a lot of people might not. Talk about is that Camus his mission and start to and I think Martin Luther King to me is in a sense a modern existentialist because they and even Ian McKay and Minor Threat and Fugazi, they all said the same thing is even though this world is a formless entity that I cannot control and I am out of control and I am lost and I am forlorn and taken from my mother. There's only one thing we can do. To a sewage that to to to fix the situation and it's just literally to try just to try. Yeah, that's it. Right. Yeah, that's the best man. Thank you. That's it. And that's what what's the picture on the front of the mythosophist? Well, I don't remember on my book, honestly, because it's a bunch of essays. It's some dreary gray thing. What's the one on yours? It's it's the it's the guy carrying the boulder up the hill. That is the universal symbol for trying in the face of absurdity when he knows it's going to roll down the other side, right? Yeah. So what that's the key is like, it's all so dreary, it's all totally connotationally miserable, but the character never stops going back up the mountain. And so that was that's what he's trying to use to sort of convey his it's his black box, right, the mountain in the boulder. Yeah. He's like, why try? Well, he he just start comes away with it, too. He's like, well, that's why Victor Franco and why start are said that like the French occupation or the German occupation of France was like the greatest time of their life was because they learned that they learned that in the face of certain death, that actually trying was where the dopamine comes. That's where engagement like actually participating in your own life is where you reignite and you reconnect with God. Yeah. So it can be a completely positive outlook. It's just you have to see it through and the only person that's going to get to the other side of it and see it through as someone that has to. Right. Yeah. You're you're so brilliant, man. My heart just started soaring as I was here. I first this is why our best friends. It's the best. It's like so cool to like have you as my friend. Thank you, Emil. That was a really beautiful. Thank you so much. Well, it doesn't end like that for everybody. So we have to I mean, I feel like me and you have to look into this mirror of friendship and just and thank it and say we're just fucking lucky, man. Yeah, that's that's it. It's luck. Just like just crazy luck. Ah, I needed that, man. Thanks, because I think I left Camus like a little more confused than I thought I was. Thank you. It's like you just did a back adjustment or something. Thank you. Yeah, people find you. We should wrap it up. Where can people find you? Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm not done with any of the new drifters sympathy. So I'm working on the new Holy Son stuff and and trying to finish Grails and all my new records. So just they just got to keep in touch with us because me and you have a couple of things planned, too. But yeah, yeah.

Welcome to the DTFH Family Hour brought to you by Blue Tube, brought to you by Squarespace, brought to you by Cash App, brought to you by Dammit, Casper. You know, it's actually kind of coincidental that you're starting off with Los Casper a long time ago, unfortunately. But you're starting off with sponsors because your last podcast episode, the Rainbow Brain Skull, you were hour, but it's actually generally more than an hour. I did the same thing. I called mine an hour. It's like, what the fuck? Yeah, I kind of stopped saying the hour part, but I guess technically on some of the metadata, it's still there. But here's the point. You got sponsored by eyeballs in your last episode. And I wanted to ask you, how did you get connected with them? And are they what company is putting eyeballs into people's heads? And how did you get sponsorship from them? Um, it's a part of Elon's new move, not movie, his new company, the Eyeball Company. Kind of a weird slip up there, huh? Movie. Not that you would say that. What did I even say, eyeing? Whoops, no, you said it was a movie. Kind of like, you know, something about what's going on here. You must, right? Because you're like, you're sponsored by eyeballs. Tell me, go ahead, though. So it's a musk thing. Like it's I always thought that eyeballs are just kind of like organic things that spring out of human DNA. I didn't realize they were a corporation. Not just human DNA. I think it goes back 500 million years when the eyeball was first invented and there was no such thing as eyeballs before that. And life used to just be motion and bumping into shit. Love, dude, you don't have to sell your thing on my show. All right. I know you're just doing the copy right now, but they're great. I agree. But let's get to the meat of the thing. How'd you get sponsorship from the way that people transform photons and animals and all like creatures that have eyes into some and something we could see? How'd you get that sponsorship? I need that eyeball dollar. Oh, I just said I would suck off the guy that owned the company as one would get any sponsor. The guy owns eyeballs or Elon Musk? Both of them. Why not? Why stop at one? I would most I would I would give Elon Musk a blow job if he asked, probably. What if he didn't ask, but he just kind of like eyeballed? Oh, that's good, man. I don't have to talk to my wife about it. I'm sure she wouldn't care. She think it was weird. There was we are. We're starting off we're starting off goofy. And before we we do a DTFH, it's always I'm always in my head. I'm like, is this going to be a goofy one like a Johnny Pemberton or Brendan Walsh episode, or are we going to get into mindfulness like a Sharon Salzburg, Ragu Marcus episode? You never know. I mean, that's the thing. It's like, you know, it's like the way it's good. I mean, I do didn't I do know. You know, if I if I'm doing a podcast with someone who is in a comedian, I definitely am not going to if I even tried to do any kind of off the cuff improv with Sharon Salzburg, it would I think she would be like, not she I don't know. I don't know what would happen to be honest. I should have tried. Some of these people actually will surprise you with how like, like Trudy Goodman is a really good actor. And, you know, like a lot of them are like very artistic, but they've gotten like their their role. People know them for is the spiritual teacher or whatever. You know, Ram Dass played the cello before his stroke. You know, they expressed the cellist, the lover, the professor, the son. What are his other identities? Oh, my God, the race car. You like fast cars, which a lot of people don't know about him. He like really? Yeah. He was I didn't know he liked fast. Oh, that's right. He had a Mercedes Benz. Yeah, that's an airplane. Triumph motorcycle. That's it. Yeah, he was into like worldly stuff for sure. And he was not ashamed of that at all. He was delighted by things in the world. I, you know, I'd love to know your thoughts on this, man. I'm I'm listening to this book. It's blowing my mind. Have you read these? I think it's called The Seven Story Mountain by Thomas Merton. The Seven Story Woman by Thomas Merton. No, that's the Seven Story Woman is a different, wonderful, erotic book by Lord Rembrandt Pearl. And it's it's a delightful book about a guy like it's is naked and just lives in the pocket of the Seven Story Woman. The Seven Story Mountain by Thomas Merton Mountain. Yeah, mountain is really, really good. And but he became a monk. And the part that I don't like about the book is that he. Really disses the world, you know, like he thinks the world is like kind of a fucked up place and that the best place to be is out of the world in a monastery. What are your thoughts on the monastic life? Unlike avoiding everything, I wonder how long I could tolerate it. I think you said on an episode recently with Sharon Salzburg or Russell Brandt or one of those people about how, oh, man, I would hate it. I would hate to be a monk and how like day three, you would just kind of be over it. You don't want to shave your head and just and Ram Dass would would say it well, too, like when he was trying to be live the monastic life. He then became the horny celibate, meaning that none of that went away. He's just hiding it inside of him and choosing to transmute it there. But I don't know about being away from everything. I watched the show Avatar, The Last Airbender pretty recently. Have you seen that? Have you heard about this? That show has been recommended to me so many times that it's really kind of disrespectful that I haven't watched it yet. Because some of the coolest people I know are like, you got to watch this show. It's spiritual. It's like a teaching or something. Yeah. Next time you have the time for it, do it. Or when your son gets old enough, maybe like it'll be at that perfect pocket of you'll both enjoy it because it's it's one of those shows that adults like it and kids like it and teens like it. Why did I bring that up? Oh, so there's four nations, right? There's the there's the air nomads. They're the monks that decided that the world should just be left alone. And we're going to do our own thing and just play up in the air. There's the water tribe. There's the Earth Kingdom and there's the Fire Nation. And the Fire Nation just wants to destroy or conquer everything, not destroy, but make it their own. Yeah. And during the Great War, the Fire Nation ended up wiping out all the airbenders because the airbenders were just just hanging out there so they didn't have enough defenses. So I don't know. Something about something about the ultra peaceful life. I just always thought it wouldn't wouldn't pan out long term if there was some real bad guys after you. Oh, right. OK, right. So yeah. So that is the sort of geopolitical consideration of the Brahmachari ashram of the monastic class, which is you y'all need us like, you know, you for the for the monasteries to exist. Right. There's a sense of like, well, you're also going to need the laypeople who are like freedom isn't free. It costs people like you and me. Yeah. Yeah. The, you know, yeah, my critique of the thing is more like I just would I find it to be so like the idea of it to be so. Dull or something. And but then, you know, the the I think the react. Hold on one second. Awesome. Anyway, like it's it was it's more along the lines of like, God, I'd be so bored. But when you're reading Merton talking about what it was what it's like to go into one of these trappist monasteries, it the way he paints the picture of it, it's not boring at all. It's like essentially like another dimension. It's like a portal out of the world into some other place that isn't affected the way we are by the stuff going on, like the elections. Like he basically the way he puts it, it makes it seem like it's Narnia or something, you know, like something completely out of time and space. It very it very well may be so. And like we were so attached to all these different stimulations we have like election updates, getting the most recent thing. Like, have you been looking at Twitter and then you see someone posted something five hours ago and you're like, this is way too old. I need someone to post something within the hour. Otherwise, it's complete garbage. And absolutely, you can even get bored of we have every movie, every song, everything like all at our disposal on YouTube, Spotify, title, all these different things, Netflix, whatever. And you can be sitting on your computer for three hours and you're like, I'm I'm bored of everything. Have you ever thought about your cellular health? No. Why would we? Because cells are the foundation of our health that make us who we are. And one of the important building blocks of our cells is called NAD, which is vital for things like sleeping, breathing, eating, drinking. You know, only some of the most important stuff we do that we don't necessarily think about either. The bad news is as we age, our bodies don't make NAD like they used to. And here's the good news. There's a way to boost your NAD levels thanks to true nitrogen. True nitrogen helps counteract the effects of time on your body by promoting cellular repair. It also helps with healthy aging by supporting cellular function and metabolism to maintain overall health and well-being. True nitrogen can also help you increase cellular energy. It replenishes the decline in NAD due to stressors, such as lack of sleep and overeating. So you can keep up with your active lifestyle. Taking true nitrogen also helps with cellular defense at the face of stresses, such as alcohol consumption or immune stress, which is a form of cellular stress. True nitrogen has caught the attention of the scientific community with its remarkable ability to boost NAD. And they have over 10 clinical studies to prove it. I'll put the link at DuncanTrestle.com to those studies. Give yourselves a boost with true nitrogen. Right now, new customers can save $20 on a three month supply by going to truenigin.com slash Duncan. That's T-R-U-N-I-A-G-E-N dot com slash Duncan to save $20 on a three month supply.

I'm bored of all the Terence McKenna talks ever. I'm bored of all the Ramdas. I'm bored of every DuncanTrestle family hour. You can get there pretty fast. So perhaps these Narnia monks know something that happens after we. Because I've never done it. I mean, you and I both meditate and we're all about meditation. Oh, I need to meditate more and be more still and up the time we're doing it. But I mean, I've never done the multiple week thing of you. Hell no. I mean, multiple week, it's like no. And added to that is essentially like, and this is another thing I've been looking into and I'd love to know what you thought about it. The idea of renunciation. Not just like by going into a hermit like a hermit mode, but renunciation in the sense of beginning to cut yourself off from the things of the world. Like in the way Thomas Merton put it was literally like music. Like music of the world, like everything, like turning off all the faucets of the world. And then, you know, what happens when you cut? Turn all the apps off that you're running. And it's it's like, yeah, what he's saying is when you do that, you essentially are pulled into God or you're, you know what I mean? That that the whole world itself, this is the part that gives me goosebumps. The whole world itself, it's not that real. It's not much. And there's this eternal loving love, there's an eternal light that is not. That if you're too caught up in the world, you can't see it. Yeah. And the more you cut the world off, the more that light grows inside of you. And there's nothing better than that. Like if you're lucky enough that you should have the discipline to do that, then yeah, you go into another universe. It's essentially like, look, you know, how many of us have smoked DMT, taken ayahuasca, tripped out and in the height of the moment thought, God, I wish I could just stay here. Yeah, you know, like I wish I could stay in this other dimension, not stay high. But I wish I could stay in this completely different place. It doesn't seem that affected by the material world. And that's what he's suggesting. He's like, oh, every monastery door is a literal portal into a completely different universe. You know, but then I get really bummed out because it's like, I like music. Yeah. You know, I like the colors. I like the world. I like politics, you know? And that's where I think maybe that's just Catholicism, you know, or that's you know, that's all of them is liking stimulation. No, Catholicism, especially monastic Catholicism is not just like shrugging off the world, but kind of like not liking like that. When you hear him talk about it, when he's really kind of severe. I mean, it's a fucking month. Yeah. But he's really kind of severe about the world. And it's and they talk about Satan and how like, did you ever see the witch? Oh, man, someone was just talking about. I don't know if I saw the witches or hocus pocus. So I feel like I've seen eight witch movies in the last year. But I don't know if that's the one I actually saw. We had a spray of witch movies, didn't we? Like for a while, he's fucking hereditary. What do we hereditary really annoys the shit out of me? I love Ari Aster. We could I love all this other stuff. Hereditary. You know what bugs me about Ari Aster is he's too ordinary looking. Like I want some like kind of quirky looking old man. He's like a 32 year old professional looking guy. I'm like, you came up with the fucked up shit. That's not I'm not. It shows how our judgments are insane. Like, yeah, I'm looking at Ari Aster right now. Like if you looked at him, if you just met him, the first thing you thought wouldn't be you make some of this creepiest fucking movies ever. No. And yet he does. And like you really get the sense that he's like definitely tuned into the metaphysical world, man. Like I love so much of his stuff, but I just couldn't connect. What else does he have other hereditary and mid somar, which are both which are both good mid summer. Did you say mid summer? Because you kind of blurred out on me. Mid somar, mid somar, mid somar. You didn't see mode somar. I did see it. I loved it. That's that's what made me really fall in love with him. Let's look at his entire character here. Hold on a second. Let me look, let me see here. But that ordinary looking guy is standing in that barn with the 50 naked women all chanting and unison and the one that's like pushing his butt into the like teenage girl. And then like he's just standing there with his little director thing, probably going, all right, that was good. One more time from the top and action. And he he created all that. I don't know what the point of that is. Just I think it's the same point as earlier. Here's what he's made. Oceans eight, which I have not seen. That's the best oceans. Hotel Artemis. You didn't see oceans eight. I liked oceans four way better. The witch, which was fucking great. It comes at night. I liked it creepy as hell. And then mid summer was his like hit. But, you know, the the the thing that like I do like about his movies is like his the like his idea of evil. Yeah. And I'm not, you know, but, you know, the in the witch. What what I was getting at was like there's a part where like, I guess Satan appears. Let me see if I can find the exact quote from it, which was let's see here. Would you ever get a Jamie for yourself or you always want to keep it a small operation? I always want to keep it a small operation. I mean, I do need to. I have a Jamie named Aaron, who does like helps me do all my editing and production and stuff, but he like the as you have experienced with me. It's a little chaotic over here. The way I work is kind of spontaneous. And, you know, I wouldn't want to drag someone around with me through that, you know, anyway, the point every time we've interacted, it's like you're perpetually moving into a new place. Yeah, exactly. I remember I was in your your place where you had that that big green egg out front and the big picture of Neen Crowley Baba and then then you moved to kind of like across the street from me here in Silver Lake. They were a little more Highland Park. And now you're I don't know, you've been in like five different places in the last three years. Man, I'm definitely a traveling person. I move around a lot and I used to resist it. But now I'm just used to it's been like that my whole life. I mean, I don't think any of us have any kind of like perpetual identity necessarily, but if I karmically, it does seem like my karma is to to move around a lot. But now that I have a kid, I mean, that's why we came up here to the mountains is because we realize like, yeah, you can't do that gypsy life with a kid. You know, I don't think the kid would the art kids would would be too upset about it in the sense that if they're, you know, if you're used to a nomadic life, you get used to it. But we're trying to find a nice stable environment for them. That's like, you know, a house that's like their locus of existence while they sort of figure out who they are. But I'm trying to tell you what the devil said here, man. I want to thank Shutter for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I'm a horror movie snob. I love horror movies and I grew up on them. I used to have a subscription to Fangoria magazine. And what's been frustrating for me up until the existence of Shutter is that sometimes it's really hard to find those old school, hardcore, bad-ass, bucked up, mind-destroying terror movies that used to be able to find when you're a kid in College Station, Texas, and your dad had to work and you could go to the video store and rent anything except things that had sex in them. Those were the glory days for my experience with horror and they've come back.

Friends, I'm telling you, I'm proud that Shutter advertises with my podcast because I love them and I fantasize that one day, much like the brilliant Rob Shrob, I will be able to create some kind of show for them.

Thank you, Shutter, for sponsoring this episode. In the witch, the devil says something like, do you want to eat fine cakes and wow, nice clothes? And it's like something like that. But it's like the, that version of Satan is very Catholic and very Christian. And it's one where it's this refined personality that is seductive, that is, you know, gregarious and funny. And like, you know, all the things in the world that we consider to be success are like facets of the satanic energy from that particular perspective. You know, like eating nice food, being fancy, having an advanced personality, being famous, being like someone, someone, all that stuff, from Merton's perspective, from the monastic perspective, especially is like considered to be a convoluted relationship with God, like a reversal of what's actually important. Kind of like the whole time we are at the base of this like holy mountain, pretending it's not there and essentially like eating our own shit and pretending we're eating like fucking like steaks. You know what I mean? Because in comparison to being a servant of the divine energy, nothing the world offers you can compare. Like nothing in the world can touch it. And, and you know what I mean? This is Buddha under the Bodhi tree. What do you think about that? Yeah, I think we all know it deep down, but it's also like there's no shortcut to it because the Buddha had everything before he left the palace. He didn't just decide like, you know what, these things aren't going to make me happy. He experienced them to excess and then was like, all right, there's got to be more. And I feel like when you, not you, but when we try to be like, hey, it's not all about the money and fame, money won't make you happy. Like I feel like that's not going to work on anyone until they have the money and realize that money doesn't solve all your problems. It does solve all your money problems. As that one guy said, what's his name? The guy that, how to get rich tweet guy, Naval Ravikant. That's what he said. I don't know him. Oh, he had a great quote where he says money doesn't solve all your problems. It only solves all your money problems. That's cool. And yeah. So, but, but it's like we, we know it and, but we also keep learning it along the way. If that makes any sense. Like, oh, I thought this thing was going to make me happy and then it turns out it didn't. Oh, it may be if I have a hundred thousand Twitter followers, if I have a million, or if I have this amount in my bank account, or if I have this type of social thing, it seems like nothing outside wise ever really gets you there. That's why it's so tricky because it's always one step away from the action where it's like, well, next step will really be there, but you never get there. So much of your art has within it like this, a teaching that I do connect with Ram Dass, a kind of self forgiveness, a kind of acceptance of the self, a kind of like you're fine, just where you're at. So much of that, do you really believe? And how much of that do you, do you sometimes like scratch your chin and wonder to yourself like, what if this is all wrong? I'm split exactly down the middle. I like split half the time like it's, this is truth and I am enlightened. And the other half I'm like, these stupid rainbow comics, I'm an idiot. And these are all third grade concepts or not even third grade concepts. And it's so surface level, not good. And then, you know, you kind of swing back and forth between the two extremes. As I'm sure you do too. That's interesting. I do. But what's very interesting to me is that your comics seem like the opposite of surface level to me. Like they seem like very deep and psychedelic. And like sometimes that I'm looking at them, I get the Terrence McKenna effect, where I just feel like I'm tripping or something, or I'm remembering something. So that's interesting. And what is it that you remember other than what you didn't have? And if it wasn't in your memory at all, which brings me to what we're going to be discussing over the weekend, which is do you love like an old McKenna talks? He's always talking about the weekend because they're all at some excellent retreat. And it's like a small room and the coffee is like stale. But these are like these divine relics to us. Like, oh, it's an old Terrence McKenna talk where he. Dude, I love that you're roasting Terrence fucking McKenna right now. How like he escapes the scorn of all of us. We're all so blown away with him. But yeah, man, sometimes I listen to him and I think, wow, this guy is just like holding court right now. It's some expensive retreat. You know what I mean? Like, but yet still compelling. Like he's so brilliant. Oh, yeah. Terrence is probably it shifts, but most of the time Terrence is my number one. Not that I don't love Ram Dass and not that Ram Dass isn't my number one sometimes or Alan Watts isn't my number one. But for some reason, Terrence would always just stand outside of all paradigms. And ask, well, what is it that you're doing if you're not just getting drunk and praying to some guru or this malarkey? Well, I didn't intend to get into this over the weekend, but basically the rap is this. All boundaries are dissolving the boundaries between living and dead, the boundaries between male and female. And now the boundaries between past and future, where we see figures from the past emerge now through holograms and deep fakes, which weren't even invented when I was alive. But now I'm talking about them, which brings up this whole other thing, which Duncan hasn't even had a chance to speak in the last five minutes. It's just all been Terrence. Why am I going to cut off Terrence McKenna? You're channeling Terrence McKenna. You know, that is the, to me, the, all the political shit aside, all of our obsession with the state right now, all of the embarrassing 2020 fixation on the machinations of the American fucking empire aside. To me, the winter is coming that nobody's talking about because of the goddamn president being this like attention vampire. Yeah. A black, a fucking black hole of narcissism. Unlike anything most people have ever encountered. Thank God is that we are going to resurrect the dead. Terrence McKenna sure as shit is just on a hiatus right now. He is coming back as much as you can come back without a physical body. And that is going to be through an AI doing exactly what you just did. The only difference being that it's going to have at its disposal to some total of all of Terrence McKenna's lectures. And it will have gone through every single one of those created some neural map through which it can express itself. And we're going to like you for sure are going to be at a Terrence McKenna lecture. That's an AI that is adapted or adopted or sort of absorbed his consciousness via energetic Analyzation of all the things he said in his body language. Yeah. That's real man. And that's going to be true for everybody. And I that to me like that's the thing we do see every once in a while the click bait deep fakes are going to get his thing. But I don't think anybody has really gone deep. Don't you kind of look forward to it like I've noticed when this might be an older episode but you were bringing up this with Rogan and how there's going to be an AI version of Joe Rogan that's even more interesting and compelling than the real one. Yes. Because it's you know younger and it's got more you know CPU while Joe the real carbon based one is aging and yeah going away. But like I remember that his reaction was more like oh that's scary. But you're just kind of laughing in the back and there's something very freeing about everything like dissolving basically like every video you're not going to be able to know if it was a deep fake or not every audio you're not going to know if it was a deep fake or not even if it gets stamped by the official fact check company. There's always going to be people questioning the ministry of truth and the ministry of the other ministries that George Orwell fucking things. You know what I mean. The fucking ministry of quoting George Orwell the ministry of like yeah. Yeah man I the yeah the this sort of path in human history really does to me show how prescient McKenna was because he he was getting us ready for the singularity and he was talking about how the closer we get to this event the more our systems are going to melt down. And that this that's the big meltdown man which is like when people are dead they're dead. You know what I mean they don't fucking come back. You're not going to get to communicate with people who have dropped their bodies anymore. You can absorb their writings. You can watch their movies listen to them talk but certainly you aren't going to talk to them again and that you know all the stuff we are all going to have to go through the thing where people are going to see some porn of us like you know making love to like. I don't know fucking the guerrillas and already. Whatever it may be. Have you seen people. There's deep nudes now and deep fake video nudes too. I don't know if they do it for video yet but yeah there's already there's already software that X-rays a person. Oh yeah yeah I've seen that. I know what you're talking I wrote a little article on it and like all the revenge porn people are doing with it and all that stuff. But that that's just like you know it's that that is the I think one of the embarrassing qualities of humans is that. Generally any kind of tool that we have the first thing we do is try to use it to fuck. Fucking you know what I mean that's still the monkey part of us. And so like the sexual you know second chakra stuff is it always gets magnified or you know amplified or used or converges with our technology. And so yeah deep fake sex stuff all that stuff. But like post that now that that shit will ever stop. I mean it's going to get worse. It's going to be people are going to be having non-consensual sex with famous people through VR and some kind of like you know what's that shit called. I don't know. You know now yeah VR AR mixed in with like you know high tech fucking flashlights and high tech. Feedback gloves and so you can be a full sensory. That's what I felt was missing from Wally where like they should have been in these full haptic body suits instead of in front of TV. But I digress. Well that's where they got. I mean you know they were trying to be relatable probably. But yeah I agree with you. That's where they got it wrong. But like the the the great robbery that nobody seems to want to look at is the robbery of the personality. It's like we can tolerate the somebody. I mean it's still going to be annoying and uncomfortable and shitty to imagine that someone's like you know fucking an AI version of VR version of me. A deep fake version of me. I don't know if there's really bother you though. Like at this point like maybe in 1998 or something. But after having all we've been through and seeing like I don't feel like any combination of pixels on a screen is going to surprise me. Like I've already like ran it in my head. I'm like yeah do what you want with the pixel. Non consensual anything sucks man. Like you know what I mean. Like it sucks when like you let any kind of like data stream in and the data stream has got aggression in it. Even though a lot of times it disguises and then you know what I mean. Like I didn't I didn't want to talk to you. I didn't invite you in. So like you add to that that suddenly you know like your girlfriend is going to be like hey look man somebody made this deep fake of them like fucking you. You know what I mean. No bad press. It's going to be annoying. No bad press dot com. That's going to be the deep fake porn site. But like the the to me like where it gets really weird is when you add to it the duplication or the mimicry of a person's personality mixed in with that and not just fucking whatever it may be. You know and then suddenly like essentially like the thing that so many people consider to be who they are something they really have ownership over their personality. Suddenly that is no longer yours and that gets duplicated replicated and then people are hanging out with you living with it. You know what I mean in some AR world people are going to be hanging out with you. You're going to be their roommate and they're going to like have conversations with you and they can even make a kid with me. They can have a non consensual child with my DNA and have sex with that and have that person shouting racial slurs or whatever. It's all on the table. Torture you. Sure. I mean that's the other thing they're going to like who want like in the future no one's going to be excited about seeing a YouTube video of their AI self inhabiting a deep fake in somebody's virtual reality basement being burnt with cigarettes. Right. Like you know what I mean like and to me like those kinds of events as they come and not to mention all the like nefarious shit where someone's going to get a FaceTime from you being like please send me money. Oh that's going to happen with ads like there's going to be dead loved ones selling you like insurance as you walk down the street if there's still a street to walk down but all of that. But what's going to happen over time and this is the part I'm trying to get out here this is the singularity part is that we're gradually going to stop believing that our bodies matter that much. That's the thing it's like our duplicates are going to be so precise that the moment of death is just really going to be we're going to like go full circle to what they already say it is in you know certain cultures which is you're dropping your body. The difference is that in the past when you drop your body people hang out with you in their hearts and their minds and their imaginations. But in this case people are going to be hanging out with you for real. You know what I mean that's what I'm saying it's like we'll is I'm not talking within the next decade I'm saying 2030 years. The next decade is not unbelievable though. It's not unbelievable but I would say I'd say this is like 2050 problems but who the fuck knows like where suddenly people the people just start killing themselves not because they're depressed but because it's like I don't want to be the body right now like I'm just going to be my deep fake like I'll exist in the net that's where I'm going to be and some weird religion will spring up around it. And then what will happen is someone will kill themselves and their deep fake immediately will be like I'm fine I'm fine it didn't hurt at all. You know what I mean like but was is it real you'll be like wait are you serious yeah yeah my soul transferred you know what I mean but it's like that's just an AI. And the next generation isn't even going to find that strange. Well right I mean that's going to be one of the big problems that's like one of there there's so many of these like technological difficulties that are right around the corner from us but to me the hair raising goose bump stuff. My friend is that what they said about the end of the world is true the dead will come back to life and be judged hang on I'm going to disconnect my phone I don't know I'm suddenly getting calls. Sure thing this episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Mattress chew you chew that mattress and get 5% off with your code trust. Trussells. Yeah guys this is a great time for a commercial. Yeah we've got a new sponsor it's collects code French bread mattresses they. Yeah they made a French bread so very comfortable very soft to sleep on you got to take a shower the next morning but it's great is like you don't have to get up to get that midnight snack you could just chew right down into your bed. Yeah and call your doctor if you you get an erection the last longer than 36 hours after sleeping on French bread mattress. Yeah yeah definitely call your doctor no matter what if you get an erection the last 36 hours because the doctor will come over. Now I want to tell me something man what do you think about this you know this is like the idea of like the book of revelations all these like end of time prophecies you know they they they involve like the resurrection of the dead. And like you know we all envisioned it this is why people you know in medieval times like they I think this is where the whole like comfortable coffin bullshit came from is this idea that you're going to like wake up and at least you'll be in bed. You know and then like oh you know you kind of like you look at the tarot card what's the tarot card that shows everybody right judgment you know what I mean like this is like encoded in a lot of world religions but. Like is that like the singularity the end of the world the apocalypse it literally means not that we're all going to die but that we can't die anymore you know what I mean there's no way out. And we like and that doesn't occur in one magical day it's going to just be we wake up and realize that that was always the case because you can revive someone who died in 1932. If you know enough about them and perhaps we're even this this goes to the other boundary so McKenna said that the boundary between. Future and past and present would dissolve so that kind of comes along with the death one because you just grab a data set from the past and you bring it back and then it's like not dead anymore. All of a sudden and we saw it with gender in I mean gender it's always been happening but specifically in the last five years gender was kind of turned upside down. On his head before it was little boys do this little girls do this and now like you're a turf if you even. You know suggest there is I mean what's the definition of a turf I was about to ask you that someone that says that someone that's a turf is someone that doesn't think trans people are actually women or that trans men aren't. Men they're like a different that's called a turf I don't know yeah that's what it is it's tough to keep up with all these things you know how many terms get invented per day. That you miss out on if you're not on Twitter or tick tock or something well I mean that that's the thing the trans people they're like the most cutting edge among us because they're the ones who are like you know. Shaking that shaking off the tyranny of DNA assigned identity and that and all the cultural shit that is connected to that and like that's terrifying for a lot of people and I think the reason is terrifying for a lot of people is not necessarily. Because the people who are turfs as you say are homophobic even though that is a lot of them but also because they they grok that it this is the very beginning of the meltdown of everything as we understand it and that's terrifying that's terrifying I mean it's like. You know. The reason I one of the reasons I think that trans people. Get attacked by turf so much is more of a technological problem in the sense that the requires surgery for a lot of these people are like they have to take hormones and stuff to. Transition genders and there's a temporal lag in between that which is off putting I guess for turfs or something like that but the more that temporal lag diminishes. And the more even it becomes less of a permanent decision even though some people want to stay there permanently I think it'll become less controversial it's just right now it's because like. You know what I mean like what I'm saying is if we were to get to the point if where we could instantaneously transform into not just another gender which I think it would be like that would be something they did in school is they would be like okay everybody we're going to turn into women today. Like oh we're going to you know what I mean just so you can experience what it's like to be a woman. Like it's certainly or to feel a woman to have like a woman's body you know or like here's what here's what we're going to like do whatever this technology is some atomic. You know whatever quantum nano particle readjustments and who knows what the fuck it is a neural link in or whatever but certainly it's something that like doctors would do you know what I mean the same way when everyone was excited about psilocybin and psychedelics. One of the reasons they were excited about it is because they were they were wrong but they thought it was inducing a schizophrenic state. And so psychologists were excited because they thought okay if I can know what it's like to be schizophrenic I could work with schizophrenics right that was that I was one of the things that was exciting about it but. God damn how great will it be for you know men to know what it is like to like have the hormones the genitals everything of a woman just at the very least is be like oh that's what it feels like to be a woman. You know what I mean it's one of the great just to be able to squat on top of a mirror all morning just to only be able to do that but I was thinking about wait wait to look at your pussy. Yeah that is you're right that's like the first like that's what I would do first day. Oh but the I was thinking that we already do this in video games like if you select Princess Peach when you're playing Mario Kart or if you select Chun Lee when you're playing Street Fighter or you want to play as infested Kerrigan in Starcraft yeah whatever other examples I can give it's not like you're you're picking a girl or even just your avatar in a chat room. It's kind of like hey look I'll be the girl for this or for Halloween during the midnight event where the roles are reversed we're kind of fine with it but like you said since it's a long. Maybe people don't like to think of the surgery yeah it bugs them to think of surgery and and I've heard all the arguments before I don't mean to get into the big thing of it. The big thing of it I know that it's weird with with kids or with sports and you know there's always every now and then there's a Rogan episode that's kind of deals with that you know there's this person in. Transports that shouldn't be in the women's category or whatever but those are I feel like those are the little cases. Right yeah I mean I think I think like the world we're talking about here is not so much that it's just that that's the beginning of it I mean yes and that the the irreversibility of it I think for some people is is part of the like. Controversy and the I mean if we in the temporal lag in between like recognizing that you're a woman in a man's body and getting to enjoy body that resonates with your consciousness. Well you know and also that seems to imply like an interesting like you know some kind of interesting karma you know if you like get into the idea that we all plan our incarnation that some people are entering into this dimension. And that there's there's their their identity is a different gender than their body is like curious to me in the sense of like what a what a what a for a painful incarnation to choose yeah you know to have that sense of like. Like not being comfortable in your in your own body and then also what's I think controversial about is some people when they do transition they realize like oh I didn't I didn't I didn't want to. And then they for and then people are hard on them it's like well they were the most adventurous people ever that they would like be that. In the expressing themselves as they like pictured themselves that they would do the experiment in that regard you know I think that's pretty like like. That's like I have problems deciding where I'm going to eat you know what I mean but like to really commit to that level of like shifting is pretty like wildly courageous. And so you know I think once technology catches up that you're going to see in the same way like in a video game like if you ever played a video game with someone who tries to make their character look like them. Have you yeah it's weird it's like this is a chance for you to not look like yourself and you're literally trying to replicate yourself in the game. There's a lot of comics I remember like at least two or three comics had a joke about how when they start playing we they're they're such a basic dude that the default me was there. Like it just looks like them when they start just brown hair. That's depressing and funny. That's what I'm saying is like if I'm playing a video game I like I like I immediately want to change form. You know what I mean and like I think that if the technology was available that whatever it is the biotechnology to warp the human form instantaneously then the people who decided to maintain whatever they considered their original form would be looked at. And like it's just seem weird. Yeah like you don't want to be a bear. You don't want to like you don't want to have seven dicks. Yeah. At least get five at least like you don't want to know what it's like to have like beautiful breasts and like a massive dick and wings. Why would you want to be nothing but dicks. You don't want to just be a big pile of dicks that like rolls around. You don't want to be just one giant sentient burrowing dick. Like you know what I mean like what like you would be really a weird thing to not take advantage of that. The problem is now if you're like you know I want to be a sentient burrowing dick. And you end up getting the surgeries you know you start having like your like parts of your ribs removed you start getting your neck expanded you try to grow your head out and like you know what I mean. If you try to get something like attached to your skull that will help you burrow into dirt you're going to end up on the drudge report right. Like you're going to be one of those people where like holy fuck why did you do that. And you know what I mean the reason is is because you like had to go through surgery but with quantum technology all I'm saying is the whole whatever we define ourselves as right now that has anything to do with consistency of form. The consistency of the human experience is it's understood and written about. I think it's all going to break down as we like continue to accelerate into McKenna singularity. Oh yeah and not to get to esoteric but it is the DTFH but where our bodies are already doing that like the solid form we're in isn't this thing. It's like the atoms are already dying cells are splitting and regenerating and like seven what is it seven years you're a completely different pile of atoms than you were seven years ago. So it's almost like we're just willing ourselves to maintain this form until we don't and perhaps the shape shifting reptilians or when Ram Dass's face could change if you looked at him right in those beautiful blue eyes of his. Yeah just his face would turn into I mean I'm just reporting this third hand from other people's stories I never experienced that myself but it's real damn it and he. Yeah so perhaps we'll be able to just do that once we're our consciousnesses. What are you talking about shape shifting. Yeah like could we control just the actual physical form once we see that it's doing that. Yeah like whether you get you're going to actually live to become a Maharajie to just be like a a blissed out acid old man with a blanket like in this incarnation or next but do you think of whether you'll actually become that. Well that's one of the things I love about Buddhism is that the idea is yeah everyone's going to end up being a Buddha eventually like the universe goes on forever and for sure you'll be a Buddha. It's some point I'll be a Buddha at some point that's something Jack cornfield said to me is we don't want you to be a Buddhist we want you to be the Buddha Buddha. Thank you Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Yes sure by now every single one of us knows that a website is a perfect way for you to do online marketing to sell your stinky socks and filthy high heels online or to sell your works of erotic fiction. But a lot of people don't seem to realize that a website is a canvas that you can glorify so many things with for example somehow the domain name I shaved Bigfoot is available. I shaved Bigfoot dot com all your Bigfoot erotica it could be online for people to enjoy it doesn't just have to be a business website doesn't just have to be a Brooklyn delicatessen named after like an antique saddle company. It can actually be something artistic wild interesting and most importantly confusing. Let your website be an engine of chaos and yes engine of chaos dot net is available someone already plucked up engine of chaos dot com too bad. Make your website be a culture jamming distortion mechanism of pure occult power. You can do it all with Squarespace. You want to make a website in seconds because you're in the midst of some kind of mania and you think that you've discerned something that people didn't see in the Dead Sea Scrolls that folks need to see right now you could do that with Squarespace. You want to create a beautiful complex powerful deep high level website that makes people's brains tremble with orgasmic delight when their eyes fall upon it you could do that too. And if you want proof look no further than Duncan Trussell dot com which is a Squarespace website Squarespace they've got everything you need to create a beautiful website. Also if you want to do email campaigns they will handle that for you as well they do it all. Squarespace is just the place you need to go if you decided to take the next step into making your website to sell your custom ordered grills made out of rare Syrian ceramic or if you just want to make a website where you put out your theory that Bigfoot is out. Squarespace is actually a interdimensional being that travels from the astral realm and manifests here temporarily which is why we haven't discovered him yet and that is 100% true by the way I can prove it. You could do it all at Squarespace.com right now head over to Squarespace.com and try it out and when you're ready to launch use offer code Duncan and you'll get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Thank you Squarespace. So yeah this is one of the incarnations and in this incarnation we're like playing around with our particular life conditions and forms and stuff but the idea is most certainly that at some point in some incarnation we will wake up for real. Maybe not this one but that's okay I mean that's that's the other thing about Ram Dass I love so much is like within his teachings he managed to like create a kind of like immediacy be here now while also inviting people to drop that weird spiritual rush that everybody gets into. You know you gotta turn into Maharajie now it's like no you don't it'll happen but give it a billion in lifetimes. Yeah at least. At least or you know again I mean I think the the right now like okay there was a time not that long ago where people would walk around and they'd see a bird and they think wow look at that bird it can fly but they never thought like humans will be able to fly one day. People really thought it wasn't possible or that people will be able to go faster than a horse or that you know people will be able to go into space. You know that and I think like one of the right now our version of not being able to fly is we don't think we'll ever be able to like travel through time or access other multiverses. And I think that's right around the corner man like that's gonna happen McKenna talked about it I don't think it's just McKenna a lot of people are saying like this is our understanding of time and space is right now like already transforming just by the very act of being able to go into a space station. The possibility that we're going to be able to build colonies on the moon. That's going to produce a completely different human perspective and then the discovery of life on other planets and then the discovery of like that we've been visited by them and then that's followed by some kind of understanding that we don't know how time works at all. Do you think it's going to play out like that or there's also that theory that we never actually go outward we just go more and more inward and that's why we haven't heard from any other planets. Yeah right I mean that's yeah well I mean I think that whole differentiation between outward and inward right isn't that the hilarious thing is like we think there's an outward and we think there's an inward. You know and that's kept us really solidified in this particular like way of understanding history. And that one you know one of the liberating things that is going to happen I is some clearly time travel is going to happen technologically I've talked about it in the old days I was obsessed with it but like the you know ability for like. My phone does it the new iPhone does it it's so fucking weird you just like it's got wide or whatever that is so you just scan a room and it turns it into a 3D space. You know you talked about this with Tom Rhodes like a million years ago how we're building a time machine using these devices like so we're manifesting it into being and it's what. Like Arthur C Clark said about how we're our goal is not to discover God but to create him. Yeah her or is there. Or are you. Do you get I've noticed you got in trouble not to bring up controversy or not real trouble but sometimes I'll see your social media and it's like. Depending on the month you'll be getting hate from the left for making some joke during a serious time and now you're getting hate from the right for posting a picture of Joe Biden or something. Oh yeah well see this was like a delightful discovery. And it seems so obvious but you know Natasha Lajero posted a picture of like vote by now he's disgusting or something and then I just put that up because like. I guess I just to me like the dismaying thing is it just shows I've been I must have been a bit of a coward politically or something. When the joke is vote Biden out. It wasn't even a joke I like the elections were coming up. I just voted for Biden I feel like a real disc I really don't like Trump. I find him to be kind of loathsome and just generally disagreeable a very divisive human. And so I'll go to the exact thing. And I guess they I mean when I was on rogue and I said I was voting for Biden. I guess my assumption was people understood that I'm like I don't like Trump. I was like I don't I don't know. I mean that was a huge assumption. But because I put vote Trump out all of a sudden my Instagram was like a vote Trump out. OK you said vote Biden out because he's not in. I'm looking at the exact picture right now. It was enough of this filth vote Biden Harris vote him out. And so I got like this crazy amount of like QAnon weirdo hate like real like concern trolling like Duncan not you please you know this kind of stuff. And you know it was when I realized like oh god this is like this is what's in my Instagram. I need to like kind of like get the fleas off the dog. So I just started posting pictures of like Biden getting kids getting vaccinated like no fracking just like real basic not very exciting stuff. I put a picture of Rachel Maddow and a picture of Fauci you know and like the the eruption of like confusion and hate that happened was like excited as a like troll. It was exciting for me you know because like you know anytime you it's like finding an untapped energy reservoir. You know and so yeah that's that I've been getting a little bit of that but I've been having pretty fun conversations with some of the people who like will engage with me in a discussion. You know like you know man to me like and this is like cereal box wisdom here this is truly completely unremarkable shallow unimportant obvious shit man. But to me what's really amazing about living in the United States of America is that we have such wildly different political ideas and that we're still friends. You know like that's what I like about it that's one of the things I like I like some of my friends are QAnon people and they're they're like really upset right now and scared weirded out. But I love them I always love them you know what I mean like I don't care and it's dismaying to me to think that like sometimes when I call them if they don't answer the phone it might be because I posted a picture of Fauci. You know what I mean it's like give me a fucking break really like. Yeah from either side and I hate using the from either side thing and I always end up being such a fence sitting centrist but I'm not a fence sitting centrist in my in my voting but in the like I'm I don't have it in me to hate Trump people or QAnon people like I'm curious. I want to know what QAnon is. I know that it's about Trump traveling back in time and saving the world from satanic pedophiles which there's satanic pedophiles for sure but I don't know if they're operating out of that specific pizza restaurant or if the 4chan news is accurate especially because. Have you ever met a satanic pedophile. Have I met one. Yeah. I don't think so. No I haven't. If I had I would have called the cops on him. I've met a lot. I've met a satanist and a pedophile but not both. Just kidding. I haven't met either. You haven't met a satanist. I'm sure I've met a satanist. I mean you right. I'm not a satanist. 50% of 50% of you know I'm just saying that because you went to like a church of it once. Oh I've been to a lot of different churches. I've been a mosque you know I'm not it but. But don't you get curious like with not necessarily QAnon but I found myself looking at you know Reddit slash R slash conspiracy or R slash conservative to see what the other side of the things is. I'm kind of curious on what the other what the other side has to say. Well sometimes it's boring but. The to me that hopefully what every single one of us can agree on is like let's figure out what the truth is and because the truth is just truth right. So it's like you know is there really like I've never met anyone who worshipped Malik. I've never met a fucking pedophile. If I had ever met a pedophile I would immediately do everything I could to get them arrested and reported and to stop abusing people. I've met a lot of Satanists and never once have I met a satanic pedophile. I met Satanists who would kill a pedophile but I've never met like a satanic pedophile. And so you know what I mean like my my like subjective experience of like various religions of the world has been that at the very worst they can be kind of like insular and judgmental and stuff but I've never met anyone. And I feel like truly somewhat of opened up to me by now about like doing human sacrifice or what do you think of like the like Jeffrey Epstein temple just this little stuff like that and I know that's a huge jump to put you know QAnon and Trump and stuff and I've I still haven't even read what the QAnon conspiracy actually is. I keep saying I'm going to actually go look at what it is but I never actually research it but it wasn't it did you ever go down that rabbit hole look at his island see the temple sacrifices. I believe that there are bad people who are occultists and are doing whatever sacrificing children probably I don't even imagine that's the part that see that's the like if that's where I get offended not because of you but just because it's like man I've interviewed so many different occultists they would never hurt a fucking kid and like I've interviewed like so many people and meanwhile who have like like outsider fringe ideologies and man the one thing they all have in common as far as I can tell is they would do anything to keep a kid safe but that's but like let's look at it's funny that I'm having to I'm devil's advocating the side of the argument when normally it would be you you're a kind of like at this point like I guess I'm the devil's advocate because I'm defending occult which is Satanist and people like let's take let's take Muslims though like you'll say like well I've spoken to hundreds of Muslims and not one of them would be head someone but then in Paris like you have the ISIS people beheading so it's like a big blanket of people where you might use the word Muslim but it refers to two completely different people with completely different beliefs and ideologies so I guess occultist could be a very broad term. You look at the Bible and you see legitimate invitations to do violence to kids in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons and for whatever reason no nobody talks about that. You look at the Catholic Church and the fucking Boy Scouts you know what I mean? You look at like all these huge organizations that have been you know some of the Boy Scouts is bankrupt now but you look at like the Catholic Church is really they're completely bankrupt from sexual abuse, sexual abuse, lawsuits. Yeah man and the Catholic Church is like has notoriously protected priests who have abused kids who need to be in fucking jail and so to me it's like where we find a place where we all agree here regarding the QAnon like satanic cobble of pedophile things is we all totally don't like people who hurt kids in any way especially that way right that's something we all agree on universally. The problem is like when you get people who like love kids not like a pedophile but love kids enough to like do anything they can to keep their childhood safe and give them a chance to grow up without all the crazy shit that happens to people who've experienced sexual abuse right then and that gets exploited by people so that that love of kids gets exploited and people start filling your head with like stuff that may not be accurate. What is accurate there is sex trafficking. What is accurate there is most certainly fucking pedophiles and what is accurate is like there's people out there who don't seem to have any care for anybody other than themselves and like just want to gratify their senses in any fucking way they can where we need to be accurate if you ask me is finding out who those people really are and what religion do they really follow because as far as I can tell it's not fucking satanism you know what I mean. For every like weird story of some satanic fucking cult that does some awful shit there's there's literal stacks of court documents and transcripts and authentic proof that the Catholic Church has been hurting kids for centuries. You know what I mean like but yeah why are we dealing with that. Because that's old news we got over that like in 2010. Well yeah I mean exactly we just forgot about it. Q will be old in five years or something. Someone was saying like how QAnon is very successful because most of the time it doesn't predict accurately and the way our psychology works is that you get more addictive if the payoff is less frequent. Like if it paid off every time it's not that addictive but if it pays off every five times every eight times every 16 times then it's like oh I got to keep pulling the lover so I think they mix in accurate predictions and most of them are not accurate and do you still look at conspiracy subreddits or anything. Yeah I do I mean I've gotten a bit boring right. Well that's a problem it got subverted I mean and that that's to me like this the sign that they must have been doing something right because to me like the whole QAnon thing the radical conspiracy status thing it's like an indication of just infiltration and corruption it's like you know we all anybody with half a fucking brain knows that like there's a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes that you're never going to know about you know stuff that isn't even that remarkable just go on WikiLeaks and look at like I don't know the employee manuals they have there it's shit you would never know when you went to a Chili's it's not that interesting but it's still you know from a perspective like that's hidden data like you know the server routine at a Chili's or whatever like we already know like stuff happens behind the scenes and that's real and we also know that if as above so below if it happens at a Chili's it sure as fucks happening at the Pentagon I mean there's secrets and we know that there's mysteries and we know that and the human desire to like understand those mysteries is the call to God if you ask me it's like we all have a sense that there's not an elephant in the room there's a god in the room we can't quite see or grok and so one of the reduced versions of that divine like desire to encounter the cosmic manifests as people who are interested in uncovering conspiracies and so for me it's a real sad thing to see like a conservative regime hijack that very noble desire and turn it into a like pro-Trump propaganda that's the part that's dismaying to me because it's like you know you're you're taking it's it's it's no different than what happens when like soldiers get sent into shit wars it's like the thing they rail against Obama and Biden about is happening to them which is that they're very like legitimate sense that there is something wildly powerfully incredibly alive just behind the scenes is being turned into bootlicking and and and their like desire to like keep kids safe is being directed towards a fucking nonic as far as I can tell and again anecdotal evidence I know it's not like as far as I could tell like you're like if you really you're going to pizza places when it's like man there are a lot of funds out there that you could donate to that raise money to help people who are right now involved in lawsuits with the Catholic Church because they were molested they're compromised Donnie T is the only guy with the answer God man it's so frustrating it's like single-handedly taking them all down and again I'm not it's not the entirety of the Catholic Church I'm just saying and it's not just the Catholic Church it's the fucking Boy Scouts it's like I think they're they're like it's the pages in DC it's you know what I mean it's like it happens where the Olympic doctor guy yeah it happens it happens everywhere right and so it's like goddamn man or y'all it's like people it seems like these people like you're getting like the laser pointer like what you do with a cat you know what I mean they're getting laser pointed to chase after this like fucking mirage of some Babylonian death God do people send you evidence trying to persuade you or is it all just come on man I thought you'd you'd be hip to this but without actually sending you evidence oh no I get I get evidence and I get drops every day I well not every day but I certainly have poured over like a lot of the Maria Sabina stuff the Podesta emails like all that stuff where fishy but like it kind of stops after a while like I got into it not cue but the pizza gate stuff I remember reading it in 2016 but then it kind of just stops and there's no there's no more juice to it after a certain level well I mean you know I'm like I'm comfortable like not knowing I think the like the spirit eating stuff and the occult stuff the images I saw of it were like really quite disturbing and it you know I'm a new dad so it's like I'm like my like protection mechanism is like really like like I would I would do anything to keep my kids safe so when I see some like art exhibit that appears to show an effigy of a little kid and blood everywhere it just turns my stomach man I don't like it but that being said there's a lot of art that turns my fucking stomach you know what I mean like I don't know that's like that's somebody doing performance art and she's like a lot of her performance art that isn't in the occult is disturbing I'm not trying to do apologetics again man any any illuminate like anytime the light shines into the dark corners and kids are kept safe or people are kept safe from being exploited by rich people or priests or whatever that's a good fucking thing to happen you know and I you know if any good thing has come from the Q and on shit at the very least hopefully hopefully it's making people like reconsider any decision that they were making to like do anything that were hurt a fucking kid I don't to me though it's like when I look at that stuff I just think I don't have enough data here the Epstein thing is real though that's real you know what Tim Dillon says about conspiracies is where we think that it's going to be like a a six season arc with a nice finale and like build up and denouement and like all that but it's it's a soap opera it just keeps going the characters change but there's no ending it's just another twist and another twist and you never actually know because you're saying like oh I don't know if I'll ever know but there is no knowing in this game it's just you keep that yeah people have been looking at this for years and now it just has a different name well it's yeah I mean it goes there was a great article someone wrote connecting the Q and on occultism to Nazi occultism because the Nazis were really into magic and the occult and so that's another thing that's I've found really dismaying about Q and on is like you know they're using like legitimate like sigils chaos magic stuff and but they're connecting it to the state which is the same thing the Nazis did and so to me like that whole thing and then the other thing that bothers me about it is there's a general sense among them that they've like that they're they're like punk rock unique original when it's like no you're just a group of people that really loves the president and you know that's never been that cool you know what I mean that's always embarrassing and the difference in this case that makes it kind of indefensible to me is like in the past when you know stuffy people have been overcome with their love for the president to the point that if you say something shitty about them they shush you that's been like considered like just normal like conservative a conservative way to be so this part that sucks is like you're no different than when I was a kid sitting at the dinner table with my dad and my aunt and I decided to edge lord right and say some shitty thing about whoever the president was at the time just because I wanted Reagan just because I wanted to see my dad's face turn red you know what I mean and my dad is like never say that again you know what I mean there's no difference between QAnon people who are telling you to shut up for making fun of the most as far as I'm concerned the most embarrassing president and like any other conservative person who's tried to silence a person who just wants to have a little bit of fun making fun of like a powerful person which is literally one of the like main steam valves in society is you take the fucking you know you send up leaders you have to because otherwise they get too puffed up. It is punk rockin' that like there I mean it was like this with Bush but not so much but there really has been a very everyone is trying to bring him to bring Trump down but for good reason like the evidence is all there why they would be attacking him on all these different angles but just the fact that it's everywhere every social media account is anti-trump every show everything so in just oh yeah that they feel punk rock yeah right but still you're just a statist you know it's like when when uh when the and here's the other thing that sucks about it man is it's like these fucks they like to insinuate that like I haven't it's only Trump I've ever like said and it's look I know it's like pure hackery to make fun of a president it's not like some unique comedic angle but it's just as a form of like self-care you know what I mean making fun of like the how embarrassing the American president in general is just makes you feel better you know it's punching up and it's like the the to me what's the the the thing that's really dismaying about it is it's like of all the years that I've said anything publicly about any president made fun of Obama I think I called him a drone lord I can't remember what I said about Hillary Clinton I'm sure it was something shitty there hasn't been a political thing it's just like you're the president so like God Jesus you're gonna you're embarrassing and a lot of times you're murderous you know and so the what really sucks to me is all those times I never got shut the fuck up the implication that I was gonna be hurt they were gonna do something to me you know what I mean I've never had the sense of like being silenced yeah like I have from them that's happening during his supposed loss like I don't know how this is going to actually play out it seems like Trump is going to lose this one but don't know but I don't know I guess there's like a big group of people are afraid they're gonna like tattoo they them on your forehead or something if Trump loses like they have this whole world been built in their head that because I don't know if you watch the the Trump what are they called the rallies or anything but it's funny how they're painting the other side is oh it's going to be a socialist dystopia but then the actual left people are like oh no they're not far left enough they're these are like center yeah center left center right people but since they they can't he can't say like Kamala is a cop because then the crowd will just be like who cop and they can't be like he's it's like just get it right you know what I mean like if you're gonna like rail against the state or whatever or the deep state or whatever just get it right that's all you know like like yeah are you gonna fucking call Joe Biden a fucking socialist like really if they wanted a socialist they would have put Bernie Sanders in there they didn't let Bernie Sanders an actual socialist happen because all the democratic donors don't want to get fucking taxed at that level and so they put this centrist Biden in there so this like there's a lot of things you could accuse those people of being but socialist that's yeah and the left is already good enough at making fun of Biden even people left center no one's excited about Biden this was a purely get Trump out vote and you can see that I mean I don't know if it's it's either rigged by the deep state in which there's nothing you can do about it or Trump lost in which case there's nothing you can do about it so either way people should just be fine with it I think there is something you can do about it the fact that Republicans took a lot of wins in the Senate and the House yet didn't win the presidency really speaks to how people might have retained their republicanness but just been like I'm really sick of this guy he's gotta yeah get out yeah well I mean I don't I don't that's the other thing about it that's so bizarre to me is like people don't seem to understand that like being the president isn't just legislating you know it's like there's a lot it's your you there it's a persona thing and it's like you're influencing people to act a certain way and you're shaping people and you know the but to get back to what you said there's nothing we can do about it there's definitely something we can do about it and what that is is just have these kinds of conversations you know and have them with people who do where it isn't an echo chamber and have them with everybody and not be you know not like we like you you can literally troll to your heart's content stir up little ants nests of like people who love Trump or love Biden or whatever the fuck you want to do but like you don't like it's it's what Neem Karoli Baba said kick somebody out of your house but don't kick them out of your heart and it's like that to me is like the main thing we can do like if we if you've already voted if you've already publicly made people aware of where your political leanings are and you've done that with an intention of not being sanctimonious but because you want to shape the political landscape of your country if you've already done all that then all that's left to do is to try to connect with as many people as you can if you ask me if people who don't agree with you people you know that doesn't mean you can't get in a nice argument with them it doesn't mean you can't you know what i mean it doesn't mean you have to act like all fucking sweet with them online but it's like these people just like you want to be happy just like you and want food in their stomachs just like you they want a roof over their head just like you they want to feel important just like you they you know what i mean all these things that were all the same fucking person here man and it's like you want to talk about the real evil cobble of people hurting fucking kids it's anybody who is trying to make us forget that and and and that's the real problem it's like i don't give a fuck what your politics are in general you know what i mean i don't care at all i don't even want to talk about it with you most of pro life pro segregation pro police yeah the racist thing is going to throw me off man you know what i mean but you want to be pro life fine you want to be pro cops fine you want to be pro the banks fine you want to be a communist fine you want to be like whatever the fuck it is that you are fine you know i don't care about any of that at all the only thing that like i'm not going to be able to connect with someone on is like where it's like they're racist or they're like you know what i mean there's like a they're they're fascist or they're like wanting to like create some kind of awful ethno state or some shit you know what i mean exclusionary you know i but even then it's like god damn it man we have to have like the aspiration with each other that like we can find a way or that we can all really connect and still maintain our individuality without merging into some boring right wing or left wing pod of like you know people echoing each other and i don't know how to do it a lot of times it's rare huh it's like yeah i i feel like when obama was first elected there was some of that i feel like after 9 11 there was some of that i feel like there was some unity early quarantine and there was some unity right like the first two days of george floyd's death and then afterwards it split hard politically yep yeah and a lot of that was manipulated yeah and for one day it was everyone was agreeing i mean i think looking at it from a day to day perspective instead of some grand historic perspective like your brain probably wants you to do you know just like when you wake up in the morning praying to like not to not for me it's just like please god i don't want to let can i not be as much of an asshole to say you know what i mean like some basic simple thing like that like let you know i want to that's how but that's how low the bar is that's i set that yes i set the bar that low for myself because if i get up in the morning like let me be a messenger of peace in the world or any of that schmalti bullshit it just doesn't feel real but for me it's like i want to be a little less of a selfish asshole today you know what i mean like that i want to be able to forgive people and forgive myself and not be a dick as much that but also i like to troll it's like i'm sorry i like to put like pictures of left leftist leaders on my instagram just because it's astounding to see the the conversation that happens but also i feel a little like at the very least it's like well at least they're talking to each other in there you know what i mean at least there's a back and forth happening you know at least there's some kind of communication happening because it's when we're gonna have a civil war it should at least be on there exactly to keep it inside the phone diffuse the energy there you know what i mean and also in the conversations when i'm looking at them it sucks when people are like you know and i'm i'm guilty of everything that i'm accusing people of in general you know what i mean i'm i'm guilty of being judgmental i'm guilty of being divisive i'm guilty of being a sanctimonious i'm guilty of being uh high rhodi i'm guilty i'm i i'm completely guilty of these qualities and i recognize that being pretentious or whatever being lowbrow also but like you know when i see people in a conversation and right away the other person is saying like you go fuck yourself man that sucks but when i'm seeing people playfully interact with each other on there even if there's an edge to it it's still like cool you're talking you know like because at the end of the day i hey i can't believe i just said at the end of the day because like that's who we are you know what i mean we're we're americans we're more complex than the state wants us to believe we're more nuanced than the state wants to believe you can be a fucking drooling leftist fucking ecoterrorist and i guarantee you have more in common with some right-wing fucking pro-cop anti-drug person than you think you know and it's like finding that place is our job as people living in a country together and not letting the fucking narrative be dictated by rachel madow or by rush limbaugh you know what i mean it's like not up to them to tell us who we are and tell us what's right and what's wrong it's not up to them and it's if we are depending on them to let us know what's happening that's our fault yeah it is so i think i think this happens every now and then like there's not there's no rushing the like oh why can't we just be united again it's we just have to kind of ride it out well stop waiting for people to unite us that's the thing it's like the unification is it gonna happen from the state so stop hoping that at some point we're gonna get the leader everything we're not gonna get the fucking king arthur it's not happening we're gonna get like corporatist oligarch style people probably for a little bit now but on the local i'm talking the hyper local micro level which is you your family as jack cornfield says the part of the guard you could touch you know what i mean that's where you could do the work and that's where you can and i don't it's just like the the concept of the joining of heaven and earth or you know in psychedelic culture they call it integration but the like the idea is that you or in burning man it's like you want to be a participant you know and part of being that participant means as much as as much as you can authentically do it try to like connect with people you know it doesn't you're not going to get a disney movie style thing and it's not like you're going to come across a a pro-life bible thumping homophobe and convert them any more than they're going to convert you but you sure as fucking find things you can connect on that aren't political and have a nice chat with them without ever knowing that and that that's i think the that's the that's part of what we could do that's part of how you could break out of your comatose paralyzed state and also don't try to change them drop the agenda you know what i mean that's the other thing nobody wants to be changed i don't want to be turned into a fucking q anon pro chump person i know my q anon listeners if i have any left after this fucking rant that i know you don't want me to like convert you into like a pro biden kamala harris sycophant but and but i know it's kamala kamala god damn it even that's political you fucking oh my god transphobe fuck the point is man i like we still can have fun together like we still can like i don't know how many games of hearthstone i've played with people i don't know what their political agenda is but i've definitely enjoyed playing cards with them you know it's like that sometimes it sounds so basic and dumb and and like i know it's not anything revolutionary but jesus christ y'all like just figure we can figure this out don't listen we don't need to like the whole civil war shit that's being shoved down our throats forget all that you know like we're it's just this pandemic has got people all edgy and shit yeah that's that's the real tricky variable because telling people to calm down when this unprecedented uncertain time where yeah some i mean the social unrest was coming anyway but the pandemic is not helping the social unrest man yeah i you know one of my like and this is you can't get these experiences anymore but one of my like one moment i think about a lot man i was hanging out at this bar downtown with this mongol you know the outlaw biker dude you know their outlaw bikers are dangerous and i i'd gotten lucky enough to like be hanging out with one of them and i remember he like we're after a little bit we were talking i'm realizing like if i hang out with this guy too much longer something terrible's gonna happen you know what i mean but i was really enjoying his company and somewhere in that like conversation he looked at me he's like i like you and i was like i like you man but we both knew but we're very different beings you know what i mean like his idea of what's right my idea of what's right and probably a lot of places is not gonna meet yeah you're gonna start talking about the jews and another like two more topics or something i don't know i don't think i don't know what the mongol's like i don't think hopefully they're anti-semitic and and like again man that is where the tricky thing is is like we can't we can't be enablist you know and like that that's the thing like there does have you can it's easy to do spiritual bypass and can and like think that oh i'm just connecting with people when really what you're doing is getting seduced by a nazi you know what i mean like there is there there are exceptions to this but how often do you truly find yourself when you're going to get your coffee when you have made the trip to the grocery store when you have decided to risk getting sick to go to a fucking outdoor cafe depending on where you live when you do find yourself how often do you legitimately find yourself confronted by that level of person in general you're gonna run into an old person who probably whose body is hurting who's like you know what i mean nervous to be outside you know what i mean that's the reality of it and you could say hi and that's it no big deal simple is that you know that's who we really are that's what we really are but we're being told like there's go ahead sorry i've ran it too much in this podcast i think about that with biz wait wait i couldn't hear that last sentence you just chopped i said i've ran it too much i've been very rude go ahead you were saying i think about that with business oh no no you're good you just cut off but i said i was thinking about how people do business together who otherwise would not do business together like you might have some really racist i hate calling everyone racist that's my problem with the the hyper wokeness is that going too far the other direction than everyone becomes racist but let's take for example a real racist on ebay purchasing something from a black man but they didn't know that they're buying it from a black man they're just buying it from someone on ebay so then you have these people doing business together that otherwise would have probably never done business together yeah i mean you know like yeah the like i think it must be really fucking painful to be like a hard-boiled racist i mean that's a paranoid world to live in you know like and i you know i've had macawed brooks on and his identification of racism is a mental illness i think it's pretty good it's like clearly not real you know what i mean like you're clearly like another like if i'm afraid of like mailboxes you know and like we hang out one day and you realize like i'm legitimately angry and terrified of mailboxes you're gonna think man dunking you you're sick you know what i mean like it and i think racism is a kind of mental illness that a lot of people are afflicted with some like almost everybody really isn't not just tribalism like anything else but a more obvious historical mapped out kind of tribalism it's because i know that if we were all the same color i know that we would still hate each other culturally or for some other reason yeah we would find some other like thing but you know like you're looking at like people who are profoundly terrified of complexed people and have an idea about them that's completely wrong you know like that the way they think they are is 100 based on their complete lack of interaction with them and like that's the that's the scene and like the what for a lot of those people they live their life and like real fear and trembling and like i imagine that like if there was some weight and like do the neural link download maybe like you know give them the experience of what it's like to be a black teenager driving through the same place they drive through every day you know what i mean traveling while black the vr game yeah just exactly that you still play vr not as no i'm like on the fence about that new oculus i'm thinking about getting it i'm like kind of like confused about whether i should get a place the new playstation or the new oculus i'm not gonna let myself get both so i'm sort of like torn about that but uh do you vr yeah i was just thinking about how like years ago you i think it was when you first got the vibe and you were just raving about it and like how like have you tried vr porn it's insane and then still a week a week later it's kind of like oh right the vr thing it's weird how quickly you acclimate to this thing that is the future it's a holodeck and then for some reason the magic goes away after a week where it doesn't suck but you know you're not called to it i've had a lot of great vr sex experiences man it really is a great sex tool man i think it like it's sad that like these companies can't really like advertise that part of it but yeah especially for everybody out there oh i don't think it needs the advertising people just know on it are gonna go get it yeah like that yeah and people deserve to fuck right now you know like i i feel bad for a lot of my single friends out there because i imagine it's like difficult to meet people right now like how is that even working out i think it's like i've been catching wind of this new terror in the land which is just like kissing people you know oh that's right yeah that's the new age that's kissing yeah people are really scared i think a lot of people aren't fucking anal is like the only safe thing now a yeah anal i double anal is safer than kissing double anal cures covet are you still polyamorous and if so what is that what does that happen we are not polyamorous while erin's pregnant it's too complicated oh right right second one yeah like you can't it's like it's too like it's too much energy to spend yeah i know some people pull it off i didn't know she was pregnant again i thought that photo you posted was an old one no she's pregnant i should have just assumed it was current but yeah right around the corner thank you yeah but it's like you can't like it's not number one is where are you polyamorous during the pandemic at all or it never happened no we like we are our last girlfriend it's been a while man we um yeah when we just like realize like it will i mean erin is excited about it happening again i think more than my old ass but like the you just it's hard to it's hard to do you can't do it when like someone's pregnant it's like just not fair it's not fair it's like you know what i mean like it's it's right now it's life is not it's not i just i can't imagine pulling it off like we know we're going to bet it not i can't imagine pulling it off under ideal conditions either so that's interesting that's why well i feel like i'm always asking you polyamory questions because you want to try it no i don't think i have the energy i mean it's tricky you can the problem with it is you it is delicate man like you can really like it's not it's like the power balance is really like can can wildly like it's it's you have two people and then a third person you know and that third person finds themselves in this sort of you know if they like it it's a hard it's like weird enough to be seduced by one person you know but if two people are being seductive with you you know it can be like a lot i think you know shon and cast remember shon and cast right yeah up with them i i love their podcast that's very yeah yeah very ape so shon and cast were a thrupple with mara and then mara left the thrupple and then shon and cast are like it's weird going through a breakup and then still being in a relationship right they were still together but then the third person left yeah like yeah i'm like it is it's really tricky and like if you're like you know if you it's it's all about communication and like i'm not the best communicator and so like there's uh it's just very tricky like we're learning like we actually were at one point going to like a um marriage therapist a counselor highly recommend that for people in long-term relationships and like she was helping us figure out how to like ethically do it you know like you have to have in everyone's different but like certain rules like maybe like a group text you know don't individually text because like like everything needs to be like out in the open or all this stuff can start growing in the in the shadows and that's what you don't want because what you want is like union and like the excitement of it and the romance of it it's very romantic it's very exciting but what you don't want is for someone to get hurt you know you don't want someone's feelings to get hurt you don't want to feel bad and like you don't you don't want to feel bad you know i don't want Aaron to feel bad now we have kids you know so it's like there's a like like they're just it's a real delicate thing man it's like oh yeah certainly my idea of what it is when i was a kid imagining wow a threesome would be incredible versus what it actually is you know what i mean is like two very very different things you know it's unfortunately it's not though i've heard people like it you know get lucky and sometimes just find a person who just wants to fuck you know in general like it can get really like heavy and deep and like i don't know you know what i mean it's like mostly not the sex probably right mostly it's group texts and communication and rules and boundaries and i mean yeah mostly it isn't the sex anyway you know what i mean like if you think about dating and even though like at first you're always fucking or whatever and like if you really like you know that's one of the signs of learning how to have sex is learning weight this isn't just the sex this is the dinner this is the you know cool the text or sending a song to someone or the you know what i mean or relaxing or trusting opening up and then the sex is something that happens but what's really fun about probably like having a like sharing a girlfriend which is what we've done so far is like it's really like romantic and like i like watching erin like get crush on somebody you know like it's cool to like watch like watch her get excited when she gets a text from someone you know i don't it's like it's cool you know and i like that but that's the good side of it but yeah the sex thing is like it's awesome it's unique it's weird i never quite how is it weird just because you're it's like weird to have more than one person in the room yeah yeah and it's hot it's hot like it's sexy but it's like also weird like you but you know any any horny guy is like had ideas in their head about what it would be like and when you're actually there you realize like fuck i just have one i only have one body yeah and one dick i only have one dick i only have one body i only have one thing and it's interesting to like feel to people and to feel like it's like it's weird it's like i don't know how to put it man i sound like a complete dork but it's tough to wrap your mind no i bet people are perking up right now i i feel like when people hear the stuff they're like when you talk about this or when you talk about psychedelics or something they're probably like oh especially d t f h or such as myself oh cool i didn't know isn't that crazy i'm a d t i'm a d t f h listener and i'm on it right now honored by it's like an it's an infinity mirror i love where you're looking at yourself looking at yourself looking at yourself this is my eye for me this is why this is my i love this kind of podcast where we're just talking like it's the best it's like the way that we've like shifted topics i love it like no sense of connectivity you know anything just jump no completing thoughts i love it all random what podcasting is to me it's like the it's like so fun i i don't know about the listeners i mean but i hope they like it and yeah and you've got children not just real physical children but you've got podcast children which i consider myself one of like michael philip at third eye drops collin frangicetto at cosmic nod like so many people have podcasts that are like on the lineage tree of of d t f h yeah that's exciting i mean you know with the polyamory thing in general i feel like we got really excited about it when we didn't understand it and we talked about it a lot and then maybe hopefully didn't confuse too many people about it you know but we just learned about it more i still don't know that much about it the people i know who has successfully navigated those waters have taught me a lot like they've given me like insight into ways to like ethically do it but you know most of our experience with it is unfortunately been rather bumbling and like you know kind of clumsy and i like you know what i mean there it hasn't been as like um i don't know it like what's been clumsy about it has there been any juicy slip-ups like easily avoidable mistakes that other people could avoid yeah for sure it's like the biggest slip-up is you need to come up with some kind of like i don't want to say rules because it sounds embarrassing boundaries boundaries you need to come up with boundaries and and and where it flies in the face of most like organic relationships is you need to set those boundaries up right away so like the people that you're with you know have have does they deserve to know what's going on you know what i mean and it's like this is why a slow boil is good because like my my regret in it has just been like i think like there have been times where maybe people felt like we were ghosting them when really what was happening is erin and i were going through our own shit you know what i mean and trying to figure our own shit out and like you know conversing with someone that was like we were like intimate with was was causing more turbulence right as we were like working our own interpersonal shit out and like you know what i mean and so in that people can start being like hey what about me you know and then in that you and unicorns should expect that shouldn't they know a lot of they shouldn't have rights but they should like expect to be ghosted at points well i mean no i think ideally no like like if you do it right up front then they understand like listen this isn't a probably isn't this isn't a permanent situation this is going to be fun and romantic and and exciting but it isn't permanent and and but and also like i don't know i mean that's the problem is like it's just tricky you know and and that's the that's the reality with any kind of dating isn't it is like you know no matter what it's a human being that you're like with and uh you know they they deserve compassion and love and a sense of like being wanted and you know what i mean and like it's you know this is the problem is like once sex gets involved and once all that other stuff gets involved it can get quite confusing you know and and and yeah and like people you can accidentally like you know it creates a lot of karma you know we're talking about the thing that makes life happen you know so it's like there's a lot of energy there and and and you know i think any kind of amory is wonderful it's just uh figuring out ways to navigate those waters compassionately in the midst of going nuts with all the like sex stuff you know what i mean it's like it's it's really like it's a it's a lot of us haven't been taught how to do that you know it's not something taught in schools god knows you know it's not so people wing it right and like you know in there you there's just a lot of room i think to like confuse people at the very least including yourself you know and that's all but i highly recommend it for people who are you remember sex ed up for it absolutely i do yeah i remember being excited about it and then being completely bored hello
