You're listening to the Ducatrustle Family Hour, and we're going to start this. This is like some music I made, and just because of the way it sounds, it makes me want to talk in a certain way. This is so weird how powerful it is. Not like I'm bragging that my music is powerful, but just a certain background sound can literally change the way you talk. Whoa, that's crazy, man. I'm turning the music off so I can talk like a normal person instead of like the host of some kind of like murder slash romance show. Welcome. Today's guest is David Nickturnies, my meditation teacher, and today I'm going to go Alex Jones on you for less than two minutes, only because Epstein's partner in crime just got busted by the FBI. This is going to create some interesting moments for all of my fellow conspiracy theorists. I do not say that in a derogatory way. Conspiracy literally means breathing in unison, which is fascinating. That's a whole other thing to talk about. And I love Reddit conspiracy, and though I do know that some of the conspiracy theories that pop up on Reddit conspiracy are being placed there by people who more than likely are sitting in some kind of hoarder's cottage on a throne made of cat turds, every once in a while you get some real interesting shit that pops up there, and then later comes on the news. It's your job to be able to discern the rantings of someone sitting on a throne of cat shit versus people who are actually leaking information. PS, I'm not going to tell you what I'm sitting on right now. That being said, here's a conspiracy for you to investigate, and I'm beginning to think this might be the mother of all conspiracies. Actually, father, whatever you want to call it, grandfather, family, the origination point, the big bang from which all the great conspiracies emerge, and it's the most boring conspiracy I know of. Well, I just thought of it, but I probably didn't. I probably read it somewhere, and so I'm ripping it off from some enlightened being more than likely. It's like something Chuggum Trump has said somewhere down the line, I just forgot, because I was stoned when I was reading. Regardless, here's the conspiracy. What does boredom feel like, and what do you do when you're bored? And also, are there forces around you trying to convince you that there are solutions to that feeling you get when you're bored? That's it. Those are the, look at that. To me, that's the DNA of it all. It just popped into my head as I was staring at my phone on the toilet, when de-antwered. I'm reading this great interview with de-antwered, and it was like just a wonderful admonishment of people staring at the phone saying, the phone tricks you into thinking you're doing something, when in fact, all you're doing is looking at other people doing stuff. P.S. de-antwered has a new album out. I can't wait to listen to it. Now, friends, with us today is someone who has taught me a lot about boredom. David Nickturn, my meditation teacher, he's here. It's a great conversation that we recorded at our weekly DTFH family gatherings, which you can access at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. These are live events. We don't always, I guess, sometimes just members of the family come on and talk, but it's a blast. And so if you're interested, patreon.com forward slash DTFH, we're gonna jump into this conversation, but first, some quick business. Hi, my name's Derek Plank. I live in a small cabin up in the Appalachian Mountains, and I just wanna say, if anybody out there is feeling bored right now during COVID, come on up and fuck me. I don't care what you are. I don't care who you are. All I care about is that you are over 21 years of age and you can sitting at all. Just come on in my cabin and just fuck me down. You won't be bored anymore, trust me. I will, at least for a few moments, completely take away that gnawing, deep, horrific, strange, never any feeling that you've been hiding from and all your various activities here in the material plane of existence. Come bang me down. I want you to come up in my cabin, go to Duncan's website and use offer code CabinFuck, and I'll give you a free fuck. But if you don't use offer code, I'll let you fuck me for free anyway, because I just wanna lay up here till this pandemic ends, getting bang blasted, fucked, sprayed, and splashed on until this whole goddamn thing's over. Thanks for, uh, thanks so much for listening to my... What the fuck was that? Are you making me listen to that? Why are you doing this to me? I wanna listen to a murder show. What? Watch the news. I wanna watch a murder show, or just the news. Not this, not this kind of shit. Something about somebody who got kidnapped, or just the news. Or just the news. My apologies. Oh, sex, negative cortisol addicts that are enjoying my podcast. I'll do a whole episode on murder, don't worry. But for now, I'm gonna read as a form of incantation, a kind of counter spell against the dark forces that are currently working in the world to try to confuse us, make us think that humanity itself is somehow a festering plague on the sweet flesh of the earth, ignoring the fact that the earth is what creates humanity itself. I'm gonna read a poem, a poem that was sent to me from a health food store, and I'm gonna ring this bowl as part of the ritual. There's a dead fly in the bowl. Hope that doesn't mess it up too much. To the fig tree on 9th in Christian, and my deep apologies to the brilliant poet Rosgay for reading this in some wrong way. Tumbling through the city in my mind without once looking up, the racket and the lug work probably rehearsing some stupid thing I said or did, some crime or other. The city, they say, is a lonely place until, yes, the sound of sweeping, and a woman, yes, with a broom beneath which you are now too. The canopy of a fig, its arms pulling the September sun to it, and she has a hose too, and so works hard, rinsing and scrubbing the walk, lest some poor sod slip on the silk of a fig and break his hip, and not probably reach over to gobble up the perpetrator. The light catches the veins in her hands. When I ask about the tree, they flutter in the air, as much as you can, help me. So I load my pockets and mouths and she points to the step ladder against the wall to mean more, but I was without a sack, so my meager plunder would have to suffice and an old woman whom gravity was pulling into the earth loosed one from a low-slung branch in its eye-wept like hers, which she dabbed with a kerchief as she cleaved the fig with what remained of her teeth, and soon there was eight or nine people gathered beneath the tree, into it like a constellation pointing, do you see it? And I am tall and so good for these things and a bald man even told me so when I grabbed three or four for him, reaching into the giddy throngs of yellow jackets, sugar-stoned, which he only pointed to, smiling and rubbing his stomach. I mean, he was really rubbing his stomach, like there was a baby in there. It was hot. His head shone while he offered recipes to the group using words which I couldn't understand. And besides, I was a little tipsy on the dance of the velvety heart rolling in my mouth, pulling me down and down into the oldest countries of my body, where I ate my first fig from the hand of a man who escaped his country by swimming through the night and maybe never said more than five words to me at once, but gave me figs and a man on his way to work hops twice to reach at last his fig, which he smiles and calls baby. Come here, baby, he says and blows a kiss to the tree, which everyone knows cannot grow this far north, being Mediterranean and favoring the rocky, sun-baked soils of Jordan and Sicily. But no one told the fig tree or the immigrants there is a way the fig tree grows and groves at once. It seems to hold us. Yes, I am anthropomorphizing. God damn it. I have twice in the last 30 seconds rubbed my sweaty forearm into someone else's sweaty shoulder, gleeful eating out of each other's hands on Christian Street in Philadelphia, a city like most, which has murdered its own people. This is true. We are feeding each other from a tree at the corner of Christian and ninth. Strangers may be never again. Thank you, Ross Gay, for existing on this planet. If you like that poem, check out catalog of Unabashed Gratitude. It's on Amazon. And if anybody knows Ross Gay, boy, I sure would like to interview him for the DTFH.

David Nickturn. Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, no need to be blue Welcome to you It's the dunkitrustle video It's the dunkitrustle video It's the dunkitrustle video It's the dunkitrustle video It's the dunkitrustle video Everybody, this is my meditation teacher David Nickturn. Who has been generous enough to join us for this family gathering. Hi, David. Greetings, everybody. I can't see you, but I'll take it on faith that they're out there. They're out there, yeah. Well, it's a chat. I can't see them either, unfortunately. But they're out there. Okay, great. Wonderful. David, I am so lucky to have you as my meditation teacher. I'm not sure you're so lucky to have me as my meditation student. They've heard me talk about you all the time or mention you or talk about you. Lately, I really have realized what a powerful role you play in my life. Even if we go weeks without talking, I'm always thinking about the conversations that we've had. And so it's exciting for me to, for people to get to actually see you on video. And for us to have one of the talks that we generally have over the phone. Are they surprised I'm not a cartoon? They knew about you prior to Midnight Gospel. Are you, do people talk to you about Midnight Gospel or do you hear about? Sometimes, yeah. But that would be so badass if we could just animate me for these conversations. I agree. That guy would show up with my voice. It would be so wonderful if we could do that. You know, this is something I think in the future we can look forward to, actually. That's going to be a way to do it, not just in the blocky, weird CGI way that people are doing. David, I wanted to start off, if we could, by reading something that Chogym Trumper wrote that I have found that I cannot get out of my head. I love it so much. And I just thought maybe we could unpack it. Well, just before you do that, just let's everybody know, who may not know, Chogym Trumper was a Tibetan teacher who brought Buddhism to the West in 1970, which is when I met him. So that's the teacher that I studied with. Just to give it a little context, because everybody might not know that. So he's your grandfather. Okay. Well, he does feel like that. That is one of the qualities, I guess, of, I don't know why I feel like I know him, but it is a thing where I am, whenever I am reading him, I have this sense of familiarity with him that is very strange. Okay. So here's the, here's this thing that I found in this book that I, that this was actually the book that triggered you becoming my meditation teacher, because I've been reading this, this book at a Ram Dass retreat that you were at, was becoming increasingly infuriated with Chogym Trumper by reading it, in a way that I've never been in any spiritual thing I've ever read. I've never been like, I've never become angry. And, and so I was angry at him at that point in time. And, but still, you know, recognizing that anger as a, the anger coming from realizing what he was saying was resonating with what I thought could be true, but was fucking up what I wanted to be true. And so the, and so I was pissed and I, and I was up there and then I said something, I asked, because of this something on the line, do you think Hanuman is a, is permanent? And you heard me say that and I think that's when you thought, oh, well, maybe he's not such a dummy. I'm not sure what you thought, but we got to be friends after that. And I'm really lucky about because of that. Okay, so here's the quote I thought we could start off with. Well, I never thought you're a dummy. No, I'm not. That's, yeah. Not even close. Thank you. You'd have to, you'd have to do some serious work to get to be a dummy. Yeah. So I've been reading this chapter on fearlessness. And this is talking about Padma Sambhava's Padma Rajya, this prince that appears in a lotus flower. And this is the line metaphor metaphorically speaking, metaphorically speaking. And the way he, you know, yes, metaphorically speaking, but here is this paragraph I found that I just think really captures this joke in Trumpa, not just, you know, his philosophy, his ability, his writing. There is also a quality of fearlessness and enlightenment, not regarding the world as an enemy, not feeling that the world is going to attack us if we do not take care of ourselves. Instead, there is tremendous delight in exploring the razor's edge. Like a child who happens to pick up a razor blade with honey on it, it starts to lick it. It encounters the sweet taste and the blood dripping off its tongue at the same time. Simultaneous pain and pleasure are worth exploring from the point of view of the sanity of crazy wisdom. This natural inquisitiveness is the youthful prince quality of Padma Sambhava. It is the epitome of non-caring, but at the same time caring very much, being eager to learn and eager to explore. What does that mean? Well, that describes you to a T, Duncan. Oh, really? Don't you think? I think that what it does is, I want to give a real-world example. But wait, I want to ask you a question. If it does describe you, why did it make you angry? That's not what made me angry. The thing that made me angry was in the very beginning of the book where it said people who say, the thing I experienced was so powerful, I can't even describe it, are like people who have started lighting candles to their own insanity. And I'd been like, one of those people was like, oh, I was so high, that which I saw was beyond articulation. And therefore it must have been something so incredible because you can't say what it was. And he's saying, well, it could be that you're just making your ignorance into a God and then worshiping that. And that was the part that was eating me alive because I spent my entire college career doing some version of that. But this in particular, as I mentioned to you yesterday, my dog, my Chihuahua fox, who I've had for since 2012, just suddenly couldn't breathe and I had to have him euthanized. The vet just said, yeah, we can try to keep him alive, but he's suffering greatly. And if there's probably not much we could do, he was an old dog. And so here you are in this suddenly your day goes from the day every day has been in the pandemic, annoyed with the dogs, if anything. You know, the fox snapped at my kid and my child and Fox had started this new relationship where anytime the child walked by this like stuffed watermelon that Fox would sleep in, he would look in the watermelon, Fox would look in the watermelon and go, I have fun, which is really adorable and really sweet. And you know, anyway, so suddenly the dog is, you know, dying, you can tell. And now the dog is gone. So this in this situation, this is the razor is the loss is the now I have this empty watermelon sitting in my room. I can't even look out about crying. And but then the crying is the sweetness. And you have these two things smashing into each other at the same time. And I guess what I love about that is it isn't tiptoeing around that this is a child cutting its tongue. It's not saying, oh, the dog is on the rainbow bridge. Oh, you know, all this stuff. It's saying, oh, you've, you looked a razor blade when you got that chihuahua you got a razor blade dipped in honey. And I just thought maybe we could talk about that idea. Well, first of all, I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah. And there's no doubt at all that if you look into our hearts and our psychology, that loss and impermanence and death is the most profound and provocative thing to contemplate. And just for example, there was a great one of the wonderful things about studying with trunk room chase. He brought over many of the most accomplished and masterful Tibetan teachers of the last century, you know, the 20th century. So that through no good karma of my own, I got to meet many, you know, I saw that it's not just I thought maybe from which is a freak, you know, that he was so brilliant. And so, so accomplished in so many ways. But one of them was karma, 16th, who was the first. The original karma was the first reincarnation discovered in Tibet. So that's the oldest iteration of that whole idea of a tulkua reincarnate llama. So karma carries a heavy weight. He's the head of the Kagu lineage of the Dalai Lama is the head of the Gaila lineage. And there's two other main ones. But karma, when we met karma, it was interesting because your own teacher, you see your own teacher a certain way, you know, you're up close and you see, you know, things. So him bringing one of his, his gurus over. And I just saw him, it wasn't karma, his job to work on my psyche and do the surgery and do the interaction. And, you know, it was more just man, you, you, you experienced the manifestation of the Buddha, basically, to be really blunt about it. Well, that's what a Buddha looks like. That's in the cooking show. That's when they took the one out of the oven. You know, and we're the ones where we're like, oh, take this piece of pastry over here and do that. Then they come at the end because they don't have time. They take the one. Yeah, we're like the tray of ingredients or whatever. That's cool. Yeah. And so somebody asked karma, but well, what does an enlightened person experience? And I thought, well, that's good. This is a smart person. They're looking for a shortcut. Most people are looking for the long way around, you know. Yeah. If I do 45 of these and I widget this and I wangle this and I kind of stand on my head and I hold my breath and pinch my eyeballs for 1100 years, you know. So this person's just going, well, you're, you're a Buddha. What's the deal? Right. Great question. And so they asked him, yeah, right. They asked him, what does an enlightened person experience? And he just said impermanence, which was interesting. Think of the things he could have said, wisdom, compassion, skillful means, you know. But the unfolding of impermanence is really the closest we get to understanding reality. It's profound. And it's the one thing most people don't want to consider. So therefore it's a kind of medicinal quality too. Right. Just like medicine, you know, you don't necessarily think, oh, this medicine is so sweet and delicious. Right? No. So impermanence has a bitter quality to it. Does it not? Oh yeah. I mean, it's, you watch this animal that you've loved, its eyes roll back in its head, its tongue hang out. Yeah. And then there's no more life in this body. It's the first time I've ever, it's the most, it's a Chihuahua. It's the most nervous, it's the most nervous creature. And it's the first time I ever felt him like really relax, you know. Yeah. And the, and so it's bitter as, I can't describe you. I mean, you're weeping in a, in a room you've never been in before. The, my, I didn't see the vet who, I couldn't even look at her. My wife said that she's crying. She's crying. She just put another dog to sleep. So she's in an hour, she's had to euthanize two dogs and, and so yeah, bitter, bitter, bitter. And then, and you know, broken heart right now. And, but then also this other thing that no one wants to talk about either, which is, yeah, I'm fine. That's the part no one wants to talk about, you know, because then there's a performative aspect to grief. You know what I mean? Where you want to be like, Oh God. And actually I was looking at my grief and thinking, Holy shit, if this is a chance for me to be selfish for the whole fucking weekend, I could like order some whiskey. I could like do grief theater for my whole family. I could do, you know, but that, you know what I'm, but that's not completely, that's not really what's happening either. It's these two, if I, it's two things happening simultaneously. One, I went, if I'm in the grief part, I'm crying. If I'm in the other part, I'm like, what am I some kind of fucking sociopath? Am I not honoring my dog? But when you, I like what he's saying because he's saying these two things have happened simultaneously. Yeah. So speaking about simultaneously, I know, you know, that I have a sweet tooth for synchronicity. And, you know, there's a whole chapter in my book called tendril auspicious coincidence. So in the Buddhist tradition, we call it synchronicity, but it's more than that even. It's, and this is something like around somebody like Karmapa or Trungku Rinpoche, the atmosphere gets charged up with tendril or auspicious coincidence. So things seem to be firing synchronously. And I'm teaching in Japan this weekend. Now you might ask, how is that even possible? Well, I'm going to do it the same way I'm, I'm talking to UNL right now, but I'll be up from 8pm to 4am tonight and tomorrow night. And it'll be there Saturday and there Sunday because even though it's now in both places, it's a different time. So you can figure that one out when you, when you have time to think about it. How could it be now in both places and yet completely different day? Right. Yeah. So, and yes, no, it was this morning at 6, 6am my time. I was on for a Friday evening workshop there. This could get your head spinning thinking about this. Don't think about it too much. And we came up, we actually were talking about impermanence. That topic arose there. So synchronously, and we came up with the words in Japanese, which is Mujo is impermanence in Japanese. And then what's the relationship between the equation we were trying to get to is how do you thrive? How do you live a successful life? How do you live a full, rich existence that is not poverty-stricken, that's not desperate, that's not full of doubt and kind of fear? How do you live that way? And so the other word I was getting to was joy, tenoshi, which is Japanese. So we were just making this, we were jamming the way you and I jam. And so you put emptiness or impermanence together with joy. Now you have the third word was seiko, which is the same as your watch, which means fulfillment and enriching thriving. I was trying to get them to come up with a word for thrive in Japanese. So impermanence plus joy equals thriving. That's cool, man. So if you don't, and if you don't understand both, you're not going to thrive. So if you're having joy, but you are stuck there, you know, and kind of don't understand the impermanent nature of it. You know, that's what we call the debilok or the god realm. But if you understand impermanence, but you don't, you can't feel the joy. Bliss really is actually the right technical word for it, bliss and emptiness. But if you can't feel the joy, but you'll experience the emptiness or the impermanence, that's called nihilism. You just, you just root into a negative state of mind. So you're right on the edge of a powerful experience. I have one thought when you start telling me about it. I think about it from the dog's point of view, from Fox's point of view. That liberates everything when you think about it from other people's point of view. Everything gets much, much more expansive. And you also said, I killed my dog, but you did not kill your dog. You helped your dog die, that's the way I see it. And it was time for your dog to die. And we don't know, we don't have the Buddha eye to see where Fox is right now. We just simply don't know. But you know, there are versions of reality in which his continuity is happening from his perspective. And maybe he's looking at you and going, maybe he can still see you in some, you know, kind of, let's say psychic kind of way. So how you can communicate with him anyhow. You just tell him you love him and you just say, it was so great. You can speak from your heart. It was so great to have you with me. You're a great friend. And now you're at my couch. Well, you can say that. Sure. And just, but you're just sending it. We don't know where it's going to, but from your point of view, you can, you can do that. And then we have the practice of Tonglen, which is we take on whatever confusion or suffering that being might be having in transition. And we send them, we send them delight. You know, we send them peace and we send them, we send them the tenoshita joy. And a key point, letting go. It's okay for Fox, wherever you are out there, it's okay for you to let go of this life and move on to the next one. Whatever you think that might be, it doesn't really matter. You're sending out that vibration. So, um, but you know, I've had, I've experienced what you've experienced, total grief and bliss at the same time when one of my best friends died in a car accident. I was sobbing, but I was also practicing with it and sort of staying with the energy of who that person is. And we're human. That's our, that's, that's the deal. Sorry. That's just the deal. That's the deal. And that's the deal. And that's, you know, that is why I feel so lucky to have been working with you and, you know, the working with teachers because it, I did, I did get to, I did get to do the thing. You know, I, well, I did get to do the thing where I didn't completely try to escape into my head where I felt it when I was in there. I felt, I'm feeling it. I'm not, you know, I'm not, because that's the, I mean, I am the master of numb, master of numbness. Sounds like the shittiest heavy metal album of all. No, it sounds like the sequel is what it sounds like. The what? The sequel. But I, I am really good at that. I've become quite, so the practice of like, no, I'm not going to do that. This time I'm going to not just be a broken apart thing, but also have that mindfulness that, you know, let it exist within awareness. And in that it is a million times worse than succumbing just to the grief. If you succumb just to the grief, you'd go, you do go into just a sobbing, sweet, sobbing thing. But it's a weirdly it is. It's only one part of what's happening. But it's, yeah, impermanence and joy and the two things exist simultaneously. Or are they the same thing? Well, you know, here's, here's an interesting and this gets a little metaphysical and for our world that we shared with the Ram Dass retreats and the Bhakti tradition. So you could say it's the same thing. Well, one, right? That would be saying it's the same thing. But in my tradition, we say it's the same, but it's also distinct, not one and not two. So they're interdependent. But otherwise you couldn't talk. You wouldn't have a word for each one if it was just the same thing. Right. You'd go mush. That would be your only word in your whole language. Mush. Mush. Everything's mush. Yeah. Just mush together. But this is Buddhist Tantra. This is, this is the, the duality is not something you just try to wipe out with the like wishful thinking. Duality is powerful. Right. You have a wife, don't you? Are you the same? I have a wife. One thing? What? What kind of, what kind of relationship? We're definitely not the same thing. Can you hold on one second, please? Yeah, sure.

Thank you, Squarespace. This episode of your series, and the friends of mine who did get onto it, that eighth episode is pretty deep and I think it's true, you can correct me, that your mother and I are the only people who play ourselves in your show. That is correct. I mean, everyone, it's all from me. I understand. Yeah, but for sure, yes. You and my mom were the only ones who were animated to be themselves and that was intentional. Yeah, but your mom really walked through that, you know, not many people are going to have the experience you have with your mother, Duncan. That's just the bottom line. There's going to be a lot of confusion, a lot of anxiety around impermanence and dying and all that stuff. So your mom had really processed it, you know, and then she processed it with you in real time, very, very cool, very wonderful. And, you know, a lot of people can learn from that because most people fear death and they fear impermanence and they fear thinking about it and they fear talking about it. And it's the one thing that made the Buddha get out into the search. He would have just been a comfy guy. He would have been, you know, a comfy guy if it wasn't for experiencing impermanence and old age and sickness and death. So it does jolt us, it jars us. A lot of people don't like to talk about it. A lot of people have fantasies about it that may or may not be true. Right. I hear people talking about it as if they're like, you know, well, this happens and then the light and then the crystals. You know, I go like, OK, well, I'm glad that you have that view. But we don't know and that's the most powerful thing about it. May I ask you this question? This is something that's been haunting me throughout the pandemic because it seems like some kind of psychosis or something. But how do we know that this isn't death? How do we know that we're not in the bardo between actual life and, you know, our past life and our future life? How do we know? How do we know this thing that we are calling reality isn't just death, that we've already died? Well, so that's pretty easy to clarify from a Buddhist point of view. The answer is it is. We did already die. And from the point of view of what you're talking about is called the bardo teachings. Probably people have read the book of the dead or something. The bardo means in between state, in between, right? So in between what and what doesn't matter. It's the part in between. So this is one of the bardos. The obvious bardo, let's say the big print bardo as you died, your consciousness is having certain experiences, qualities to it and then you actually end up in another body in some kind of, with some degree of discontinuity, some degree of continuity. But then there's six bardo states. That's just one of them. Dreams is a bardo. Right. Orgasm is a bardo. What? Yes. Orgasm is a bardo state. And this very life, moment by moment life is considered a bardo. But that's more subtle, right? Like right now you're between your last thought and the next one you're about to think of. You're looking for it. I can see it in your eyes. I'm listening to what you're saying and I'm just thinking like, I have really fast bardos. I was, it's a premature ejaculation joke, David. Oh, good. But what? Okay. So let's talk about the death bardo. So the death bardo is described in the bardo, I think is that? Total. And so here we have all these descriptions of it. Now, how do we know for sure that that is real? And how do we know that this thing we're in right now, even though they would say, oh, this is the bardo of life, isn't just more confusion that happens in the bardo of death? In other words. Oh, well, wait. Yeah, of course. It's the same. Okay. What is confusion is having a sense that what is appearing, what's apparent is literally true. Yes. That's a good definition of confusion. Like you think a rope is a snake. Right. Right. That's the sort of obvious example. You think when you go to the football game and they go into the huddle that they're talking about you. Right. That's called paranoia. Right. Yeah. I've never gotten that high, but now I probably think that. Right. So confusion is just mistaking the way things appear for how they actually are. And so, of course, 99% of our experience in this particular wherever we think we are right now is has the texture of that. Right. You know, and so by tuning into in between states, you're actually glimpsing a kind of different aspect of consciousness or mind, which is extremely, it has certain qualities to it that are different than the confused state. And that's why when you practice meditation, what do you do? What do you do? Well, I follow my breath. And when I'm thinking, I go thinking. Yeah. But the breath is irrelevant. The breath is just a technique, a method for what? Bringing your mind back to some kind of present presence and experience. If you could do that, you don't need the breath. And the more progress techniques, you don't need the breath. You just come back to, I mean, like what? Just be here now. Wait. So that year now is considered in between the daydream or something? Yeah. Of course, if you're being here now, you're not in the past. You're not in the future. Oh, shit. And therefore, there's not a lot of thought that's relevant to that experience. The thought comes afterwards. I'd like to describe this to somebody else. All right. Look about it. The actual experience happens like that. That's how fast it is. And that's how death happens. So for Fox, Fox has one little minute there recognizing, you know, the reality and then the hallucinations come back because they have so much momentum. Right. That's what we all have strong habits and patterns. They just kind of create a little bit of a, you know, loop. Gotcha. It's so quick. It's very fast. And this to me, it just happened. Did you see it? It just happened now. I missed that one. But I want to chat with you a little bit about the concept of paradise, particularly the idea of the Amanides Buddha. Do you know how do you pronounce it? Yeah. Amitabha. I wonder if you can talk about that a little bit. Yeah. Well, there's, um, within the relative reality, within the confused states, there's, you could say relatively more positive and relatively more threatening. Right. Like if you just look through a day, we go, I just had a nice walk. We saw the sunset, me and Aaron, you know, all kinds of things are evolving and cooking there that you, you're, and you feel a little bit of peace and happiness. And, um, then you, you, um, come home and you see your dog, uh, Fox is, um, in distress. Yes. And your reality flips. It switches tone or mood. Yes. So that's, that's where the six realms come in that we've talked about, you know, from my book, Awakening from the Daydream, if people want to read more about it, the six realms are either relatively more pleasurable or more painful, just like reality is, right? Just like our experiences. Right. So the, there are certain realms in the higher realms that where there's a lot of good karma happening, a lot of good energy. I mean, Maui was that in a certain way. Yes. Right. You know, we, we got cranky and stuff like that, but nobody is serious about being cranky. Right. No. You know. So that's, that's the notion of Amitabha is the Buddha, the form of Buddha that, um, kind of connects one with those kind of more positive energies. And so therefore you have a ease, much easier shot at awakening there and getting enlightened. You're just not like fighting mosquitoes all day. You know, it's just that the atmosphere is kind of more, more, um, pleasurable, more positive, um, more compassionate, all those qualities. But what you're saying is, as I've read it, uh, the idea is that when you're dying somehow, just from the consideration of this being, you get transported or you, you travel to this realm, which is this paradise realm within, within which you can then, it still isn't considered enlightenment, but it's, it's, it's like a, I don't know. It's like the one time Rogan took me to some UFC in Europe and like, I, like they took him in a, when, you know, when the plane, like that we went to some secret fucking, like, I don't know what it was. Robin Williams was there. It was like a little airport lounge where there's caviar and and I'm like, what the fuck is this? But it's like the, um, this is, this is the, it's that version of that, but in the spiritual realm. So when you're making your soul pilgrimage or whatever you want to call it, if you're not quite ready to do whatever the hell it is, the letting go, the giving up the samsaric cycle or whatever that is, there's this place you can go that isn't human realm that isn't the, whatever full realization is, but it's a place where it's easier to practice. Well, it's like the first class lounge, isn't it? In a way. It's perfect metaphor, perfect, perfect metaphor for what you're saying. Yeah. You know, but, but it could become, and again, this is all the wheel of life really clarifies a lot, those teachings clarify a lot of this. It can become its own little form of golden trap for people and they got to have that and any sense of irritation or anything tricky to work with or challenging gets sort of swept under the rug, moved out to the side, you know, you have people who take care of those kind of things. And then it just becomes an ordinary God realm, which is completely samsaric, but it, you, you go like, well, I'm having a good time. So, um, don't, don't, don't bother me. And it's just another, it's another form of attachment. Now I love your book, Awakening from the Daydream. It's one of my top go-tos, Gris for the Mill, Awakening for the Daydream, the beer now, of course. And in it, you're talking about this, these are psychological states. Um, in other words. And literal and literal and literal. So in, so maybe you could talk a little bit about in this realm, the realm of the gods, and then I have a question after that regarding. Yeah. So basically the, the, the way that Trungpa Rinpoche taught this material, which is what I'm, what I carried on, carried forward with, is that for a modern Western person to understand these, uh, teachings, they clearly have an esoteric element to them. It's describing states of mind. It's describing experiences that we have, way, ways that we shape our experience. That's what the realms are. So another way of thinking about it is once we shape our experience, it, it, it kind of becomes literal. You know, so think of a homeless person, uh, in L.A. That, of course, the person might have a certain amount of depression, anxiety about their life, but the whole realm has kind of become quite literal. Um, you know, so, so it's hard to even get any frame of reference say, this is your state of mind. It doesn't have any meaning to say that to somebody who's in that situation. You'd have to work with the whole context of the situation. Right. So, you know, and the best thing you could do is improve the situation. Right. Cause that's called the hell realm. So, um, you know, there's a literal, there are realms, they say, of existence in which that level of suffering is nothing. You know, people are being stabbed in the eye and then recovering and being stabbed in the eye again or having molten lead poured down their throats and then revived and have, you know, real metaphor for suffering, which is the way I chose to talk about it in the Western context. But according to the fullest iteration of it, it's exoteric also. And like, for example, you're in a human body there. Right. We talked about the animal. Yeah, you are. No doubt about it. And then Fox was in an animal body. Yes. Now, could, you know, could Fox go to, you know, Fox might have to go through some, uh, experiences and then dogs are like very close to human. Maybe, maybe he's got some human qualities in him too. Or you look at people that you can see right in front of your eyes. They're turning into an animal as you're talking to them. Yes. Or I've watched myself turn into an animal. Yeah. Absolutely. So that's what the realms are both illusory, but the illusion can get very solid. Let's put it that way. Okay. So we're in a solid illusion right now, I would say. The realm of the gods and you know, I, I, there's a, I saw this video and it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen. It was a woman living in this ballet, this, you know, ballet like mansion, just every beautiful and she's like tearing up as she's being interviewed because there's too much construction and they're having to deal with construction of vehicles going by her mansion and it's upsetting her. She's crying. And so for her, even though these physical surroundings are like, I mean, a person in a homeless encampment would probably wouldn't even think that I will ever be in that place. You know, but for her, she, her mind state has produced a hell realm surrounded by, by God realm, by God realm. And if we take that to the mythological plane, there's this idea that there are these beat celestial beings that are disturbed somehow by their near omnipotence, by their eternal ability to have infinite resources, but then also the implication and this is what I, the real thing I want to ask you about. And I, and again, this is just maybe just literalism and woo woo bullshit and just, but it really, is there the possibility that in the celestial realm of the gods that we're talking about, which I do believe exists, that some of these beings are looking down on the human realm as a kind of homeless encampment and thinking to themselves, I want to, we want to help. We don't want, we want to get in there. We want to, I think there's a way that we can actually give aid to the human realm to upshift it, to transform it. Yes. Yeah. And I think one of the things about the Wheel of Life is there's a Buddha activating and manifesting in each realm. So there's always some possibility in every situation and this is, this is also impermanence, by the way. This is the positive, you know, remember Mad Magazine, the positive side of impermanence is that one, one thing that's impermanent is your, your embryo that was forest was impermanent and now it's a baby. Yes. Right. So there's the flip side that change allows things to grow, to develop. That's not often understood as part of impermanence because other understanding of impermanence is nihilistic. Right. Oh, it's all just bad news, you're fucked, you know. Right. So that's, that's not it. It's that things are shifting, changing by nature, dynamically, in real time and your mind is actually capable of working with that in that way without wishing it was other than it is. You have that potentiality, you can train it. But still, this, my question is more along the lines of aliens. The gods help helping. Yeah, like, like the, the, the, like, you know, one of the things when I started working with you and really reading Trump is writing and you know, one of the things that's very confusing to me is the plurality of Buddhas. That's, you know, because when we first hear about Buddhas and we think there's one Buddha, but then you start reading it and it's, it seems like there's thousands of Buddhas out there. Well, it depends, you know, what level, what meaning you want to describe to the word. For example, there are billions of Buddhas because all sentient beings by nature are Buddha. Right. Including ants crawling across your property. Their nature is Buddha. Oh, wow. Now, if you see it that way, that's called sacred view. Wow. And you don't just step on an ant because you're having a bad day, you know, and it doesn't deserve to live. And, you know, and you're more privileged or whatever. So that's, that's the purest view is that all the beings are, have that potentiality. I don't know any Buddhas who don't hold that view. I don't know any great teachers who don't have that view. There are many great stories about this, but when you walk into a room full of people, what do you see? What do you actually see? You see their temporal situation and whatever overlay and confusion and anxiety is, and then you see a certain kind of glistening, you know, kind of potency that may or may not be contacted or actualized to the extent that it can be, you know, and that's called compassion because you, it's not compassion because you feel this poor person is so, so low and I could help them. So if somebody was a God and was able to help somebody in a vertical way, the way you're talking about it, it would, they would have to have that recognition. This person is, I'm not going to save this person from themselves. I'm going to just help to help them to realize what's possible for them. Because you see it in them. You have to see it. Otherwise it's not compassion. It's just codependence. Wow. You don't, and you don't, and this is the ruiner of righteousness is the problem here because the moment you see that, you know, you can't unsee it. The moment you see it in all the, whatever the thing is that you have been enjoying scapegoating, the moment you see that thing you're talking about in there, it really, it's not like, how can you, how can you attack it? How can you be aggressive to it when you have seen what you're talking about in it? It's a, it really is. It cracks you open. Yeah. And it's a tall order because we have our fear and our greed and our anxiety. You know, everybody has that. So it makes you want to tighten up and hold back and not take a chance and have a strong point of view that's maybe got more force than it does in clarity. You know, so we're all in that, you know, that's also the seed of compassion is you were recognized to, you know, I mean, I guess the Christians say there, but for the grace of God, go I and that, and that what they would say. Yes. You know, that's compassion. But not if you view the person as kind of like a destitute, incompetent, incapable, you have to see the Buddha nature, the consciousness. And then, then your relationship to whatever they're hallucinating is going to shift. And it doesn't mean you become a gooey, loving new age. He kind of, it's all, you know, it doesn't mean that because actually what it could mean is you become quite direct in terms of communicating with people. So, you know, that's, that's kind of a possibility for us is to not shy away from other people's confusion. And then it manifests as skillful interaction with them, which has a number of different possibilities. One is nurturing and another one is being really direct. Like when you told me it was bullshit when I said that there, remember, do you remember? I bet you do. You, I was trying to say that I don't have any intention. And because I, we were talking about intentionality. We were talking about intention. You remember this? And I was completely, completely bullshitting in front of the whole class because I wanted to see, I don't even know what I was going for. It was very arrogant, I think, but I was trying to like say, I didn't have any intentionality in anything. Like I was just kind of like free Roman the world and just happened to end up sitting with you talking about Buddhism. And you said, you said in front of the whole class, you're like, that's bullshit. I did. Yes, you did. And it was true, which is why I hurt so bad because, but in a good way, it helped me, you know, I needed that. I needed that. That was a good one. That's it. That was a good one. You never do that. You're very rarely do that. But in that case, you had like really discovered or you had like had a chance to pull a thread of this, this story I've been trying to put into my life, which is because, you know, if we don't have intention, then we don't have culpability. If we don't have intention, you know, the moment you can remove intention, then all of a sudden, you're free of all karma or something, I guess. You know, you don't have to, you know, you can pretend that Yes, pretend that people that you have hurt, you didn't mean to, but then also you can imagine that if you've helped anybody, it's you didn't really mean to do that either. It's nihilism. You turn into a kind of like blob of nothingness. Yeah. Yeah. Protoplasm. Protoplasm. Well, the, the four skillful actions according to this Buddhist way of looking at it is first you pacify, you allocate space, you hold space for somebody or for the situation. So, so there's a calm or a kind of gentleness and expansiveness and everybody can just, okay, let's slow down. Let's not start talking right away. Let's sit for five minutes first or let's, let me listen to you first. That is something that is not happening anywhere in America right now. Nobody is listening. Right. It's starting actually with the, it's just starting to happen that white people are starting to listen because they've been shooting their mouths off for centuries and a lot of people are just going like, I might just need to listen here. Yes. I'm doing it. I'm just trying to go like, let me just be the student for a minute here and let me listen. That's pacifying energy. Then there's enriching, which is kind of suffusing. That's the honey part of the razor blade. You know, there's some kind of joy. There's some kind of depth of experience. There's some kind of positive energy in the situation and you reinforce it. You go like, you know, you say you can do it. Let me help. Whatever, whatever form that takes. Then there's magnetizing, which is dealing with alienation, you know, and somebody just feels left out, you know, so you invite them in, you include them, you draw them in. And then the fourth one is the wrathful one or destroying action, which to be very clear about it. If you're angry, don't try it. It's very simple because there's a danger with each of the four, the pacifying one, you could go to sleep. The enriching one is you sort of look over situations and you're not clear. The magnetizing one is it's all about kind of, you know, what do you think about me thinking about you thinking about me thinking about your latest movie, you know, it turns into that kind of Hollywood. Yes. And then the destroying one is just cutting through to the straight shot and it can be so soft. It can be like a sharp knife cutting through butter. I mean, I was thinking as you're saying that it could be just somebody's eyebrow just goes up like that, like Spock, you know. Right. Oh, really? Right. The person goes, you know, so for some, it's very rare that I would say that's bullshit, almost on a matter of principle. So I must have, if I did say it, either been out of my mind or understood that we were playing still, that you would get the joke. Oh, yeah. Otherwise, I would never say it. I did. David, it was the other person's going to get the joke sooner or later. Then it's, you just, you saved both of you a lot of years of whatever. You just have to understand how much that helped me. I mean, it was, it was the beginning. That's what I mean by getting the job. Okay. That was how I really started exploring intention and thinking about the offering of the merit with meditation and why am I sitting and what is, I really started to at the very least look at the, like the, what is going on here? I haven't really, I don't know that I've even come close to understanding intentionality, but at least I'm not tricking myself into thinking that I'm floating around like some unintentional protoplasmic goo or something like that. Like Clancy without the arms. Yeah. Yes. Exactly. I also wanted to ask you, and here's a really weird question, but I thought this is a fun question. I think maybe after this question, we can, people are asking questions and we can go to their questions, but do you think we knew each other in previous incarnations? How long have you been my teacher? Because And you never write and you never call. That's, that's, that's kind of a Jewish approach. I knew you. I knew him since he was in Mesopotamia and he never writes, he never calls. So, you know, here's, here's, I'm, I'm just going to answer this a little differently. I'm going to give you my theory of the Jell-O of time. Okay. Time is, time is like Jell-O with little, the fruit Jell-O that has those things, and the things in the Jell-O are temporal events, but they're kind of in this giant blob of Jell-O. And so do we know each other in the past, present and future? Yes, of course, because that's how things unfold. So my guess would be, you know, if there was such a thing as previous incarnations, if I had the gift to be able to see them, which some people do, you know, I, I, I feel like we can get a feeling about it by what's happening now. If we believe there's any such thing as a future, which I have my doubts in my current search, maybe the future doesn't really actually exist in a way, but the past has impact and the future does not yet exist. That's why I would say the past doesn't really exist either, but it has impact on what's happening right now. And you're a fool if you don't acknowledge that. If you say, oh, there's no past, you know, okay, that's like saying there's no intention. You know, things have gotten to this point by, by the virtue of the past. So of course we have an unusually, you know, potent and enjoyable conversation and there's got to be some karma in that. But it's so, you know, what happens when I don't spend time talking to you and we are conversations go to my dreams. We have conversations of my dreams now. I, then I realized like, oh God, you really are taking this man for granted. Like you, it's such a, it's such a, I don't know. You know, I have friends who I don't talk to for years and I talk to them and not a second is past and it feels like that with you, you know, but then also, and this God forgive me for even saying it out loud. Now I have this piece in my heart that's like, well, I don't know how long David's going to be around for. And I don't either. And that makes two of us. Yeah. And then now it, then it makes me feel like I'm rushed. Now it's like, you know, now I feel like I'm in a hurry with you or something. Or I feel like, oh, you better like just, you know, I don't know, like Anaconda, David and squeeze out every single thing you did. Did you, did you feel like that about Joachim Trump or Rinpoche? Yes. But there were other feelings mixed with it. He was, and one of the things that I'm working on right now as a kind of spiritual friend, you know, doing that kind of work sometimes is a lot of people like you, Duncan. I just was online with somebody else. Many, many people I meet are more like your age and even younger, you know, 30. I would say a lot of students are in their 30s or 40s. I'm 72. So if I get together with my clan, which is that we call them the old dogs, you know, of the Trump crowd, we have a certain way of, you know, skip, you know, we experienced a kind of clan quality and a lot of powerful experiences. But most of my orientation, you know, I'm not looking back. I'm looking forward. That's just who I am right now. And so I'm very interested in the young students. Like I'm passionately interested in people like you. It's not a small thing. It's like when you call, I light up, I go, oh, Duncan's on the phone. We're going to be able to talk about real shit. You know, I don't have to, I don't have to like, you know, yeah, well, let me look at my calendar. You know, I mean, it's like, we're going to just jump into it. And I experienced the same thing, which is that every gap is like a comma to me, even if it's a month or something like that. And then you call. I just feel like that was a comma. And now we're continuing. And it's very spontaneous. I just, I have a rule with you. I'm not going to like think about too much about what I'm, you know, and it's also respecting the podcast quality. Yeah. You know, I have a lot of prepared stuff, but no, we're just going to see, we're going to jam basically. It's a jam session. But I want to talk about one last thing and then we'll take questions. And I'll wait. You asked me about Trump. But so he said something in his will because he had a big group. He had a lot of students. So if you got a piece of him in live action, that was, that was, that was unusual because there was a lot of people, thousands of people. He said in his will, I will haunt you and he has haunted me. Wow. Whatever that means. And so because he used was a master in my opinion of all four karmas. Sometimes it was the most fun person to be within the world. Really funny, really playful. He said, if it's not funny, it's not Buddhism. So there was jokes. There was hanging out. He was unafraid of the, of the toxicology of the world, both in terms of people's neurosis and literally physical substances. So he, he was, as my opinion, and it's hard to frame this in current realities is that he was fearless in terms of how he interacted with all, all of us and all of that. But he also was challenging to be with at times, very, like very provocative. Yeah. And, and I had to keep deciding to go back in and many people who study with him will know what I'm talking about because he could, he had the skill to manifest the wrathful energy. And now misunderstanding with that was that he was a crazy person or something like that. It was, it was not like that, but there was a sense of being pushed to the edge of your envelope by the mere, mere quality of his presence and the unrelenting, unrelenting quality of presence. Right. So that's in there. That's in the mix too, is what I'm saying. That's in you. And this is the thing. Really? Oh, Dave, this is the thing. When I, well, I don't know about the substances thing necessarily, but the, I was thinking, okay, this is, and again, I'll cut this out of the podcast because I do feel like many of y'all, by y'all, I mean my teachers seem to get real squirmy whenever I mentioned the, the woo-woo stuff. So there's only, there's not a big crowd listening to this right now, but this is one of the many weird things that has happened in our work together. I'm literally, we've been texting. I have my phone down and I'm thinking, I don't remember what it was you said. I'm getting on neurotic and wondering if you were saying that I was arrogant or something. And then I'm thinking, I am fucking arrogant. And then, and then, and then, and then I thought something like, yeah, I guess that's what a teacher does sometimes. They just like, they're good at like throwing jabs. Then I look at my phone. I haven't even been talking to you. This is just my mental continuum. And you texted me. The real jab is you meditating for 20 minutes every day. What's that? I mean, seriously, what is that? Oh, well, that's tendril. That's synchronicity. That's, that's exactly what we were talking about before. You know, I, I, when I think about something like that, I think, well, of course, why wouldn't that happen? See what I'm working with your people. I tell you why it doesn't happen. We're too busy in our heads to really notice the kind of flow, you know, the kind of, you know, like synchronicity is a powerful, powerful thing. And I always, I have a rule, pay attention when it happens. Right. Pay attention. If you just notice two things at once, even like, for example, I was talking about impermanence and joy this morning in Tokyo online. And then you, your dog died. And so we're talking about impermanence, but I had this link prepared because we've talked about impermanence and enjoy this coming together. And that was exactly what you started talking about, licking honey from the razor blade. It's like this conversation you started this morning just continued in a different body. It just, to be honest, I feel a little bit Duncan, like the guy, the chess guy in the park who's playing 20 games. Wow. That's cool. And it's like, oh, this, oh, this game. Okay. These moves. That's cool. And, you know, and, and it just seems like that's what we're all doing. We're all playing multiple chess games. Right. Right. And you go like, okay, what's the now thing? So of course that can jump into, you know, kind of spontaneous bursts of knowledge, which is called intuition or called even when you, when you have intuition to another degree, it's called oracular, you know, oracle is always downloading that kind of information. And there are people who are trained to do that. Um, so, but our thing is just, there's, you know, kind of a commonality. We're walking on the same road. You know, you're saying, oh, look at the flowers over here. I'm saying this. And then all of a sudden it's like the two of you say the same thing at the same time and it's going to happen. Right. Okay. Fair enough. I'll take that answer. It's a beautiful answer. It's actually the most detailed you've ever been the many other times I go, what the fuck, David. But now let's take it to the quest, to questions from folks. Sure. How much more time do you have, David? I'm, I'm open on the back end. So it's up to you guys. Okay, great. You know, one second, let me, I was trying to be clever with dual monitors and hold on one second. I'm going to open up something so it'll seem like I'm not paying attention for a second here. Okay. So we have a bunch of questions, but the cool thing about this is people vote the questions. But this is an unfortunate, the most voted question, David. Do you prefer raw or roasted cashews? Now, see, that is a perfect, perfect example of what we're just talking about. Why? I'll tell you why. I'm at my house on Long Island. I've been here for three months by myself. I've seen people this way, but hardly ever an actual three-dimensional corpseable human being. Corpseable. So what am I doing? Well, I'm cooking. I don't usually cook that much for myself. I'm cleaning up. I'm eating. That's like an event. I'm also, I'm not eating that much, but I'm trying to eat healthy and keep. I want to keep healthy right now with this situation. But what's one of my favorite thing? Nuts, because you can snack on nuts, even if you're on a kind of healthy diet and that's a good snacking thing. I've got about five different kinds of nuts in my kitchen, and I'll just go in and have three nuts. Now, the last batch of nuts that I dealt with was cashews. And what the person said, cashews. Yeah. And I like them toasted. So when I get the nuts from the store, I put them in a frying pan, just low heat, and I toast the nuts and I put them back in the container. So that is a current issue for me. That's not just some random metaphor, allegorical question. Literally, I like my cashew nuts toast, and I just did it. Ah, cool. That's unbelievable. That's so cool, man. Well, that was from Dr. Shudd. That person's probably intuitive, whoever said that. And in fact, you can write them back and say, I bet you're an intuitive person, and this happens to you one time. They're listening right now. Yeah. What's their name? That's from Dr. Shudd. Dr. Oh, he's, I mean, you know. Oh, these are the names they give themselves. It could be a doctor. I don't know. Handles. Here we go. This is the next question. People use the term meditate on it, something, as we can have a theme or object of meditation. But every practice I've encountered is basically trying to not think in simplistic term, parentheses and simplistic terms. So how does one meditate on a topic? For example, to reach a decision. That's a great question. And there are many, many different types of meditation. Even within Buddhism, there are probably thousands of different practices and things. So it all depends on what you're trying to cultivate. So one way to think about, there's two ways to think about meditation. One is you're just becoming familiar with something. Maybe you're becoming more familiar with the feeling being present. Maybe you're becoming more familiar with your thoughts and emotions coming and going. So that's the word gaum in Tibetan. G-O-M means to become familiar with something. Another way of thinking about it is you're strengthening some quality that you have. Compassion. You can meditate on compassion. You strengthen your relationship to compassion. You meditate on the quality of impermanence. You contemplate impermanence. I teach this one program that's called, it's the first leg of a teacher training program. And the first level is just an overview of meditation so people can get questions like this answered. So there are four practices that we do in that one weekend program. The first one is the mindfulness, which that person's right, he or she, whatever, whichever they are, is saying, yeah, it's sort of more intuitive and I'm trying to just relate to the quality being present and maybe not repress the thoughts, but just let them come and go, come back, come back, come back. Then there's an awareness practice which is less focused on an object of meditation, you know, more surround sound. You know, just appreciate the whole play of phenomenon, but still in the intuitive and direct perception level. Then there's contemplative meditation, which is what our friend is really talking about there. You think, you're supposed to think. You're meditating, you're contemplating on a particular topic though. You're not just going like, let me just, I'll just, I'll just think about anything I want to. That's called life, you know, you're already doing that. You don't need to practice that anymore. Now I'm going to think about impermanence. I'm going to hold my mind to that topic. How does that make me feel? Is everything subject to impermanence? Buddha said everything's, you know, conditioned things are subject to impermanence. So you can think it through and there's, you're developing something called prajna, which is discernment. And you can apply that to sort of sublime topics and powerful, you know, deep topics. And you could apply it to how to use a Phillips head screwdriver. You know, that's called lower prajna, just ordinary prajna. Yeah, you know, you look at, for example, you look at the screw and you go, how come this screwdriver is not working? Right. What don't I know here? Right. And you go to the wiki, you know, wiki, or you go to, and you go, here's the description of this screw. And I said, you need a Phillips head screwdriver. Right. And so the purpose of contemplative meditation is to generate insight and perspective. Right. And then the fourth one we do is a compassion practice. And that's, you contemplate loving kindness. You think about all your friends. You think about all your enemies. You think about all the people you don't really know or care about. You think about yourself. You think about your mother. And just for goodness sake, just contour your thoughts and wishes for all those people in a positive direction. So that's kind of meditation too. Then there's visualizing deities and mandalas and chanting mantras. And there's a million things that are just working with different aspects of our minds. Is there a hierarchy to these? Is it a hierarchy? It's a good question. In the terms of the, and again, that weekend program is meant to illuminate. It's kind of, it's kind of a frequently asked question, compendium in a way. There is a progression. Let's call it a progression. And in Buddhist terms, classically, it's Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana. So there's like narrow, middle, and kind of progressed. And they use different methods and techniques. The basis of the first round is kind of getting clarity about your own state of mind. That's what we're all really, we really got to start there. Then the second one is developing compassion and the interpersonal realm, you know, becoming more liberated. The first is becoming more liberated in the personal realm, then becoming more liberated interpersonal realm. And the third one is really trying to discover the nature of reality in a very direct way. Without any bias, without thinking, well, it's got to be compassionate. It's got to be free. What is it actually? How do you feel right now? What are you experiencing? Is it a problem? You're angry. Is that a problem? Well, it's a problem because I heard somebody. Okay. What is the anger without, without that aggression in it? What does it look like? Wow. And you get to the pure forms of those energies. So that's a little subtler. So obviously, and more transformative. Pure forms of anger? Oh, sure. Wow. That is so wild. Oh, this is something that's another one. I hate to keep promoting my own programs. You should promote. Please do. I'm in it. Well, okay. Well, this is one that I think would be great. It's in August. Again, this was going to be up at Tibet House, but it's all online now. And so they're all on my website. So the one that's coming up in August is there's another level one intro to Buddhism and mindfulness program that's going to be through Kaya Yoga in Connecticut. And that's July 22nd and 23rd. And then July 29th and 30th, four evenings, three hours, stints, Kaya Yoga, K-A-I-A, yoga.com. And that's what's coming right up. That would be probably a great starting point. In August, there's a program which is called the Five Wisdom Energies. And this is something, I don't think you and I have gotten to this yet, Duncan, but we could do that soon. I'm still in one. I'm still just sitting. I'll try to do some deity visualization or something. No, no, this is not deity visualization. The deities have come down to visit in a very practical way in this kind. It's basically saying the deities are your own energies. And guess where they really reside in your emotions. You want to know what a deity is? It's part of your emotional landscape. It's the enlightened part of the emotional landscape. So you go, what's enlightened about pride? That's just stupid. You shouldn't be proud. But there's something in it. When you know somebody who's proud, they have a certain kind of richness about them. A certain kind of generosity that's usually part of the package. So what is that energy like in its pure form? And rather than throwing out the confusion, you transform the confusion into its wisdom aspect. That's alchemy. That's some kind of crazy alchemy. It's alchemy. It's totally alchemy. It's Buddhist alchemy. Wow. That's heavy, man. That gives me a lot of energy. It's easy too. It's easy to learn about it. It's not hard to learn about it. And so there's many different access points. And I like helping people find what they're looking for. I guess I'd be a good librarian or something like that. You're just a great, you're just one of the great teachers, man. Okay, we're going to take one more question. We have lots and lots and lots, but I'm having a little bit of paranoia because I want to make sure this is our recording. I'm afraid I just want to just make sure we get all this. This is a great question. Hello, sweet friends Duncan and David. Can you guys talk about the Buddhist practice of cultivating love? How can we cultivate and project love energetically, especially for those of us who struggle a lot with self-hatred and anger toward the world? Thank you. So in that training that I talked about with the four modules, the fourth one is metta, loving kindness practice. That's your ticket. What's the person's name? 10,000 grows in a trench coat. That's a very creative name. I know. I love that name. I mean, you can visualize that right away. And you open the trench coat and they all fly out. Oh, that's cool. I never thought of that. That's what I saw. Yeah, I guess they could be static there too, but I would say open the trench coat would be the short answer to your question, let the crows fly out. But without being poetic about it, metta, loving kindness practice. That's your ticket. I think it's pretty easy to access. You can look in my, probably both my books have it and you can look online. And maybe you've done it. 10,000 crows. It's like an Indian name too. Native American name. 10,000 crows in a trench coat. Yes. What have you seen 10,000 crows in a trench coat? Where have you been? I've been opening my trench coats so the crows can fly out, take on their own true nature, which is love and compassion is already in there. Of course, you know, maybe we receive certain impact from people and things in our life that made us doubt that that really happens. Unfortunately, fairly easily that people can doubt their own goodness. Yes. And that's, you could call that self hatred. I think it also has to do with doubt and not, not having the conviction that that's what's really in your heart in the first place. So the process has to be one tilting a little bit and you know, you're over on the hard right side of the boat, you go to the left side of the boat. You know, you emphasize the positive element and that's what that practice does. And you also explore. You look at the root of your experience a little bit more. Sometimes that's meditation. Sometimes that can be therapy in other ways. But we got it at the end of the day. I feel we have to trust ourselves. There's no other choice. Literally, we have to trust ourselves. So you have to find a way to explore what you need to explore, cultivate what you need to cultivate and have some kind of basic faith that you have the potential, the capacity to do that. I used to say, you can do it. You can do it. I didn't even know. I mean, he was even, he would just leave the room and say, you can do it. You don't even know what he's referring to. It's just a positive kind of iteration. So good luck to, and if we can help, if Duncan, I can help you, we will help you. Absolutely. And David, I am so grateful to you for your time here today. This is, as always, these are my favorite conversations on earth. And I would love it if you could actually share some ways. I know you did already. You gave, you gave folks your email, which for the, when we released this as a big podcast episode, I'll have Aaron delete that. Cause that's just, that's opening the gates of, that's opening chaos into your life. A lot of people are going to email you, but, um, Well, I hope they have a purpose in mind other than just rattling the Venetian blinds. Some people love to rattle those blinds. Yeah. Yeah. But, I mean, you know, well anyhow, you use your judgment on that. Okay. I'm not, you know, as savvy probably as you are about what comes and goes. And I've deliberately maintained a certain level of ignorance about, you know, social media and stuff like that. Would you, would you be interested in hopping in from time to time? We have this community that gathers on a sort of discord server. If I gave you a link, would you be into hopping in there and saying hi to folks? Of course. Great. Can I see them? Well, you'll see their chat. You'll see their chats. I'll show, I'll show you how to use it. And it would be great for your students too. I mean, it's, it's one of my favorite, it's an amazing bit of technology. But David, could you let everybody know? You already did talk about your classes, but just a way for folks to connect to you who listen to this and probably are interested in taking some of your courses or reading your books. Well, the one, and here's the liberating fact of the pandemic. It doesn't matter where you are anymore. It used to matter. So I would have been in LA. I know I would have been in Japan this week, but I'm going to Japan in a couple of hours, but I'm doing it this way. Magic carpet ride. So the program that's coming up next, which is a complete 100 hour mindfulness meditation teacher training program. This is what I'd recommend for people. At least the level one, the first weekend introductory program really gets a lot of this framed out and a lot of starting point. And that's at Kaya, K-A-I-A yoga. And it's, it'll be on my website, davidnickturn.com. And just come, you can come for any of those four, there's four evenings, the 22nd, 23rd, 29th and 30th. So I would say if that's where you, if you, we could meet up there. That'd be a cool way to meet up to just to register for one of those programs. And we're going to be talking about this stuff and going into a little more depth about it and practicing too. Cool. So that would be a good first start. Wonderful. David, David, thank you so much. Everybody connect with this man. You can see he's a beautiful soul. He, and now you know how he likes to bake his nuts. Roast, please. Sorry. David, you're the best. Thank you so much for sharing yourself with us. I really, I really am grateful to you for. Thank you, Duncan. Just to say the folks out there, I couldn't see you this time, but I'm feeling you. And I hope that we get to meet and continue these kind of conversations are really important to have right now. They're not frivolous. We're being challenged to really go deeper. So I've kind of allocated my full resources for having these kind of conversations right now. Thank you. And Duncan, you're a great, you're a beacon for people, Duncan. People, people, you know, they, they tune into stuff through you. You're a channel. Well, then I'm lucky. And I'm lucky I get to tune into you. Okay, David, let's talk soon. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Bye, Duncan. Thank you so much for listening.

Thank God Thank fucking God Like, if they were much bigger, they would be the most terrifying bird Well they're so frantic Can you imagine the sound of like a dog-sized hummingbird zipping through some primordial forest? Like, it would sound like someone like shot a lawnmower out of a catapult It would be so scary to hear It would because they have thrusts on both flaps They have thrusts because they bend their shoulders in a certain way So they can, that's how they can fly backwards and they can fly upside down So then flowers, the flowers evolved to, because the nectar was so expensive to make Flowers evolved to keep everything else but the hummingbirds from getting it So that's why they have like the bells, the bottom bells on the flowers So that only a hummingbird can get It's essentially like what we do for squirrels with our bird feeders It's the evolution of the bird feeder is designed to just allow fucking birds And not these thieving squirrels to get a seed So it did that but via the long, slow natural selection Yeah, over tens of millions of years Man, that shit, I can never wrap my head around it Shane Like, I want to wrap my head around it but the subtle, slow changes And the way that one creature is like adapting to another Through this kind of incredibly slow mutation It's, whenever I think about it, I totally get the people who are like, that's not what happened godly Yeah, I know, and there's something You know, like, yeah Go ahead, sorry No, what were you gonna say? No, I mean, that's it, it's just like, that was it, it's just like, though, you know, I understand why someone would be like There's no fucking way that hummingbirds used to be big and then they shrink down And then the flowers change shape This is exactly perfect for what we're going to be getting into So one, there's this nice evolutionary kind of principle There's this great book called The Red Queen I've maybe mentioned this concept before, but it's basically there's everything in life Between predator and prey, between host and parasite, between males and females within a species, between males competing with one another There's always these kind of evolutionary arms races and there's always, there's usually this kind of evolutionarily stable system Where they're fairly evenly matched, like a very simplified version is you have a wolf or something that hunts rabbits And most genetic mutations that are abnormal are bad Like, at least 999 out of a thousand are bad But once in a while there's an advantageous one And now that wolf is a little faster And then, and it's able to do better and have more offspring and feed more of its kids It passes this trace on to its kids But then, but then the rabbits start disappearing because they're getting predated so much The wolves have such an advantage But then some of those rabbits that gained this other thing, maybe they got smaller so they hide in the brushmore Maybe they got faster themselves And then they start increasing and maybe they're too fast for the wolves now And the wolves start dying off except these ones And so there's this usually balanced, very slow through, you know, this is, we're talking about a million generations This happens, this change over time And it seems particularly weird if you think about whatever the particular species is as an individual Versus as a process, you know, so if you see that like it's a flow or like a river That looks like a shit ton of rabbits flowing through time And then you see this other thing flowing next to it, which is a shit ton of wolves And they're sort of running against each other And then it's the same thing you see, I guess it's similar to like when you see a rock In a river that's been completely flattened down by the infinite flow of what's that Essentially but happening genetically, right? Yeah, and then there's these kind of punctuated equilibrium And there's things that happen like invasive species So we're running into this a lot with our modern world because we have humans brought global travel and everything So now the whole world's becoming connected in these ways that it was So remember the whole, you know, last year the murder hornet situation This giant Asian hornet, the bees in its native region have adapted For when this giant Asian hornet comes into their nest, the bees can often get and swarm that hornet And kill it before it's able to alert its friends and come in and kill off the nest Sometimes it gets its friends and kills off the whole nest But a lot of times the bees are able to capture it and kill it before it can go and do that But that red queen, so it's called the Red Queen Because there's a scene in Alice in Wonderland where Alice is running with the Red Queen And they're running and running and the scenery's not moving, they're not going anywhere Alice says, why are we running so fast? We're not going anywhere And the Red Queen says, it takes all the running we can do just to stay in the same place Wow So that's what, so like back to this wolf and rabbit, like both of them are seemingly very different You know, they're both much faster than their ancestors or whatever are more muscular And they're kind of indistinguishable over time But they're both at the same place, which is sometimes the wolf wings, sometimes the rabbit wings And that's a lot of how life works, but then with an invasive species, now you have all of a sudden This giant Asian hornet comes to the US where the bees don't have that They've never evolved that trick to swarm a hornet when it comes in to stop it from alerting its friends And then it has, now these hornets can come in and potentially kill off Colony is this, this is why there was a fuss about it last year And this is, we're about at the time that people will start keeping an eye out for them in Washington And stuff like that, but it's because they would have never, that would have never happened before That they would end up in some other region It's like an arms race of like, America gets a better tank and then the Russians build a better tank or whatever And they keep on going back and forth, and then you take that tank into some developing nation that has never built a tank And all of a sudden you're going to roll right over it Right, or what is it called? The project where they came up with the atomic bomb Where they developed this technology so secretly that they're so far ahead that there's an incredible superiority That there's nothing anyone could do, or like, which is going to happen again with some, God only knows what the fuck it's going to do And we, you know, like some anti-matter weapon or just some, who knows what You know, they're just, you know, a flash of light in an entire city Like all humans just turn into puddles, moaning globs of humanity And then what are we going to do? What do you do? What happens if some enemy comes up with that? And just out one day, like an entire American city, the streets are just filled with like, silly putty goop That used to be humans You know what I mean? Whoever the enemy is is like, well, you know, probably should surrender Probably have to surrender And sometimes there's... And so that's what happens Yeah, and then sometimes there's some whoopsie daisies too The last bomb that we dropped was orders of magnitude bigger than we were expecting it to be There was actually US planes and ships that were what they thought were from a distance observing it That like got knocked out of the air and everything They used some certain metal that they actually thought was going to lessen their explosion They thought it was going to lessen how big the blast was going to be So they didn't kill that many, you know, just be like this powerful signal of like, hey, don't mess with us And then it actually had the reverse impact and was much, much larger than they expected it to be Whoopsie daisies Whoopsies And so, so yeah, that could happen with the silly putty machine as well But that's what the murder hornets are Like anytime that happens, then that's when it like... I think what you're saying is when you have like these naturally competing species Winning does not mean wiping out the other species because then you lose your food source Yeah, your fucks Keeping the other species alive but catchable Whereas like you get murder hornets, you get that fungus that... What did it wipe out? The oak trees? You get kudzu? Yeah, exactly That's what the... You were talking about lumber being expensive for your fence or whatever before we were recording And this is sorry to share that if you were trying to keep your fence secrets to yourself But that's part of why lumber is so expensive is because of this like... I think it's called thousand cankers or something where these... So this is now that we're approaching camping season and we're getting fully vexed And we're gonna get out there and camp with our friends and everything This is why they say don't bring in wood from other places Because if you bring in wood from a thousand... Three hundred miles away or whatever it might be Well, those beetles or whatever had that same red queen The tree adapted defenses for that beetle and that beetle went back and forth And was able to take advantage of the trees sometimes And sometimes it got... Sometimes the trees one, sometimes the beetle one And now you take that beetle that's been shaped through that process You bring your... Well, you already got a cord of wood You gotta burn this stuff somewhere so you bring it three hundred miles somewhere else Not knowing any better, you see a sign that says Hey, don't bring wood from elsewhere, you know, buy it here And you're like, why is that a rule, you know? And you do... And then those beetles, if you don't... And then if you don't burn all of your wood Those beetles might migrate into the trees there And you're having that situation in Colorado where like 60% of some species of tree Is being like killed off and devastated So this is just going to keep on... This is like COVID happening because of this This is going to... Most modern plagues are because of this You also when you lose biodiversity You pack more and more creatures together in a smaller area And create a bigger petri dish And then you combine that with traveling around And introducing novel things And through this kind of invasive species sort of logic This red queen logic And it's going to... I think we're pretty amazing in adaptable creatures And as long as we keep on having specialists That are studying wood parasites or whatever And that sort of thing I think that modern problems just require modern solutions And we can no longer be like, oh, it's just nature, whatever I'm sure it'll be fine to bring wood wherever We're just in a very different situation than what we're adapted for But isn't that the... Go ahead, get to the point with the hummingbird I'm sorry No, no, this is all tied to the same conversation, actually So a hummingbird that's adapted And flowers adapted for it And these flowers are now dependent on these hummingbirds They aren't pollinated by anything else The hummingbird is now... So the hummingbird's conscious experience... The hummingbird doesn't know about its past evolutionary trajectory It just has nectar vision It just has its eyes out all the time It has these specially adapted hummingbirds You can have a whole tree full of flowers And it will know which ones it already went to On previous days And if they're still nectar there Because they can't... For all the flapping that they do They can't waste a single flap They are living on the edge of starvation Every single... If a hummingbird goes three hours without food It's probably a goner It goes into basically hibernation Every single night to sleep It's called tarpour Because it needs to just stop using any energy And then all of a sudden... So your whole life... If you're this hummingbird You just know like your whole life is Oh you just go and you get this nectar And you probably are telling yourself The stories about it too You've probably constructed... The gods say that five flowers apart Is the best way to... You have this whole morality around it I don't know man I know what you're saying Because we're going to anthropomorphize them For the sake of your point here But I feel like if... From observing hummingbirds And based on what you're saying I think they're just like I'm fucking hungry Fucking hungry They are Oh god There's one of those fucking things Stick my beak in There's another of those things But I love the idea of hummingbirds Like having mythology and stories And that would be a very beautiful Version of reality Maybe it's true I don't know But you look at those things They're just like speed freaks They are speed freaks You know they're like freezing at night Waking up Eating sugar Freezing Fascinating beautiful creatures One of my favorite birds by the way And they have to... They have to be territorial So another thing that you can predict Is anything like that That's a really rich source But a rare source of energy In an environment There's going to be... It's going to be territorial So if you were to find some new species That didn't... That no one had ever discovered You could just tell from looking at Like one of its teeth If you knew what you were doing What kind of food that it ate And then from that You would be able to tell Whether it was territorial or not Because if... If something just eats vegetation Then who cares? It doesn't matter It's not worth fighting over There's vegetation everywhere But if you're after honeysuckle If you're after fruit trees So primates are really territorial Because there's a richer source of energy And it's only in select areas So that's everything that's territorial Is things that are in these select areas So hummingbirds are super aggressive And... Yes So one day you... And I do think that there would be... Is a hummingbird having these sophisticated thoughts? Probably not But I think that consciousness kind of arises From these... Yeah Conscious is the storyteller That comes from all this So here's a... I like thinking about what the brain is for And then that helps think Well, what are these stories for? So there's a sea squirt that... Is it okay that I'm talking so damn much, by the way? No, that's what I wanted Yeah, no, I love it There's a sea squirt that when it's born So it's stuck in one place in its adult life And it's basically just a filter And it's just stuff's coming by It's filtering it out That's how it gets its nutrients And then it blows a bunch of sperm and egg Into the water at a certain time They combine, they turn into these tadpoles These tadpoles develop a tailbone In a brain, in eyes And then they can... They can navigate So all that is sensory tools For navigating the ocean that they're in Until they find just the right spot And then they stick to that one spot And then because they're never going to move again And they're just filters They eat their own brain and eyes They just digest them What the fuck? And then... Because all you needed... We like to think, oh, the more brains the better But they have a cost Everything has a cost And so if it's not doing any good to have a brain Sitting in one spot just being a C-squid philosopher You're just going to metabolize your own brain Because everything has a use What a relief, probably Probably the little bit of time they had a brain They were just so horny, terrified, confused And then finally they get to go back To just a fucking brainless filter The good old days Remember those days? Were we always like this? Wasn't there a time? I feel like I was happier when I was just a filter And you can see kind of the natural inclination Is when we do have the means to plop in one place We do just want to veg out And there's this inclination like, oh, I'm just going to turn my brain off I'm not going... I'm just going to plop on this couch And I'm just going to slowly turn into this C-squid And eat my own brain Yeah It's easy Well, I mean, isn't that... That's the... To me, like one of the amazing things about humans And the disaster of... One of the many disasters of humanity Is that we... We can't really turn it off And we do tell stories But most of the time the stories we tell ourselves are completely wrong And just the amount of energy it takes up To constantly be reproducing whatever the story is You keep telling yourself I mean, most people... They might be smiling on the outside But they're living inside of an existential film noir Like paranoid horror movie You know what I mean? They might see the most... Whoever you think is the most bouncy, shallow person in your life You don't know what's going on Up there You know what I mean? And a lot of times that story they're telling themselves is one of how horrible they are One of how much they suck One of how much their friends are at to get them You know what I mean? All that energy That energy I think that's why people get in the heroin You know? Is they just want to shut that off They don't want the fucking story anymore They just want to be blank You know? But it doesn't really work Because then they have to start telling themselves another story Which is like, fuck, I'm out of heroin and money Are you still there, Shane? Did I lose you?

Okay, so Shane, so yeah I remember We had a little technical I remember right where we were and it's a perfect It leads into everything which is kind of Consciousness is this kind of great exaggerator And a lot of these stories that we're telling ourselves Aren't necessary So I think the last time I was on We were kind of talking about the subject of Say you have a suicidal thought or something Sometimes that's just this feeling of Hey, I'm kind of going the wrong direction In my life right now And it's just this very nuanced feeling That consciousness then exaggerates To get your attention As if you only had a picture If you're playing a game And you needed to act out Like the feeling of anger or something You'd make this cartoonish Like you're trying to get people to guess As fast as possible You'd make this cartoonish like Hulk And anger is much more nuanced than that It actually is It's just kind of your brain Trying to communicate through you Through these kind of ridiculous stories I bet it happens a lot more for humans Than a lot of animals Just because of what social creatures we are Because we get selected for For our storytelling abilities And everything else So then it's this kind of feedback loop And so when you talk about like Oh, it makes you want to just do heroin Or something sometimes Well, there is a good example of this So the stress response system Say you're in an argument With your significant other The stress response system goes off You get bickering about like a fence Or whatever that you're going to And then And then But what happens is you resolve the fence issue Okay, we'll get this kind of lumber instead It's a little expensive Whatever settled You settle that And then what happens is The stress response It kicks in really quick And then there's this hormonal cascade This cortisol that regulates a lot of it And mediates a lot of your A lot of what your energy is used for So it shuts off digestion, sex drive Your immune system, things like that Because it wants to power You need energy to your muscles And most stress response That's what most mammals need And then the parasympathetic response To dial that back down That's a new hormonal cascade To reset, to get you back to homeostasis The thing is, is that there hasn't been A real selection pressure to Nothing's ever needed to relax Now, like right that moment So it takes like 20 minutes For those hormones to dial you back down So even though you resolved the fence issue Your body's still telling you Why are we still stressed out right now? And then you come up with these Conscious narratives You start thinking, you start making a case You start looking back through time At the other issues of the This was your idea, this house You needed this one, I wanted the one That already had the fence And you start making up other shit To pile on to this conscious narrative And opiates do just the opposite Opiates just like Takes all that stress response It's just like everything's great Everything's gonna be great It doesn't matter if you're sucking a dick In an alley or whatever You're just like, I guess this is terrific This is just what heaven is Sucking a dick in an alley Well, I mean it is But my one experience With being injected with synthetic heroin Was after I got one of my balls cut off And they asked me And I'd already planned on telling them I was in pain no matter what How often do you get to get injected With synthetic heroin by a medical professional In a completely safe environment So yeah, I was like, yeah, I'm in so much pain And they're like, okay, no problem We're gonna give you delotted And I remember It was just the craziest thing I just got my ball chopped off And all of a sudden I'm having the best Literally the best day of my life And it wasn't like there was Just that thing you're talking about The gradual reaching homeostasis It was just instantly like, oh yeah This life is really good And my friend who drove me My friend's driving me home And I'm like, what a beautiful day Thank you so much for this ride Oh god, do you wanna come in When we get home, play video games And he's like looking at me with this Just perplexed sadness Like, you know, your reality Is gonna hit you pretty hard soon Which it did, which is the problem Of those fucking things Is that situation, it doesn't extend I came down so hard And I woke up and was in a lot of pain And woke up and was freaked out On my first day of having only one ball Yeah, of course But I think it's a completely normal And very healthy thing When you're freaked out and stressed out To not wanna be freaked out and stressed out more Of course And to let all potential methods To get back to like some relaxed state You know, at least cross your mind And if, so you know, this is This is why grounding This is why integration Not just in psychedelics But just in everyday experience If you're like, I'm gonna watch the news Set an intention How long are you actually going to watch it for And then afterwards You need to integrate that How much of it was real or whatever I got my second vaccine last week I texted you to thank you For actually inspiring me to get on it sooner Because I was in such a I'm in such a situation That I'm at such low risk That I was like, I'll let the people That are like out and about So I was like kind of lazy about Anyway, the second day of After my second vaccine I had my immune systems revved up So just like I said The stress response is about regulating Energy around So when the immune system needs to do its work And it's throwing everything What do we need here? Do we need a fever to burn it out? That's the best Oldest trick in the book Get that fever But basically you need You need to take all the energy Away from muscles and everything else To get that immune system Revved up and going I went to play pickleball I played half a game It's old person's tennis It's tennis for people That aren't athletic And I played a half a game Normally I could play all day I played a half a game And I was like, whew Wow, I'm burnt out And then and so I'm like kind of It wasn't bad I've had worse hangovers But there was the interesting thing was The story going on in my mind I was supposed to record a podcast that day It was like, oh this pod This new podcast Mind under matter that you're doing It's not going to work out any Nothing in your life is going to work out anyway Why bother doing anything Which is just a very exaggerated Version of why don't you lay down And not do anything Right, and you know If we talked about this What they call that in Buddhism What that's called So that's called the poisoned arrow And so the breakdown of it The story that gets told Sorry y'all I'm going to tell the poison arrow story again The story goes like this There's variations of the story The essence of the thing is A king is out on a hunting trip And an arrow flies from the forest Hits him in the arm And he you know His attendants are like His doctors there and they're like Okay, we're going to We're going to pull the arrow out And he's like, what are you talking about Don't waste any time First we need to make sure that You know that there isn't an army That this wasn't an ambush Look for whoever shot the arrow first And we'll get it out of me So then they bring a hunter You know who's like Who is there He's like, yeah I'm your majesty I didn't mean to shoot this arrow at you But it's poisoned, right He's like, well what kind of poison is it And get my pharmacist here To figure out the right antidote Before we pull the arrow out And so anyway There's a million variations of the story But the essence of the thing is The king goes through all these Like ridiculous examinations About what's happening Trying to figure it out in his own head And by the time he finally like Is ready to have the arrow pulled out He dies from the poison So the idea The way that translates into real life is You look at your You catch a glimpse of your bald spot When you're, if you're me And you're when you're like Maybe trying on clothes pre-pandemic You know when the fucking mirror Is in the dressing room And like suddenly you see How you look to everybody Your whole life But from behind And you haven't seen it You know what I mean You're like, oh my god Oh my god, no You know what I mean It's shocking And you're like I've got asymmetrical love handles And fucking dad bod And going bald Oh my fucking god What am I gonna do I gotta work out Why don't I fight And I work out five years ago And just keep working out And keep taking those fucking jiu-jitsu classes What's wrong with me Is something wrong with me Maybe I just Maybe just compared to other people I'm weak I'm a coward I'm a weak fucking coward You're like trying on pants You know what I mean Exactly That's the story And that's the poison arrow Because really all that happened Is you saw something That everyone has been seeing You know it's not like Just cause you saw it Suddenly now everyone's like Oh my god That's how the person looks from the back That's literally what they see Anytime you walk away from them So unless you're walking backwards But the point is like This is the This is like one of the One of the ways humans torture themselves Is they can't It's hard for us to just be like Bald spot And then just keep going to try on the genes We generate these recursive Thoughts that go on and on and on and on and on And those are the stories That make up the identity That we claim to be us Yeah, yeah And whichever ones that we It is There's this Intuitively you have a thought like that And that thought just feels real Like oh I had a thought That thought must be based on something And we just aren't great at putting together The nuance and the complexity Of what's actually happening Which is way way way more subtle Than I'm a total coward piece of shit That should have been exercising earlier Whatever You know it's so much more subtle than that It's elemental isn't it To me you're saying it's complex Quite often it really is isn't it It's just like If you manage to peel away The reason you think you're feeling The way you're feeling Whether for example like take hunger For example And just experience hunger As it is Without thinking where you're gonna get your meal From or what's coming down the pipes That you're gonna eat Just feel that feeling of hunger As it is That's it Suddenly if you really like Start looking at the hunger Just as it is I see what you're saying That's when you realize Whoa just this feeling Is a combination of different feelings You know like there's a tightness It may be and then there's also like this Like achy feeling But then there's also this like Kind of like you know like It's a weird imperative to get food But anyway the point is If you just stay with that feeling As it is You know it's interesting And that it's easier to work with Well you know then whatever the story Is you're telling yourself about That particular feeling That is an adaptive feeling In the context of a species That is a hunter gather And doesn't know when their next meal is That has evolved to have fat cells Because there's not refrigerators around Because you do need to store energy For a rainy day And so this feeling of hunger Would have driven your ancestors To go out there and do something about it Yeah And now it's maladaptive Now you do have a refrigerator Now you don't need to worry about having to If you aren't going to have food for a few days You're going to have food But you are living in this With this drive that is like Hey get it well the getting's good Eat as much as you can And now there's this modern issue Of obesity that never happened before So that brings us back to like the hummingbird What happens you have this perfect You're living on the knife's edge Of survival You have this fine tuned metabolism Every flap counts And now there's this limitless source Of energy that other than needing some Insects for some protein Now it's just there I found my new home I should just live here now I never need to do anything again This is amazing And you see this guy come out to fill This is better than This is better than anything you could have That's ever happened to any species Never in 3.5 billion years Did a species just show up All of a sudden there was just unlimited Resources, super saturated resources An unnatural amount of energy Like concentrated into this And it's there You don't need to work for it or anything And then this guy comes out To feed the feeder every 3 to 5 days Or whatever if he's doing it right So you don't get infections or whatever You don't get sick from germs And you might start to think What is this thing? Is this some god that comes That gives this unlimited source This amazing phone And you don't know that that's not a god That's just some dude named Phil That got a Christmas present He didn't really want But decided to hang it up in the yard Anyway, it looks like Thinks you're kind of nice But isn't, you know This guy doesn't revolve around you But it would make sense Egoscentrism is such that We all find ourselves at the center Of our own perceptual universe So you're going to think this guy Spends a lot more time thinking about you Than he does So then you start relying On this source of nutrition That this god brings And then this god Just doesn't fill the thing one day He just totally forgot And now you've raised a family You've developed these rich new traditions About this source of life And the dude just forgets So you go to like check And see He has this marvelous structure That we call houses But this crazy nest That you've never seen anything like it before And you see him go into his nest Maybe you should go and check on him And you go to do that And you bang into a window Because never in your evolutionary past Never in the 60 million years Was there some transparent Solid structure That you needed to navigate Otherwise you might have adapted To look out for glares or something So you bang into this window And maybe that's enough for Phil To notice That oh Those hummingbirds are out there Maybe I should feed them And he takes care of it Well what happens then Is there's this Pavlovian conditioning Of like Oh You bang into the window And then you come out And get fed And you start attaching Kind of narratives to that And building this tradition There's this There's this Do you know I think we've probably talked about Skinner boxes before That the idea of Sure of course Yeah And so there's this great way You can kind of teach a pigeon superstition If you put A pigeon in this In this environment Where everything is really predictable It does some task And it gets a reward And that's how life has always been It's entire life And then one day You just throw a reward in Out of nowhere It'll be like What was I doing To get that reward Was I flapping my wing Like this Flapping that wing around Like oh that's my lucky dance That I do And it will just develop Like this OCD Tick Because it's better to It's better to perceive patterns Even when patterns aren't there It's called Apathinia Where you tend to like See things in the clouds You tend to put a face on things Where it isn't See this is great man Because this is A subject that's been coming up On the podcast The last podcast with my teacher David Who I work with With meditation And so there's a concept That comes up In the form of Buddhism I study And it's called disowning So the idea is You're supposed to disown Like if you have some Dramatic experience When you're meditating Or after you're meditating It's not like you're supposed to Ignore it But the language that gets Used is disown it Because exactly what you're talking About will happen Like especially with meditation Where one day you might For no reason at all Experience the most incredible Bliss that you've ever felt in your life And it doesn't make any sense Suddenly what we were talking about Is one thing that doesn't get Mentioned a lot of times When people are offering meditation courses Is that you might Suddenly start feeling like Your heart just got broken But No one dumped you Your parents didn't die You didn't lose your job Just all of a sudden You feel the most incredible Overwhelming, sweet Sadness that you've ever felt But it's not connected to anything And so that Weirdly that feeling is like Overwhelming for a lot of people Some people stop meditating after that But then some people kind of Recognizing how remarkable That was They go back To the cushion And they try to do Whatever they were doing When they had that feeling That blocks up the whole thing Because So what ends up happening Is you get frozen In this loop Where you're trying to reproduce Something that's gone And so the recommendation is disown If you experience I think it's a version of Robert Anton Wilson's Agnosticism It's like these things happen They do, they're remarkable Unbelievable Exactly when you were writing their name down But then also You know At that very moment A bird flew by Your window that reminds you of that person Why? Who the fuck knows? But But if you Turn your whole life And you're trying to replicate those miracles Then all that ends up happening Is everything gets stale Because you're Then you start missing The actual miracle Which is just the right nowness of things Because I was It was Saturday I was sitting with my family We just got my oldest son A kiddie pool And he's splashing around in it And the family's there, we're so happy But I start thinking to myself I'm happy But I'm not as happy as I was A few weeks ago You know what I mean? And so because I'm holding And then the story starts Well, why aren't you as happy as you were a few weeks ago? Well, it's because I'm not sticking To my workout routine And then the story starts And the whole time I'm pulled completely out of that moment Because I'm holding up one thing That's long gone against the thing that is You know what I mean? So to me This What you're talking about, that's what it reminds me It's like this cargo Cult mentality This never ending attempt To make To repeat something That's way gone It's so tragic because the whole time You're doing that, you're missing what is Right now And then you have kind of this You have Confirmation bias in every moment So you're also You're also Doing things like Well, you have like Motivated reasoning And so if you're Looking for a reason To think something Consciousness is all too happy To build a case There was no crying here You just felt good Feeling not as good As you did three weeks ago Is not a crime Slow down lawyers in my head We don't need to construct all of the evidence To just pile on And pile on the reasons For this and then there's Also these kind of intermittent rewards So the way The reward system works Is if you have So you want a Pavlovian train Something and you have this I remember when we talked back June or whenever it was And kind of the beginning ish of Covid and I was like Everyone watch out for one thing Which is Like Take the hit right now And just accept that this is Going to be a long haul And then work on slow Incremental gains from there And you'll feel better each time If you instead Slowly Tell yourself it's going to be another couple of weeks And are just disheartened Every two weeks that's just going to It's going to break people And there's pretty Strong neuroscience to break that up And so if you want to train Say your pigeon again You want to train it to press this lever They used to train them to guide missiles That was like when some of this first Started was like Like a military funding To have pigeon guided missiles To have a pigeon in a missile To peck in certain ways To guide the missile They ended up abandoning it But they learned all these Amazing things in the process And That is some doctor strange Well It really is So you turn the light on You go You want it to hit a lever When you turn the light on It's in a cage You turn the light on And the pigeons just going around And then one day just out of curiosity Or sometime that day it hits the lever A reward pops out It goes ooh this is terrific Dopamine releases in the brain Hurray and then eventually Dopamine becomes the motivator Now when the light comes Once you learn to make that connection Oh when the light comes on Hit that lever you get the reward It goes off when the light goes on Not when you get the reward It goes ooh I know just what to do here It's like you already got the reward But then you get complacent If you just get that one reward Every time 100% of the time You're gonna take it for granted I'll get to that lever whenever I get to it Whatever If it stops getting the reward You're going to abandon it completely But if you do these intermittent rewards If you give it the reward 50% of the time Then it's twice as motivated For half the chance of Actually getting the reward And so this is why like gambling Such an issue too For people this is why like Social media and posting things Like I hate how I am We're hackable Yeah we're really So is that what you're getting at here Are you saying that technology is our hummingbird feeder Is that what you're saying Yeah And yeah and there's these kind of Emergent properties That are happening where we're now In this modern environment Where we have this like This rich source This easy source everything's easy You don't need to go out and hunt for your food anymore But then there's these Unexpected things that happen to this hummingbird Now all these flowers that were dependent On the hummingbird pollinating it They start drying up And dying And now all these other Insects and stuff that were dependent On that they start dying too And now there's this desert This desertification that Starts happening And now you go If you're that hummingbird you're like Why is what I'm happy But why am I not as happy As I was three weeks ago And you look around And you go what's different Well my environment's changed A lot and also I noticed that other people When they have these great gifts That They have this same sort of Desert My god this isn't a god This is the devil This thing's It's the fucking demier Yeah yeah The matrix master Hold on wait we're gonna pause We're gonna take a break I gotta use the bathroom This is awesome I'm

like there's a few different streams We're covering here One of them is Something Jared Lanier talks about Is a huge warning to us Which is we're hackable We're way, way more hackable Than we like to think that we are And We're so fucking hackable That Many of us are actively Being exploited And again, it's like If you're being exploited by natural systems It's a whole different follow-up For example, let's take the exploitation Of I don't want to call it exploited If I go running My brain is going to reward The shit out of me for that And I'm going to feel really good But if Some company Figures out a way to even remotely Replicate that Via some system Of social Intoxication Instagram, Twitter, whatever Then I might not run as much Or like let's say Like the joy I get from like Learning something on the piano Here's a perfect example Recently, I started playing What has got to be The dumbest game ever created By any human on earth, but the most Addictive, Mortal Kombat Oh yeah, this game is It's just the dumbest My, when my wife comes in And watches me playing it She's just like They can't even fucking spell combat Because they spell it with a K You know what I mean? Like you're playing something where they don't know how to spell The main thing No, they know how to spell it K, it was Mortal Kombat Isn't it funny That we're like, oh, well your generation Just doesn't get Mortal Kombat We had We had arcades We had, you know It's something you're getting older And like, you know Come at me mother fucker I will fuck you up with cheap moves I will fuck you up with cheap moves until You scream at me from Wherever you may be and your kids Will start crying in the background I love it, but the thing That I realized At some point with my many video game addictions And Mortal Kombat only bring that up because It's highly, it's a very complex It can get as complex as you want And you gotta memorize all these Like combos And you string these combos together And it's a delight But The time that you're spending Learning those combos You could also Learn how to play piano And which is what I'm trying to do right now And there's only a certain amount of time in the day And I get the whole like, well you need to have Some fun too or whatever But I get just the same Dopamine release When I like it finally like Figured out like, oh that's what that Note means I'm trying to learn to read music or Holy shit, my left hand Is working And it's free of my right hand It's working on its own and I've always wanted to do that Wow, wow I can't believe that But The hummingbird feeder, it's Mortal Kombat It's like, you know what I mean And it's not like some Neutral hummingbird feeder The fucking thing is designed To keep me glued to it That's where Manipulating me to like I wish it was honestly So this is where shit gets weird It's where the code Is manipulated And just There's just So messy, our modern world Because even going for a run Which is terrific and healthy for you It's bizarre Part of the reason why it's so difficult to do that Is because it's a Bizarre thing to do There's people that do There's tribes today that Still persistent Use persistence hunting That means you're in Africa in the heat of the day You pick the warmest Time possible and then You aren't as fast As some As some mammal As some like elk or whatever And so you run You jog after it And because humans can Sweat and cool down And other mammals need to Stop to breathe the pant To cool themselves If you just keep this thing having to move And you jog after this thing For three, four hours In the heat of the day It'll just fall over And then you stab it And that's how you eat that day And we're built to be having to Imagine getting done with all that And then they see someone On a treadmill Just running in place Like, what are you doing? Like, oh, I do this for fun I do this to feel good I run in one place To feel good I'm not chasing something I'm not hunting something I just do this for kicks They would think you're insane Because it is a sort of insane thing to do And just as that hummingbird Has now been adapted That hummingbird has been adapted To eat twice its body weight And sugar a day because of what it needs to And then when it's migrating Some of them need to Swim across the ocean To get from Florida To Central America They need to, they'll stop Or I think Texas actually They'll stop and they'll put on Twice their body weight In two or three days Just eating And that's what they're adapted to do But now, now you're doing that And you're ballooning up And you don't need to Swim across the ocean anymore So now you're just Now you're just larger Than you need to be And now your wings aren't holding up And you need a heart beating A thousand beats per minute It's probably pretty fine Tune for just the right amount Of sugar and everything And now you're having cardiovascular diseases And everything else And you think that And you're trying to come up with stories Of like why is this happening Is this thing a devil that did this Or is it just that I'm doing the wrong Because sometimes it stops feeding us Is it, so then you develop Rituals of like oh sometimes If you're banging on the window Well banging on the window isn't always going to get us attention So then there's intermittent rewards So then it's like oh if the do is right On the morning it's because You want to catch him when he's like in his kitchen Or whatever and you develop these Rituals over time That end up working and you come up With really dramatic lore About them because The more dramatic The more salient it is And the more a brain's going to attach To it and so Especially as social creatures That's a lot so if you're back to If you're back to Say fighting You're fighting with your significant By the way Duncan was not Fighting with His significant over a fence Fight adjacent Honestly we were fighting this Oh yeah no we've You know we've been married long enough now Where we're really learning how not Like when we're fighting adjacent You know just like I'm getting better It's generally usually The solution is Really simple it isn't complex But no The reason Shanky's bringing up this fence I have friends who are now making fun of me Because I've been in an infinite This pouring Householder Project To try to get a fence around my house I love it It is so hard to think forever And it's not as easy as you think It should be easy but it's not Anyway the point is We were talking about the stupid fence But it's for the millionth time That's the problem The first time we were talking about the fence It was exciting And it's also The thing is you and I Duncan We have to build A podcasting empire And we're writing We're managing all these big things And then it's those straws Like the camel's back It's always the Little tiny nonsense Shit like the tech issues Those are the things that break you Not the grand We can come up with fun things To talk about and all that That's the easy part The hard part of life is putting up With those small Those thousand cuts of Dealing with a lumber company And then You almost want to just burn the house You almost just want to be like You know what we fucked up Let's just call it a day And incinerate this fucking house So what happens in that 20 minutes That you've resolved The fence issue but your hormones Haven't dialed down If you haven't yet learned as a couple To like oh maybe we need to take a 20 minute break Or 25 minute break Let that parasympathetic Response do its thing And then revisit this And it's probably fine If you instead keep piling on And you're keeping that stress response Activated longer But here's the thing that we do as social creatures Is you reach out For support so you're still Stressed and you're like Am I crazy? Then you call a friend And you go They're giving me this hard Time over this and that and your What's your friend going to do They're your friend they're going to be like Yeah you shouldn't put up with that Now they're building this Dumb case for you They're reinforcing a thing That should have never been reinforced In the first place Exactly You overly attached to an idea And now you're bringing in the troops To like your social You're bringing your damn Network into this stupid fight That you shouldn't be having In the first place and they're Helping you build this dumb case Okay so So here's the When you're telling me all these When you're making this beautiful Connection Between hummingbird feeders Modern life Technology Dopamine hijack systems I kept thinking of like The Archetype of the like Jesus in the desert being Tempted by Satan or the Buddha About to achieve Realization A similar situation appears Where there's a Essentially like I guess If you wanted to reduce it to the most I don't know Something maybe obnoxiously Basic They're invited to instead Of like let go of the world To Utilize various dopamine Hijack systems Power Fear Which is a great Way to hijack someone's Nervous system Sex All the things so like Both of these in a lot of these stories That's what happens is that there's temptation The temptation is from the world Trying to hijack your shit to hack you It's essentially you're trying The world's trying to hack you So This is The birth of like Religion or philosophies It's That aren't superstitious That aren't like you know Based on some kind of like cargo Cult mentality but more along the lines Of an identification of a problem Wait a minute Our nervous systems are constantly Being hijacked by Shit in the world And this never ending Hijacking Is Reducing us to the level of Reactors In the world and usually the way we're reacting Is wrong usually our suspicions Are unfounded usually What we think is a miss isn't A miss at all I mean I don't know how many times You've run into the person Who is living a life where they are certain All their friends hate them Have you ever run into that person? I have People who think Who have this suspicion That everyone they know Secretly Distains them And that's how they start acting And so they start getting weird And they start getting needy And they start getting scared They're like look I just know you don't like me Why don't you just say it? And it's like what are you talking about? I used to like you But now I don't know It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy It really does Yeah But so Or the other side of that is just like You end up Coming up with a solution That involves all this effort And energy expenditure Because you've made up an animal That you're going to capture There isn't even something to chase You just made it up And then finally you get the thing you're thinking of And you're nothing's changed at all You're in the identical situation So that's where you hear What's called What is it Alan Watts I think Alan Watts called it the perennial philosophy That's where this transcendental idea emerges Which is We need to just deal with the reality That we're kind of blind But not blind like our eyes are Covered with a blindfold But blind in the sense that there's so much stimulus Happening And so many More than likely completely wrong Uh Reasons that we're coming up with For how we're feeling or what's happening That it doesn't really make sense anymore To try to make sense of the world You know what I mean This is where people start using The word intention Which is like okay I'm going to help people You start finding like a basic You need a basic basic thing Which is like oh yeah I'm fucking hungry as shit And I'm annoyed My mouth is dry My neck is tight Here is My wife She wants a fence around the property But If I start getting into like I feel this way because of this and that It's only going to compound An already stupid tedious problem Rather than a very simple What do you need What do we want How can I help It does seem to boil down To that You need something far more simple Than these Fucking Neurological hijacking mechanisms That are becoming increasingly complex And increasingly powerful And increasingly subtle Because if you don't have something like that Then you're going to get You're going to smash into the window Over and over and over again You know what I mean You're going to be in hell This is why I mean grounding is just so important too Because there's So there was a ton of things That I thought of there So one part of why It makes sense for the mind's eye To exaggerate things is imagine that Skinner box again I don't know if a study like this has ever been done But imagine that Instead of doing some Because once you get complacent You don't just need the intermittent rewards But you can also just give the thing a raise And it will care again So once it takes one for granted And then you can give it three And it'll be excited again ten But then ten will become what one Once was But then when you have a hit When you have a drop When it goes down to five rewards You were getting ten Now you're freaking out Even though that's five times What once made you happy Now, based on context I'm not as happy as I was three weeks ago This can fluctuate Your brain is kind of always Measuring these things But imagine that reward Imagine you saw it ahead of time It was behind a glass So you knew if it was one reward Or five rewards or ten rewards I would imagine The motivation Would go up depending On how many If you see behind the glass That there's ten rewards Now you're very excited to hit the lever One reward you're like I'll get there, whatever Now imagine Now take the blinder off again And you don't know what's behind there What is going to motivate you more Is that exaggerated Mind's eye You're going to imagine Oh, I bet there's ten back there That's what's going to get you up That's what's going to motivate you And get you out of bed Well, the same thing happens with fear In these scenarios You're going to be that much More motivated to be vigilant I was outside I've been outside It's been nice here in Wisconsin And got this little fountain Out back And I'll watch these little birds Come by to drink from the fountain In every single one of them The land, they're like They're looking around, they're looking at me I'm fifteen feet away They're fidgety and nervous They take a little drink of water And then they're like And then they check to see if that was okay And then they take a longer drink of water And then, bam, they're off Better get the hell out of here That went well, okay Let's get out of here before the trouble starts It's like, dude, you could just chill And have a drink of water there If you knew the reality of the situation Which is that I'm not going to attack you I'm just here watching you But you need to imagine that Well, what if this thing does decide To just throw something at me Or whatever, that's game over I don't get to live another day To take that back And so you imagine these Kind of worst case scenarios And so this is where there's this idea Of learned helplessness That comes in, which I think that When you're talking about the people That are like paranoid And I think that we've all I know I've gone through that in some manic states That's why I'm so vocal About paranoia Because I know what paranoia can do To the mind, which is You can have the most outlandish Idea of something And everything in you All of your logic is going No, that's not right I'm not in a Truman show You know, Duncan's not playing Some joke on me And it has me on my podcast And pretends to be interested And then afterwards tells people Listen to what this idiot's saying Of course that's not what's happening But what if it is In that moment when you're like Oh my god, the cost involved On the sliver of a chance that that is Makes it become more real Have you ever heard of the availability heuristic? No It's the more readily You can imagine something The more probabilistic Your brain tends to believe it to be So, simple study They go, here's the control, they go Hey, you're taking a flight For $30 You can have this life insurance If your plane goes If you die during this flight For any reason Crash, you have a heart attack Whatever, your family gets a million dollars And most people are like No, thank you And then the other condition is All right, $30 And your family gets a million dollars life insurance If there's a terrorist attack On the plane More people sign up for that Even though the first condition included Terrorism in every possible scenario Yeah But when you start creating an image When you start going like Oh, now you can picture someone with a vest Like that's going to blow up the plane or whatever This is why if you're selling someone a car You get them behind the wheel You get them imagining Oh, now I can I'm driving it to work I'm driving this to the beach Oh, I could take this camping Okay And they do the same thing The other similar one is there's like There's like There's like a description of a bank teller And they're like, this bank teller She's a female She wears like this or that And this other thing And what is What is the chance that That she is a feminist And people Rather than just like a female bank You know, someone comes into the bank They're wearing this or that What's the chance that she's a female bank teller And then what's the chance that she's a female Bank teller feminist They'll pick the They're more likely to pick the Rate the feminist one higher Just because it's that much more specific It draws more of an image Even though if she was just a female bank teller That also includes the feminist thing And all these other things But you just can't picture it as much And so we really like to picture things And create these stories And then that makes them more real So now There's two main stressors in life Which is lack of predictability And lack of control If you can't predict things That sucks If you can't predict a shock happening That sucks But if you can do something when you're shocked Okay, that's something And then the lack of control is like Okay, you can't You have no control over getting shocked But you know when it's going to happen A light comes on, you're gonna get shocked You can at least brace yourself You can at least like plan accordingly And those are just stressful situations But if you take both of them If you just put something in a cage Filled with unpredictable shocks There's no, it has no control It can't move to the other side There's nothing it can do about it It learns helplessness It learns that this world Is full of unpredictable shocks That I have no control over Now if you put it back in a situation Where it does have control It does have predictability It can't learn that It takes it like 50 times longer to learn Than if you would have just put something fresh in it Would have learned right away That sucks That really sucks And so what happens when you take predictability And control away from say like a global pandemic Or the many things that happen in our lives Loss of job or something like that What is the conscious narrative That is going to validate that feeling If you're little lawyers in your head Want to build a case That the world is full of unpredictable shocks That you have no control over What does that case look like You start looking for there's like these Superpowers with these agencies These super brides that are This world They are out to get me specifically What's even the point of expending energy When I know I'm just going to get shocked And have no control over it anyway Why waste the energy putting effort into anything It's much cheaper energetically To create very very dramatic stories Of why nothing is worth doing Wow Yeah right Like you want to come up with or You want to come up with And sometimes those stories are so insane Man Sometimes those stories are so ridiculous And again I want to say that I'm saying this from a non-judgmental point of view I'm saying this from a lived in experience Of like you know I've been to psych wards I know what paranoia feels like I've told myself endless stories in my life That nothing is worth doing So many times I've fallen If anything I teeter I really have to watch The learned helplessness aspect of life Is something that my brain will grab on to In a hurry You give it a chance to say that Like none of this shit matters And nothing means anything My brain will be like ooh I can get down with that I can get down with that narrative And it's dangerous and it's seductive Well yeah I mean it is very seductive And it usually is like Whenever that's happening to me What's happened is I have Transplanted relative reality with absolute reality You know what I mean It's like the other day I'm having a conversation With some people that we just met And this guy Super cool people by the way But you know we were saying like it's cold And this guy did the thing Which is You think this is cold? This isn't cold You know what I mean Like you gotta go to Michigan right now It's cold as fuck if Yeah exactly So this is like And we were laughing Cause like that always happens I've definitely done it But then in an event What we're talking about is relative reality Which is no shit Like if you've ever been to the vacuum of space Compared to the vacuum of space It's fucking sweltering right now Like So that's But because we live in a system Where that relative reality Gets so fucking Is infinite In other words it's like What you think you're tall You're six feet tall Have you ever seen Jupiter? I mean like Jupiter Do you know what I mean Six feet tall people would take To wrap around Jupiter I don't know But a lot of you You'd have to be way bigger To be the size of Jupiter But so if you get too If you get for me If I get too into that Absolute reality Where I'm comparing myself Or my problems Or the world Or what I could do in the world to Some to the vastness To the infinite vastness Yeah sure You're gonna become completely You're gonna become meaningless You know like yeah You're just like What are you You're less than anything You're not even a You know we look in the microscope You see the thing I don't know what it is Something Miba maybe I don't know You see the thing getting eaten You're not like Oh my god the horror Yeah That thing's just got ripped to pieces But because it's so much smaller than you And so much different than you You don't give a fuck about it And theoretically There's beings infinitely more Advanced than us Infinitely larger than us Infinitely everything Who like maybe are vaguely aware In a way of like When a nat goes into a window They're gonna feel like that When the planet When the sun's super novice You know what I mean Like a It'll be a thing in a second In their eye They won't care They might even think About a planet of sentient beings Who cares Stupid You're boring things You never got off the planet Really Fucking idiots But the All I'm saying is like When I get So that means I've gotten too Out in absolute reality You know what I mean Like I'm saying Once you start getting down into Like their relative Relative reality Then there is a reason To keep trying There is a reason to keep trying And you know In that My friend Imo and I Just had this conversation about this You know which is What is the reason to keep trying What is the reason to keep trying When it truly is Random electric shocks You know That come in the form of like Fucking fence The shoelace breaks Whatever You know You're like For no reason You like Thought you were done pissing But you're 46 Suddenly piss It gets in your teeth You know what I mean I'm so happy that I'm not the only one You're not the only one But like All I'm saying is like The So this is where If you boil If you condense it down To just like The as-is-ness of things Why wouldn't we just give up Or why wouldn't you just lay Why wouldn't you lay on your back And just give up And imagine you have no power Or authority or anything Over the world Why wouldn't you just do that And there's a lot of answers There's a lot of answers to that But the one we just talked about With my friend Emil Is um Rebellion Basically the idea is like What we have as humans That makes us so exceptionally powerful And incredible Is that regardless of that shit We can just decide No I'm getting back up You know what I mean Just that Is pretty fucking amazing Just that No It doesn't matter Am I in the Some matrix maze Run by a demiurge That's like Said all these technological traps Around me Or whatever they may be Entwined me in a body Where my nervous system Is like Being completely manipulated By everything around me To make me do some stupid Little fucking pigeon dance Just because Who knows why Who knows why This is why Camus uses the cursed Sisyphus Pushing the boulder up the hill For eternity Having to watch it roll back down And where Sisyphus fucks the gods Is he's like No, I'm gonna keep doing it I'm gonna keep doing it I'm gonna keep happily doing it And that means that you didn't Get me motherfucker Yeah Yeah, I have to do this I guess because you're making me do it Yeah, I guess I'm in a human body And I guess I've got a dick And I guess I like to fuck And it makes me excited And I have fucking weird nipples For no reason I don't make milk And I guess like I'm gonna worry about my bald spot And yeah But In the midst of all of it I'm still going to Be me and happy And as I am In the midst of that Regardless of the shocks Yeah You keep shocking me motherfucker I'm gonna keep doing what I do Anyway, in there is this rebellion This like sweet Like Indomitable kind of thing That a human has the ability Has the capacity To To You know, actualize You know And I don't mean to keep rambling But No You were talking about Your advice about In the early days of the pandemic Dead on You were like This shit isn't ending anytime soon I was still believing Like a few months maybe It'll It'll go away And you were like Oh no, no, no We're gonna be in this For a long fucking time And it's gonna be longer than you think And it helped me a lot man Because like I didn't attach myself To some bullshit idea That you know That this was gonna end anytime And one of my friends was telling me In Victor Frankel's man's search for meaning One of the things he noticed is that people Would start saying We're gonna be out of here in a couple of months We're gonna be out of Auschwitz in a couple of months That's where they were We're gonna be out of this concentration camp In a couple of months We're gonna get liberated Two months would pass They're still there And those people They'd either kill themselves or just die After those two months Because they'd set up A time that they were gonna escape And that was Even though it gave them Two months of like Okay It long-term ruined Yeah You know what I mean? Yeah So you strip away that And I wasn't even I wasn't even being like Negative or fearful Or trying to fear monger Or anything at the time It was just It served me so well I've been able to I've been able to take on all these other projects Like this super fucking awesome thing That I'm doing with Rameen Nasir How Mind Under Matter But I've been able to I'm in a place now Where things are like The summers looking really good COVID-wise Hopefully people keep on getting vaccinated I'm a little worried about the fall If we don't get high enough numbers Of people vaccinated And mutations and stuff But I might be in a situation now Where I'm like Ooh, things might be getting better More like a little sooner Than I had anticipated in my head And that's such a beautiful reward That I get to have To like great It's happening sooner I never had to endure the like Ugh More of this And I'm not counting my chickens by the way But things are I mean the vaccines are looking Absolutely incredible Getting people to take them That's another issue altogether But yeah I mean And by the way In terms of like Us getting hacked all the time You know We've been hacking people through Making people laugh through like We use disgust to hack people You go That group of people They're cockroaches Or that That's a filthy woman Or that person makes me sick You're hacking peoples Often without knowing it You're hacking peoples Disgust mechanisms Which he talked about fear and sex and the other Disgust mechanisms are another motivator That make people pay attention Like Oh this person is disgust Well you're not eating that person There's no reason to attach it to You know A disgust mechanism But it's so powerful That we create these metaphors to do that And so modern technology Is just doing a little bit of like It's just adding on to what we're already doing And there's beautiful ways of doing this too Like marketing all these things Like You do an ad read And you create a beautiful experience for someone There's the same There's I don't mean to make this This is a Here's just a thing that I saw recently That cracks me up I didn't mean to attach it to anything else But there's I just saw this story Or I read this book about marketing And it was about how You can fool Wine sommeliers By like adding If you add red dye to a white wine They'll start using Descriptions that are more Associated with red wines Than right wines usually Because our tongue Is one aspect Of the experience of tasting It's the presentation It's our eyes It's the How is your server How was the story The server builds up these So they test all these things You can build this This is my grandma's recipe And she went through all of these things You can build It adds to the experience This is why This is why you put Like you go and see a painting In a museum And you're like Why do people like this painting? And then you read the description And you're like Oh wow I see that brush stroke now Well they do this Yeah They did this with pâté They decided to take dog food And turn it and make it look like pâté And see if people could tell the difference And they couldn't Like people that liked pâté They couldn't tell Oh god They couldn't tell the difference And part of You know My inclination My cynical inclination Is to go See you're living a lie You know That pâté That pâté That you were spending so much money on That was bullshit You could have just been eating dog food And I did this to myself Like I trained myself to like pâté Because I just decided I should like it And I didn't So I kept on eating it Until I had an appreciation for it And now And I do that to myself I'm like Shane You idiot You trained yourself to like dog food But the reality is Is there's more to the taste experience Than just the tongue So you can have the cynical You trained yourself to like dog food Dude I first had pâté In France I like meat It seemed like the sort of Like I like ahi tuna and stuff Seemed like the sort of thing I should like I try a bite I'm like this is revolting I hate this And there was some thing Because I had that with wine earlier on too But then I learned to appreciate wine And I was like that's what I needed to do with pâté And so for years Duncan I'd be like by myself On the road I would like order pâté And so like fancy French place Or whatever I'd eat it Nope Still don't like pâté One day I'm in Albuquerque, New Mexico I order it And I'm like ooh I like this pâté This is like a seven year journey For me to enjoy pâté For who knows what reason I'm doing this for Just this feeling like I should And then two weeks ago I'm reading this book And there's this dog food study And I'm like you fucking moron You spent seven years Spending all this money To like dog food So that's the cynical take The optimistic take Is that there's just a lot more Going on to our sensory experience And when we do enjoy When we are grateful for the environment That we're in When we do have the culinary expert That's spent all this time And you can really appreciate it And much like this human experience That we're in Is insanely troubling in a lot of ways Because we have all these mismatches Of like now we gotta find ourselves On these weird like stationary bicycles And stuff What? Why would you get on a bicycle? That doesn't go anywhere Completely insane But you have to stay healthy But it's also being human Evolution never saw something like this Like what that hummingbird went through There's never been anything like this That a species like an apex predator Got so powerful That it would just throw scraps Till there was never a shark That was such a good hunter That it would throw scraps Just because it liked the way some other fish looked And thought they were cute So it would feed them regularly Once in a while you'll see some fun video Of like a goat falls in love With a cat or something like that But never has a species just been like You know what? We're doing so great We're just gonna start giving away crap Feed the birds We're gonna feed birds We're gonna feed deer We're just gonna start feeding other crap too Wait you're gonna feed the birds To trap them and eat them right? Like you wanna eat them? No, just wanna look at them I wanna take pictures of them I just like their feathers No I kind of Yeah And the feathers were doing it for me for a while And now I just kind of feel the sense of responsibility I don't even care that much about the bird anymore But I'm gonna go out there and clean that damn thing anyway And maybe you're even helping their migratory patterns In doing this But because by the way I don't wanna It was just a thought experiment To my knowledge there's nothing wrong With becoming birds correctly And I'd probably encourage you to do so actually But the idea that we get to do this That we as miserable as we can feel sometimes We're doing so well That we can just throw crumbs to other species Not for a trick Just for amusement It's incredible It's incredible And it's incredible also the implication Because if we go back to this idea of relative reality And use that with intelligence Which is many people say Well you can't do that yet Because we haven't found life on other planets But we're here And we did this We did this We got to the point of an apex predator That is now keeping pets Not just keeping pets But using essentially eugenics We're breeding Like we took tigers And turned them into like tiny adorable Purring little things You know what I mean We did that on purpose That wasn't wolves hunting That was like the people Who created the fucking pyramids Over time Gradually like The same with dogs And the same with so many other creatures So that to me the implication Is really profound In the sense that In the same way in your awesome story About the hummingbird When we've assigned some kind of Ability to contemplate its reality It's thinking all these Probably very lofty things You know what I mean Maybe it's thinking like I must be incredible That this is happening I must be fucking incredible It's giving me this juice I did everything right And I maybe know something about me I told myself if I just kept on Doing everything right And going to every fifth flower In striving day in and day out One day I would get a sign And then it appeared Yeah Right But you know humans When we start contemplating our place In the universe and the possibility Of a greater intelligence Yeah It may be even the possibility Of a panspermia Greater intelligence Having some hand in Our evolutionary process Or the seeding of the earth With genetic material Yeah We think to ourselves Well It must be because we're amazing Whatever did this You know Like it has a special Like probably a special Some people say We're being trained And we're being like Sort of gradually groomed To take on the role of God And maybe the hummingbird is like You know maybe I'm getting They're doing this Because they're going to give me a house Like this eventually or something But not realizing like No I just think it's cool to see a hummingbird Which is why I'm doing this Similarly if there's some vast intelligence It could just be like Yeah Like we might just be like We might be like that fog They put out in clubs You know what I mean Like we just might be that sentient fog To some advanced intelligence That got us on its version Of fucking Instagram You know what I mean It got some stupid thing Makes a human planet See the humans They run around They blow each other up And like that's it We're just giving something A mild kind of entertainment If that It doesn't really care Maybe it made the whole planet Populated the planet with us But it doesn't really care Maybe it was given the planet Just like you know what I mean Somebody gives you a bird feeder And it's like yeah Alright I'll fucking seed it With genetic things Just for the fuck of it The point is man I think when you start realizing like Our place in the universe Isn't necessarily one In which we are the chosen lambs Of the divine You know what I mean We're God's children Or we're this or that We could just be some kind of You know Something like mildly entertaining For a not so exciting God There's never been It's so unfathomable That no one's made this movie Aliens are always coming To take it over Or they're helping us Or they're saving us It's like very human centric They're real wrapped up In what we're doing Never does like Never does an alien Just show up like Sprinkle a bunch of like Tablets with fanciful technology They're like Oh look at how much They like these things And then kind of get bored With us and then leave And then we're left going like What was that? You know it's kind of I guess the closest thing Would be the What's the What's the God's are crazy Or whatever The coke bottle falls out of it And like the meaning making That goes behind that It's sad Cause you know Like I love ancient aliens But the sad thing is Generally like the idea is Like they're coming back Like they left They're gonna come back But really they They just weren't that into us They might have come They're just like Yeah I don't know There's like that planet By that little fucking stupid star And it's got things on it But there's so many other Cooler like versions of it That why would you even go there? I was I had this rock climbing Partner for a little while That was like He was like The boyfriend of My girlfriend's friend of the time Or whatever So we just got like Partnered up you know Rock climbing And I'm not Unless you're hitting record Or I'm on stage I'm kind of an introverted person And I can be like A little timid and everything So I'm climbing with this guy For a while I knew he had some computer job And I'm like Oh why haven't I Have I not asked him More about his work Why hasn't it And so I like We had lunch And I asked him More about what he does And realized Oh this is why he's been Keeping this from me What his job was Was that So there's a There's a It's basically like an ad farm So what his company did Was supplied an app That would run ads All the time on phones So what you Like hey You want to make a few extra bucks Just get a whole Get 20 cheap phones That you're going to plug in And just download this app And then it runs ads On your phone all the time The person running those ads Hoping that it's reaching real people Pays an amount of money It's fraud It's absolute fraud And so they're paying money for this And then you're just harvesting This ad money And then they're always having to Because like You know they're developing systems To catch these cheats doing this And stuff they're always trying to Out with this And I remember thinking at the time If this is a simulation That's what I think the simulation is Like you're an ad On someone's phone That they bought To get a couple extra dollars For a thing And I realize no one's even watching this That's amazing All of human history It's just There's a fucking alien just trying to Skip, skip, skip, skip I hate this fucking thing I hate this human history So fuck, skip, skip, skip So boring Yeah well I mean that is the You know my One of my friends man He had this Just off handedly once He was like Telling me about like ants He was like you know an ant Get stepped on by a human But it doesn't know That's even what happened It doesn't know what fucking humans are Or what you know what I mean And a human dies And it's like oh I died of this disease But it's only because of the You know limited perception It can't see that like In some higher realm You know what I mean It's like a It's a fingernail that just got clipped It's probably something you know It's a plant that just a leaf Got plucked off a plant Oh and I'm sure ants are just At peace with genocide At this point in their evolutionary history There's just like huge sloths Of them being wiped out In like not the most predictable ways All the time you know Some primate sticks of Puts a stick in their hole And they climb on the stick And they just get licked off the thing And it must happen all the time There's a Or not Hold on a second Or not I mean isn't that the Isn't that the great terror Like one of the most Prohibited technologies If it ever happens The thing that they won't allow For a while Will be anything that lets us Feel the experience of other animals Ants, birds, whatever Because unless like You know you feel like a hummingbird And it's just like Nothing It's like It doesn't feel like anything It's just some robotic Nothingness that zips around But should you feel like The experience of an ant And realize it loves Do you remember Do you remember that What was that awesome Like alien sci-fi movie Starship Troopers Do you remember that movie? Yeah a little bit A little Let me bring you back It's an amazing fucking Commentary on fascism But at the very end of this movie With delight This telepath like Communes with an alien And with a big smile on his face It's like they're afraid They feel fear It's delightful What I'm saying is You know as a human If suddenly you realize like Oh no Actually Every blade of grass Every creature Everything is feeling love Joy Happiness Sadness It didn't have anything to do With your fucking nervous system You anthropocentric fuck It was just the nature of things Oh Oh It would talk about being paralyzed You know what I mean Cause then you would have to decide Like how do I take another step How do I do anything You know I'm a conquering dragon thing That just kills As a matter of its existence You know what I mean Part of being able to live in the world Requires imagining that trees Are just fucking like Bits of like planetary pubic hair You know that loggers trim Versus like what they really are Habitats Shade Oxygen producers You know what I mean Like we don't want to think about that We don't want to think about that We want to pretend it's just like Trimming a beard when you clear cut a fork You know Add to that the motherfuckers might actually Like you know be sad Is there being ripped down It would be a difficult way to Like it would be hard to be Well if it makes living any easier Something would theoretically Probably need a limbic system To have the rich emotional experience That we do So it needs to at least have a little bit Of some neurons going on probably But at least feelings in a way that we That's a probably friend We conceptualize them By the way Speaking of aliens I know I've been hounding you about this But you gotta check out Alien Worlds On Netflix because it's Here's why I'm not gonna watch it You keep recommending it And here's why I'm not gonna watch it It tortures me I can't watch it because It makes me sad That that isn't A real alien world I know it's so But it is But it's like It's not science fiction It's science speculation So what they do is They'll take an evolutionary biologist Being like Oh here's why these stock-eyed flies Have these eyes that go out Real weird and long It's because of the sexual selection pressure And then they go through a few things And then they're like Okay on this planet Where we think there might be life The gravity is slightly different And it has more suns So here's based on What we know about how evolution works here Here's what you might expect life To look like with little more gravity Or a little more sun on it And then it combines fantastic CGI And stuff I think you dig it I'll check it out again Because my main issue with alien stuff Where we differ is like the I guess it's kind of Reverse anthropomorphizing It's that everything looks so human-like We're like well If there's a superior intelligence I imagine it's like Us with a slightly better brain So definitely bipedal Maybe longer hands Hands are great Stuff like that Where it's like It might look like spiders And things like that Is what alien life might look like So I like that kind of speculation Yeah I do too I'll check it out Yeah I don't It's really weak of me That I can't watch a thing Because it's not real What the fuck is wrong with me It's more It's like David Attenborough Speculating on alien world type stuff But then regarding ants There's one thing That I do think That we need to be aware of In our modern environment Which is there's an ant colony In South America Where they have The way they navigate things Is kind of like flocks Or other things Where they're taking Like subtle cues from various Like oh okay That bird sees something Maybe we don't So if it darts in this direction We'll just follow it Well these ants do this similar thing And once in a while So they're navigating Based on each other's hormonal trails That they're leaving And once in a while Too many of them will get off course A little bit And get turned a little bit And what happens is They start spiraling Have you seen this? The death spiral And then they just Keep on spiraling around And around in a circle Having no idea Like just following the trail That usually gets them Where they need to go And now it's just Millions of them Just marching themselves to death In a death spiral So we do need to keep an eye out For things We need to keep an eye out For things like that Good night everyone Have a good night Sleep tight Sleep tight I always have We're not in a death spiral I love to I have my bias One of my many biases Is that I tend to I tend to attach to the dark Cynical side of things More than is probably accurate I don't think it's cynical I think the only thing I think like I remember By the way We've been going for a long time I feel like I'm taking way too much of your time Okay So like when I was in Religion's class And they were like Reading some verse from the Bhagavad Gita And the verse had something to do with being detached Like the attitude in the world It's literally like the most scandalous verse Which is The wise mourn neither For the living nor the dead And it's like People at this liberal art school Kids They're just like What the fuck You're saying be detached From this life that Because it says things like Passionless You know Fixed Passionless And people hear that and they're like But That's who I am It's the thing that weeps When I hear Inya You know what I mean Like that's me And So I think like A lot of times When people are hearing something They'll say oh that's cynical But it really isn't Cynical Necessarily As much as like It's just the way things are And that If you Want to live a Seizured life You know Where instead of like Strobelites Activating Your epilepsy It's like Boobs Or Cigarettes Or whatever And it's not as literal Seizure you're having But it is kind of In the sense that like It sets off a string of reactions That always lead to the same result Which is a kind of Weird stupid death spiral Yeah You know what I mean But if you want to say That's what it is to be human That's life man It's like That first sip of whiskey And then you have your cigar Bed on the fucking game Get a blow job from the thing And then you wake up And you do it again It's like if you want to say That is what life is all about I think that's actually quite cynical You know that What's I don't know which What's like What's less cynical You know Like pretending that a human life is one of Like self induced ups and downs Acting By the time you're in your 30s or 40s Surprised when shit doesn't work out Even though it's like Consistently hasn't been working out For a long time I don't mean working out Like you lose the job or whatever I mean literally like Shit doesn't really work out here You know But we're supposed to always be in a Constant state of like Shock or surprise or Anger or fear Like whatever But at some point it's like You know I'm sorry I'm rambling but It's like the thing that ruined my addiction To My embarrassing addiction to World of Warcraft Was and I'm sorry This is such an obvious thing But all of a sudden I realize like Literally the same loop is happening here Like All that's happening is the shit I'm fighting Is getting bigger And more colorful And the things I'm fighting it with Are getting bigger And more colorful It's the red queen And the speed that I'm shooting at it Is getting like faster But it doesn't matter because all that's Happening is the things Exactly The things just get bigger So that the thing That used to be amazing the speed Is now too slow Then it speeds up again And you realize like ah This is just a stupid Never-ending repeating loop With increasingly colorful bullshit in it That is like completely hijacked My nervous system Yeah level one was just as Challenging as level 20 Now and it's the same rewards It's the same amount of challenge It's just On a different scale Same feeling Of desire mixed in with like Disappointment mixed in with like Oh wait I figured it out But that's really not much different Than any given human life You know it's like a similar situation That we're in here right You realize like even if you are Massively successful what's happening You know your nesting box gets bigger Yeah yeah That's it You know what I mean Your nesting box gets bigger Your The thing you drive around The nesting box to get this shit To bring back to the nesting box Looks cooler You know but That's pretty much it Yeah yeah You know so All I'm saying is I don't think it's cynical at all To kind of look at Human society as it is right now And say If this isn't a fucking death spiral I don't know what it is Yeah Like We won't be the first species To hit a peak and And collapse It happens all the time Where some new invasive species It finds itself in Some really favorable environment Where now it can have a ton of kids And do really well And everything is great And then it overpopulates Eventually runs out of those resources And then just massive Drops off the cliff And Drops off the cliff Yeah And then it starts over again Which is great I mean that's the I think that There's something to be said for Not Quite Buying the whole thing That's happening You know like Not being completely Do it for as long as you want to do it But at some point It's like nice to realize Like you You aren't that important In fact You know what I mean Like and that's not bad Like that's good Even if you were important You wouldn't be that important I think that This is something that Comedians and Scientists can really take advantage of As this alien anthropologist idea Like okay Take me out of it As much as I can zoom out Imagine humans weren't here Imagine this wasn't a tradition Imagine that and now look at it As an alien and you're like Explaining to this alien What's going on Now things look pretty bizarre Our traditions, our habits Look pretty bizarre from this alien anthropologist Point of view because you realize Oh many of our behaviors Are just these historical leftovers We just kind of do things The way that they were done in the past And some of these things served Different times and different contexts Better even as we sit here Giving advice to like our younger Selves basically of like Shane I wish you would have learned This little aspect earlier Of not needing to be The top of the Status pyramid Or whatever because you're going to find that Embarrassing anyway And want to run from it The moment you have any kind of spotlight And But the thing is Is like different stages of life We needed different Just like that sea squirt Needed a brain for a while And then doesn't need a brain anymore The same thing happens with Puberty and hitting middle age These different systems take over So some young person might Be listening to us thinking we're bestowing Some like grand wisdom But maybe you do need A little bit of that like Maybe you do need that to get addicted To the video game for a little while And you need to work through Through all that you know Yeah no I'm not I'm glad you said that I'm glad you said that because Let me just interject for one second Yeah I'm not trying It might sound like I'm being a little nihilistic Here or something like that Not at all It's your car Like you have this karma here This momentum And it's playing itself out It's just playing itself out And the Idea isn't necessarily to Suddenly stop doing anything Because we're all getting hijacked by dopamine Hijacking systems in nature And technology But rather we don't have to take it so seriously That's all It doesn't have to be like with our Gritted teeth and our fists clenched And our fucking ulcers Bleeding and our fucking Assholes tightening as we Grip our fucking lives Like we're falling out of a plane Into the mouth of a dragon or some shit We can actually just Simultaneously Honor whatever our particular desires And our incarnation is without having to be So ripped to pieces By Day to day disappointments That's what I mean Humans are the The most chronically stressed species On earth just because We have this super well adapted System that isn't fit for Our modern world But it's also I was thinking about Remember those two trails of the wolf In the rabbit that you kind of picture In your mind of like this It's almost like a molding evolution Just like wolf or whatever over time Well no one cares About that one wolf Along the way necessarily But there was like Something really beautiful And important that Each and every single one Of those wolves were A part of something that was Really quite significant and special Yeah That's it man, that's it That's how you can simultaneously like Over your life without Becoming like An ego maniacal gravity I'm the best wolf there's ever been No you're not You're a system You're part of a system And we don't know what the system is growing Into like nobody In a million years looking Back on whatever like weird lemur like Creatures we like apparently Are distant ancestors would Have looked at that and been like We'd be shooting fucking rockets Into space When a relatively short amount of time It's gonna be Fifty times bigger It's gonna have a massive brain You'd be like that's a just an annoying Weasel thing that's us And similarly like We don't know what where we're headed You know what I mean we don't know what we're gonna turn into And there's a lot of people who have some grim Prognostications But you know maybe we would have had some Prognostications seeing some Ancient weasel you know We would have thought you know this fucking planet gets hit By meteors and you're probably gonna Get eaten by a wolf or something like that You're never gonna make it to launching rockets You know what I mean so I think something about Being aware that you're part of a process Is a bit of a relief You're not the end you know it's not stopping With you Everything that you value You Gotta be wary of attaching too much To it because you can take the same species And getting Getting taller might be Advantages In one strain of it because It can now see up over the grass And it can see things better But then the one that went shorter It hides in the grass more It's less susceptible to predation Because it's hiding in the grass But the taller one's a better predator So if you're the The taller one you're probably telling yourself This tale of like Being tall is the way to be Be as tall as possible all the time And then you end up getting Snagged up by something Whereas if you're the short one you're telling yourself The same story like oh being short It's great isn't it nice just being So stealth Being stealth is the way to be And then you don't see enough stuff to eat And starve to death so there can be Pros and cons to either side Of it But what about this one Helping other people is the way to be Just help Just cook people dinner I don't mean like you know just That like to me anytime I start doing that I'm insta happy This is What about that Well I think that Cooperation is something that One it's co-virgin evolution It's happening like you mentioned It's happening in other species It's rare when it happens So there's game theory and like Tip for tat and that sort of thing And it actually It usually is Like the product of A bit of incest Early on in a species Where there was enough genes being Some species Found itself drifting off in an island And they got Separated from the rest And then they were more genetically Similar So it made sense to be Less competitive and more altruistic But then when you introduce That new That species once that species builds And then grows goes back into That old system That new system of cooperation Beats tip for tat Every time it just needs the ability To get there in the first place And then once it does Cooperation Cooperation slays In every AI model Of game theory that they've Tried And the thing is There's these weird things Happening now of People attacking Your virtue signaling Or everything's too Politically correct and everything I'm not saying that that's not the case But I will say that if it is the case It will be the first time In 3.5 billion years That a species has cared too much And that was its undoing Wow Wow That's so cool And it- Ah Shay, that's beautiful It's never happened You don't apocalypticize yourself By helping, by caring It's so weird that Ego wants you to think I'm the subjective personal level People get this fear That if they start doing that shit They'll cease to exist Which is weirdly kind of true In the sense that if you really get caught up And like, you know, I'm lucky I've got kids and wife And there's always help That needs to be done But anytime I'm like doing that I feel energized I feel The way that I think I'm going to feel If I go off by myself and Lay down and close my eyes The thing I seek in my Being a recluse I find that in helping It's like everything makes sense When you're helping So yeah, to me that's the It's the boring secret Or something It's like, oh, are you suffering Let's just see what happens What do you think is going to happen Here's a virtue signal Whoever's out there rolling your eyes You fuck That's the funny thing about that It's like, oh what, you think I can't stand my ground? You think I can't come back At you? You attack me? You think I won't give back? Alright, try it Let's face it, claiming virtue signaling Is virtue signaling Which is a different type of virtue signaling When you get in a never ending Infinity mirror of virtue signaling It's a waste of time When I'm reading anarchist literature When I'm reading any kind of Communist stuff or any kind of Socialism, generally in there There's this idea of Do you know your neighbors You need to go meet your neighbors And that sounds so dumb But a lot of people don't do that So next door To my house is A senior citizen Who has dementia and has a caretaker Who almost burned her house down So they fixed it Thank God, but I'm there And I'm walking With forest and there are these People in front of the house with the woman Who I hadn't seen yet, so I stopped And it was uncomfortable and weird And I said, hi, I'm your neighbor And this very nice lady Was like, oh hi Introduced me to this woman who has dementia And then I said to her Hey, here's my phone number If you ever need me to check on her Or you need anything right away I live right there, so here's my number And her face Cracked, man You know what I mean, it cracked in the best Way It was no longer a stranger, it was a person Who saw that I'd been through that With my dad to some degree I knew where she was at Opened up this light Beautiful light came Like not literally, but it was the most sweet Beautiful thing And anyway, all I'm saying is You're not gonna get that shit From playing Mortal Kombat You know what I mean, you're not gonna get that From winning You're not gonna get that from winning whatever the thing is You're trying to win You only get that from going To your neighbors and saying, do you need anything? Yeah And then always, it's not Why we've been programmed to think they're gonna slam The door in our face You know what I mean, so I love what you're saying Maybe that's where we're headed Maybe all this bullshit isn't A death spiral, it's like We need to be marching around in circles Long enough for us to realize This is fucking everything up It's killing the planet It's killing ourselves It's making everything meaningless By trying to constantly serve ourselves I mean, I know what I'm saying Serial box bullshit But try it, friends Just see what happens if you go and Knock on your neighbor's door and ask if they need anything Well, I think it's good timing to hear a message like this Because what happens is So Remember when COVID First started and everyone was like I think I already had COVID I had a week where my eyes were watery And stuff like that And I think it's because Much like I could sit here And explain Some like revolting Thing or whatever And make someone dry-heave You know, I can activate those Or people use disgust or whatever What happens is Is that the immune system Is looking for threats So if it's hearing things If it's being fed Ideas or whatever What will happen is the immune system Will be like, okay, there's a threatened environment And I've got to handle I either need to get away from this Or I need to handle everything that's in this environment And I've got to keep everything out I've got to keep all outside All the difference Need to stay out Different ideas Different ways of being Outside Different people Keep the different Any different thing If you're sick And you have your own challenges To face You close in And isolate more And you start signaling Like here's my tribal thing You start attacking Other tribes And so it's kind of The way things went down It's not like they couldn't have Gone a lot of better ways But it's also pretty natural For People to be averse To outgroups and helping When there's this Subliminal cue Of a virus going around And now as things are Beginning to By the way guys, I wouldn't get Too, too ahead of ourselves Just yet I would say I would tell people to live a normal Like have barbecues and hikes with your friends And stuff like that rather than go to indoor Gatherings For a minute But besides that This is like a perfect opportunity Now that people can go out Again, maybe instead of Partying and everything like that Right now Like getting, doing that Maybe going out and greeting Your neighbors and trying to be more This is me talking to myself Trying to be more understanding Of one another And trying to be a little more altruistic Because this has been If, you know, we've talked off The air about how kind of There's aspects of the pandemic that I found To be really exciting And much of it is like the chance For a reappraisal And the chance for a restructuring In a reset in our Society And I think that we'd be missing A really great opportunity If we didn't Cooperation More cooperation into We're set up perfectly for it Um, and so Yeah There you go You know what, friends, this week Do something to fucking virtue Signal about it And then virtue signal the shit out of it Just see what happens Just do it Because to me is a long-term Selfish Cunt as I was diagnosed Um LTSC Is terrible It gets a lot of people It's really It's a real epidemic It's another pandemic Yeah But the reason that I was Being so selfish Was only because I was trying to Feel a way That I feel when I like And making breakfast for my kid Or when I'm doing something that Really doesn't have anything to do With directly pleasuring myself I just didn't know That that was, you know, I'd heard these Obnoxious virtue signaling hippies Say this shit over and over again But I'd barely done the experiment And like having started Once you start down this road It's not like you're some amazing person Who feels better to help other people Than it does to help yourself What you're saying would back that up too Is though at some level We recognize That this is our Destiny as a species Is to become cooperative In an extreme way To become like I told you Here's a fun kind of anthropological Study that I think I told you briefly I was reframed in this conversation We talked about this off the air I had these anthropologists on Last fall, one of them studies Witchcraft and like hunter gather Communities and And it's really Interesting that The things that You know how acupuncture Like Scientists can go And study acupuncture and be like Oh damn, they hit Like this nerve at this perfect place That Releases this thing There's a whole jargony explanation Of why it works, but damn it How do you figure something like that out It's something that's stumbled on Through trial and error over time And so a similar thing happens Where there's this tribe of people What will happen is They will get a Waterborne virus So you have to understand Before germ theory Which people still push back on Your chiropractor will forward Like terrain theory And try to be like, oh, your brain's not connecting With your immune system I gotta adjust your spine for you And then it will communicate properly You don't believe in microscopic things Do you? Of course not You need to pay me money And so Before germ theory Before people could pick up on this idea Of things that we'd stumble on Like God bless you came as a thing Of like figuring out sneezes Where kind of Method of contagion and stuff Right, oh yeah, yeah, yeah And so this tribe They have They'll get a waterborne virus And they'll call the doctor Which we call a wish doctor But it's just their doctor there And so one The placebo effect is incredibly important To you too And believing that you're healing Is something that It's a different mindset than thinking that you're sick And so if you can have someone Come in And do this ritualistic thing That creates this like Okay, you were sick before Now you're healing That's a different sort of thing That's happening in your mind In your extremely complex And powerful immune system Maybe giving you some remedy or whatever But then there's stories attached to it Which is that an alligator The ghost alligator Came in Through the water at night And bit you And you You must have been doing something wrong You must not have been serving So first off, it's really interesting That they without Exactly putting their finger on it They're tapping into Oh, this is connected in the water To some way You know, and then it's just this Exaggerated story of this alligator And then There's victim blaming often Attached to it You've done something wrong Because we don't want to For the same reason why I learned helplessness Is so dangerous It's better to perceive patterns And So you don't want To believe that things Can just randomly Shock you So you must have done something You must have had this coming And so what they come up with then Is that Oh, you must not have been being generous enough In your Community And so then they prescribe Giving away some of their things Or doing some act of generosity And That one Just like the experience of the Pate Like hearing the whole story Will make it taste a whole lot better Than dog food, even if it is dog food Having this story Attached to it really makes The immune system work It makes this believable story That you can have this placebo effect In your immune system Can start doing its job Better to have a fancy Water filter, absolutely Any day of the week, but given their Circumstances, this placebo Works really well And then it's this socially reinforcing Thing, so what's happening This person's kind of at their weakest And they're giving stuff away Why would that be helpful? Well, now you get this reciprocal Altruism where you were just Altruistic, you shared caring And now people are caring for you The most That is brilliant I would love to know If there's been a study where People If there's any kind of correlation With service in a stronger immune system If something about Helping people somehow actually Strengthens your immune system for some reason I think there would be a lot of sexual Selection pressure too Because you're showing Much in the same way that Is like, look at how many Look at how many resources I have so many resources I can burn them In this conspicuous Conspicuous fashion I just paid $10,000 more than I needed For this emblem On the car That differentiates And acts of service can be That same way So the problem with virtue signaling Is that maybe it's like a disingenuous You say you're helping people and you're not Helping people or whatever And expecting something in return Expecting to be praised or something like that Right, but if you're actually So it's not that there's There's not a threat there And it's not that people don't take Advantage of systems pretending Like they're doing good when they aren't But to actually go out And show that you have You are so robust That you can also help others That's some sexy ass shit That's gonna get Your dick or pussy sucked Probably So that's the answer All we gotta do is flip the switch From Mercedes to helping I think so Too late for me Not That is not a virtue signal It's bad, maybe I'll cut that out I don't think I will We gotta go, man We just did an epic mega podcast This was a two and a half hour podcast Thank you I could talk to you for a hundred hours Yeah, me too, man Thank you so much for giving me your time How can people find you?

It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and in celebration of this, our 158th episode, Big 158, I'm going to release Doves into my studio. Beautiful. Beautiful. My sweet Doves. Fly home. Fly home. Fly home. Fly home. Fly to heaven little Doves tell baby Jesus hi, tell him that I love him and I hope that I don't die. Ask him why he killed my mom and took my ball away, tell him I forgive him and I hope that he's okay. In the news, pals, even though you might have been temporarily convinced by some hypnotic vampiric ship wizard that you're a pointless, empty, meaningless mode of pig flesh rolling down the river of time in the direction of oblivion, the opposite is quite true. You're the infinite universe temporarily experiencing reality using the biocomputer that you call your body. You're an infinite being, a mini big bang inflating your subjective universe using the force of your attention and every single millisecond, the incredible biocomputer that you've currently become convinced is your body, is actually constructing a universe and it does it effortlessly while you sit around shoving Doritos into your mouth and drinking LaCroix. That's a true miracle friends, you're a meat prism through which the force of creation is being refracted. So don't let some cannabalic fear paralytic inject their hysteria into your paradigm. You're going to be fine, things are going to get better, your life is going to become increasingly beautiful and your happiness is not dependent on any person, place or thing and anyone telling you otherwise is trying to enslave you so they can feed off of your fear and anxiety. Don't be fooled, you're going to be fine no matter what and anybody who says differently is a bitch. To quote Mahatma Gandhi, don't let some stinker put their finger in your brain soup baby, you're the universe. Okay pals, real quick I want to introduce you to my new friend, his name is Tempest and he was found in a car engine. He's a beautiful little kitten that my girlfriend has nursed back to health. He started off freaked out, spitting, scared and transformed into the most cuddly, wonderful, beautiful, sweet little angel who is currently residing at the Santa Dior No Kill Shelter. This is him purring. I'm telling you friends, if you smell this little baby's fur you can smell the crotch of Jesus Christ himself because I'm pretty sure that this little kitten must have been sitting in Jesus' lap up there in heaven and Jesus probably sneezed or something and he fell down to earth, landed in a car engine and was rescued. Now you, if you're somebody who's got a nice place and the ability to take care of a little kitten, if you're somebody who for whatever weird reason wants to have the pure embodiment of love enter your life, if you want to have a best friend for the rest of your life and I'm telling you this is a grade A, high quality, high grade American kitten, then all you got to do is contact Santa Dior. The number is 323-898-8889 and the website is s-a-n-t-e-d-o-r dot org. If you're somebody who can adopt Tempest, not only will you get a beautiful cat, but I'll throw in every single t-shirt and poster that we have at the shop. Adopt Tempest, won't you? Terms and conditions to apply Tempest is not thrown off the lap of Jesus, but Revelling and Scott was thrown out of heaven. Holy cow, we've got a great podcast for you today with Timothy Leary's son, Zach Leary and Gaye Dillingham. They have both created a wonderful documentary about Timothy Leary and Rom Doss called Dying to Know and they're here today to talk about that and a lot of other things. We're going to jump right into that, but first some quick business. This episode of the Dug and Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Dot Susara. About two years ago, Chris O'Dell, who started Dot Susara, a company that produces some of the most amazing hemp gear available on earth, contacted me and ended up sending me a backpack made of hemp. I've gone through a lot of changes over the last couple of years, but this backpack hasn't changed at all. It's like something out of the Lord of the Rings universe, something you might find inside a volcano hidden underneath some magma, untouched by anything that a human being can create. I have a feeling that this backpack is made of some kind of immortal hemp. I have a feeling that Chris O'Dell ascends a mountain into Valhalla and wrestles with Norse gods for permission to cultivate their eternal hemp in the fields of Odin. He then carries that stuff back down here to planet earth where he has fairies and elves that he's enslaved using his powerful charisma, endlessly sew these things together to create some of these amazing bags and shirts and fighting gear that you can find over at DotSusara.com. They've got a lot of cool stuff. They've got a really cool hoodie. They've got a really cool backpack. If you're into fighting gear, they've got fighting gear. If you want to walk into your gym with a backpack that is going to make everyone tremble in fear because they think that you are a member of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, then this is the backpack for you. Are you thinking about using a grappling hook to climb to the top of the tower to assassinate some Tsar, Emperor, or evil wizard? Then this is the backpack for you. It's not just backpacks. It's got a really cool logo, a really cool lotus-like logo, and a lot of great stuff. So please go to dsgear.com. I would not pump up this product to this level if I was not so blown away by the power of this backpack that I've had. I take this backpack on every tour with me. This backpack has been dragged through countless airports. Every other backpack that I've ever owned just falls apart. The zippers break. It ends up getting sizzled or dissolved by geysers of my super potent semen that accidentally go spraying against it in my hotel room when I'm on tour. Lots of terrible things happen to old backpacks of mine, but not my backpack from Datsusara. No, this thing seems to have been made out of the wings of a hemp gargoyle. You know what's great about hemp, aside from the fact that it's eco-friendly? It's antimicrobial, which means that the usual schmegma and sprays and coughs and exploded cysts that blast all over a backpack when you're traveling through the cities of the world don't have as much of a chance of infecting this backpack. If you've got a regular, pro-microbial, non-hemp backpack, then you might as well find some old diapers and sew them together and make a backpack out of that, because you're essentially carrying on your back a bit of plasmatic viral goo. That's not a backpack. That's a death wish you have on your back, friend. Throw that thing out. Go to dsgear.com, use Family Hour at checkout, and you will get 5% off some of these amazingly strong, breathable, antimicrobial, versatile, sustainable, eco-friendly backpacks. Just check it out.

It'll save you some time and if it makes you happy, I'm happy. Today's guests are amazing. I've got Zach Leary here. Zach Leary is Timothy Leary's son. Timothy Leary is a hero of mine. He's a controversial figure, been in jail countless times. He was the person who introduced Rom Dost to Silas Saibon just to get going and that's just a tiny infinitesimal portion of what this human being has done. He was essentially the architect of the 60s, a Harvard professor who was a prophet of psychedelics, a prophet of LSD and not just that, but also a brilliant psychologist who created incredible models through which we can understand the human psyche. He was one of Rom Dost's, aka Richard Alpert's best friends and they both kind of took separate paths. One took the path of the Guru, the path of the East and Timothy Leary took the path of the Wild Trickster Revolutionary and they sort of parted ways for a little while and then towards the end of Leary's life they came back together and that is essentially the subject of this really cool documentary that's coming out called Dying to Know. If you live in Northern California around San Francisco, they're going to be screening the movie, they're going to be screening it in a lot of other places. I'm going to have all the links that you need to find out about screenings of this incredible movie. I've seen it and it's just wonderful. You can go to dunkintrustle.com and all the links will be there as well as a clip from the movie and all the information that you need. So now everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, Gay Dillingham and Zach Leary. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, Gay Dillingham, Zach Leary. It's a true honor to have you guys on this podcast. Thanks for being here. Thank you. Hey, Dunkin. Yeah. Happy to be here. Zach, first of all, if there's an award that was given out to having the coolest dad on the planet, you would get that award. Your dad is Timothy Leary. That is an incredible thing to be that close to such a controversial figure. Do you feel that this documentary is partially to change the public perspective of your dad? Well, it is an incredible thing, but it also comes with its baggage, too. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't say that. As I get older, it becomes more and more incredible, but I think as you were here with so many kids who are an offspring of somebody luminary or somebody famous, it has its pros and cons. It took me a long time to learn how to navigate that, but regarding the film, none about me. The public perception of him, to me, was always, I always thought of him as a luminary and incredibly complicated. His life was incredibly complicated and incredibly brilliant, and I think the film really goes into the humanity of him, more so than the accomplishment side. I think it really dives into the humanity of him, which is a really important thing. A lot of people seem to miss that. When I think of Timothy Leary, how about this? I'm just going to throw out the general stereotypical viewpoint of Timothy Leary, and then I'll let you guys correct me. How does that sound? Okay. Okay, one second. I'll just fix the levels here, and I think my mic's a little hot. So Timothy Leary, I'm just going to list what everybody thinks. Gay, are you still there? I'm here. I'm interested. Because I went through the same process, like sorting out the public persona from the real persona. So here's the public persona that most of us know. Timothy Leary, lunatic genius who took too much LSD, went crazy, and decided to try to create a psychedelic revolution that involved people disconnecting from society. He was popularized the phrase, tune in, turn on, drop out. Everyone should quit their jobs, man, and go get high on acid. Now, that's not my opinion of him at all. I think my opinion matches what you guys think, but what also is wrapped up in the package of Timothy Leary for a lot of people is he was too vocal about his stance on psychedelics and his revolutionary tactics were partially responsible for the prohibition of the study of psychedelics, which set back the psychedelic movement for years and years and years. How do you guys respond to that? There's so much there, Duncan. I mean, there's so much there. I mean, we could break that off into a lot of different tentacles here. First, I don't think he was encouraging reckless, irresponsible use and encouraging people to drop out of society. The drop out part of the tune in, turn on, drop out, incredibly misunderstood. It does not mean quit your job, quit school, drop out, follow the grateful dead around, take lots of acid, and fuck society. It meant drop out from your preconceived notions of what you thought it meant to be in this world. Everything you know is wrong. Challenge everything, question everything, think for yourself, question authority. That's what drop out meant. It meant to take your role and grow with it, expand it. And his path, which gets into something interesting versus Ramdoss, was through the mind, it was more so than the heart. But the LSD and all of those experiments were really just catalysts to drop out into new ways of thinking, into new portals of consciousness, into new love fields, into new soul fields. And I don't think he was, gosh, and then the second tentacle of this, sorry, Gay, I'll let you turn him in in a second. Well, you know what? You did a great job, Zach, and it's right on. Our film does go deeply into that. The other thing is, instead of too vocal, he was too influential. But carry on, Zach. Yeah, but the second part of it, which is a really, really important thread to go down, is like in the modern psychedelic renaissance, which we are experiencing now, and much of it, amazing. I mean, the work that MAPS is doing in Rick Doblin, I mean, it's CIIS, it's fantastic, and we're all on the same side. But a lot of that conversation has shifted to how did we get to this situation? So it's very easy to Monday morning quarterback it and to look back at the history and go, oh, well, Timothy, you know, I mean, he was, he was a mad Irish rascal who was going around challenging the government. They had to lock him up because he was so dangerous. How many times, by the way, did he get locked up? Oh, gosh, well. Was it 24? 26? Well, it's more the total time he spent in prison, which was almost four years. And of that, two and a half was solitary confinement. God. Yeah. And most people don't really remember that because, and he certainly didn't spend a long time talking about it, but, you know, it was a big part of his history, which that's what this documentary goes into also and the impact it had on his life. And you know, by us scapegoating, even the culture, you know, the, the allies that we are scapegoated him, the movement scapegoated him to some degree. Yeah. And of course, the authorities scapegoated him and needed him out of circulation because he was too influential. Yeah. And you have to understand like the time, you know, in the context of everything that happened at the time, you know, first, you know, he was a very accomplished, you know, academic professor at Harvard, then all of a sudden him and Richard Albert were kind of going down these new doorways to experiencing, you know, the different dimensions of what, you know, this whole thing is, and then all of a sudden what happened around them was what we now know as the sixties. Yes. I don't think you can, I wasn't there, I'm not old enough, but I don't think you can imagine the magnitude of that to be, and like he always said, to understand the sixties, you must understand the fifties. And you don't understand the explosion that happened then, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Kennedy getting shot, the civil rights movement, the sexual revolution, all of that happened around him. All of a sudden, I mean, I'm not saying he didn't turn it away, but he became sort of a catalyst and a spokesperson because he was the architect. He was the architect, and he was older, he was already well-established, so he kind of like, you know, the kids could turn to him and go, look, mom, like this Timothy Leary guy, he was a professor at Harvard, you know? And that's an extraordinary thing, but he didn't, I don't think he ruined it for everyone, and I think it's a really, it's a bad, it's a little piece of history, I think we need to correct. Yeah, I agree with you 100%, and I look at, when I think of him, the other misunderstanding that I think people have about him, I'm just going off of my own misunderstanding and then applying it to the entire planet, which is probably a mistake, but as I started studying Timothy Leary and through, mostly through Robert Anton Wilson, yes, and looking into his other theories, you realize that there was so much more to him than just the world of psychedelics, and I don't think a lot of people realize that either. Yeah, probably what. Can I address something before you too far away from it? Please. Relative to a new book that just came out, which I think your audience will be really interested in, because I just became aware of it, and it just came out, called Timothy Leary, The Harvard Years, which is the early writings on LSD psilocybin with Richard Alpert, Houston Smith, Ralph Metzner. So what this does is it took Timothy's academic writings between 60 and 65, of which a lot of that was even before the psychedelics, because he was really proposing a real U-turn in psychology, which was already threatening before the psychedelics. The psychedelics just then put a supercharge on his ideas, and I think that's a really important book for people to also absorb and put in the matrix of understanding Timothy, because most people know him as the post-prison clown. Back to your question about everything else he contributed to as a futurist, really the early cyber movement, which Zach can speak to, and a lot of kids know him as a very different influence, aside from the LSD guru, more of Zach's age. Yeah, I know of the 20-some books that he wrote, I think what, only 304 really dealt with psychedelics as a whole. Right. You know the rest, and you get into the Robert Nanton Wilson stuff, The Eight Circuits of Consciousness, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know, all of that stuff is equally. Would you guys mind, and I don't mean to diverge too far away from the subject of the documentary, but I have so many questions and only a little bit of time, and how often do you get to chat with experts on one of your great heroes? Can you talk a little bit about the Eight Circuit model of consciousness for people who maybe aren't familiar with it? Gabe, do you want to take that one? That's a tough one. You know it. I don't. I didn't read every single book. Well, it's complicated. It's very complicated. But isn't it the basic idea behind it, is that there are aspects of the human psyche that we haven't quite yet activated, because the ultimate destiny for humanity is to escape from the gravity well that is planet Earth. That's one of my favorite phrases he used, gravity well. We're stuck in a gravity well, and at the bottom of that gravity well is a planet. We're all stuck on this planet right now. But we're in the same way that, you know, the caterpillar transforms into the butterfly. We have the potential within our DNA written in there to ascend from the gravity well and sail out into the cosmos, and that the moment that we start moving in that direction, aspects of our DNA start becoming activated, which expands our consciousness to some degree. Is that it? Yeah. And we are hardwired for more than we think, you know, as you go up and down the ladder of the Eight Different Circuits, and you get to the core of it. It's not dissimilar to the different bardos in the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying or anything, and you kind of get into these different levels, these different circuits where you can really tap into our, you know, our hardwiring, you know, DNA, maybe mission for life, you know, but it also brings up some interesting points to us, whether or not like it really gets, that gets into the physical, you know, and he really manifested so much in the mind, you know, and how the physical and the metaphysical, you know, expands to the soul. Yes. Right. Right. And his predictions, it seems like the predictions he was making weren't incorrect. They were just off by a few decades based on what Kurzweil has been saying, the idea that, you know, we're on the precipice of discovering, of doubling the human lifespan, the idea that, you know, with new technologies, space migration is going to become a real possibility. He was just off a little bit, but he wasn't wrong about what our future holds. Yeah, I think he was, I mean, he was as much of a futurist as he was, you know, a psychologist, as much as he was a psychedelicist, and he was really in some ways a technologist too, although he didn't actually, like, he wasn't too good with technology himself. He saw how it could work and how the application would fit. He wasn't too good with, well, what technology did he, I mean, I mean, he wasn't good at, like, yeah, I mean, if he had an iPhone today, he'd be fumbling around and be calling me into the next room to, how do you turn this fucking thing on? That kind of stuff. But he could write the manual on it, you know what I mean? Yeah. So, the other aspect of your documentary that is really cool is it's another of my heroes, Rom-Dos, and here you have sort of the, these two beings both encountered the same initial psychedelic truth, and they kind of went in separate directions, whereas Rom-Dos took a more spiritual, not a very spiritual, very religious path. It seems like Timothy stayed, you know, outside of that stuff. It seems like he was a little skeptical of that, of that version of reality. Is that incorrect to say? Forgive me if it is. I think he was skeptical, yeah. I mean, I think he was really, well, he was skeptical of the whole guru system, for sure. You know, there's no question about that, and he was skeptical of any sort of institutional kind of hard line of how, you know, spirituality or how a map for consciousness might work. And you know, when Rom-Dos came back, when Richard Alpert came back, and he was Rom-Dos, you know, you know, I mean, it's what Christian Doss calls today, disorganized religion. But he came back with a kind of a set of a map that came from a lineage. Yeah, and Tim didn't like that. I bet he didn't like it at all. I bet they got some real funny conversations about that. Did Tim make fun of him a little bit when he came back? He did, but that was also their, you know, that was their rough spot, you know, from when he came back until, you know, until the late 70s. They, you know, they had some difficulties. Can you talk a little bit about that? Did you ever witness a Rom-Dos-Timothy Leary argument? I didn't, because by the time, you know, they reconciled and kind of fell in love with each other again. I was just a little boy and it was a love fest from there on out, so I never actually saw it, you know, I never, I was too, too, too young for that. Gay, Gay, did you ever witness any of these things or it were? No, I came in in 95 as well, right, when Tim was dying, and we put together this conversation between Tim and Rom-Dos. And so I just met Tim at the end of his life, and at that point he, you know, Rom-Dos was the first person he called when he found out he was dying, because they had this, what, what a man named Howard Tice, who's a PhD, who will be one of the people speaking after our film in the Bay Area when we launch on July 10th. But it's really about this mythic hero-twin concept, and I think that Larry and Rom-Dos really, that's what caught my attention in the relationship, but it's got so many levels, because it could also be a man-woman marital relationship, and how we are so different, yet we are in this dance together, and when you really think about it, the entire human world is relational, I mean creation is relational. So the power they had together, but it also means twinning off, it means separating, going out on your own individuation paths, which is what they did when they had such different opinions about how to go about things, you know, Tim was still the scientist, Rom-Dos wanted to go the faith route, and bless them both for going their routes and coming back together and reemerging as soul friends, and they called themselves soulmates, even though it was never a physical love, because that wouldn't, you know, and Rom-Dos talks about being gay, and Timothy wasn't, and had five marriages. So the other, you know, kind of tragic irony, but also maybe why Tim could be such a visionary is because, as Rom-Dos says, he stood outside that psychodynamic plane, which is where the emotions live in the inner world, and where most women want to engage, and probably why he and Rom-Dos were so well together as two men, and that he couldn't really hold any long-term marriage to a woman, also for that reason, and that Timothy really could be the visionary because he did sit outside of systems and looked in. I like to call it, and this kind of came to me somewhat recently, different rides in the same amusement park, you know, and a lot of people, I think more so in the leery camp, you know, really frown on that, because, you know, part of the, you know, the panacea or the destination from what, you know, the intelligent application of psychedelics can give you, it can give you a really strong form of individuality, you know, it can really give you this form of self-actualization and self-realization, where you are this independent entity that can shine very brightly. So the idea of kind of gravitating towards a guru or to a Maharajee or something like that, it's a little sticky, but I think at the end of the day, if you ask both of them, you know, where are you trying to go? It's the same thing. Yeah, now that's something, I'm glad you brought that up. There are camps, there are clear, definite camps out there, and one of them is the psychedelic camp, which represents people who are taking the psychedelic path, and it feels like leery skepticism about Ram Dass is embodied in that camp, like it seems that a lot of people who've taken that route, Ayahuasca, whatever it may be, the moment that you present the idea of the guru, they feel very strongly about that being a terrible decision to make, it feels like. Yeah, and strange to me, because I reside in both camps, you know, I'm a devotee, I've become a devotee recently, but I grew up in the psychedelic camp, so I do understand both sides, but I don't know, I mean, everybody has their own personal trip and their own personal experience, I have my reasons. I think as a western, mostly western culture, we don't really understand the whole guru concept, what's underneath the layers of guru, and I wanted to say, Zac's a unique person on many levels, but one because a mutual friend once said, if Timothy Leery and Richard Alpert slash Ram Dass would have had a child, an offspring, it would have been Zac Leery, because Zac really does bring the two camps together, because Zac spent so much time with Ram Dass after Tim died, and for us to really engage, what does it mean to have a guru, which is just the person that shows the path, and it's certainly not a name that Ram Dass has given himself, he would never call himself a guru, he's a teacher, but he had a guru, named Kurali Baba, Maharajee, and our culture doesn't understand that, we have a different form, and some people have come up to me after the film and said, thank God, this is finally pulling together my burning man life with my spiritual life, because there's also people in the yoga or spiritual community that are uncomfortable with the leery kind of psychedelic camp. That's right. Yeah, they don't want to, yes, they're very uncomfortable, and they run into a problem there, because it is undeniable, well I guess it's not undeniable, because we can't say for sure, but I would put money on that if Ram Dass Alpert had not encountered leery, he would never have crossed paths with Neem Kurali Baba. Absolutely true. Oh no, he would have been a retired Harvard professor and tenured, and we have a scene in the film where they're laughing hysterically, because Tim says, yeah, I ruined your economic career, and Ram Dass, of course, thanks him now, but yeah, Ram Dass would admit that today. It's sort of our other friends in the camp who don't like that very much. Yeah, that to me is a fascinating thing, and in a very strange way, leery was a devotee of Neem Kurali Baba, even though he would never say that he was, because he became his great servant in the sense that he did the ultimate service, which was to send migrating to India, the person who would be the number one distributor of that lineage, and that to me is a really fascinating thing. Do you know the bus story when Tim and Nenna were in India? I don't think so. They were on the bus. Okay, I don't have all the names and the facts like exactly the Elden, but you'll get the gist. Tim went to India in 1965 with Nenna, and then his whole marriage with Nenna kind of unraveled on that trip to India, and they were kind of going through, and he went there. His intention was to understand, to try to dive in deeper to Eastern mysticism. He went there with that intent, knowing that there were maps out there that could sort of, maybe, these are relevant, maybe there's something on to them, there's something to them. He was on a bus, I think it was near Allahabad, and somebody came on the bus to try to get him and Nenna off to show him some things, and Nenna didn't want to get off, she wanted to go, but Neem Kurali Baba was about 100 yards away from the bus. Wow! Yeah. Well, and let's also mention that Nenna is then married Bob Thurman, who's a Tibetan Buddhist scholar. And they met in Noba. And they had Uma Thurman, who most people know, and so Nenna ended up in the whole Buddhist community in her own right, in a way. So yeah, that was another interesting... But the cool part of that story is, you know, he was right there. He was right at the foot of Maharaji. Right. And it just wasn't his karma, you know? Well, I don't think he would have bought it. I think that if he... I don't think so either. I don't think so either. I think he would have had a lot of... He's such a revolutionary, and he's so anti-authority that I think that he would have wanted to see what he could do wrong, and see what the reaction would be from Neem Kurali Baba, if he did the very worst thing he could think of. It feels like he'd want to do something rebellious so that he could test the waters to see... Let's just see how a holy person reacts to non-reverence, to non-worship, to non... Like, what if I don't play the game? Right, right. Well put. And I just want to say that as the filmmaker that spent 19 years making this, because these two men so deeply interested me, and then I just dug deeper and deeper to understand who they were, for me this is autobiographical, because I got a little of Tim in me, and a little bit of R.D. in me, and it's always in conversation. And it's also why I chose the symbol of the yin yang to represent the film, because we're a little bit of both in each, and some of us are more in one camp than the other. But, you know, if we're to be honest, even the believers doubt, even the doubters believe, etc., and it's all a mystery. And nobody... The film is not trying to tell anybody what to believe, but to have a conversation. So my commitment is a community engagement experience. That's why I want to be in theaters and have groups in discussion about this. And I also, yes, it's a historical film, but it's more than a historical film. It's very current, because it's about what is up in the zeitgeist. It's about what's up in the zeitgeist, psychedelics, and for death and dying. Because what these guys did, which was so important to me when I was 19, I read the De Pet in Book of a Dead, and then started a psychedelic experience and used medicine in a way, because my brother, believe it or not, Zach, your film festival was on Tim's birthday. Today was my brother's death, the day of my brother's death. And when I was 17, and that blew me apart. And I had to reconstruct myself. I was on the ground. And, you know, there was a lot of, what I want to say about this, though, is that that's when I started seeing how upside down our culture was around death. And what these guys did, for me, was to help redefine that. And by writing the psychedelic experience, which was based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Larry and Albert and Metzner basically guided you through a psychedelic session based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. So this is not just about preparing for the death at the end of this mortal body, but to practice all the ego deaths that we have to go through almost every day in order to live more fully. And those are the things that our culture seems to be deathly afraid of. I mean, literally. So that's the reason I stepped into this film, and these two archetypes represented this so perfectly. And as humans, and as story, and as real, and to be able to see Tim's human story through the love of Ram Dass, the lens of love, because the love lens is so important. Yeah, the other mistake we really make, which I've meditated a lot on my life, is that our culture, particularly our media culture, our first thing is to judge, to chew up and spit out and the dualities and everything else that we do. And truly, we're all human, trying our best, and our lives have this wide arcs, and we all make mistakes. And if we can see each other as doing the best we can, but we're looking at each other through the lens of love, then it makes everything different. I once kind of mashed up the best of both these guys in terms of if I had to come up with one phrase, because I'm like, what is the theory here? I would say, be here now and think for yourself with unconditional love. The love thing is so important, and I just was, as you were talking, Gaye, I was thinking about something actually Duncan that you said on a few podcasts ago, I don't know what it was, but about this love field that's around us, right? There is this love field that's all around us, and it's undeniable. It's there if you want it, if you don't take it, that's sort of your own trip, that's your own ego, that's your thing, and there are portals into this love field. Maharaji is a portal into it, psychedelics are a portal into it, meditation is a portal into it, and that's really, that's it. And that is, yes, in this love field that whatever this thing may, whatever that love field is, I think a lot of people are coming into contact with it now more than ever, because we are in this new psychedelic renaissance that's happening. There is some, there is a pro, there is the, you know, when I was a kid, I can remember my mother would hang out with like people who are really into crystals and what's like new age people is what they call it, and they would talk about how this shift is coming, there's a shift in consciousness coming, a shift is happening, a shift is happening, and I remember just rolling my eyes about that and thinking that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, but now I see it, it's really happening. People have access to these super potent psychoactive chemicals, and they don't just have access, but they also have access to the internet, and they have access to the refined teachings of Tim Leary and Ram Das, which is what, you know, I didn't have that in high school, if I wanted to, if I was, when I took acid for the first time when I was in I guess the 10th grade, and I took acid I think partially because of your dad, because I can remember going into the school library and finding a book on psychedelics or on drugs and flipping to the back page and discovering a paragraph on your father, just a paragraph, and it was talking about there's this professor who advocated the use of LSD to open your mind, but you know after that they're like, but he was crazy and you shouldn't listen to him, but I remember reading that and thinking, wait, oh yeah, okay, yeah, these aren't all, this isn't all bad, there's something here, there's something here, but that's all I had, there was no Google, I couldn't look up Tim Leary, I couldn't find anything else other than this flicker of hope that these substances weren't all evil, that they weren't just heroin, they weren't just crack cocaine, it was a whole other thing, so now we have all of these teachings completely available to everyone, and also we have websites like Aeroid, and we have the studies that are now finally being done thanks to the end of the prohibition, so we really are in a golden age right now. I think so. Yeah, and we're more grown up and we can look at it differently and really do set and setting, I mean I want to bring this up partly because Timothy was so excited as a psychologist when he found these medicines because he thought he found the elixir, and in many ways he did, it's not the only elixir, it's an elixir of seeing, and we don't have that class in our culture anymore, the seers, the shamans, the so forth, and you know there was two camps, and there's always you know at least two camps, but back then Tim really struggled between you know the Aldous Huxley theory or point of view, which is this is for the shaman class, this is for the you know the more intellectuals, this is not for everybody because it's too powerful. Then there was the Allen Ginsburg, which is it's for everybody, democratize it, it's on the street, and of course we know the sixties, it was on the street, and everybody had access to it, and for good, bad, or indifferent, but it was definitely, it's a very powerful tool, and you know my personal opinion is it's not for everybody. I mean and Tim said in this hearing in 1966, people basically need to be you know prepared physically, mentally, emotionally, and go through some kind of not certification, but some kind of like filter system before you know set and setting, before you just jump in not knowing the depth of your well, because that that door between the unconscious and the conscious is going to be flung open, and you better be prepared for it to whatever comes up. So anyway I'm going on. Well no that's one of the byproducts of the ridiculous prohibition is that instead of you know it's so fun to fantasize about what a psychedelic society would look like, where psychedelics were not prohibited, and where psychedelics were recognized as being as important as reading, or as important as any other field of study, and that this had been, and the psychedelics have been researched on a global scale, so that we fully understand what's happening in these heightened states of consciousness, and people are literally trained to be, I don't know what you want to call it, to be guides, even though I think that's a ridiculous word for it, but to be the shaman class. It would be amazing to see what that would look like, a western modern version of the shaman who up until this point has been in the west, it's an outcast, or it's someone who's essentially looked at with a great deal of suspicion, anybody who does any kind of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy has to do it at their own peril right now, and there are people who do it, but they could lose their license and go to jail, or there could be incredible lawsuits, and I think that that, I think when Tim encountered this elixir, as you call it, through the lens of his genius, and through the lens of his, through the futurist lens that he looked through a lot, he recognized that this was the seed that was going to grow a new society, I think he recognized that it was there, this was it, and he also, let me say something about the other dichotomy, I think he also recognized early on that we can't just medicalize it, you know what I mean, like put it through the psychology sector, and just through that kind of singular sector, because it's also very much communal, and remember we have the church, the peyote church, which has been sanctioned and legal, as well as the udv church, which is now in ayahuasca, saying, you know, it went all the way up through the supreme court and had a unanimous decision under the freedom of religion act, so we do have these small little bastions of legalness, these small research projects, and then this on the other side, this community, this church experience, because I don't think we can, you know, I do think we need community around this, we need support, we need structure. Can you guys talk a little bit about the League of Spiritual Discovery? Yeah, in Laguna Beach, yeah, I mean the League of Spiritual Discovery was kind of an early sort of communal archetype for a society that could be created around, you know, the intelligent use of this stuff. But this, Tim founded this, he started this, this was his attempt at creating a religion that had LSD as its sacrament. I wouldn't call it a religion. But his idea was to use the freedom of religion to make it, this was like his attempt to legalize assets. That was the doorway in, and the reason it just didn't, it really didn't take off is because right about that time he started getting into a lot of legal trouble, and you know, and that was sort of, that was it for that. But yeah, that was the doorway in, and you know, this really gets into like Terence McKenna's schools of like the archaic revival and things like that. And I think Tim was really, really sensitive to that, you know, through every culture in mankind, every indigenous culture has been using, you know, medicinal psychedelic plants and medicines. As far as we know, as far as you can go back, except for the Eskimos because they couldn't grow anything up there, but you know, but anyone else, you know, and it was a return to that. And, you know, as we talked about the Eighth Circuit stuff earlier and about like what we're hardwired for. And I think, you know, anybody who's gone on a psychedelic journey, and if you've kind of gotten the moment or gotten the aha sort of, you know, revelation when you're on it, you're like, this feels like, wow, this feels like something inside of me that's been there all of all along. Yes. You know, and I'm just kind of seeing it now because, you know, I can't, not that they just unlock those doorways. And the League for Spiritual Discovery was really about, you know, the communal, the archaic sort of civilization and kind of getting into our tribal nature. What are the tenants? Did he have tenants for it? Or was there any kind of motto or saying or scripture? It's a really good question. We should probably look in the archives for that. There probably are some, some manifestos on that. I've got all sorts of interesting manifestos from like the Code of Conduct at Millbrook and a visitor's contract and all that stuff. It's super far off. Visitor's contract. I would love to see that. I'll send it to you. I'm going to email it to you and you could read it for your, edit it in. But yeah, there probably is one for it. Why can't, why did the League of Spiritual Discovery not continue? I don't understand. Because he went to jail. But why didn't people keep it going? Why can people resurrect this beautiful idea? Because when I think about the, what a perfect name for a religion for, and I know he probably would have hated, hated the term religion, but we're talking about the concept here is a, an umbrella, so to speak, where LSD could be used sacramentally because it is a sacrament. It is a sacrament. It is as much a sacrament as anything I've ever experienced. If not from my contact with the substance, I don't know what would have happened to me. I owe a lot to it. I feel reverence for it and gratitude for it. And I could go on and on and on about how wonderful I think it is, but I don't understand why that beautiful, why that didn't keep going. It should have kept going. Well, in some ways, and this is just my, my kind of two cents, my own personal trip is that, you know, when Ram Dass kind of came back and when Richard Albert came back and became Ram Dass and kind of started this little bubble of a psychedelic spiritual kind of, you know, Hindu Ram Ram Hanuman community, to me, that was really the extension of that because, you know, psychedelics were, you know, and it's not really talked about as much now because there's so much reverence for, for Maharaj, but psychedelics were still really, they were a huge part of that. Ram Dass didn't stop doing psychedelics. That's a huge, I've heard that in the community a lot. Oh, Ram Dass came back and he didn't have to get high anymore because he was already there. It's not exactly true. Oh yeah, that ain't true. That's not true at all. I mean, he was still doing psychedelics until he couldn't anymore for, because of physical reasons. That's right. Yeah. Yes. He just knew how to play the dance, how to do the dance a little bit better. What a great point. But to get back to this yin-yang idea where you have these two different camps and you have the Ram Dass camp and here's, and which, you know, I love, I've been to six of those retreats. I'm going, are you going to the one in December? I'm going to the one in December. I love, I love it so much, but there's a lot there to digest. And if you're, if you're somebody in the, in the, in the Dawkins universe, if you're one of, if, and there's a flourishing community of skeptical, scientific-minded atheists who have seemed to have really had it up to here with this Deepak Chopra, as they say. They're pissed at Chopra. They're pissed at anything that they call woo. They don't want to hear about Hanuman. They don't want to hear about Ram. They don't want to hear about a guru. They want facts. That's their end up. That's the plane that they're on. And we have to respect it because that's the, in the same way that Timothy Leary created Ram Dass. And inadvertently, science created Timothy Leary. Science created LSD and LSD created Timothy Leary. So we must respect that process. We have to respect that process. And so that's why I love the League of Spiritual Discovery, because it's this concept of like, let's get rid of all these flowery symbols that I love, by the way. I could, I love burning incense in front of a picture of Maharaja and chanting. It makes me happy. I'll do it until I die. I love it so much. But I also understand why so many people, when they see that, they're like, you know, I'm friends with comedians. So they come over and they're like, is that your granddad? Who's that picture? What is that? Why are you burning candles in front of that thing? Would you have sex with them? Would you? Would you? They say the most blasphemous thing they could say because they don't want to deal with these symbols. It's too much. So I like the Leary camp. I like the idea of opening a doorway for scientifically minded people to contact the psychedelic universe through the lens of questioning everything. I think it's a beautiful thing. It needs to be revived. Somebody out there start this religion again. I do too. And you know, faith is entirely based on your own experience. Nobody's ever had that experience with Maharaji. Then why would you resonate with it? You know, I was a cynic. I didn't think I was that person. I mean, sort of. And same with psychedelics. They're just different doorways. But we all, when you hear Dawkins, when you hear these skeptics, you know, in a red rage over the fact that somebody in the middle of the United States believes that dinosaurs existed 700 years ago. I know. But you're always thinking to yourself, my God, just take one hit of acid. Take one hit of acid. Take one DMT trip. And then let's talk. Get that data. Get the data. Because it is data. It's data. And it's data that's being ignored for some reason. And I don't understand that they need to encounter that data. Because what is it that Bill Hicks said? God, you think you're you're you're anti psychedelic and anti drug? Are you really? Then go ahead, throw out your entire fucking record collection, the whole thing, throw it out. Yes, because it's all there. Well, right. Well, and, you know, it's Tim, Tim, Leary and Rom Das Alpert, they discovered an inner universe through the use of psychedelics. And they wanted to understand that inner universe, initially for both of them, all the way to the end, I think, for Leary, but initially for both of them using the lens of science to understand what was going on in the in the inner verse. And I think that that that subjective universe, acceptable, accessible through psychedelics gets completely neglected by science in a lot of ways, because it's how do we track it? Now, people will say, well, we can put you in an MRI machine and give you a dose of psilocybin. I can tell you what parts of your brain are lighting up under the influence of the thing. And maybe I can tell you what levels of serotonin are being released or dopamine are being released or the combination of these things. But nobody, as far as I'm aware, can take pictures of the guy who looks like he lives in a forest with like leaves on his face grinning at me through the darkness when I'm on a high dose of mushrooms and MDMA. Nobody can grab images of who is that guy? Who is this? Who are the legions of spirits that I seem to be witnessing as I'm tripping out here? Can you help me understand the faces I'm seeing and the wall that's melting right now or the mandalas that are blazing in my inner eye every time I shut my eyes? What is that? They can't get there yet. They can't get there yet, but they need to go there, especially the skeptics, especially the atheists. They need this experience that at least they can come back and say, well, you know, yeah, if you go to hard science, you know, 99 point, you know, whatever percentage of everything we see and what we are is space. It's actually not matter. We're not matter. We're more space. So when you, you know, we talk about this in the film about how to live in the world, our brain has to limit our senses. And what psychedelics does is it just takes away all that limiting factor, which we couldn't live in that space. It would be too much. But it's good to part the veil every once in a while just to remember and to see. And, you know, you see the, I found this incredible footage of Tim testifying to Congress, to the Senate hearing in 1966. And Ted Kennedy's interviewing him and he says, so, Dr. Leary, can you describe one of these so-called trips? And Tim laughs and says, well, no, sir, I really can't. But then he goes on to try to describe it while all the guys in the Senate hearing are smoking cigarettes, trying to understand about these, this other drug, right? We're in the 66 now. And Tim is then talking about being, you know, he melts into a puddle on the floor, a serpent comes over, swallows him, he's excreted, you know, and he says, to most psychologists, they'd be cowering underneath the desk. But to a Hindu or to, you know, it would be the third book of the Vagavad Gita or whatever. So, you know, this footage, because in the film, I wanted to physically show when this clash, this deep clash of culture and understanding and you watch that and you see why the status quo was so freaked out. You got all these middle America, you know, white kids rebelling saying no to war and everything was turning upside down in this 50s culture could not absorb it. That, well, and I think, you know, culture still is having some problems absorbing not all of the culture, but there is still a, there's that same, like whatever that is, that same impenetrable wall that springs up when a skeptic or a person who considers them this, I don't know what you, what you call it, but this, the materialists, that weird wall that springs up when you start relating some, any kind of metaphysical or mysticism, mysticism at all to these materialists, it's still there. And, you know, Learion and Albert, they ran into that wall full speed and, and that's why, you know, Learion ended up in jail a lot, but the wall is still there. And this brings me to a question that I'd love for both of you to answer. If Tim were here today, what advice would he give all of us who've experienced the world's accessible through psychedelics and want to, and want to, want to continue his work? What advice would he give to the psychedelic community? What advice would he give to the spiritual community? What, how would he lead us now in the world that we're in now, where these restrictions are loosening on this, on the prohibition and where we have access to all of this technology? I think he'd be leading us through the information age, which is really where he left off, you know, and I think sort of what you were just saying about the disconnect that we're seeing today, I think it's kind of an offshoot of the information age, because the information age is highly quantifiable, you know, it's made up of ones and zeros, ones and zeros, ones and zeros. And there's a lot of, you know, there's kind of a finite understanding of how that all works and mysticism needs to be infused back into that, to how it started with Stuart Brand and the Whole Earth Catalog, you know, Steve Jobs taking acid and all of these things, that's how it started. And we kind of need to get back there to make the science and the mysticism work together. So I think Tim would, would be leading us through them, through the information age, through, you know, kind of new and creative ways to express yourself psychedelically through the internet, through the web, you know, through, you know, everybody like, look, we're recording this podcast, like right here on a laptop with two microphones and you broadcast it out to the world right now, you have a megaphone right now that reaches a great number of people. This has never been able, you know, this is the first time in human history where we've been able to do things like this, you know, I have this, this magic device in my hand right now that is a complete, you know, for anybody who's taken psychedelics and you go ahead and get lost on an iPhone and just go through apps and surf the web on an iPhone, you see the parallels, it's no accident. It's the same, it's the same trip. That's trippy, man. You're saying the pattern of apps and websites is actually the very similar to the weird kaleidoscopic rush, weird. I do, I feel that way. When you're lost in a web hole, it's very much like a k-hole, you know, you're just spiraling down this, this, this matrix of information, long away stuff, swiping stuff left, swiping stuff right that serves you, swiping stuff left that doesn't serve you and you're just going in and you're finding your reality that speaks to you. That's very psychedelic. Wow. It is to me. The other, you know, kind of, I would say first of all, Tim would say we were right, I regret nothing because I did hear him say that and, you know, we're in the growing pains of this consciousness revolution and creating community around it. But, you know, I just got back from a very unusual experience with 30 international women, two Nobel Peace Laureates, and Gloria Steinem, and we walked and spent six days with hundreds of women in North Korea and then walked across the demilitarized zone into South Korea. Wow. And I mentioned, this just happened on, you know, in May. This was like a couple, few weeks ago. And I mentioned this because, you know, if we engage our consciousness, then we can take it out into the world in all kinds of ways. And when I was there, I, I, because I had the reference point for the layers of reality that our media cannot comprehend. It's always the breaking news. It's the surface. It's why is this guy evil? You know, this, this Kim Jong-un, why is he evil? All the ways he's evil. But when I was there, not that I'm there to condone what's happening in this isolated, perverted, screwed up place, but to, to go in there full eyes, full heart open. And I felt like Alice in Wonderland. I kept going down one rabbit hole after the other and through the looking glass. And I had reference points. So I knew how to look deeper. And the way these people have staged their entire reality, because they think if they can show a perfect world somehow, but that in fact is what freaks us in the West out how, you know, it's like just the paper cutouts. And anyway, so I can't get into all that now other than to say that, you know, if we can engage our consciousness, there is no end to what we can do. Because I felt, I also want to take back this, this, this dirty word that's been created called North Korean sympathizers, which is what, you know, we were called going over there, these women. We had the Nobel laureate that stopped the, the, the war in Liberia, Lama Bowie. We had Marie Maguire from Ireland who stopped that civil war. And they were going to try to call us naive. So I said, yeah, we were over there. We were empathizing. So call us a North Korean sympathizer. We were empathizing with the North Korean people, South Korean people, and all people, because that's the only way we're going to, you know, evolve out of this absolute Gordian knot we've created on our planet with this military industrial complex. So anyway, so don't get me started down that hole. But I say that because we have to look at our entire world knowing how many layers of reality there are and how to solve problems. As Einstein said, you can't solve the problem with the same but thinking that created it. So I think psychedelics are one of the tools, not the only tool. There's a lot of mindfulness. There's meditation. There's a lot of tools and as there are people. But I do think that, you know, back to what Duncan, you asked too, I think Tim would be absolutely scratching his head around the polarization that we're seeing today. I think it's a very perplexing reality for conscious individuals and thinkers to find ourselves in right now. Can you define that polarization? Yeah, there's a lot of good ways to sort of look at it. My favorite as of late is the filter bubble. And if you're not familiar with the filter bubble, it's sort of Eli Parcier who co-founded Move On wrote a book called The Filter Bubble, which basically it's this accidental offshoot of technology happened basically through Facebook and Google about, you know, both of those algorithms are written around personalization. Google serves you the stuff that Duncan wants to see. Google serves the stuff that Zach wants to see. So our search results are each different. Same in Facebook, you know, it's giving us a personalized experience. So what kind of like our neurons get deeper and deeper channels and then you stay in those same channels because you're used to them. Yeah, yeah. So what's basically happened is it's created, you know, these far right and far left bubbles which we find ourselves in. For instance, in your, you know, your Facebook world, you're not seeing any far right kind of tea party activity at all. You don't see it. Why would you? Because Facebook thinks you don't want to see it. Same with the far right. They're not seeing all our hippie psychedelic, you know, Maharajie shit either. So it's created. There's no more middle. Wow. You know, so there's no more, there's no more place. There's no more like, and so the Republican party that we're seeing today is a whole different beast than we've ever seen before. That's why they're getting weirder. They're not, there's nothing to measure their strangeness. It's true. Well, and it's happening globally. It's happening globally. Like we've demonized North Korea and they've demonized us. We are definitely demonized in that country. So, you know, we're both so demonized. We're all living in hell. Yeah, but we're seeing this thing like, you know, more people are practicing, you know, yoga in America than ever happened before. Burning Man has now grown into a pretty mainstream event. Yes. You know, rock and roll. You live here in that water village, whatever, and our hair is long, and we, you know, whatever, you know, we see all of these things happening. But at the same time, it's like we see this sort of mainstream sort of like interpretation or dissemination of like how it is that we're supposed to fix the fucking problem that we're in. And we're just like, what's happened? Right. What the hell's happened? How did we get here? So how do we take this? How do we take the promise? You know, how do we take it and make it work? Well, yeah, yeah, this is, it's really interesting. This is kind of, it reminds me of like an informational Galapagos Island or something, like everyone's evolving into their own strange creatures based on this bubble. I've never heard that before. It's really interesting. Great book. Really. I'll check it out. I'll check it out for sure. That's fascinating. So it seems like both of you are sort of pointing at a method or a mode of living in the world that involves inclusion instead of separation that's trying to figure out a way to speak the language of other information cultures, so to speak, instead of raging against them. Absolutely. And you know, from all the Ramdoss retreats, you've been on the illusion of separation, you know, this illusion of separateness, you know? I mean, that's a core Ramdoss principle that he's been talking about for 40 years, you know, this illusion of all these things that we're looking for to separate each other from. Yeah, yes. But man, that illusion, it's a pretty strong illusion. It's powerful. And you get sucked into it all the time. And it's such a difficult thing to, you know, how often do you find yourself separate? And sometimes don't you need to separate yourself? Sometimes don't you need to look at a North Korea or look at a red state mentality like, God, like, I can't remember. One of the Republicans running for president is famous, and now it's a famous quote, it went everywhere, the guy who said, if America's sick of, if you're sick of war, don't vote for me. Yeah, that was what Graham, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey Graham. Yeah, right. Right. But yeah, if you're sick of, don't vote for me. And, you know, so God, what do we do about that? Like, I don't care what information bubble you're sitting in, like, how do you love that? How do you love that? How do you, how do you? That's the work, isn't it? Yes. But how, what would, you know, because Leary, he was, he was really like divisive, like he was, it didn't feel like what he was doing was saying, let's all join together so much as much as like, go ahead, sorry. He was, he was. And if I had to bring up any fault of Tim's, it was probably that he was a real us and them kind of guy. Yeah, he was, he was in it for the fight. Yes, he was. He was scrapping it out. He was really doing it, man. And maybe he thought that the LSD would be a kind of rocket fuel that, that, you know, created a momentum, not just for him, but all of society to sort of push us, push us back. Yeah, yeah. That's why Tim and Leary, or Ron, just both live inside of our psyche and the mythology. You've got the warrior fighter and then you've got the peacemaker, you know, that brings it together. And that's in our society. It's inside us. Some are more than others. And we all play out this role in the theater of it all. Right. Oh, what a beautiful idea it really is, you know, and I go back and forth on, you know, I've, I'm friends with Ragu Marcus. I have him on the podcast a lot and they're, they've always been very good at like getting me to temper that part of myself that when I see the cop at the, you know, the recent video of this cop at a pool party, I don't know if you saw that. Did you see that guy? No. So this video on the internet of this, this cop, was it tech, was it Texas McKinley, Texas McKinley, Texas, this cop goes to a pool. These kids are just at a pool having a pool party. They're completely harmless. They're in bathing suits. They're obviously having a great day. It's a beautiful day, but somebody calls the cops on them. But the kids are black. Well, right. I mean, that's, that's, well, yeah. And that's their fault. If you're going to go to a pool party in Texas, you've got to change your skin color, apparently. But they, but this cop, it's, I mean, I can't think of anything that looks less threatening than a group of teenagers in bathing suits at a pool party. It's just the opposite of ISIS. And this cop, he does a barrel roll. He, so he comes in, does some kind of weird military barrel roll like in the middle of kids in bathing suits. He does a barrel roll and he starts applying some kind of, uh, I don't, some military tactics where he's trying to get kids on the ground and separating kids. He pulls his gun at one point. And finally, he ends up with his knee in the back of a teenage girl who's on the ground screaming and crying, probably as PTSD now, from the experience. And when I see something like that, there is no Ram Dass in me at that point. There's just a feeling of let's get that guy's name, let's get that guy's address, let's ruin that guy's life so that all other authority figures who get the inclination to do barrel rolls at a teenage pool party consider the fact that if you do that, the internet's going to swarm on you like killer bees and it will never end. You know, that's, I don't know how looking at that guy and being like, well, his adrenaline was really high and we have to, you know, he's playing his own game. That's his own game. He just got in. So he needs help. So let's help him. But how do you get angry? Yeah, you're right. I mean, it's all of it's all of it's real. Jack cornfield would say, you know, life is an ocean full of joy and a sea of tears, you know, right? Sometimes I don't get that. Right. It doesn't work for me in this instance. I'm with you. Well, it's tough, but I love what I mean. Yeah, I really love that you have identified these two, I don't know, these two intertwined paths that somehow have got to really figure out a way to truly merge like finding the figuring out the path of the heart and the path of the mind and where those two meet and embracing all of the new information that's coming out now and doing, I think, what Timothy would have wanted us to do, which is to utilize the internet as much as we could to figure this thing out so that we do have some kind of realistic merging, you know, not a bullshit merging, but a realistic, in the same way that technology is merging with humanity or inorganic life is merging with organic life, we've got to figure out a way to bring the chopers. We've got to fuse the chopers in the darkens. There you go. That is exactly the growing pain we're in, I think. And there's a lot of ways to describe it, but that was well put. And I just want to say that, you know, my husband Andrew Ungerleider came up with the idea to put these two guys together and said, let's bring, because we had heard Tim was dying in the media that day in 1995, and he said, let's bring Romgoss down. I was born in 65, 1965, so I wouldn't have come up with that idea. I knew both their work, but I hadn't understood the depth of their relationship. And like just two years ago, we find out my husband is cousins with Richard Albert Romgoss. So at all, and most of the people in the film now are somehow pretty deep and connected in my world somehow. But I wanted to also say that, you know, it's been a really interesting journey with this film, obviously 19 years, it's my labor of love, and finding Zach to work with has just been a godsend. But we are doing something very important and to this so-called evolution of consciousness, I think, because I'm kind of taking the risk to launch this independently. And usually you never get to do theatrical release with a film, documentary particularly, because it's too expensive and you subsidize it. But we have four theaters now set up around the Bay Area, and we start on July 10th. And we're having community engagement Q&As panels around all these screenings in theaters. So go to dying2knowmovie.com to figure out the times and schedules and everything. But I say this because this film, even though the audiences love it, we've been sold out everywhere, but I couldn't penetrate the so-called business of it, if you know what I mean. And by not being able to penetrate that in a really wonderful way, I finally realized the silver lining was it made me reclaim it and know how precious it was to me, and then I made this film to have a deeper conversation. And so by God, Zach and I and a few others are going to go out with the film, sit with groups, have these great conversations, intergenerational community experiences around the subjects that we've all been dying to have, right, but not able to. And whether it's the fear of our own mortality or drugs or how do we change culture, it's just such a it's got a lot of juice. And I don't want to give it up into an old school distribution model that will be out there for a few minutes and it's gone into the collective trash heap. So help support us, go on the website, get involved, and if you're in the Bay Area, for God's sakes, bring your friends and let us know what you'd like to see and hear. Like how do we create more community events around these things? And bring your Republican friends too. Yes, please. I love the theme of this of this podcast. Just like trick them. Tell them you're going to do something else. Yeah, tell them it's like an American, like American sniper outtake. Yeah. So I know what that differential is, and, you know, the definition of extremism is when you live in a community where it's, where you only are with people of your own ideas, what Zach was saying earlier about the siloing of the internet and so forth, you know, you become more and more extreme. A lot of studies have been done on this, but if you, if you purposefully and consciously add diversity of thinking and community and other ideas to your life, you're going to be that much more robust and everybody's going to get more robust. So we have got to, you know, and I've noticed that this, this film does break down barriers. It goes way beyond just the hippie psychedelic community. My mother, who's 83, her old friends that have never even touched a psychedelic, didn't, you know, are digging this film. You know, it's crazy. And then young kids from different countries that have no clue who they are, are digging it. And as well as the people from that might, that did live through it and even knew these guys are digging it. So, you know, I'm really good. My heart's full that we got, we seem to be spanning a pretty frickin' large, you know, community consciousness. And so that part of my dream seems to be coming true. Guys, I've seen it. It's an incredible film. If you're in the Bay Area, you definitely should come to a live screening of it. And I will have links at DuncanTrustle.com to, to the website and anything else you guys want me to put up there. I'll have it there.

It's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. If you're listening to this, I'm in Los Angeles right now. Beautiful Los Angeles. We're going to scope it out considering making the big move, though we keep wavering going back and forth. There's so much involved in moving these days. I mean, holy shit. It's weird in the book of revelations. They never mention how many preschools you have to do interviews for if you want to move to Los Angeles during the apocalypse. We don't know what it's like there right now. I've been getting a real mixed message from people who are there, ranging from it's insufferable to it's fine. We're going to find out. Anyway, because I'm traveling now, I don't have time to do one of my long, award-winning, beautiful, powerful, musical, almost Broadway-level intros. So we're just going to jump right into this episode with my friend Marcus Henderson. Now, before we get going, I would like to invite you to sign up for my Patreon. Once you do that, you will no longer be plagued by commercials. You'll just get straight DTFH injected right into your pineal gland. Also, you're going to get extra content. We meet twice a week for our journey into boredom, our meditation, and of course, our legendary Friday family gatherings. We're a tribe, a commune, a vibratory field of consciousness calling you to come home. Come home to your family. Now, everybody, with us here today is a brilliant actor. You probably know him from Get Out or Tacoma FD. He's one of the most incredible things that came to me from the Midnight Gospel, because he and his friend Brandon reached out to me and said, what do you say? We just like, we be friends. It was the coolest thing ever. Then we started doing like a weekly philosophy club where we just get together and talk. It was super fun. And actually, one of the bummers about leaving LA is Aaron and I just started hanging out with Marcus and Brandon and his family and then we split, so it really blew. But what doesn't blow is that Marcus is with us here today for a frank, smart, intense conversation about acting and what happens after you co-star in a movie like Get Out. Everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH Marcus Henderson. Marcus, welcome back. How are you doing? It's great to see you. Feeling great, man. This is so good to be back here with the family again. I miss you. I miss your family. I miss LA. It's great to see you. They just come back, man. We just come back already. It's looking like it's going to happen. It's like we just, we miss it so much. It's killing us. We watched the game last night and we're like, oh, just thinking, oh man, if we lived there, maybe we could have been there with the kids watching their minds get blown by that. Did you watch the last night? I watched every game, dude. Oh my God, what a fucking game. I know, I know. Oh God, it was ecstasy. The thing is, is that I really wanted Garoppolo to win so that he could fuck it up in the Super Bowl. That's really what I was looking forward to because I, for fantasy football this year, I pretty much used Cincinnati's whole starting lineup. Okay, wait, I'm sorry. Let me tell you this. Before we get going in sports talk, I know shit about sports. Aaron likes sports more than I do. And I almost started doing the thing. I'm trying to do a fake like Garoppolo. Yeah, of course, me too. I wanted that. Yeah, Garoppolo, oh my God. Yeah. He's such a great guy. I told somebody yesterday, just say number 10. Just always when you're talking about sports, just say something about number 10. Number 10 on that squad is like fucking terrible. But I have to say, when Aaron wanted to watch the game and I was being a real fucking dick about it, like I don't like football. But then like at 30 minutes in, I'm just like, holy fucking shit. You're the edge of your seat. Because they know how to build the narrative. The story is built so well. Yeah. It's built so well. And this is a testimony to any human being who watches sports or doesn't watch sports, but catches like the World Series at the bottom of the ninth with two outs down by one, bases loaded, you know, like that's made for TV. Yes. Yes, it is. It's everything. That's those are miracles. Yes. And it's just it's like sad. Like, you know, at the end of the game, like no matter what, some like a group of people's hearts are going to be fucking broken. So that's that's like there's this brutality to it, man. Would you see the Dallas game? No, I didn't. Okay. So after Dallas lost, these people lost their fucking minds, man, like lost their minds. I mean, I saw videos of people crying and breaking down. Like, did you bet your whole house on the game? Yeah, it's deep, man. It's deep. It's, you know, it's deeper than almost anything. I mean, it's one of the deepest things in popular culture. I don't think people realize how like red and it's very sticky. You get caught up in it and it's so there's so much weird, like, I don't know. Just just deep, deep metaphysical shit going on. I mean, just the chanting of the crowd and the energy. It's a ritual or something. Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. And in basketball, there's been a lot of crowd control in terms of like censoring what the crowd says to the players because players have gotten a lot more sensitive to what's being said to them while they're playing the game, which is, I mean, it's no excuse to call somebody, you know, a bitch ass motherfucker while they playing the basketball game. Like that's just, it's no, why you want to do that? Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's curious that like when you, if you think it's just the teams, it's totally not. Okay. There is some participation happening via massive amounts of energy being poured into either group. It's like everyone's weirdly involved in it somehow. There's this amazing documentary. It was not amazing. It's just like a documentary. I was about to say amazing, but it's called The Malice in the Palace from when like 2004, 2005 or something like that, when Indiana played Detroit in Detroit and they got in that huge brawl with the crowd and like Germain O'Neill, like Iran, our test to all these guys. Like, it's like, man, like this is crazy. You know, like that, like we don't want to see that happen again. Obviously. Right. Yeah. I'm surprised it doesn't happen all the fucking time. I'm surprised it doesn't happen like one out of three games. It just descends into some melee or just the whole, just everyone attacking everyone else. But people manage to stay restrained. Dude, I want to talk to you about something because you're, I don't know. I know, I know a few actors and it's something that I'm always interested in because I love watching movies and I love, you know, I was a theater nerd. I just, I find it to be one of the most psychedelic art forms. But so I was watching Macbeth. There's a new Macbeth out, have you seen it yet? I have seen it. It's so fucking good and so fucking creepy. And I just want to talk to you. I want to start off talking to you a little bit because you're one of the only Shakespearean actors that I know. And I want to talk about that a few different points. The first being when you are playing a role, a Shakespearean role, how much of what you're saying do you fucking understand, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, because it doesn't sound like a person. You like, what the fuck are they talking about? Yeah, it's so weird and trippy and like yet somehow relatable. But you don't know, like it's saying things like, you know, thrice a field mouse come this way and then a drop upon the fibers pipe. We saw it. But they're saying it with like this passion where you're like, holy fuck. So like how much, how much of that did you like actually deeply understand as an actor? And how much of it are you just sort of doing the cadence of it? So I think that there are two things that happen in the process that sort of intertwine with each other. Number one, you are learning the cadence because it is a musical language. It is something that goes da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. You know that I am Vic Pantameter. But the other thing that's happening is you're breaking down your text. Like every word, every word means something is so skillfully placed, you know, in the monologues, in the dialogue, like everything is said for a reason. Like when you get these couplets, like there is a world of things that you're able to do with language. And I think that, you know, Shakespeare just like universally, you can get a lot of things out of that, you know, no matter what your background is. You can definitely relate to Shakespeare and understand these characters in a way to where the language is just going to do it itself. Like it's just like if you're reciting a song or something like that, like you may not know what every word means, but you can feel the passion of the artist that you're mimicking, you know what I mean? Like my son is Malachi's into Kanye West. Can't tell me nothing. You remember that song? Oh yeah, hell yeah. Wait till I get my money, right? What does my five-year-old son know about that? Not a goddamn thing, but he loves that song. And like he wants to hear it every day on the ride to school, on the ride home, and he doesn't know what those words mean, but he feels it. Yes. So I think what happens in Shakespeare is that even if, even as the viewer, as the audience, we may not understand what is being said, but the passion from the actor who has done his research, who has been putting that place to be the author of these words on stage, you immediately get that opportunity to make somebody feel something. You know what I mean? Totally. So yeah, that's what I think Shakespeare is, and intertwines the language, the musicality of the language with the meaning of the words. To me, it feels like it would be dangerous to play some of those parts, but not to be overly dramatic or whatever, but just sitting by myself in my living room, watching it, and as the darkness of that fucking play starts creeping into your life, and you're beginning to understand that you've been lured into some awful trap. Like it's terrible. I mean, and of course, you know, I was obviously like super stoned, but I was like, this is like as horrible as any horror movie I've ever seen, as dreadful as any fucking thing I've ever seen. So acting that out, do you feel like I'm getting sick from this? By the way, I don't know which plays you've actually acted in, which? Well, I was just about to say at Alabama State, we did Othello. I had the opportunity to do Othello twice, actually, and I did it the first time. And it was like my first play that I got to do a lead in, and I felt like, you know, what was really interesting about the experience is that Alabama State is all black school, and Othello is a black man in all white world. So how do you pull off a play like this in the setting that you're in? And basically, you know, no color, race, culture is beyond jealousy, is beyond love, is beyond rage, is beyond war, is beyond friendship, you know, infidelity. It all lives in that play. And so being able to do it, it just really, you know, talking about living with it, man. I did it the first time, and it was just like, oh man, just get all these words out of the way, and just speak all these words as fast as you can. And then, you know, it'll all be over with. Yeah. The second time I did it, I had a much more calm demeanor about, you know, what I was doing, I understood the words, the musicality of it was coming together. And I definitely just had, like, a better understanding of that world. Now, I was 20 years old playing the role, but like, it still resonated with me. Sure. I imagine it would probably get deeper and darker the older I get, because my understanding of the world is a little different now. Right. You know, as in any play or anything you do where you're younger and there are older characters, you know, you get older and you're like, you know, I play Walter Lee and the Raisin and the Sun, and he has a son and a wife, and he's living with his mom, and he just wants to like get from under. He just wants to finally get a leg up. He takes that money, and he like, you know, he's going to do something with it. He's going to give the money to Willie, and Willie's going to make his dreams come true. Yeah. And now, as a 36-year-old man, I'm like, man, how many times have I given Willie my money because I thought I could get a leg up in this world? Wow. And how many times have I looked at my kids in the last, you know, 10 years and said to them, I promise you, I'm going to make you give you a better life than I had. Wow. You know? Yeah. Like, I understand those words so much deeper now. Yeah. Than I did when I was 25, 26 years old playing those roles. Right.

Is that sort of like, so that must, the older you get or the more experience you have, then it almost informs your acting. But for young people who I've seen who are brilliant actors and you're like, you didn't, what the fuck has even happened to you that you're somehow able to fully become these characters? What method are they using? What is the, you know, what are you plugging into as a young actor when you don't have the experiences and you successfully portray some roles, some older roles? I think it's a translation that happens, you know, amongst different things, you know, whether the translation be like, you know, I was in high school and my girlfriend ended up kissing my best friend, like, so therefore I understand jealousy. I understand, you know, betrayal. Now, you know, now I can take that into my world. So you don't have to be super old to understand. Or even like, as a little kid, when your parent promises you that you're going to go get ice cream, and then you end up going to the dentist, you know, like. Have betrayal. You know what I mean? Like it's there. Right. We've all experienced these things from very young ages. How we define them depends on our experience with it though. You know what I mean? Yes, there are people who have been in abusive homes and didn't even know it because that's normal to them. But then they get somewhere and realize, oh, shit, that was an abusive place. Now they have a language for it. Now they have a word for it that they didn't have before because it breaks up the normalcy of things. So I think kids or young actors who have a good grasp that you can tell that a lot of it is like a rawness that comes from them. I think that they're able to translate really easily their life experiences that they've had up to that point. Right. But there's also, you know, I think that, you know, people can be polished also. Right. Well, OK, before we get into the polish thing. This is what I'm really interested in is the reservoir of feelings that great actors seem to plug into and they're universal. Are they universal? I mean, like, in other words, like the, you might have when you get older, different methods for connecting with the emotion that this character is probably experiencing. But is there any difference in the betrayal you feel when your parents are supposed to take you to get ice cream and they take you to the dentist and the betrayal you feel like when, you know, so a business partner stabs you in the back, even though the story is different. Is the feeling the same? I think so. And I think it's dependent upon the individual. But if you put it out in front of a mass audience, relatability doesn't have a meter. I think I think it's like, oh, that's relatable. But, you know, like, no, it's just it's relatable or it's not right. It is or it isn't in that sense to me, you know, like if, you know, I'm watching. I don't want to give me spoilers away. But, you know, if I'm watching the movie and then like the main characters, family who took care of him dies and, you know, and then all of a sudden he's alone in the world again, like I don't know what that feeling is to lose, you know, like someone who raised me. But, you know what I do, I can relate to the feeling of losing someone. Yeah. So that's what I attach myself to, you know. OK, so you're studying. If you had to read a script like that, you're going to study that. You're going to think to yourself is your process of getting ready to audition or do this part. You're going to think to yourself, all right, when did I lose somebody and then invoke that feeling as you read the words? Is that it? I think I used to do that. I used to do that, but that's it's really taxing. And it you can't really, I don't know. I haven't at least me for me, I haven't mastered coming out of my feelings in that way. So when I audition, I usually like I'm going to give you like a snippet, right? Because it's a free service. Like I'm auditioning and that's a free service. I haven't seen any compensation for my worth yet. So I'll give you a snippet of what I can do, but I'm not going to like fully go all out in an audition, not now, because I feel like in some way I've paid that cost. You know, like audition tons of times every year, you know, when I first got out here, it was very like, got to get it right, got to do good because it was in person, right? It was like this thing where it was like, I'm meeting you for the first time and you know, this and this and that. And then as you get older or you start to do it more and more, that like something about it becomes a little, what's the term? Is that called lacklustered? Like it just kind of fades a little bit, like that excitement. So then when you go into a casting director who hasn't booked you ever and it's like your tenth time going in, like I'm not so compelled to like, especially when I see the choices that went up and you think, well, I don't really know why I didn't get this part, but I'm going to tell you what, I'm going to give what I feel comfortable with, what I can go home at the end of the day and say, you know what, I gave it to them the way that I feel comfortable and they didn't choose me. Cool. That was their choice. It wasn't mine. If I did my job. I mean, that's the brutal, like that aspect of like living in LA as an actor is just of all the professions out there. I mean, like most people, how many job interviews do you go on in a life? You know, you'll go on like a ton of job interviews and get a job and then you'll just do that job. But an actor, always job interview after a fucking job interview after a fucking job interview. And these are some of these are like jobs where some part of you has got to know, you get that job and like that's the next level. That's the fucking thing. And also, I'm sorry, like I think I'm like, just no one ever talks about the brutality of driving to Culver City in traffic, trying to like get into a mind state where you can go in front of these people and do the job you're talking about. And so it's not showing that you just drove, you know, an hour and a half through fucking traffic. It's not showing that like whatever your bank account is not maybe not doing the best. Yeah, that you saw some desperate. Yeah. And you just sat in the lobby with like a literal spectrum of views, you know, like people and like, there's a more beautiful version of me. There's a less beautiful version of me. There's an older version of me. There's a younger version of me, this rainbow that's supposed to be you. And then they're going to pick one, one part of that spectrum. It is dehumanized. It can be so dehumanizing. How do you, how do you manage to like keep any sort of like balance and not go insane when you're doing that as an actor? Well, I think that the really important thing is that you hold on to what's yours and what makes you you because even though, like you said, there are rainbow views in that room, nobody is you, nobody. And if you hold on to that, that's why I said, like, I'm not, I guess, let me clarify what I was saying earlier about, you know, not giving it a hundred percent. I give a hundred percent in my audition, but I give it in the way that I feel comfortable to where you take me or you don't, but this is what I have to offer you. Yeah. I'm not going to, I'm not going to do this showboat dance for you that I think you want, because then I'm going to, then I'm going to go home and think about a million different ways I could have done it differently for you in that way. Right. But I wouldn't have been happy because it wouldn't have been my performance. Right. I would have been one of the rainbow of people that you saw in the room. I got you. That's so smart. You know what I mean? I'll regret in some kind of way. But if I go in and I'm going to give you that little taste that you'll know what I can do, but I'm not going to like, oh, I gave that thing my all, man. I gave it my all every single time, every single time you'll burn out. Right. And you got it. And it's nothing that's so precious about this business that it doesn't happen again. Like we keep thinking like, oh, man, I want to be a part of that show. I want to be a part of that movie. Oh man, that movie did history. Oh, that TV show is, that made history. But guess what? There'll be another show to make history. Right. There will be another TV, there'll be another movie that does well that people will talk about. And then one day, guess what? No one will talk about it again. Right. And then you have to go, well, you know, and one of my issues that I've had is the idea that I feel like whenever I talk about get out, I feel like it puts me right back into 2017. It puts me right back into this place where everything felt so unsure. And, you know, am I a movie star or not? Right. I was in this huge film, but somehow this train felt like it passed me by. I felt like I was witness to so many great things. And in my own life, I couldn't see the joys and the blessings that were happening for me. Right. I was letting everyone else dictate the idea of what it must be like to be a part of this thing. Yeah. You know what I mean? I'm really sitting here like, they're like, man, I know your phone is blowing up right now. You're like, should it be blowing up right now? Right. Should people be seeking me out? Because I was a part of this thing? Yeah. And it's like, no, man, you just got to, you have to go through life with what makes you comfortable. There are some people who, you know, I was told the other day I did an interview the other day and the interviewer told me that I was, the host told me that I was very humble. I was too humble. And I, you know, I kind of like, you know, thought on that for a minute, like, what does she mean? What does she mean? I'm too humble. And I think that the idea of like, because I don't like to self promote. Yeah. I don't like to tell people what I do and how I do and and all this kind of like those. Right. I rather just show you. Yeah. And if I can show you without telling you, then I feel better about myself. Yes. If I have to tell you and show you, then I kind of feel like it's suspect for sure. When someone is telling you that people do it all the time. People do it all the time. Yeah, sure. They have to in a way. Yeah. Right. Like you get on Instagram and everything is perfect on Instagram. I know. Everybody's life is perfect on Instagram. It's really fucked up. Everybody's booking something on Instagram. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But real life, man, it's all sorts of fucked up things that's happening. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by feels.

Thank you. Feels. Yeah, you know, Instagram really is one of the most powerful torture technologies existing in the world right now. If there is a hell, you can be certain there's a fucking Instagram and how if there's a guarantee that you could take selfies, I would bet a billion dollars you could take selfies and people who see your picture of what like are like, Oh, look at him. Wow, he's really got it made. He only gets his feet chewed off by crocodiles three times a day. I'm over here getting sodomized by a giant beetle 24 seven. What the fuck? But then you know, you're taking a picture of you getting humped by the beetle and someone's like, God, look how fucking happy his beetle is. My beetle hates me. His beetle seems to really enjoy. This is like, you know what I mean? This is the this is the the torment of Instagram because yeah, you're seeing like a fucking tiny millisecond out of these assholes lives. Yeah, that's it. Like just the right angle for a girl and like all of a sudden she's like a six waist and like a Brazilian butt and you're like, wow, man, that's amazing. But then like, yeah, what happens after that millisecond? You know, you don't see it. It's just like it's like porn, you know, porn, you don't see the beginning and the end of whatever this fucking weird thing you're looking at is you don't see if that were real what those people would have to deal with for their lives after that. Whatever the fuck they did. It's true, man. It's like this is a it's one of the it's definitely a good reason to avoid Instagram or you know what I do? I follow monks. I follow a bunch of fucking like Tibetan Buddhists. So my Instagram has always got just I can't really understand it. Shit in like Sanskrit and someone going door into November. I don't know. You seem happy. You seem happy. You seem like you'll get me there. So why not? Yeah, man. I you know, you just gave me a thought about what hell what if hell was like this place where you could literally do the one thing you enjoyed the most, but you could do nothing else. But like, eventually you would get tired of it. Like you were like want to do something else, but then you were like a torture to keep doing it. Oh, dude, like Homer Simpson and donuts. Oh, yeah, that actually is. Hold on. You know what? Look at this. Look at this. I just got this book in the mail today. It's called The Treasury of Precious Qualities, and it's a it's this Tibetan Buddhist text. And you know, it's so funny. Listen, I'll just read this to you. The first chapter is called the value of human existence. And it says. Let me find it. This is fucking intense. It's so funny. You're talking about this. So long enchanted in some sorrow's wilderness, tormented by the cutting of their heads and limbs with seeds of future sorrow hidden in their minds, beings long so foolishly for bliss of higher realms. From there, they fall again, their state states of mind destroying them to wander in three evil realms or as insensate gods or else in barbarous lands with false view views handicapped in places where the Buddhas have not come on blazing iron grounds without reprieve with dreadful weapons wounded time and time again. The denizens of hell are slain but cannot die still tangled in the web webs of hatred's evil deeds. What need is there to say that hungry ghosts are wracked by one for food they find not even pus or blood or filth and streams and orchards dry before their eyes, their vitals burn in endless pain, their length of life uncertain measured by the strength of obscuration. Beasts prey on one another or each other's food and hunter's quarry they are slain by cruel means are caught and tamed they are reduced to bondage born to great misery what can they do anyway it's like just what is describing what you know the the problem with instagram is it gives you a sense that there's this possibility you know if you believe the shit you're seeing in the shiny happy people on instagram then you get this sense of like oh i'm fucking up well i'm not in to loom i'm fucking up i'm not in a private plane i'm fucking up i'm not experiencing like whatever you know the generally no one's taking a instagram picture of their messy fucking room that they haven't cleaned in three days and obviously you can't instagram how bad you stink so it's like you're yeah it gives you a sense of oh if i had that i would be happy and it's the biggest fucking lie because it generally isn't the fucking case yeah exactly you know and i and i try it my best now and i'm a lot better with it to like just keep a steady flow of like who and what i follow and like right you know like i don't stay following the same thing you know over and over unless like it's like constant contact you know like oh yeah i constantly contact you when we talk on a regular on instagram like then you know yeah but for the most part i don't i just don't even participate i'm like this this a voyeur really uh and when i've had enough i'm just like i'm good i'd rather play a game or something on my phone if i'm gonna be diddling like play a brain game or something challenge myself yeah sure you know what i mean but but the trick the trick really is to focus on you to really focus on you and to find those that happiness because in 2017 i couldn't find that happiness for myself you know i couldn't find i i just kept looking at everything that was going wrong you're saying in the midst of like you know being in one of like the best the greatest horror movies of the last god knows how long you still weren't there it was like there was no uh it wasn't it wasn't soothing you or fixing something well you know you you have these dreams of making it you know or making it whatever it's supposed to mean for the individual but i i had these dreams of making it when i came out here and for me that that the idea of making is is just being of worth being a commodity in terms of like uh of in what i do you know everywhere i've gone i felt like i was of value to the community you know yeah um and and in hollywood i would like to see myself of value you know uh to the community and so i i came here with these dreams and so the first thing i booked was was jango and chained and i felt like wow i'm working with quentin tarantino not everybody gets to do that every day no so that that's this is my way in this is the thing and that that wasn't the thing you know i mean like everything that we said and the thing got cut out and like a lot of scenes got cut out that we did we worked on it for like three weeks and i was attached to it for like a year yeah and didn't know anything wasn't aware that like nobody gives a shit like if you go do another job right if you're on schedule left contract like nobody gives a shit just go and do the job right i was like oh do i go do the job my agents are like well i don't know it's a chance you might piss off harvey winstein and quentin tarantino and i was like oh well uh is that a bad thing because i don't know any better is that a bad thing yeah they're like i wouldn't want to do it right i'm like okay well i guess i won't do the thing and so then like i lose these jobs and this confidence in me kind of dwindles a little bit right like so i move on to go do other things and before you know it like i got a family now and and then i'm working at a hotel and i'm not doing the thing that i came here to do yeah and people that i went to grad school with are winning oscars and yeah you know like being in big top movies and i'm like what the fuck is happening right now right and i did some real soul searching man and it was just like i need a sign that i'm here for a reason or i'll just go and a good friend of mine uh patricia mcgregor brilliant director she called me to come do a play and i went to go do the play and subsequently i had to quit my job in the quitting of my job i booked a new tv series uh commercial yeah all this stuff so things were moving i was like yeah this is it this is what i want yeah this is the thing and and it just kind of like snowballed into like a career where i was able to take care of my family and do nice things and and you know like actually be of value of my community uh but i still didn't feel like i was there yet this idea of there yeah uh and so finally get out happens and like when we were filming it it felt like it was going to be special you know right we knew like jordan was so confident and so like he just knew it was going to be iconic he was like that's going to be iconic he's calling everything iconic that's going to be iconic that's going to be iconic and i was just like yeah man like i love that in a leader i love the idea of a leader that's confident i'll follow a confident leader over over a cliff man i promise because it's just like yeah man this makes sense like it feels right uh the trailer release so that was in february 2016 the trailer released in september 2016 and the internet lost its mind and that's when we were like whoa yeah okay that was different and then the next that in 2017 and went to sundance and it like premiered at sundance but guess who knew about it who not this guy oh you know what i mean yeah i'm a part of this thing that was like number one that was like the first like blow i would say right okay then the movie actually premiered but they were like it's not going to be a premiere premiere it's just the screening because they didn't want to call it a premiere okay and i went and we went in these like street clothes and it was a full-on fucking premiere oh man what and like you know it was just like how did that happen i don't know man i have no idea but like it just wasn't communicated and it ended up being this like wildfire dude that just like spread like crazy and um i was doing a play at the kurt douglas at the time and like i just didn't really focus on it because i had something else i could focus on and by the time i came out of it man like it was just like everything was just hitting me in the face people were doing the fucking run everywhere and you know people were yeah you know quoting the movie everywhere it was all sorts of tremendous artwork that came out of it um so i started catching up on all this when i finished the play and i was about a month and a half out i was like oh wow this is crazy look at all this stuff yeah and and then it was just like that's when the train left i feel like that's when i like i was just i kind of came out of it like okay well what do i do now yeah yeah you know and it was just it there was just no guidance but what i believe what i believe about this industry though is like you know it takes some sort of sponsorship you know to really to really make it you know it takes somebody to to put their arm around you and say hey kid let me show you right you know you you learn the game you play the game you teach the game in that order wow that's cool i i feel like i have i'm in this like in between space of learning and playing and i'm playing i'm playing the game i'm i'm all out playing the game now yeah but you're here's your this is what this is what i think is so incredible about that city this is why that city will always be one of the coolest places there regardless of like whatever particular shit it's going through the reason it's always going to be one of the coolest places is because you know what you're it doesn't matter what size of fucking fish you are that pond is so goddamn big there's fucking leviathan swimming around in there you know there's like things that are like so you know no matter you the sense of scale that you might get living in a place that's with a smaller population density fewer artists uh you know it goes out the window so i this is one of the like things that can happen to a perfect a working actor as you start thinking you you find yourself post get out feeling somehow like insecure not insecure but just a sense of like man i need i need to fucking work harder or so or somewhat insignificant because yes i i'm i'm a part of this thing and all of a sudden i'm i'm i don't feel like i'm a part of this thing in fact it got so bad dunkin let me tell you how bad it got bro it got so bad that most places that i went people thought that i was daniel kaluya the star of the movie fuck and i couldn't believe i couldn't think to myself how is this possible it's only four black men in the movie that's brutal man and how how do you not how do you get us confused brutal and and and it happened everywhere it happened at award shows it happened on the street it happened on the job like it it was so many at this point i just call it being danieled i got danieled oh my god that sucks so bad it all it all sucked it all sucked but here's the thing man you go through that you suck it up you recognize you know the things that you would do differently if you could do it differently and blah blah blah but you you ultimately realize i gotta move forward with this right i gotta move forward with this thing i think that's why i'm able to joke about it i mean i've been able to joke about it but it's it's just like this idea though like when when i hear somebody talk about an expectation that they might have from my experiences it makes me it just it kind of sends me in a a little wormhole of like oh you think so and then i have to remember to align with my expectations and align with my purpose right you know because expectations only are born from purpose i think you know yeah yes absolutely i like that i mean this is i think this is just a double-edged sword of the profession you've chosen it's just you know you it's there's so many sand traps for an actor like there's the sand trap of you know fame or getting addicted to the fireworks that come after you're a show that you worked on a year ago or two years ago comes out that's another thing people don't realize is the weird spacing like you shoot a thing and all this time passes and then suddenly wait you almost forgot about it and boom there it is it's there and but you're you've already been away from those people probably in that experience for a while now yeah so that's fucking weird but then then the other that's the sand trap of success where you know or rather the perceived success which is something i think plagues like actors who are like taking off is like you know there's this insane naive judgment that people are putting on you which is that oh yeah you know my god was so like you did it congratulations and then you have to like you know you either have to pretend yeah i did it isn't it great or like correct them to make them understand no you don't get it this is job to job to job to job it's not like one thing it never ends and i think that's a part of the actor's job too or the person in entertainment is that you're supposed to uh pretend like it's all good and it's all like i love this because people think oh what you do you sit on this cushy you know you just work for however long and you know i don't know like people people have told me that oh man i wish i could be an actor man i i have an easy and it's like it's not a easy fucking thing to do no it's not an easy thing to keep your focus for fucking 13 hours or like if you're called in at 6 a.m you get up at five depending on the location five four four you get up at four you know you get up at four you going in you know and then all of a sudden you gotta go through the works and everything like that everything is go go go then everything is stop yeah and then it's like you don't know if it's stopping for 10 minutes 30 minutes an hour two hours week but when they call you back you better damn sure be ready oh you can't fuck up you cannot fuck up that's the thing this is like it's such a high level it's like you know it's like when you're like when you i don't again i don't remember the names of these players but you look at the people dropping the ball last night in that game number 10 that haunts them for the number 10 drops the ball haunts them for the rest of their life but you know that's the other thing yeah i remember when i ended up on i don't remember the first time i got to see a movie being filmed i wasn't in it i was dating someone in the movie but i remember going in there with all the things that your friends were telling you like all right here we go i can't wait to see this like romantic glitzy cushy bullshit and then you realize this is like the most fucking technical like like like completely in there's no it's not like you're filming it from like point a to point b to point c yeah it's like we need to get you walking to the car and we're you need to step on this market this exact time and then get in the car and shut the door you're going to do that 40 fucking times and you know that kind of and you can't fuck up the car is going to fuck up someone's gonna fuck up with the lighting something's gonna fuck up with an extra something's gonna but you can't fuck up because you're the fucking actor so you can't fuck up and if you do you know people not now everybody's pissed because you you've cost us time now god like if you remember did you see the uh the shining documentary when stanley cubrick's just tormenting shelly duvall i heard about it i heard about it oh god oh god she came out at the wrong time they got snowblowers you know they're doing all like it was the maze scene she comes out of the fucking wrong time cubrick just just like doesn't eviscerator reach i think he just goes like shelly shelly shelly and it's just like oh the having stanley cubrick chastising you yeah it's a brutal job it's a technical job and it's a fucking boring job too right you're like sitting around all the time if you're sitting around and you know you're trying to do things to keep yourself occupied but also trying to keep your mind on the job you know yeah because it's it's still a job to do it and it's and it's hard you know like it's it's not easy i might say it's hard it's not it's not an easy task to do and not just anybody can do it you know what i mean it's hard man it's it's i think it's safe to say it's hard i mean it's there there's a reason it's only a few people ever ever even get a part ever it's because it's it's so hard and the people you're up against are all incredibly good at what they do and so yeah it's a it's a brutal job i and i like i think that's a and actors you're right they have to kind of play cheerleaders for the movie that they're in or they have to you know play cheerleaders for their own career or whatever and so you yeah man then they're actors so they're fucking good at it so like because our job is to keep people in disbelief right keep people suspended in disbelief i i'll give you a good example i work with an actor and he's in one of my favorite movies of all time i won't say what it is okay who he is but my favorite movies all time and i was like and i and we were together we're about to do something and i made a reference to the movie and i like you know i thought it would be so perfect and he looked at me and he said he looked dead in my eyes he said i hated my experience on that movie wow and now i changed the movie for me now it's like but if he would have just did his fucking job and said oh yeah man that was fucking great i would still love that movie i would still be able to look at that movie the same right because i want to be suspended in disbelief in that movie like it's fucking funny look most of the time you use the internet without a vpn you're probably gonna be fine but do you really want that feeling after you use the computer

that's so true that's so true some people they during the course of filming a movie they are living in fucking hell that they can't get out of it is horrible they feel they might feel like the opposite of how you felt you can get out which is like you're in a movie and you start getting the sense this isn't gonna be good you're like i'm gonna be in a shitty fucking movie like i'm about to be in a garbage fucking movie because the this just sucks and yeah that's brutal too i mean yeah acting is a brutal fucking job psychologically it's a it's a it's a torturous when we played when i played a slave in jango there was a moment where i was literally like you know i was behind jamie fox in the movie um i played a character named big seed and i had to pee really bad one like this is like one of the first takes that we were doing of the shoot and i had to pee so bad because we had took so long and it had us in these chains just sitting there waiting like you know because the camera could be ready at any moment right but still nonetheless i'm sitting here this black man in chains in 2011 thinking to myself like what the fuck man what am i doing you know psychologically i'm like fucking going through it because i'm thinking to myself like why am i doing this man like this is and i chalked it up to pan dudes but even that like don't even feel like pan dudes it just felt like you know what i mean like because i i i i can see how it uh you know how one thing led to the next thing kind of like so i see why i did jango like i understand why i did it like i'm all for it but i can tell you the feeling i had when i was there and i had to pee and i had to ask somebody permission to like unlock my chains so i could go and still kind of pissed on myself trying to get to the woods because there was no bathroom like who wants to go through that who actually wants to go through that yeah who actually is thinking themselves oh man acting is fucking great man i'm so glad i went to yell for this yeah yeah you know i mean like it's it's it's so it's it's it's it's this thing man and i'm not trying to you know take anybody's you know suspending disbelief out of no i don't i don't think you know i i don't think you i mean i think anyone who's like you know a fan of film and is like looked into it a little deeper knows exactly what you're talking about i mean that's a part of why we love actors we don't just love y'all because you're so good at being other people i think there's the like we sort of at least in there's an intuition that like oh the magic that you all are capable of working it comes at a price it's like a very yeah it's a very difficult form of of magic i mean um it's so like my friends who are actors the amount of preparation that goes into you know even the smallest roles the amount they just pour their lives into it it's just yeah so do you do you do you think part of the what makes it so difficult is that you know most really good actors like you have had experience in theater where there isn't someone like cutting every few seconds where you have to go through yeah all the way and so you get to fully become the role without having to try to be this role while you're sitting for like 10 seconds at a time yeah yeah yeah absolutely i think that being able to uh being able to to find the character i mean something that's interesting about theater at least to me the most interesting thing about theater is the idea that like you're not the only one that's going to play this role you're not the only person that's going to touch and say these words right so now you have to make it uniquely you you know uh you know in in tv and film i mean like it's rare but there are remakes there are you know so you get to like but there are new words there's a new script nobody like does a script for word for word remake you know i've i've not seen that before or maybe i i don't know but you know the idea is that in theater you literally just get to do it the way you would do it right because it's it's got to be you yeah uh if you do it if you're trying to do it like if i'm trying to do othello like paul roberson then you know that that's going to be me doing paul roberson it's not going to be me being othello right you know and that's what i think i did the first time i did othello it's like i was trying to be paul roberson i was like oh there's demota but i like try to talk all deep and i tell you what i wish i wish i could say the first time i did othello that's what i wish now it necessarily be the role they pick for me but you know what i mean i wish i could say the oh you know the first time i did hamlet i you know and also i don't know who the person you just mentioned is i mean like this is to me this is the this is the problem that this that happens when you become um a professional is that you're always you're around professionals a lot and you're around other people who probably went to Yale uh you're around other people who and so it's easy to forget this is the same with like spiritual teachers you know sometimes i'll be talking to like right this is some of these ramdas teachers and i realize like these people i don't know if they would call themselves enlightened or if it's fair to call anyone that necessarily but these people have literally found a way to be peaceful for years at a time where if i can go a day without falling into some neurotic vortex that's a good fucking day you know what i mean and i think sometimes they it's not like they forget but they just you know i that's what i think it's cool about getting to talk to like professionals is to like you don't realize how fucking cool that is to be like you know the first time i played othello yeah you know what an accomplishment that is like what a you know all those things but really doesn't matter does it it's over that's not happening anymore that's all gone there's just right now everything after this and that's it so all that stuff who cares nothing's there it's you got to keep going and you have to keep getting better and that's it if you want to if you want to you know be an actor yeah yeah and i think that you know like we were saying earlier living in your experience fully really does feed you out in your acting you know when i was uh one of the things i had to deal with especially during covid and things like that was the idea that sometimes you're just not working like yeah you know i told you like 2014 things kind of took off i hadn't had really that much time off since 2014 uh you know given the amount of projects and stuff yeah so now i have a little more time on my hands and i have to live fully in what i have and i have two beautiful children and a loving wife yes and you know like this in three dogs now like three yeah dude yeah dude it's it's a whole thing you got a covid dog we got two covid dogs oh my god i don't know what that my erin and i were talking about that a lot of our friends are getting dogs like pandemic dogs i don't know what happened man it's like who let the dogs out literally like but they are all over the streets and they need homes yeah and that's beautiful good for you and you've been also man you've got a beautiful house and like you know yeah i know like that to me that's that can actually be a little challenging sometimes because challenging in a good way but you you know what i'm talking about when you hit those moments of bliss with your family and it's like the whatever the universe is resonating in the most simple way around you and your kids and your wife and you realize this is you can't do better than this no matter what i don't care what the fuck it is nothing will nothing will ever be this this nothing will ever feel this good as far as accolades or getting better at a thing or whatever nothing beats this and so then that's where i sometimes am faced with a strange sense of like and what the what am i doing you know what i mean like is yeah the the desire to just be with your family live a simple life you know and and and and make that your fundamental practice you know pops into my head sometimes but i love creating stuff and i love making the pockets i love getting to have conversations like this but exactly and i don't want to hierarchize the experience in the world or anything like that but there does seem to be a little bit of a i don't know an accidental kind of trickery happening in the world where people are being shown via instagram or you know lifestyles of the rich and famous or their own fantasies this version of reality where you've made it when and and and it's trickery because some people who are crazy enough to be called into that lifestyle they make it and then they realize that they nothing nothing really has changed emotionally for them nothing but then and whereas if you're just hanging out with your kids and your wife somehow you've made it but what did you do you didn't do a you didn't go to Yale you like yeah you came inside of someone cool yeah and we're was able and was able to build something with that person yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to reduce our like fatherhood to to you know the way no no no it happened out clearly you gotta work your way through the other shit you don't just get to come and then retire would that would that be a sweet gig though it's called a sperm donor yeah that's true but you gotta it's a lot of requirements so i thought like maybe you just like go and do it and then be done but no it's like a whole thing you gotta bring paperwork really gotta prove who you are because that makes sense iq gotta be a certain level or something like that i you know because i when i got cancer i had to like put my jizz on ice and they now i'm still connected to that sperm bank and i get updates when they've got new sperm it's the funniest thing in these emails like we gotta oh we've got a professor we've got professor jizz i would love it if it was like emojis that came with that like the little like emoji with glasses like look what we got you guys it's basically like that like and i i if you i was too lazy to like sign up like i wanted to get jizz but the you you know i think you can go to videos of them being like hello i love music i know how to play the cello oh my god of course of course i think that like you know just to hop on what you were saying earlier you know about balance the balance you know i have this thought that life when we look at it um it's sort of like the process of of growing a plant right or or planting the seed we water it we make sure it gets sunlight we make sure that you know when it grows it grows and we take care of it as it grows but then it bears fruit and we enjoy the fruit yeah right we enjoy the labor of our work to get to that fruit yes and i think that for me the planting the seeds part is really enjoyable when i'm with my kids and my wife and we're building memories that we'll think about in 10 20 years and that will be the fruit of the labor that we put in yeah when it comes to work and the balance of work i'm still figuring it out i'm still like thinking you know but when i'm playing the seed at work i'm playing the seeds of like when i'm auditioning when i'm putting things on tape when i'm meeting somebody new for the first time like i'm really trying to make an impression so that 10 20 years down the line you know whatever i've been doing that is watering the seeds whatever my past work is shedding light on the things that i put seeds on so that something can grow beautifully yeah uh you know so like in my friendships in my family you know i'm i'm really just trying to create moments so that you know years down the line you know i am a value to my community you know right uh in the in the in memoriam section of the Oscars man i want them to play a video clip of me man i don't want to i want to just be a picture you want the fucking clip i want the clip oh yeah oh yeah i get it showing the clip of me and not just a running dude you know what i mean like i want a real fucking moment like where i'm like whipping around taking my glasses off and saying we we want we want the whole truth you know what probably by the time you die it's not going to be a video of you it's going to be a you in a hologram with an ai that's replicated your personality because you signed some fucking contract yeah in a movie and you didn't pay enough attention to it warner brothers literally owns the ai representation of you which it will probably say hey i just want everyone to know did my meat vehicle die yes but i'm still here i'm fine and i'm doing i i'm going to keep acting for infinity because i've become a drone owned by warner brothers i think a lot of you actors that's what you is going to happen to you i think that like that's one of the the real uh scary things about what's happening right now with some of the deep fake shit everyone's like people just don't realize how that's going to decimate uh the industry not now but i'd say in 10 10 years 15 years from now that's going to like be apocalyptic for actors it's going to be apocalyptic apocalyptic for a lot of things because i mean i don't know about you but i've gotten at least three or four messages from friends who have you know sent videos and i thought it was them it was their voice it was it was their faces it was their bodies and they were like yo sign up with this girl give her invest ten dollars and she'll turn it into a thousand like stuff like that and it was like whoa wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here you know like to a point where it's like wait what you're you'd wait the deep fakes of your friends were trying to get you into some kind of scam yeah what yeah dude like just regular people it's not even like they're famous just regular people i've not gotten one of those that is terrifying yeah dude yeah what it's and they're out there man they're out there oh my god yeah that's that's so crazy to me i mean that's the that's just that's the end of everything dude do you realize the best thing you can do for yourself is is to literally hang on to the real relationships you have with people like literally the people that you can call on the phone and say hey how you doing let's meet for lunch like those people because it's just going to get to a point man between deep fakes and the metaverse and you know freaking covid like stay at home orders man we gotta we gotta hold on to one another man because pretty soon they're gonna have us all in these fucking pods and we're just gonna see each alone the internet oh my god i mean yeah fake fucking bodies and shit live in the lie that we see on instagram every day in the actual world yeah yeah i know what you mean i i yeah that was one of my like paranoid moments during the pandemic early on i don't think anymore but early on i thought oh maybe this is just what happens when you die you know like you die the world seems exactly the same way but all of a sudden you could only communicate to people mostly in 2d space and you know the way that you're you're seeing it as technology or whatever but you're dead you're in the bardo and this none of this is real and but then you know i just realized that's just why am i fucking letting my mind tell me this shit you know like why am i listening to that part of my mind i have a very very like powerfully poetic manipulative shadow side that if i let it you start talking i'll be like under the bed scared to death but i know what you mean it's like you know what what is after all this bullshit that we're going through what do we have that is stable or what do we have that is at least more stable than the week to week you know drama and chaos that keeps appearing and shaking the fabric of society and i think that yeah it's your friends it's your community it seems obvious but somehow it's easy to forget that yeah man yeah no you you you you it's easy to forget because again when we look at instagram everything is so fucking perfect that we don't even decide we've decided already that that person has a perfect life and i'm not even a part of it so therefore you know i'm not a part of what i'm seeing on instagram so therefore i'm not a part of this person's fucking perfect life right but what it really takes is a phone call to say hey how are you you'll learn that things aren't so perfect right you know yeah you'll learn that oh i actually am a value because i actually care yeah you know yeah you're saying like if you fall prey to the instagram i mean actually if you're fucking instagram is making you seem too happy you you you're really like that's a self-destructive instagram like you know i i don't know the details of what happened to the young lady recently who jumped out of her window oh right who worked for one of those outlets but you know everything one of the conversations that i saw around it was like you don't know with somebody everything can look so perfect everything can look so perfect she was miss usa she was a lawyer yeah she was a correspondent who got to interview stars yeah 30 years old healthy hanging out with lady gaga hanging out with lady gaga one of zendaya's favorite like people to interview her yeah so you know like that that all doesn't sound good that yeah that fills up about 10 minutes of space in my brain and then i think about the rest of the fucked up stuff in the world yeah right and now i can't take it so that's why you gotta that's why it's important man no matter what it's looking like no matter if you think that oh i haven't talked to this person in years or i haven't seen this person in so long if you think about them check on them you know what i love that man i i'm gonna start doing that because sometimes i'll think about somebody and i'll think i'm gonna check on them and in fact once a few years ago that did happen to me man not to give some morality fucking story here i did have that impulse it popped into my head i haven't talked to them in a while i wonder how they're doing didn't follow through on that they it like the then they were dead in like six days you know what i mean like you know they like they like and you know that's something i like get to live with is that weird haunting like whoa man yeah was i sensing something shit what the fuck why didn't i do that it'd be so easy to call them i guess sometimes though we feel intrusive like if you haven't talked to someone in a while even though you might be friends even though you love them sometimes you feel like i don't want to fucking just call them out of the blue but dunking being from the south you know just as much as i do that everybody appreciates a nice how you're doing you know everybody at least in the south where where i know the south everybody appreciates a nice stop by a nice like you know catch up because they it's not like anybody's rushing to get anywhere or do anything it's just a hey man you know just a nice little stopping chat people love that you know when i was in alabama when i was growing up in st louis man people love people sitting out on their porch you're just walking by you're just like hey how you doing and it's just a quick little something in me older people will keep you there longer but you know for the most part it's nice it's a good feeling that somebody's saying hey i'm thinking about you enough to take my time out to check up on you yeah you know because as you get older i noticed too and i noticed this when i was younger too older people always appreciated it because at the older you get man like you just kind of get pushed out of that loop unless you jay-z you know what i mean like you just get kind of pushed out of the fold and nobody's thinking about you yeah because they want the new shiny thing that's in front of you you're invisible you're invisible yeah you get older you get invisible you get set in your ways you don't want to go out you don't want to do new things no so you get older so when somebody calls you and says hey i'm thinking about you it's the best how how much do you appreciate that it's the best it's the best it's the best i don't know it's so true i it's so it's so true i it's like i don't i never it's always cool when someone does that to me it's always cool no matter what you're like whoa holy shit yeah that's so nice i'm so fucking busy trying to be busy and all of a sudden somebody's like hey man take a minute out i'm thinking about you oh shit okay thank you yeah what's up and i can do the same it's people who i think about my journey and the people i think about man i probably haven't talked to in 20 years and you know and it depends some some people you don't need to talk to again you know you can just kind of think i'm from afar and put good energy out there for them you know but if some people it would probably make their day if i would just call and say hey i'm thinking about you yeah totally accept your ex-girlfriends accept my ex-girl you cannot call not when you're married not when you're married dude like it's just not it's just not fair i i used to be of a different mind man but you know i've grown to understand and learn that it's just just don't do it man it just keeps things peaceful yeah right but you know one thing i do now that you taught me this is like this is what's cool about having friends is they give you things that stick with you for the rest of your life but you know the thing you're telling me you touch a tree oh yeah i now when i touch trees i think of people i love can you tell people about that because it's the coolest fucking thing ever so i have this theory about trees and i'm pretty sure it's probably something out there on it but uh trees are like rooted into the earth right they are rooted into like the roots touch each other man it's like electricity the water and all the stuff they they have to do it to live so when these roots they're channels they communicate with each other so if i'm at a tree here in los angeles then i can communicate with a tree that's back in st louis i can communicate with a tree that's in new york yeah you know like because the roots are all connected they're all in the earth yeah you know so the next time you're out i challenge you all to go and touch a tree think about somebody send them a message see if that person contacts you in the next like however long it takes for for me it took four days for each person that i've like done that for and i'm not somebody who's out there doing it all the time but the times that i have done it it's taken four days at the most for a person to contact me that i've thought about that is so cool yeah it works it really does man it's crazy it's crazy it it so i just a few days ago interviewed this like a llama um you know a tibetan teacher and tibetan buddhist she wasn't tibetan but she was telling me the exact same thing except through meditation so the idea being that when you meditate it when in tibetan buddhism time and space aren't linear they're like everything's happening at the same time i guess so it's the same idea except you could do the same thing for like buddhas you could do the same thing for because when you're when you're when you're meditating and you drop in whatever the place is there's a lot of words for it you are in the same you become the same thing as everyone who's ever lived and is going to live in the future and so in that moment you're like part of this network where you can send ping people basically you know you can like you know ask for help prayer is what they you know it's generally called this prayer but it's an interesting uh concept with the i like the trees because it's a little easier to touch a tree than to meditate yeah yeah yeah you know i got this uh i got a gift from uh uh warner for christmas this year and it's called a core have you ever heard of this thing nope okay so it's just like this little like oblong ball looking thing with these sensors on the top of it and it connects to an app and the app does guided meditations and you put your thumbs on it and it starts the the core this little oblong ball and it starts to vibrate and what basically is doing is it's giving you a focal point to concentrate on and it's kind of like uh what your mom was talking about in midnight gospel right about feel your fingertips oh yeah do you feel your fingertips like can you feel it it but it's in the form of this vibrating machine and you don't lose your concentration you're listening to what they're saying but like anytime your mind tries to travel the ball is vibrating and it's like teaching you uh these breathing techniques so you know it's one called the box breath where you breathe in for you hold it oh yeah let go for you hold it then you breathe back in for you know so box breathe in they do the reset breath where you breathe in for you let go eight you know it's like all these different things and they're guiding you in the meditation it's so like I never thought I would be in a meditation like that uh I meditate but never like this man to a point where I'm like awake by the end of it and actually energized and I'm focusing on my breath it's never I've never had that type of experience before so have you you've been doing this regularly with this thing yes yes wow that's great man that's great yeah man yeah it may yeah that kind of stuff I've I'm I have a book on it I think it's called pranayama it's it's it's you know it's like various weird methods of breathing breathing through your nose very important um that there's a great book I wish I could remember the name I was reading on breath it was saying like people who breathe through their nose who have formerly been mouth breathers when you start breathing through your nose it'll literally change the shape of your face like the the effect of just breathing in through your mouth is causing you know a certain type of facial characteristic and that if you start breathing through your nose it changes everything like the breath is the fundamental thing that keeps us here outside of our you know our mother's bringing us here and our father bringing us here breath is what keeps you alive and it's the most overlooked fucking thing do you don't think about it you breathe all day long you pay no attention you assume you're breathing the right way because it's how it's you're alive but yeah when like people start altering their breathing patterns then a lot of diseases go away some like allergies that people have really awful allergies that can go away it's a cool book that's interesting man I'm gonna look up this core thing I want one yeah dude it's it I would say it's worth it man I I want to get you know Sarah really

For example, this week, I'm super fucking pissed off at that fucking piece of shit, Drinni Printerson, that motherfucker.

And they need to understand that it's time to stop. Fuck You TV, highly recommend it. Welcome, this is the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. My name is Duncan Tressel, and I'm a literary genius with three doctorates in words. And because of that, I love poetry. And so I'm gonna read to you a poem that I just heard because I said, hey, Siri, play a poem for me because I was feeling starved intellectually because I've only been watching Dateline for the last two years. And this is the poem that I heard. Our Deepest Fear by Marianne Williamson. Our Deepest Fear. Our Deepest Fear is not that we are inadequate. Our Deepest Fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who might have been brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. You're playing small, does not serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us, it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we're liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. Now that's the end of the poem by Marianne Williams. And I, of course, added a few measures, verses rather. Measures is what you call in graduate school, but I'll call it a verse. This is actually a tradition for men in graduate school. They don't do it anymore, but in the 50s, it was actually required that when a woman wrote a poem, a man would add several verses to the end. And so here we go. Our second deepest fear. Our second deepest fear is that our dicks or butts will fall off. If we were to wake and look down and see our dicks or butts were not on we, we might try to awaken from a terrible dream. And when realizing we were awake, we would start to scream. That's our second greatest fear. And then I added our third greatest fear. Our third greatest fear is while masturbating to VR porn, the nanny cam will pick us up and we will be recorded. And then our fourth greatest fear. Our fourth greatest fear is that our sixth greatest fear will become our first greatest fear. And now it's mail bag. Dear Duncan, I just thought I'd let you know that I was just riding in my car on a first date with a beautiful woman that I've had a crush on for a really long time. And I made the horrible mistake of playing the podcast episode where you added extra verses to a really wonderful poem by Marianne Williamson. And it basically ruined the mood of our date. And I haven't been touched since the beginning of the pandemic. And I really thought that we would be making sweet love tonight, but after I played your podcast for it, she seemed confused and like she didn't really trust my judgment or something. And anyway, I just thought you should know that that's what happened. Maybe you'll think a little bit more about what you say in the beginning of your podcast, knowing that some people are playing your podcast to dates and people that maybe haven't heard other episodes. All right, okay. Thank you sincerely, Rockford Crawley. Thank you, Rockford, for listening to the podcast. I just wanna remind you that if you like the podcast, you should also subscribe over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH, you'll get commercial free episodes of this podcast along with access to our weekly meditation journey and a boredom that's every Monday. And every Friday, we have our family gathering where we all hang out together and talk and ramble. Sign up and thank you for being such a fan and for those kind words, I really appreciate it. Sincerely, Duncan. You know, if my eating habits were similar to my musical listening habits, then I would probably have rickets at this point from not getting enough nutrition, not getting all my greens and all my fruits and vegetables and musical salads. I'm lazy when it comes to listening to music and it's embarrassing and it doesn't help me at all to only listen to John Denver and John Prine and the Grateful Dead, mostly. Every once in a while, I get lucky in whatever algorithm is serving up music, recognizing that I'm a dad in an acoustic ditch with my wheels spinning in a kind of sad, never ending repetition of some Uncle John's band, country roads to paradise, maybe a little angel from Montgomery, back to the Grateful Dead, maybe some bored revisiting of Pink Floyd back to the Grateful Dead. It's like the algorithm tries to intercede and is like, here's Daedalus, listen to this and I'll listen to it and for a second, I'll feel great. That's how I got to meet Daedalus and have him on a previous episode of this podcast, which is luck. It was an AI trying to help me, but today's guest, I got even luckier than that. A wonderful festival that On Air Fest reached out and asked if I would be interested in doing a kind of podcast with today's guest, Open Mike Eagle for their On Air Fest. And I went on to Spotify and started listening to Open Mike Eagle and it's like imagine someone who's been living in some stinky, moldy, underground cave, like some kind of golem-esque, spindly, greasy, glowing, fungal encrusted creature that's only been eating larva and sucking some kind of slime mold off of the rocks in the cave and then somebody throws like a hamburger into the cave, that is musically how I felt when I started listening to today's guest, Open Mike Eagle. Holy shit, I'm sure you have listened to him, but if you haven't, before you listen to this podcast, just any of his tracks, they're all good, he's amazing and we had a wonderful conversation and that's coming up right after this, I'm stopped. Friends, we live in an uncomfortable world, a wobbly world, a world that sometimes seems out of balance. There's just so many uncomfortable situations, like I just want to be comfortable and I want to be comfortable and I want to be comfortable in comfortable situations, like I just walked out of a car dealer after doing like a dramatic walk out because I didn't like the deal they were offering and I looked down, my zipper had been down the whole time. So I just seemed like some kind of addled middle-aged man whether it couldn't even keep his fly zipped up while negotiating for a car. We deserve comfort at the end of the day after we've been embarrassing ourselves because being human is innately embarrassing and that is why we need a wonderful purple mattress. Purple has the grid, the stretchy gel material that's amazingly supportive for your back and legs while cushioning your shoulders, neck and hips. Now listen, they have things they want me to read here and anytime you go off script a little bit, it's a little bit of a danger, purple friends listening, I'm sorry in advance, but I have to say this, they sent me a pillow and I was deeply skeptical because like you, I have been assailed by various pillow dealers over the last, over the pandemic period and I bet you're sick of it too. And so hearing about the purple, whatever, it's like it's another dream that's gonna get crushed when the reality of the pillow is compared to what they say. They send me the pillow and it's amazing. It really actually is amazing. It's got this stuff in it. I don't know what it is. I thought about cutting it open, but I would feel insane if I found myself with a dagger ripping open a perfectly good pillow to try to understand what's in there. According to this thing they want me to read, it's called a grid and it bounces back as you move and shift unlike memory foam, which remembers everything. That's why memory foam has craters and divots. There you go. That's what they say it is. I don't care what it is. I don't care if it's lizards holding hands and wrapping their tails against each other and sort of sensing the shape of my head and the mood that I'm in and then conforming so that it feels good. It just works and when you're my age that's really all you care about. When you have the type of scoliosis I have and your back looks like an old melted fence in one of those pictures from the days of nuclear bomb testing. I just want a good pillow and that is what purple is and of course they make mattresses and you should try it out. Purple really is comfort for an uncomfortable world.

Please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Art Podcast Open Mike Eagle. [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Art Podcast""] [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Art Podcast""] [""Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Art Podcast""] It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Art Podcast. Mike, welcome to the DTFH. How long do you have by the way? It's probably as long as we need him an hour, probably be good just cause I'm telling my kid to be quiet in the other room. Okay, how old? He's 12. Yeah, how great to be a dad. Is it wild? Do you feel like in some ways it kind of like, I don't want to say damaged cause that sounds negative but in some ways it like shifted you so much from what you were before being a parent that it could almost be compared to a kind of apocalypse? It definitely was an end of looking at the world a certain way and the beginning of looking at the world in a completely different way. Suddenly, I would look at like, I would see like Shaquille O'Neal on my TV and be like, that was somebody's baby. Yes! You know, like just the weirdest thoughts that I'd never had before, you know? That is the, that is the, to me that's the, one of the things it does. That, so that is a, it fucks with your ability to like judge people as much. When you do that thing and see that little baby and you know, they were just crying and confused and scared to sound. And just shitting themselves and, you know, they just, and then they grew up and had a personality and made mistakes and I don't know, it's just, it's just a odd, even just watching him grow up, you know? It's like, I see so many consistencies from when he was a very tiny person but also there's parts of him that I have no idea where they came from. Wow. You know, like personality traits. I just like, where did you get this? Yeah. Yeah, do you see, do you have the thing where you see like those weird flickers of your parents or your grandparents in their face? I see a little bit of my grandma but I also see a lot of his mom's family. I see a lot of that too. Now that, and I feel like it's okay to talk about it because you transformed your divorce into some very powerful music. But how does, how do you reconcile that? You know, is that, is that that? Cause it's like a normal breakup. You know, you can clear it out. You're not gonna, any reminder of them as existing up here. Right. But when you have- When it's a person. Yeah. You know, the thing for me is like, like I come from a long line of like broken homes. You know what I'm saying? So like- Same. I feel like that's just part of it. Like that's just part of life. It's like not having everything intact. Right. So the time when it was was more like the aberration to me. Wow. That was more like that. This is weird and cool. You know? Yeah. When it was all united. Yeah. But it is still, I mean, it, yeah. It's like, I remember after the initial like realization of impermanence that your parents getting divorced teaches you as a kid. Yeah. It just became normal. There wasn't- See mine, mine, my parents were never together. Oh wow. Like I tell people this story like, my first real memory of seeing my parents in the same room together was they took me to lunch after like my high school graduation. And I'm like sitting at a table looking at both of them at the same time. And I can barely, I could count maybe on one time before where I had seen this picture, you know? I think like when my grandmother passed away, I know my dad was there, but that was like in this big group of people, you know? But like me and them two together was the weirdest thing I had ever seen. What'd you talk about? I don't remember. I don't even remember what we talked about. I don't even think we had like any substantial conversation. I think everybody was just like having their own experience with this moment. Yeah. And making sense of it in their own way. I don't think we talked about anything profound. I think we were all trying to act like it was normal. Oh, fuck. And I'm sure it was the weirdest for me, you know? Yeah. Because I don't even, I can't even really conceptualize how they dated. Like they're just very different. Yeah. But your dad, he goes to your graduation, the only other time you saw him one other time? Well, saw them together one other time. But you were having contact with him. Yeah. He's been in my life the entire time. Oh, great. Okay, okay, cool. Oh, good. I thought he was doing that thing that some dads do where it's like, they just show up at the like big moment and they're like, ah, I'm your dad, right? I made it. I checked the box. I'm here. Right, you love me. Yeah, that's the thing that it really, I'm a new dad and like learning this shit is just like, my God, you know, a real dad, that's work. That's a lot of work. So yeah, yeah, it's teaching me a lot. But do you tell me a little bit about how it's affected your art? You know, like, and did you feel, one of the things I was worried about is I wouldn't, somehow I would stop being inspired or stop making stuff. So far it's proven to be wrong, but did you have that fear that in the sense it kind of flies in the face of, I don't know, like, you know, when the fantasy of the artist or something, you know what I mean? The loner, the lone wolf. I think for me, the biggest change, it wasn't like an anticipation change. It was like when he was born suddenly, like the act of leaving town to do a show, to do a tour, like that completely changed. Like my emotional relationship to that act took on this entirely different picture, where like, it would emotionally hurt me to be away to the point where like it physically hurt. Like, I'd be on tour and I would see a child and I would get upset just because, oh, there's people that are getting to hang out with their kids, you know, like, so it was really that for me. It wasn't so much the art because I'm very like selfish in my art to where like, I feel like there's little that could happen that would change my relationship with what I do. But I think that's because, yeah, I kind of just make what I want to hear all the time. And you know, so it, I feel like sometimes it has suffered from not having any effects from the outside world. And that's why like, on this last project, I was trying to be more true to actual emotions that I was feeling. Because I wanted to like, open it up a little bit and have it exist in the world as a thing that came from me as like a living person in the world, rather than just manifesting the ideas that, you know, it's one half of my mind speaking to the other half. That's what the rest of my career had been pretty much. It's just messages back and forth in my own head. Now, sometimes they would try to reflect the world or point fingers at the world or, you know, that sort of thing, but they didn't really exist in the world. Yeah. Like I tried to make this one like be in a space time. How'd that feel? I was, it was, it was very rewarding making it. It was terrifying putting it out. I like that. Yeah. It was weird, man. Like, cause you know that thing when you have a product and you know you have to, you know, you know, you make it, you know, you give it a title, you know, you give it a release date, you announce it, and then, you know, you kind of go into that promotional mode. You push, push, push on the socials. It felt really weird to do that with this. It felt really weird. Yeah. Cause it felt like it was me. Yeah. You know? I was reading an interview you did where you said that negative reviews, that thank God you didn't get that many, but the negative reviews of that album, I think you just read one and it was like a personal, it felt like an attack or a person. It did. I'm still not over it with that person. I'm still not over it. And that was months ago. Like still whenever that person pops up on my social media, cause we're actually cool. Like me and this like really popular reviewer, like we've hung out. I like had him on my podcast back in the day. I still hold something about that. Like I'm still angry at him in a way that I don't even know how I can address it. I don't know how I can process it. This episode of the DTFH was brought to you by the purveyors of the best horror movies available online. You know who it is already. It's shutter. And I've got something they want me to read, which I will, but before I read it, I want to say that one of my dear friends, Rob Schropp wrote and directed another episode of Creepshow. There's lots of great stuff on shutter right now. Stuff that maybe you're not aware of like Clive Barker's classic Night Breed. But also they've got their own original content and something that makes me love this network for more than the fact that it reminds me of going into an old, creepy, musty video store that I used to go into when my dad was working and I was staying at his apartment in College Station, Texas. And he gave me enough money to rent seven videos a day. There were like a dollar each at this video store on the condition that I only, that I don't get informed. That it's just horror or whatever I want, which was horror, and this video store had like crazy titles that you would read about in Fangoria magazine, which I was into when I was a kid. That's what shutter is like. It's got the real stuff. If you're a horror fan, it's got what you need. Definitely Clive Barker's Night Breed is that, but their originals, they're true to form Creepshow series. You gotta watch it. If you're a fan of Creepshow, if you're a fan of the comic that came out, if you're a fan of Stephen King, you're gonna love this series. You know, when something like that you hear it's coming out, you cringe for a second, because you're like, they're gonna ruin it. It's gonna be another beautiful thing that gets sacrificed on the pulsating alter of Hollywood. But no, they completely did it, replicated it, and you're gonna love it. This is shutter. You got to check them out. I don't have time anymore to dig around, to try to find some horror movie I've never heard of. I need shutter so I could go into the archives and watch some of the crazy horror movies that exist. I bet you don't know about all the weird fucking Italian horror movies out there with the crazy fucking soundtracks. Shutter has them for you. To try Shutter free for 30 days, go to shutter.com and use promo code Duncan. That's S-H-U-D-D-E-R. You don't have time, the singularity's about to happen. History's gonna end, and we're all gonna get evaporated into some kind of techno cloud. You're gonna spend your precious last moments as an individual looking for a horror movie you haven't heard of by scrolling through a thousand different streaming services. No, honor yourself. Do the self-care that you deserve by subscribing to Shutter and diving into the molten cauldron of gore that that network is. Thank you, Shutter. When the Midnight Gospel came out, somebody said that you're not supposed to read your own reviews. What the fuck, how do you not, are you crazy? What the fuck, what am I, that's something like a yogi maybe could avoid reading reviews, but how do you not look, because you want a sense of how it's being received? Yeah, and I am, I mean, the people that I'm reading are like, yeah, yeah, and I am, I mean, the people who gave it shitty reviews, I mean, I don't even know them, and I'm pissed at them still. I still think, I don't even know what they look like, but I think about them like that, motherfucker, why not just stab me in the face? It feels like you're being stabbed in body parts. It feels like you're being stabbed in sensitive areas. Like, you know, sometimes, actually, I'll say this, way more than I should. I searched my own name on Twitter, like way more than I should. And typically, that's okay. You know, like typically that's okay. Typically it's innocuous things. Man, last week, somebody had made a tweet. They were, and the tweet was like, rank these four artists. And the other three, they're all my friends. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. So I'm talking about, I would look at these things, look at what people were doing, it would feel like people were riddling my body with bullets when they had my friends ranked above me, which is a perfectly fine opinion to have. I just didn't wanna read it. I didn't wanna see it. I didn't want it to exist. I was like, you know how you can mute a conversation? I wish that I could delete the conversation from the servers, just take it away. Because for me, it only served to hurt my feelings. Sure, sure. That's something that you might expect to see in like a modern rendition of Dante's Inferno. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Yes, it was that sort of thing. And it was me paying the cost for doing this thing I'm not supposed to do. Right. If I hadn't searched my name that day, that couple of days, never would have saw it. Yeah, that's, I have to tell my wife, because sometimes she goes on my subreddit and tells me shit, they're saying, I'm like, don't tell, I don't wanna know. Like, don't tell me. I had to develop a discipline to not look at that stuff. That for me, I had to learn in the early days of like early days of Rogan's podcast. Because his fans would just like, just for fun, they like you. It's like sport for them. Yeah, yeah. How can you skewer Duncan for sport? Exactly, it's so like, you just learn, like don't go there. If you want, like, even Rogan doesn't go there. You know, it's like, don't go there. Just let them, you know, if they're gonna attack you or whatever, it's, they don't know you. That's the main thing, right? I mean, that's what you have to keep referring to is, or I keep referring to is like, I barely know myself. So how could someone out there really know me enough to like despise me, even if they're like, making pretty accurate, like commentary on my physical appearance. You know, you make a good point about, sorry, my neighborhood is- Oh, same, you'll get it. I'm like, somebody around here is just always like hurting themselves, it seems like. Okay. You made a good point about learning early on, like how to keep a certain distance. Like I did, cause I learned early on like, like I don't read the comments on stuff, you know, like if, you know, whatever music site posts an article or even like on YouTube largely, like I don't read the comments there because I, you know, I know that those people are competing for attention and there's no real stakes there, except for me potentially being offended. Like there's nothing, there's no real, but like, yeah, it's impossible, at least with the space that I am even to this day, not to like read the reviews, cause the reviews feel, they feel like they're coming from sources that matter more in terms of platforms, websites, whatever. And typically there's someone who is paid to be thoughtful. And I am interested in thoughtful assessments of my work, not like hot take assessments, but like somebody really is sitting and listening to a project in the, in the sequence and for the amount of time that I intended and they have formed a thoughtful assessment, I'm really interested in that. You know, I would love to chat with you just for a second about the sequence itself, cause I don't know, I feel like that doesn't get talked about as much. And I'm curious, when you're may, when you're working on an album, how much, how thematic are these things? How much time are you spending? Are there songs that actually get inspired out of a need to follow another song? Yep, for sure. There's, and typically I don't like to be in that position where I'm trying to fill holes, but that does happen. Cause sometimes, okay, this part, this song needs to be with this first half of the project. Cause there is a sequence, there's always, with me, there's always a through line. But sometimes like, it's like, okay, this has to be song five and this needs to be song six, but something needs to go in between them. A palette cleanser or something needs to go. So like, I have like done that where I've made a song to fit between. But I think, you know, to point to what you're saying, I for one, spend a lot of time on sequence. And I don't think that that's something that, I don't think it matters to people as much as it matters to me, you know? My, I have a friend who's a musician and we were working on something together once and I was watching him and getting kind of frustrated with the amount of thought he was putting into the sequence. I'd never even, I mean, this is how literate musically I am. I'd never even, I hadn't put much thought into that. But it was, but now I get it. I mean, when I was working at the comedy store, the owner Mitzi, I used to work for her and she would put that level of thinking into each lineup. And I think there is some similarity between a good comedy show and an album. I mean, obviously not all albums are comedic, but I know what you mean, the rhythm, the tone, making sure like, if it's an hour long show, it feels like something put together with some intention. I feel like that is important. I'm glad to hear that she was putting that level of thought into it. Cause I'll go to the comedy store, you know, they have all the rooms or like the improv, they have all the rooms, you'll see all the lineups. A lot of times I look at them and they feel random to me, but it's interesting to think of that, curating it with that level of intention. Yeah, well, she's thinking about, like she would, she explained it to me. It's like a lot of different things all mixed together, what they're, you know, what their stand-ups like, but then also what they look like, size, every, like the whole thing was meant to be like a, each one was meant to be some kind of weird mosaic. But when you're thinking about sequencing, and forgive me if this is a question emerging from a lack of deep understanding of making music or if it seems like a new question or something. But what, when you're thinking about this arrangement, what is going through your mind? Or is it just an instinct or? Well, okay. So it's interesting that you said that she's dealing with a couple of different factors. Cause I feel like there is the natural inclination I have to make a sequence that's just based on me trying to paint a picture or me trying to like make the audio equivalent of a movie where this scene goes here, this scene goes here, this scene goes here. But I've also learned over the course of like having a career that there's, like there's business stuff I have to consider with my sequence as well. And that was one of the toughest lessons for me to learn was like my first album, I took it to the label guy and I'm like, okay, this is a sequence. And he's like, no, this song that you have 10th needs to be the first song. Because this is going to be the single. And because we're entering, and we, at that time, we were just really entering, you know, iTunes and streaming and all of that. And he's like, you have to know that there are going to be thousands of people who click on this first track that never get any further than that. Like that's something you have to consider when you're putting this together, if you want it to be successful. Cause I was always of the mindset, like my thing was I'd want to start the album with a skit. You know? And he's like, no, you kind of have to earn that. Like you have to build that sort of trust with people where, you know, you can invite them into an experience that way. And they know it's going to be worth their time. Like you can't come out the gate doing that. And it blew my mind, you know? We compromised by, I took that 10th song and like put it second. Yeah. Cause I did have a song that I felt like this is the vibe of the album and I want to establish that. But instead of doing what I thought would be next, I put that song next. And it broke the sequence as far as I was concerned, but I do think it was a valuable lesson, you know? Did you feel, did it fuck you up doing that? Did you feel a little satanic or like, you know, like? I felt a little gross, you know? It felt a little gross. I think I ultimately ended up justifying and rationalizing it with the thought that it's still my song. It's not like I'm putting somebody else's song, you know? And it's still not first, you know? So like I did the things I had to do to wrap my head around it. But I didn't want to ignore his advice either because he had been putting out albums for years and he knew what he was talking about, you know? Right. Listen, I think there is something to be said for, we have to have some kind of respect for people with experience, you know? Like, hubris gets, it fucks you up so bad. And these people are like, generally have, have your like, success in mind because their success is linked to your success. Yes, exactly.

Thank you, Zip Recruiter. Now, I'm curious though about like your thoughts on the algorithm and on the way that technology is impacting, it's impacting the way we make stuff now. It's impacting the process. It's getting deep into our lives. What are your thoughts of that? To me, it seems kind of apocalyptic. It's terrible for me as a creator because I just wanna make what I wanna make and I don't wanna have to think about any of that, but it's the same as like when everything was physical, you wanted your album cover to have a certain pop, right? Yes. You wanted it to stand out on the end cap or wherever they would put it, you know, like. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I just did that thing where I said yes before even thinking about what you said. I've never put an album out and I don't know what an end cap is. But I think you know what I mean. Oh, I know what you mean. I just said yes too fast. Now I understand. Cause people are gonna hear me go yes, but like shut the fuck up, you don't know. What album have you ever put out? Shut up. But you know, I think the way I put it to you wasn't necessarily about having half the direct experience. We're trying to understand that you can, your album cover should be a reflection of your creative purpose in some sense. Yeah. And luckily, if it's really effective, there is a certain inherent pop to it, right? Right. But if you do one and it has, if it's bland and somebody told you it was bland, you might change it, you know? And it wouldn't necessarily feel like a betrayal of your creative idea. You would just want to do something to balance out your creative idea and like the retail effectiveness of this thing. And so I feel like thoughts about what factors affect the Spotify algorithm, what factors affect the YouTube algorithm. Like it is good to be aware of these things. Yes. But I guess it feels grosser in a way because we don't really know, you know? Like if you're dealing with the pop of an album cover, like your eyes are good to trust and your friends' eyes are good to trust and the label's eyes are good to trust because we know what we're trying to do is make something appealing and you get like a yes-no thing, right? Yes. But the algorithm, there's no yes-no, you know? Yeah. Like we kind of know the factors. We kind of know what we think can do, we can do to our products to make them more viable but we really have no idea and I think that's the scary part. Yeah. It's one thing to be trying to pull the levers in ways that you know you understand. It's another thing to try to pull your levers based on phantom information. Fuck. You know? Like it really feels a little worse to do that, I think. Yeah, it's like at least let us fucking collaborate and we can't collaborate if you don't share with us how this algorithm works. It's like you're offering a sacrifice to a God that you don't know its appetites, what it looks like, what it is just hoping and then maybe it gets accepted, maybe it doesn't. Either way, you're still confused at the end. Yes. Yeah. They gotta share this shit with us but they can't because it's like their great secret. If people figured it out, they'd fucking hack it. They'd exploit it. There's people who exploit it anyway though. Like there's people who make a lot of money on Spotify, just making tracks full of brown noise. Yeah, I heard about that. You know? And that's another thing. It's just messing with the algorithm. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Oh man, I had something else. I can't remember. Oh, well, we're getting to see to me this thing that we're talking about is spectacular in that we are having to contend with this brand new thing. In the history of art or creation, this is no one's had to figure out how to work with an artificial intelligence, a synthetic intelligence. And it seems completely counter to my understanding of making stuff. But have you ever thought about making an album specifically, not cheaply, not like the brown noise bullshit, but thinking of this new medium. And do you know of any people who are intelligently putting out stuff? And it feels weird to me when they, like they tell me what they're doing and why. And I get it, you know? Cause you just wanna, like it's weird, man. My retail example was from like thinking about going to the store and purchasing something. But now that like everything's on apps, it's like we live in the store. We're all in the store all the time. So like you want your product to be a top seller in the store, you know? And it's like, man, the thing I make music on is right here. And the thing I listen to music on is right here. Why don't I make it, you know, seamless? Why don't I make something that will pop on here, on the phone, from here, where I make stuff? But I don't know, man. To me, it echoes the same feeling I have when people ask me, do I think about who's listening when I make music? Cause there was a time when I did try to think about that. But the real answer is I'll never know who's listening. And I'll never know who's gonna come to the show and say, I love that song. It meant X, Y, and Z to me. There's no way for me to aim it, direct it, target it at anybody. So all that does is cause me to have thoughts that get in the way of anything I'm actually trying to do. And so to me, yes, you can make songs that the robots like. You can make a product that the robots like. And if that works, great. I think who I am and my situation economically when it comes to making music, how it's really just me, mostly, and people I get beats from. Like it's a two-man operation at most. Right. I'd rather put my chips on making the song that I want to hear. Yeah. You know, and if that ends, you know, if that doesn't please the robots, that's what I earn, is I earn the robots just pleasure. That's the fucked up art, man. To me, that's the great, that we live in a time period where you can seriously say, we need to please the robots. Listen, you gotta put that song at the beginning for the robots. What the fuck are you saying? Like just going back like 15 years, someone hearing that, they would think that their producer had gone nuts. Yeah. But I wonder, whenever I get to chat with an artist who I have a lot of respect for and who is making beautiful things, I ask some questions because that's inspiring. Whenever you put the kind of music you're putting out, people might like me get inspired because we think, oh, maybe it isn't at the end of the world. And oh, you know, maybe there is like, that things are turning around or something. It's a very powerful kind of magic. And then we think, I want to make something that good. And so we wonder to ourselves. And even though, I know it's an absurd question because everyone has a different thing. I have some real basic questions for you. Sure. Notebook, do you write stuff out or put it in your phone? Where do your ideas go? That's so interesting. Okay, so I was notebook for a long time and I had it in my head. It was always going to be notebook. And I have moved to computer notes. I don't like to do the phone thing. I like to do computer note and print it out and hold the paper when I record. That to me feels best. I don't like holding the phone. For some reason, my eyes don't track that naturally when I'm trying to like scroll and, you know, it's just, it's not, I don't know. I think it's asking my body to do different motor skills that I haven't practiced for this whole career. Right. But holding the paper feels right. I miss hand, I mean, I hand wrote lyrics for probably like my first six albums or six projects released, you know, and it's only the last like few I've gone at typing. I do miss handwriting some, but I have horrible handwriting too. So like there was definitely pros and cons either way. Yeah. Well, but when you don't have your computer around all the time, I mean, these, like, where are these ideas coming to you? What are you, where are you? I kind of am around my computer all the time. Oh, okay. I kind of am. And even when I'm not like it's my iPad or it's my phone, it all ends up on the computer. Gotcha. Yeah, I got you. You know, I'm constantly like feeling weird about I don't know a good centralized way of getting everything smashed together. I feel like a lockets left out. But when you're writing a song, how much of it, and again, I apologize. And for those listening who are big music fans, I apologize. Just, this is just, I'm illiterate about this stuff, but are you, how much of it is improvisation and other, how much of it are you doing at the mic in the moment and how much of it are you writing down beforehand? Man, like 95% of mine is written beforehand. But there's this thing, is it something somebody told me early on in music that it took me a long time to realize what they meant. Especially specifically with rap music, because there's written raps and there's freestyles, right? Yeah. I started out my whole career freestyling. So I freestyle for years before I ever wrote anything, but I wasn't making songs then. It was just me and people getting together and rapping. Like, that's what we did. Yeah. He told me that the best freestyle sound like written raps, and the best written raps sound like freestyles. Whoa. And it took me a long time to understand that, because I was always like, how can a written rap sound like a freestyle? Yeah. But then I realized it as I've gone through my career, because there was a time when I would write something and I would record it very robotically. Like, very like, let me nail each elicution of the syllable in this to the beat. Yeah. And that's just what it was, but in the way that an actor has to bring life to the words on the page, you learn in recording raps, you have to do that too. You have to infuse the written word with some sense of immediacy. Yeah. And for me, that immediacy, like the way I bring the energy I bring to it is like conversational. Like I like to think as if I'm saying these things to a person, you know, and they're hearing it for the first time. So like, so you're not hearing the fact that I've recorded this same part 15 times already. Right. Yeah. That's the feeling I get listening to your music, which is so wonderful. But now you must have the problem, a great problem of all these best friends you don't know. Like there's all these people who think you're their best friend. Do you know what I'm saying? You have an intimate connection to you who like, you know what I mean? That's for you. I do. I know exactly what you mean. And I haven't figured out how to balance it because like there's that sense that people come away with from the music and you have to multiply that with like the accessibility of social media, you know? Like, and I've never been, I've never been in a position where I can afford to be like reclusive. Right. I've always had to be the one out front pushing my product and engaging with people. So like, not only is there this sense that people know me from my music, there is also this sense that if you say something to me on Twitter, I am likely to respond. Yeah. You know? And so I think that does really build this, yeah, this intimacy, this sense that people know me. And like on my Patreon, I lean into that. And I actually try to like put, like I do a secret podcast just for my Patreon. You know what I'm saying? Where I like tell them like actual shit I'm going through. You know what I'm saying? Like and put it there. But I think that in some ways I have benefited from that sense overall in terms of having a career. But I think it costs something too, you know? And not even just in terms of my own mental health. I think like in terms of the value of my product, I think that I've seen a bunch of examples, especially in independent music, where the mystery brings all the value. Right. I have no mystery. I know what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, but you do. I mean, cause it's kind of like you can't help. Like I think if you're a really talented artist, you're always going to see mysterious because you know what I mean? Like it's just wild that anyone can even do that. You know, and so in that there's something really cool. But yeah, I think the archetype of the rock star is really changing, you know? And now if like someone's being all mysterious and not really interacting, I think there's a general suspicion that starts emerging where people are like, come on, who do you think you are? Like in the old days, not talking to people, it's like it's a rock star, what do you want? They're not going to talk to you, that's whoever the fuck. They're unreachable. Now it's like, okay, well, I guess you're, what are you, some kind of fucking rock star? Right, so it feels pretentious now. Yeah. But the thing about indie rap specifically is that, and I think this whole thing is informed by people having generally kind of low expectations of like the artistry of rap, because of that, a little pretense goes a really long way in indie rap. It really like, people get really excited when they can't see a person's face as a rapper. They get really, really excited about that. When it's like, whoa, who is this? Right. You know, like that's, and then all the think pieces come out and everybody's guessing. Like, you know, so being elusive inside of rap music, especially on the independent side, you know, there's some real benefits to it. Right. And when I say I don't have any mystery, I mean, I can't access that. Right. You know. I'm glad, I'm glad that you can't access that. I think that whole thing, no offense to everyone, who am I gonna offend? We don't know they are anyway. It doesn't matter. Ha, ha, fuck you. I don't know who you are. Ha, ha, ha, ha. But to me, that all forms of mask wearing musicians, to me, that seems just like a brilliant way to get an actor to go to your shows. You know what I mean? And not have to be there. You just play your music over the speakers and someone wearing the mask pretends to be rapping. Do you know anything about MF Doom? Yes, I've heard a little bit about this, where people were confused about yes, but could you talk about it a little bit? Okay, he's my favorite rapper of all time, like all time. He made the absolute best rap music for me, my personal taste that ever existed. He actually passed away late last year. He wore a mask, like inspired by Dr. Doom from Marvel Comics. After already having had an early part of his career in the 90s, where he was in a rap group as a very public figure whose face was out there, his brother ended up dying in an accident. His brother was in, he was in a group with. And then their record label shelved their album after that too. And so he just spiraled, became kind of like an alcoholic. And then he started showing up in New York at like open mics with his face covered, like with a stocking. And like doing these new songs that he had been working on like in his basement. You know what I'm saying? It was real raw, like throw away all the rules, sample, whatever, these new songs that were really exciting. And then from that point forward, he always wore this metal mask. And there was a time, I would say between like 2010, 2012, maybe, maybe a little earlier than that. He started sending an imposter to do his shows. He started sending a guy with the same physical build as him with the mask on to go do shows. And they would just be playing basically the song over the PA like you just described. And the guy would be holding the mic to his mouth and stomping back and forth on stage. I was at a couple of those shows, they were deeply upsetting, deeply upsetting. You knew? You knew it wasn't him? We knew once the show started, it wasn't him. You know what I'm saying? Like we bought tickets, we show up to the show and like, wait, this isn't him, you know? And it was upsetting. Come to find out later, not that this excuses it. He wasn't born in America. Yeah. And he'd never been naturalized. So he had gone to do a European tour and when he came back in, they wouldn't let him back in the country. And so he was deported to the UK when his family and shit was still here. And he decided that he wanted to collect all of those, collect all that show money for the next couple of years, even though he couldn't come back. So that's why he had sent the guy in his place. Fuck, that is the worst explanation. Just making money. I thought maybe he was doing a critique of identity. The end of the day, man, this is a hustle. It's a hustle. It's a hustle just like anything else is, you know? And he was in a position where it wasn't a bunch of other ways he could make money. So he put out records still. He put out records still and then for them a couple of years, he had somebody else doing the shows. Until that jig was up because people stopped booking him. Yeah, what the fuck? Yeah, you're like, when he shows up, you're like, take off the fucking mask, let's see now. Or talk to us between songs like a normal person. You could just start recording like just very generic things that you could say. But this makes me think of, I think, like one of the great emerging problems. Like it couldn't get worse for musicians as far as monetizing goes these days. I mean, you know, it seems like musicians are in a really brutal predicament. It's rough and it's fucked up. And it's one of those things where like people assuming history continues are gonna look back and be like, what the fuck? They were getting so exploited by these big companies. And like, this is the kind of thing where the government should be stepping in. And like, you can't just pay somebody, you know, five cents or whatever you're paying. Not even a penny. Not even a, you can't do that. That's insane, you can't do that. But that's where you're at now. It sucks, but like, I think it's gonna get worse in this deep fake stuff that we're looking at a time where like, and I don't mean like immediately, but 10, a decade max, where AI and AI is just gonna start where like someone's gonna be able to grab you, your voice and speak into a microphone, rapping as you and everybody's gonna have duplicates. And some of these duplicates, this is the part that fucks with my head. Some of these duplicates, they might get more successful than you. You know, it's the nuke, it's like soul, instead of copyright infringement, soul right infringement, you know, and so the power of identity is gonna get that much more diluted, you know? It's till like fame itself becomes an impossibility because anytime anyone becomes famous, triplets and multiple, zillions of them will suddenly appear everywhere. What do you think, how as an artist, like how can you protect yourself? What are musicians even doing to like get ready for this shit or to deal with the shit that's happening now? I think in a lot of ways, the people who are gonna be targeted by this technology that is probably gonna be very expensive, even though it's attainable, I think they're gonna go for the pop music first because that's gonna be the easiest to do. Like I think that the robot, when the robot start writing pop music, Taylor Swift, Keith Urban, maybe potentially, well not, definitely the singer songwriters, like they're in trouble then. Because the robots are gonna write great songs. And like, I don't, what I assume is that the rich people will come up with legal ways to protect themselves and maybe we can hide under those. Because those people, like there's a lot of people invested in those artists. Right. And them being successful in terms of them being a one to one person. Right. So I have faith that they will legally protect themselves. And I also think that like, there's a lot of artists you're gonna want to copy before you get to me. You know what I'm saying? Cause what's most likely to happen if you copied me is that you would make less money than me. You know what I'm saying? So I don't know if that's where you wanna put your chips if you're the robot rap pirates. You probably wanna go for Drake, you know? We'll see, I know, but I mean, this is the thing. I mean, you're, yes, I guess they're gonna go for Drake or whatever, but you'll see, people are gonna start copying you and I'm going to be one of them. No, I would. I totally would, man. See, that's the other thing. Like I get the liberation of the masked performer because, you know, I'm sure you feel this. Like there's times you want to do something completely different. Yes, absolutely. But you're trapped in your body. Everybody knows what you look like. Everybody knows what you sound like. And so it's like going in another direction. Like you have to either do like, I guess like what Bowie did. But you know. Yes, what's that fantasize about? We, every, like not just as an artist, but as a person, you know, just completely like, like getting out of your old life and starting a new life. So maybe part of what this technology could do is like, let us swap identities or something, you know? So it's like, you make podcasts for a few months. I'll make music for a few months and destroy your career. What happened to him? My podcast will explode. The narrative itself might be worth it for me. Oh, God. Because then I can take the story of it and make my next album about that. It's easy. It writes itself. It writes itself. But look, we have about 14 minutes. And this is another question that I love to ask. Artist I respect. Where do your, do you have any theories on where your ideas come from? You know, we talked about Robert Anton Wilson. Yes. On that other conversation that we had. And he's the one to introduce the notion to me that we might be receptors of like alien intelligence. And that all of our creativity could potentially be ideas from another place just filtered through our conscious minds. And there's part of me that thinks that's true. There's another part of me that deeply understands that every idea is just taking something and breaking it and reconstituting it in some other way. Cool. You know. And so like, especially with hip hop, that's where hip hop literally comes from. It's taking other people's songs and breaking them. And making them something else, you know. And that sort of repurposing is just so much a part of our creative landscape. Like we're doing a podcast now, which is something somebody else started, you know. And different people throughout time have repurposed this idea of recording a conversation all these different ways, you know. So I don't know. I think that I am keen to that idea of looking around for things to break, you know. And I'm also aware that sometimes entirely new things that don't exist pop into my mind and I don't know where they come from. Yeah. But it starts with breaking something. I think it ends with breaking something. Like even if it's a new idea, like, it's so hard to just introduce something completely novel into people's minds to let alone the marketplace of any kind. You know, it kind of always has to start with some reference point. Yeah. Totally. And I think at that point, you are breaking something. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck, that is so heavy. I don't think people understand that. I mean, in general, when they're thinking, like when we're thinking about how this process is working, it definitely doesn't involve, you know, there was a time where that was considered. Remember in the, there was a period, maybe I don't think it still exists. It'd be a musty take if it did, where people thought like hip hop was like theft, that the, that you were stealing from others and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I mean, it was like people losing power basically, right? But. I mean, people still think that. And honestly, there is a bit of truth to that. But the same bit of truth extends all over the place, like where there are scenes from movies that are shot for shot remakes of a scene from a different movie. And it's like, is that stealing? Is that inspiration? Like, is the scene itself copyrighted, even if there's different people and different lighting and different cameras capturing it? Like, it's really easy to take hip hop and look at it through a lens that says, this is the unacceptable kind of stealing. It's really easy to do that, you know, because you're taking a copyrighted work and putting it inside of another copyrighted work. And you have, and in some cases, especially early hip hop, they didn't do much to it. You know, they looped it or they put like extra drums over it, you know, so it's really easy if you're James Brown to be like, hey, that's my song, not gonna ask me nothing, you know? And James Brown's got a point, right? Because in some cases, part of what the appeal of the song is, is that James Brown wrote this really cool part of a song that people like listening to. Sometimes that's the appeal. So like, you do have to have a certain reverence for that, but I think the narrow view of it as straight theft really does hip hop a disservice and a lot of the creative in our world, you know? Well, it seems like a fairly neophyte perspective, you know, because anytime you read about the great artists, they're always like, oh, I'm a thief. The one, you know what I mean? They're always like, I steal those. I fucking steal stuff all the time. And they're shameless about it. And quite often they'll act like, what? What do you think there's an original, you're gonna make an original thing, go ahead. And comedy, it's different though. Because like, mother fuck, you can't steal a joke. You can't even like, even if you have the original idea, because a lot of comedy, you know, it's math. It's just math. So like, if you put two variables together, you know, probably you're gonna, there's a few similarities. Even if people are never meet, or they're gonna maybe say the same thing, to the point where if you, I've done jokes, and then like, realized, seen like a, I did a joke for the longest time. I hadn't seen Bill Hicks do it. And then I saw Bill Hicks doing the joke way, of course, better than, way funnier than my version of it. I thought she meant, of course, it was a long time ago. I didn't know if you were gonna say what was going on. No, it was like, no, it was a long time ago. It was also fucking up, it was Bill Hicks. So he's gonna write a better joke to me. But you know, all I'm saying is like, it's an easy thing to do it, but we try to avoid it. But this makes me wonder your take on honesty when it comes to writing too. Not honesty in the sense of like, copyright and all that bullshit, but honesty in the sense of like, there's like comedians who feel like they have to have had the experience before they write the joke. Oh gosh. And songwriting? I absolutely not. I think, and this is the thing, like, I think hip hop specifically suffers on a large scale from a lack of imagination. People think they have to be authentic to whatever they lived. Or they feel like they can only pardon, they can only embellish in a certain direction that plays into the expectations of certain lifestyles. We're like, I want hip hop to be about like dragons and you know what I'm saying? And magic snails. And like, I want this as a craft as a genre to be just as open as, you know, Lord of the Rings. Yeah. You know, like, so for me, my stance is always like, write whatever you want. You know, you shouldn't, I think maybe you shouldn't wrap as if you really have magic powers. If you don't really believe that maybe. Yeah. Like maybe you shouldn't try to sell truth as a lie. Yeah. But I'm all for the expansion past, like the truth of the material world and the time space that you live in. I want it to be as big to contain every possible perspective, realistic, fantastic, all of it, you know? Mike, please be friends with me. Of course, man. After this. Of course, man.

Sometimes it's hard to have a whip to brother. Got to share your dad. Got to share your love. Got to share the jam. Got to share the jelly with a screaming crown of thorns that grew in your mom's belly. All you need to understand, hand in able, is watch them treat your mother like a cow in the stable. And then they start screaming when you're watching with me. Turn the other cheek. No, fuck you, hippie. This is going to be so much fun. No. Mom and dad, what the fuck were you thinking? If life is a stage that I feel like I ain't Lincoln. And just like honesty, if I'm going to tell the truth, don't want to take it back with little John Wood's truth. Look at my great bitch, don't need another friend. That's a track from Christy McGill's new album, The Coolest Person on Mars, which is a limited edition orange vinyl dichronium printing from Onzar Delik Rex Records, which is the Serbian record company that recently caught on fire. This is a personal message to Amy Tansen. Your shower is ready. That's shower stall five. To the rest of you, welcome. You're listening to the DTFH, a podcast supported by the wizards of erectile tissue over at Blue Chew. Sometimes you'll hear people say with a strange kind of disdain, oh, you do boner pill commercials? Yes, I do. And not only do I do Blue Chew commercials, but also I take Blue Chew tablets because I like having a Jedi-like control over my penis. It makes me happy to know that this is one of the wonderful offerings of science. It has its roots in alchemy, and I'm sure it goes back even further than that. I don't care if it has its roots in the throbbing heart of some demon in the pits of hell. I would still take Blue Chew tablets because they are wonderful.

We thank Blue Chew for sponsoring the DTFH. Oh, yeah. Boner pill commercial, but we're back. Hello. How are you doing out there, oh, perfect being? I know what you're thinking, I'm not perfect. I'm fucked up in some way, probably. Maybe you got some nice secret guilt eating you alive. Specters of the past, wrathful spirits chewing on your amygdala every day, like it was some delicious fairground hot dog. If this isn't possession, I don't know what is. I don't mean literal possession, though. It wouldn't surprise me if there was some kind of hyper technological futuristic scaning mechanism that could show what dark spirits had attached themselves to your aura. I'm going to have a few. When I was a kid, I tried to jerk off with a Ouija board. It's a long story, maybe for a different podcast. Why wouldn't I have spirits? Why wouldn't any of us have spirits if you've never gotten stoned and gone to a graveyard? I actually was friends with somebody who ran a graveyard. And one of the big problems of running a cemetery just underneath the screams of the peacocks is you will have to goffs humping on all your graves at night. You've got to send somebody through there every 30 minutes just to shake the goffs off the graves because they're all on the graves, sucking dicks and fucking and getting cum splattered all over the tombs. You've got to send someone into the morning with Windex and paper towels to wipe all the gothges off your graves. But at some point, you probably got a spirit in you. You probably got some kind of demon in you. Just some creature, some weird psychic entity that likes to float around in your aura. I'm not talking about those things, though. Whenever I consider my demons, I imagine they're probably pretty cool not to pat myself on my astro back or anything like that. But what are we going to do? Like kick out the demons? Is a tree going to kick out the birds living in it? Do you want your grass to kick out the worms? No. They can hang out in whatever weird psychic biosphere that you've produced by existing itself. I don't think the demons are the problem. If you're one of those people who's really hard on themselves all the time, I would imagine that your demons are probably feeling bad for you. And I'm like, geez, you're wonderful. I love living inside of your chakras. It's wonderful in here. It's great. I love eating your fear. Anyway, the point is, if you want to have some fun, if you really want to do something revolutionary, if you really want to stand in the face of the void and do something that is completely counter to most everything we've been indoctrinated by in the West, just allow yourself a minute, just a minute of imagining that you are perfect. You know how I know you're perfect? Because I got kids now. And my kids are perfect. I love them. They're perfect. They're beautiful, perfect things. And you are one of them once. Yeah, you mutated. You got old. Your hair is falling out, whatever. You're greasy now. But you are perfect in there. There's a perfect little beautiful, adorable thing that is perfect. That's what you actually are. That's what happens when you die. That's where you go. That's where you already are. You're just like a beautiful, perfect, three-dimensional, temporal entity sticking its way out of the Garden of Eternity. And something about that creates a phase where you start thinking, I suck. I'm fucking horrible. What are you talking about? Anyway, a minute. That's all you got to do. A minute. It's a game of make-believe. Just pretend with me for a minute that you're perfect. Just see what happens when the alarm systems that have been woven into your consciousness start going off. Oh, God, we're doing some kind of weird spiritual thing. No, we're not perfect. What are you talking about? I've got sagging nips and my balls stink. I've got weird ears. My hair is the wrong color. If you see my bank account, do you realize my tax burden? All those alarms. Just forget about them for a second and experience the divine reality that you are perfect, that none of that stuff can affect you at all. Just a minute. OK, we're back. You can start fucking hating yourself again. That wasn't even a minute. But I just love doing that from time to time, just because it's wild how many crazy things I have inside of me that will instantaneously reject that experiment. Try it. Do it every once in a while. Fuck your cool friends who roll their eyes. Just do it every once in a while and see what happens. You might get a tiny little mini vision of paradise and then get this strange, swooning sense of like, wait a minute, I almost remembered something. I don't know what that thing is that you almost remembered because I've forgotten it too. But that experiment is well worth doing these days as we enter in to the summer of fucking. By the way, I want to invite all of you to join my Patreon. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. I am sad to say that I read. I'm sure you probably read about this. This is actually. Well, I have nothing to do with it, so it doesn't matter. But yeah, I guess like a few people have been getting attacked by like mid-sized animals now, not just little ones anymore. And my attorneys, again, they just want me to say, obviously, that I have no way. I have no control over this. And there is no connection between people who subscribe to my Patreon and people who haven't been attacked by animals, formerly small animals, like chipmunks and squirrels. Now I'm hearing about like mid-sized animals. It's not it's no longer like these like annoying bites. Maybe you got to get a rabies shot now. I guess like some people were attacked by hyenas and a monitor lizard apparently snapped off a few fingers from somebody. Look, I have nothing to do with it. It's not a threat. Obviously, it'd be crazy if I was saying, which I'm not, that like we do have a device here that like essentially sends out pulses that make animals aggressive to people who aren't on my Patreon, that'd be nuts. But if I did have a thing like that and I suddenly realized that it was kind of like beginning to control bigger animals that could potentially like maim someone or even worse. And then I realized that I can't unplug it because it doesn't have a plug. It's just this glowing stone somebody gave me when I was on a hike. That would be bad, actually. I'd probably be freaking out a lot about that because I really initially didn't want anyone to get more than like a little nip, like a cute little it's cute, like a chipmunk. And not that they told me this, but if they did tell, they did tell me like in whatever this is, I'm not saying they actually said it, but it could be that they may have said, look, don't worry, yeah, it'll only do little animals. And then they went back into the woods and gave me this stone. I don't know how to turn it off is what I'm saying. It doesn't exist, but if it did exist, I don't know how to turn it off. And it seems to be affecting bigger animals now. So please subscribe to my Patreon. It's patreon.com. You're going to get commercial free episodes of this podcast. You are not going to get a guarantee that you won't be attacked by these animals that are getting bigger. And I mean, how big could it even go is the thing? I should have, what if it, what if it starts affecting bears? But it doesn't matter. That's all just silly, gobbly goop, gobbly goop, gobbly goop. If you go to patreon.com. You will be able to hang out with us two times a week. And by us, I mean your DTFH family. An assortment of some of the most brilliant, revolutionary spiritual geniuses that ever plotted upon the sweet land. They're all waiting for you, your family, at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. All right, friends, with us here today is the brilliant Chris Gethard. Maybe you've seen his awesome show, the Chris Gethard show. Maybe you've read some of his great books. He's got a new comedy special coming out called Half My Life. It's coming out on June 1st, on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Peacock, and many other streaming services. He also co-hosts his podcast, New Jersey is the World, and he is doing an upcoming standup tour along with a tour of his other podcast, which is fucking awesome, beautiful, anonymous. You gotta check it out. He just has these sometimes very poignant conversations with anonymous people. He is a wonderful person, and it was really a joy to get to spend this hour or so chatting with him. So everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, Chris Gethard. Did you ever think you'd have a kid? I wondered for a very long time, I was not necessarily a very stable person for a lot of my life, and I was really worried about passing on that mental instability. It's like still my great fear. But I remember, I forget who said it, I wish I remembered who said this to me, because I was once expressing this, you know, once I started hitting my mid-30s, later 30s, start to think about it, talk about it with some friends, and a friend of mine was like, no, you don't understand, like if your kid ever suffers from the same stuff you do, you're never gonna judge him. Like he's never gonna be scared to talk to you. And I was like, oh, that's eye-opening, you know? Like, which I think is true for any parent no matter what the deal is. It's like, if you've been through something hard and you're praying your kid doesn't go through it, of course, I hope that's the case, but it's gonna go a lot better for them than it went for you, because you've got that empathy now and you've got that open door now. And that made me realize maybe this is something I wanna try, you know? You feel like you weren't able to talk to your folks about some of the stuff you grappled with? No, for sure. That's another thing that popped into my head that I was interested in asking you about as I realized we're so in tune on this, like my relationship with my own parents has very much changed. Especially my dad. I understand my dad a lot more now. And I also am kind of, I have to resist feeling some jealousy about the way he treats my son compared to how I was raised. Like the grandparent role very different. And it's hard not to go, where the hell were you, my whole childhood? This cuddly, soft man rolling around on the floor. My parents were incredible, but I mean like hard, you know, hardworking people. My mom's parents were immigrants. My dad was the hardest working person I've ever known. His whole thing is like you work hard and solve your shit. And that's cool. And I get some elements of that that work well for me. And then other times where I always felt maybe very vulnerable opening up, you know, like, I remember I've broken a bone once in my life. And this tells you a lot, this tells you a lot. My brother and I were wrestling on our front lawn and he landed on me and his knee broke my left collarbone. Oh, shit. So I was like screaming on the front lawn. And my mom came out and was like, what are you yelling about now? I said, I think I broke my shoulder. She goes, you did not. You're always being a baby. And it was Super Bowl Sunday. We wound up going over to these other family we're friends with to their house. And me and my brother got in another fight and it was a few hours later. And my parents saw us fighting and went, Chris isn't swinging with his left. I think something really is wrong. Like, like that's how they knew. Like everything was like tough it out, you know? And that wasn't just them that was growing up in the 80s and 90s. That was growing up in a blue collar neighborhood that was growing up in a family that wasn't too far removed from getting off the boat. Like all those facts, a lot of it is just you'd be tough. You handle it. And I always laugh at that one of like, the only reason they believed I broke a bone was because in the next fight I was, I was be hobbled. See, oh yeah. Well, do you, for me, when I'm looking back on what these days would basically be called neglect? Like if your parents had been one of these like, you know, any variety of social media family, there's a million of them. And that was something that we're filming, you know? And they were like, oh, he really did break his collar. Oh, shit, he's not swinging. Can't, that's an insta cancel. That's like, probably child protective services is going to get involved too. Back then? Back then. No way. No way. No fucking way. When I think of like, you know, we go to the pool with my kid now and I'm like, you know, I don't take my eye off of him. Cause he's just learned, this is, I don't know, if you've gone swimming a lot with your kid yet. Yeah, yeah. He loves the water. My, my child has just figured out how to jump into the pool, but he doesn't know how to swim. So it's like the worst part of the company. You gotta watch. But when I was a kid, his age, probably younger, they just put the fucking floaties on you and pushed you out of the ocean. Not the ocean, I'm sorry, the pool. The ocean, my parents didn't do that, but you know what I mean? Like I remember I was floating in the pool and a kid pulled, like some kid just swam up to me, a little fucking pool bully and pulled out the thing that holds the air in. Tried to kill you, tried to drown you. Watching like some kind of serial killer as I'm looking at the thing going out of air, trying to signal to my mom, she's not looking at me. The point is we are in different times. A lot of us are raising our kids differently. Is it bad? You think it's bad? Should we, are we being too soft on our children? I don't think so. I think a lot about it because I take a lot of value in how I grew up, but I just moved back to New Jersey where I grew up. I was in New York City for 16 years and I've been reconnecting a lot with a lot of people I grew up with and I always figured like, you know, like we're in entertainment. Our job is to exaggerate to a degree. Our job is to boil it down to the interesting parts and just hammer those, right? And so I'm always like, I'm probably remembering this wrong. I probably wasn't as intense as I remember. Everyone I grew up with is like, yeah, it was dark, man. It was dark and weird and hard and so many of my friends were like, I've spent years unwrapping. Like, I was born in 1980 and people around that time remember like, we literally, there were like pictures of kidnapped kids on milk gardens and we stared at them every time you had milk. You stared at a kidnapped child. Oh, fun. You know, and your parents would, your parents would just, you'd get home from school and they'd be like, go ride your bike and go somewhere. I don't want you in the house. Come back by six for dinner. Also, there's probably, you know, and then everything you hear is rumors about Satanists and molesters, like everything was like dark and they had us so scared. So I don't want that for my kid. I don't think that that's soft for him to not have that. I also do take some value and I think, especially for like a mild-mannered emotional guy, to actually have, to keep wanting to pursue a career where you never get health insurance. Being a comedian is not hard. Like, I'm not a coal miner, but it's uncertain. Yeah. For stress. I gotta be tough on some level. And the way I keep thinking of it is I'm like, I don't want my son getting in fights. I gotten too many fights growing up. I want him to know how to fight. And the way I keep thinking of it is I'm like, I want him to know how to fight. So if he ever comes around a corner and sees some kid getting beat up by three nasty kids, he can get on that guy's team. You know what I mean? I want him to be able to step up when he has to, but I just don't want him to have to all that often. Right. Yeah. I don't know how you feel. Sit. That one's a lot to unwrap. It's a lot. Well, I always feel like I have to be careful because I had a PTSD, Vietnam dad. So if I, you know, so I have to watch out because I'm going to overcompensate in the other direction. And then then I'm not going to give him what he, what any toddler needs, which is like actual structure. You don't get to be their friend. You've got to like tell them what's safe and what isn't. And just what you're saying, you know, get them ready for a world that is whether they're comics or not uncertain. By the way, that does make me think. Is there some like dad part of you that watches him or listens to the way his sense of humor or like thinks I would like him to be a comedian? I mean, that it's like, there's, there's a part of me that's like anything but. Yeah. This like. Yeah. Especially, especially right now, where it feels like comedy's getting kind of like more clickish than it's been in the time I've been doing it. And people actually seem kind of like angry at each other and you start to see like, oh, it's like so weird. It's always been a weird culture to be a part of it. And it's starting to feel like very much so now. But then there's also a part of me that goes, he makes me laugh for real. And he knows he's trying to make me laugh and he's doing it. Yeah. And not even, there are times where it's, I'm not in the mood to laugh. Like I'm not sitting there trying to connect with him that way and he'll make me laugh. And I go, man, that's, how cool is it? How cool would it be to just have a funny kid and see him go for it and do it? Like it's part of me that thinks it would be real cool. And then there's a part of me that's like, cause my wife's an artist too. So I'm also like, man, maybe, maybe he'll just like want to be a black sheep and rebel against us, which in our house means he'd have to go like get a stable salary job with a 401K. I know. And security. That's the rebellion we're going to get. That's what we're going to get probably. I mean, if you just look at the way kids push back, like I, I didn't want to be a comedian. I just ended up being a comedian. I don't know. It was all just some trying to get away from my folks. And then, you know, just, I got lucky. I got lucky, lucky. But I wanted to, this is kind of diverging from the kid talk. I think it's really interesting that you married the head music, head musician on your show. And I, and I, if my podcast is generally not like some kind of gross TMZ Inquisition or some shit like that, but I was just thinking, how did that go down? Like, how did the romance start? What season did it start? And did you try to hide it from people in the beginning? It's supposed to be a mattress, not a Jackson Pollock canvas, not a Rorschach test of body sweat. You need a new mattress. You need a purple mattress. I want to thank Purple for supporting this episode of the DTFH. And look, I know you've been ear beaten to your limit with weird mattress promises during the summer. Weird mattress promises during this horrific, uncomfortable pandemic. But my friends, I can assure you that if you are seeking comfort, Purple is your destination. They sent me a purple pillow and I was fully prepared to be purply disappointed because we have had our hearts broken with the promises of mattress mongers. But I received this pillow. It's amazing. It's like something out of Star Trek. It's bouncy. Feels like it has some kind of levitating particles inside of it. It is actually, quote, futuristic. I don't know another way to describe it. It's present-ristic, I guess, because it already exists. But you deserve a better, awesome, supernatural-level mattress. The purple grid, it circulates air. So you're not on a frying pan-style mattress like some sad nightmare-racked bit of bacon. It actually cools you down. And it's not like memory foam, which remembers everything. Purple is just comfortable and nice and you deserve it. The pandemic is ending. Get rid of that old pandemic, anxiety, sweat, soaked sponge of doom. And replace it with a purple mattress. Purple really is comfortable for an uncomfortable world. And right now, you'll get 10% off any order of $200 or more. Go to purple.com slash dunkin' 10 and use promo code Dunkin' 10.

Well, the wild part is that she was in a band that I genuinely loved years before I ever met her. I was a legitimate fan. She's in this punk band called The Unlovable. She wrote all the songs, sang them, and they're great, like great songs. And had the album, bought it at the Virgin Megastore and really admired her and had seen her live a couple of times and just thought she was so cool. And then back in the day, so my old talk show started at UCB. It was like a midnight show. And it was a really hot ticket. And it was a, I looked back and that show was dark and like violent and then like, but interesting. And like breaking the fourth wall and part times where the audience was like, I don't know what's going on. And she was, the house band at that time was all these friends of hers from the punk world. And they used to sneak her into the show because it would be, it would be sold out pretty regularly. And I started realizing that's Halle Unlovable. She's here watching this show. So she kind of knew my comedy. I knew her music and there's a funny story. One time I wound up naked on stage hosting the show due to some dumb bit gone wrong. Wow. And I was like, Wait, I'm sorry, accidentally naked? Like you didn't know you would be naked before the show? We were doing this thing called the telethon of shame. We were raising money for the March of Dimes. The whole idea was we're going to have all these like fucked up things. And if the crowd kicks in enough money, it'll trigger those things. So like, it was wild, man. Like people would be shut cause I think I have this reputation as this like emo guy and this nice guy. And I think there's a lot of truth to that. But also like, I've had some stretches that were dark. Like one of the things was like a guy ate a hot dog out of another guy's butthole. Like really dark. A guy drank his own pee. Like it was like the telethon of shame. Like everything was shameful. I said 500 bucks. I'll host the rest of the show with no clothes on. Wait, I'm sorry, man. You know what you just said? You just said a guy ate a banana. A hot dog. A hot dog out of his own butthole. Out of someone else's butthole. Okay. I'm sorry. Cause what happened is my brain was trying to process all this. And somewhere in there, I did a fake like, yeah. The way I said it was like, yeah, of course. Like that old stage act where the, can you and I, can you maybe like, how do you put the hot dog in the butt? So they had the hot dog and when it hit the monetary value. What was the monetary value? I forget. It was high though. Cause that was one of the craziest ones. It was high. Over a thousand. Probably five or 600. Okay. This guy, the one guy pulled down his pants. He laid down on a table face down. The other guy took out some witch hazel that he bought at the drug store and some cotton balls. And he sanitized his asshole. And then he placed that. He didn't put it up his butt like a dildo. He placed it in between the cheeks. Like the cheeks were a hot dog bun. Cool. That's, that's, that's a, yeah. And then he ate it out of that. Like his butt, like his butt cheeks were a hot dog bun. And he, I don't think, I mean, witch hazel, huh? Like, is that going to really work? That seems like a kind of old wives tale. I have no idea why he didn't go with rubbing alcohol. It seems like a safer bet, but that was actually the most degrading part. I guess that's true, but you don't want to eat witch hazel either. I'm butting butt. Like it. Like sweaty, sweaty. Like you're nervous. Cause if I had that happening to me, I'm going to be nervous. Like if someone's eating a hot dog on my butt on stage, it's going to be a sweaty. And there's like hot lights on it. It was, it was really disturbing. It was, and there were like a bunch of disturbing things that happened in that show. But we raised, I always justify, cause we raised nine grand for the March of Dimes in like an hour and a half at an, you know, at like a little theater. So in the course of that show, where all this completely horrible stuff is happening, I'm naked. I turn around, I see Halle sitting behind the drum set cause the band snuck her in and that's where she sat. And we made eye contact. And she says that I just looked at her and went, oh no, you're here. And then got back to all this and it's shown. That's the first time we spoke. So then their singer, when we switched over to being a public access TV show, their singer left for Canada. So they needed a new singer. They brought her in. She wound up being on the show for like seven or eight years. And we were a public access TV show for 200 episodes. And that thing was a labor of love. And I think a lot of us felt like there was something special happening. And it's wild cause like, I have another friend who was on the show. He proposed to his girlfriend on the show on public access TV. I was the reverend at his wedding. He was the reverend at mine. Another two cast members of the show are married. They're about to have their third kid. We had our first kid. I have another friend. I can think of another guy who met his wife on the show. And a whole bunch of people. Actually, yeah, probably five or six married couples that met through the show. So, you know, it was a public access show. So it wasn't some like civius thing of like, oh, you're dating the band leader, that scandal. It was more just like, we all really feel like we're onto something here. And I think when you get in like a collective environment like that, that really feels like everyone's on the same page. You're hanging out all the time outside of the show. And it was much more organic than like scandalous. You know, I love what you said on Nikki Glaser's podcast that you had this realization, the whole like comedian pursuit of the sitcom thing was to feed your own ego. And it wasn't even something you wanted to do. You'd gotten vacuumed up into that classic LA trap where people just look at what has been successful for other people, you try to replicate that. If you get on a show, you realize this is never what I wanted to do. And I just thought it was really beautiful, man, because you decided to just dive into public access and listen to what your own heart wanted you to do. I'm assuming, and look what it did. It brought a kid into the universe. It's true. It's true. I look at the kid, I go, it's all worth it. Cause you know, I do have insecurity. I do wonder, you know, I had an agent who soured on me and kind of gave up on me. Cause every year I'm going, I don't want to go to pilot season. I want to stay here and do a public access TV show. And they're going, what are you talking about? Like it's public access TV, but I just knew I was on to something. And sometimes I still wonder, would I be more, especially, I'm sure you feel the same way, especially having a kid now. I have a kid, a mortgage. I go, some stability would be nice. Right. I am very proud of everything I've done and I've gotten to live a cool life. But this pandemic year is the first year in like 15 years that I didn't get health insurance through one of the guilds. And I just go, well, there's not going to be another pandemic, I hope for, you know, the last one was a hundred years ago, but that was eye opening. It was eye opening to go, oh, I had one year where things went really wrong and now I got to scramble and try to get health insurance again. Like that's scary with a kid. So sometimes I go, man, maybe I should have done the more traditional stuff. And then I step back and go, I think the stuff I did was like cooler and more me. And I've never, I've never managed to bust out in a big way. Even when we got to true TV, it was their lowest rated show I think ever. Okay. But the people who did like it loved it. You know, the people who did find it loved it. You have the fever and all comics get it. And I remember when I, so I used to be the talent coordinator of the comedy store and I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm sorry if it sounds like that. You got the plague, man. But you do. I remember when I first got the comedy store, young comic talent coordinator. And I remember talking to one of the Sklar brothers and sincerely saying to him, how does it feel to have made it? And he goes, what are you talking about? You know, like we haven't made it. What is that? What do you even mean? And like, you know, my wife, I told her I was interviewing you and she was like, holy shit, how'd you get an interview with him? And so that's the funny thing is, I think what's weird about the job is that you end up having all of these successes that other people look at and think, my God. It's like, you know, that's an apex comic. That's a comic who's had, you know, three seasons of the show and before that, like a public access show, which by the way, public access show is a fucking show. Attaching the whole access thing is so weird anyway, but all I'm saying is, when will you feel, you know, when will you feel like, okay, I did it? Well, one of the greatest things that ever happened to me is years ago, I had caught some momentum. It was starting to move. It hadn't broken yet, but I was in a green room at the UCB in New York. And there were two guys off in a side room and they didn't realize I had arrived and they were talking loud. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop. And one of them's going, man, I don't know if I'm gonna get fired. I'm not sure what to do next. If I back myself into a corner, the other guy's going, yeah, you know, I'm trying to figure out should I move my family from LA because if they get here and then I get fired, I'm gonna have to move them back in the school year and this and that. And I'm listening to these two guys and one of them was on Saturday Night Live at the time and like years deep into a great run, the other guy was a correspondent on The Daily Show at that moment. And I had to, I was so sad for their stress. I'm not saying I liked that they were stressed, but I sat there and went, I figured those are the jobs that put out the fire. And I had this moment where I went, no job is ever gonna make me feel better. A professional accomplishments, don't do it. Like I, there's some things about me that are broken and jobs aren't gonna fix them. So I gotta get that out of my head and I gotta find some other ways to fix them that are more about who I actually am as a human. Cause it's just very, it's very tied into capitalism and this idea. One of the things right now that I've really had to take a deep breath on is like, what 2016 and 2017 for me, I had a TV show, I got a book deal, I had an HBO special, my podcast blew up. So all these things happened within like 18 months of each other. So I made more money than I ever made. And now right now I'm making about one sixth of what I made in 2017. And then I take a step back, I go, this is a pretty healthy living I'm making today. If that two year stretch never happened, I'd be thrilled. But in America, we are trained from the jump to go, oh, if you make less this year than you made last year, you're doing something wrong. I don't buy that, I don't buy that, but it's hard not to feel it, you know? You have to go, man, I'm making like 18% of what I made five years ago. And let's say, cause five years ago, your life went insane, your life went insane five years ago. So that's another thing to loop it back to having a kid is I've had all these really beautiful moments with him cause I was a real workaholic too. And just go, go, go figure it out. And then I got this new house and I spent all the TV show money on the house, you know? And it's a pretty nice neighborhood. Now we're like the poorest people in the neighborhood cause I took, it's like I made the money and I can buy the house and now I got to try to keep the house. And it's in a great school district and I play with my son in our yard. And like I mow the lawn and he gets out his toy lawnmower and he thinks he's helping me. And that's the type of thing where I go, you got to remember that this is why you fought so hard for so long. Not so you could be famous, not so you could have more money than you had last year. The reason you fight hard is to watch your son push a fake lawnmower on the lawn. And that sounds cheesy, I know. No, it doesn't, not to me. I really think a lot of us would just be really well served to redefine the conversation about success and money and how they relate to each other and how they relate to happiness because over and over again, I'm like, I stress so much, I step back and go, man, I had my TV show and that special and I wrote three books and I did this and that and that was all before I was 40. And then I'm gonna sit here and still feel bad, fuck that, like that's because of money, that's because of ego. There's something wrong with a system that induces that much stress in a situation like, yeah. Your underwear looks like you're off the tomb, smells like funyons, looks like gloom, the pandemic's over and your underwear is too, time to put on some new meandies. This episode of the DTFH was supported by meandies.

Do you know that you listen to the right-wingers, you know, bugling about how communism wants to destroy the family? But when you think about what capitalism naturally does to a lot of families, which is it instills that thing you're talking about in one or both parents, they go out in the world, drop their kids off at some, whatever they could afford and that they don't live near their parents and they don't get the lawn mower time. They don't get that at all. It's a special occasion if they find themselves having an extended meaningful time with their kids. And so that to me is, I hear you and I, I think we're feeling it. I think collectively that realization is bubbling up in a lot of us, which is what the fuck is the point? Is the point to like just get infinite amounts of money when my experience with that sort of success has been cliche as it can get, which is like, what do you know? It didn't do anything. I still feel as disturbed as I felt when I was living in a fucking roach motel with roaches crawling on my face. It was, oh, it didn't work. The thing like literally on walls of beach houses, money won't make you happy or that classic thing. When you really experience it, it's a little unnerving, but it's unnerving when you really, when you understand that at any level, just as like, fuck, then why? And don't get me wrong, I feel lucky that I made money. I feel lucky that it allowed me to buy this house. Like I understand the bend. I don't want to sit here and be like, I'm talking in one breath about how I bought a nice house and the next breath about how money is like and is like a thing that causes nothing, but insecurity and pain. Like I get that that's trying to have it both ways, but I do think that there's a lot of value in knowing when to say like, enough is enough. And I might be there and maybe, maybe I'm allowed to like enjoy plateauing it right here and not having to kill, I don't want to work until I have a heart attack and drop dead, but I don't do it. I don't want to, I don't want, I love going on the road. I love it so much, but like, I don't need to go out 150 days a year and not see my kid for half the year, you know? Like I don't want to die in a fucking Lakita Inn on the side of a highway in Fort Worth, Texas, you know? Like I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. Like, so I'll make less money. I'll tour less. I'll go out tour 25% less. I'll make 25% less money from my touring schedule. And that's okay. And that's okay. Floating into the void with all these other touring comics who happen to die on the same night as you, like, were waving at each other as you go into whatever the next thing is. I get it. I mean, yeah, I think that there had, I mean, I love touring too. I, yeah, there's no way that I'm going to do anything like that ever again with Mike. I'm not going to do that. I mean, if I do do it, I'm going to figure out a way to bring them with me. But look, have you seen that new, this sounds like a complete bullshit non sequitur. Have you seen that new pink documentary? I have not. My wife loves pink. My wife was just saying earlier today, no joke. We got to see pink live sometime. And I was like, what? Where is this coming from? I'm, you see, we were just on a beach vacation and somehow we ended up watching a music awards show which talk about like, for me, I'm 47. For me, that was just like, okay, I'm definitely not cool anymore. Like, I don't know any, I just found out about the fucking weekend. My wife was telling me like, it's like, oh, I've heard this song, actually it's pretty good. Yeah, I think he's got a shot. But yeah, so we're watching pink. And my wife was like, I love pink. She teared up a little bit. And I had to, you know, swallow down whatever my stupid anti my pink opinion or whatever. Cause like, am I going to judge someone who's doing like trapeze acts while seeing belting out music in key? But so then we watched the documentary in the very beginning of it. And we stopped just cause like, in no offense to pinker, that is that way of being. But it just starts off just taking her kid to Paris. Her family's there. And she just said to her kid, maybe you'll get a music agent or maybe you'll get a record deal. And it hurt me cause I was like, you want your kid to get a record deal? Like that's a kid. Like you don't want a record deal for the kid. I think she may be just joking a little bit or whatever. But you know what I'm saying? I think that is what you, if you want to be the parent that continues the career, it's either separate from your kids or take them, take them on the road with you on your tours and stuff. And that seems kind of tough on a kid. Yeah, I'm trying to go out like, not more than three days in a row, maybe once or twice a month. And just go, just do the math, right? Here's how much my mortgage and bills are. Here's how much I'm making from other things. Here's how much the road should do. And just make it all about the kid. You know, it's, I think it's funny to, I think about, like we were, you're saying about that with pink and how weird it feels to say the music contract. Do we want our kids to be comedians? And I sit around and I go, I get like giddy thinking about all the options. Like, cause my wife is an artist too. And I'm one of the rare comedians I know where her career is actually so weird that I'm the more normal one. I've had the more normal career doing what I do. And I did a, I earlier described a show where a man ate a hot dog out of another man's asshole on stage. Like, and I have had the more normal career. So I sit there, I go, maybe he'll be like the weirdest artist ever. Maybe he'll turn around and be like, I want to be a welder. I want to get a union card and be a weld. And I'm like, I get giddy thinking about either option. You know, that's, you want to be an electrician or do you want to go be a circus clown? Like I'm, I'm so psyched to see what it turns into. How do you feel? I don't think I asked you about the kid in comedy question. Oh yeah, I, look, I can't, any, anything he does, I think is funny or it seems like, oh shit, like just what you're saying, like you are definitely, he, he was at his grandmother's house and there was a monkey on the screen and he pointed to the monkey and said, that's daddy. That's daddy. Wow. You know, I heard about that. That is really, really, really funny to me. That, and then when I asked him about it, I'm like, did you say that I was a monkey to Nana? And he goes, he looks at me and he goes, no, no. Like it was awesome. Just what you would do with a smile on his face. Yes, but you know, no, I don't, I mean, like, I feel, I feel like part of the parent, the parent I want to be is just what, just what you're talking about, which is not hanging some role on them, but you know, listening to what they like and trying to tune into that as much as I can. Cause, you know, yeah, I don't, I think it's brutal if like, and really like pretty musty to like try to get your kid to do whatever you do. I mean, that's pretty, that's almost as unoriginal as you can get parents. Like name, no offense if you did, but naming your child after yourself, you know, what is that? I did not. Yeah, I did not do that. Is this an echo of me? Am I sending just me's through down through time? I want you, one thing I love about your comedy is that you have, you're definitely just doing your own thing. And that's not a diss on any other comments, but you, you, you have gone your own way and you've made it work for better or for worse. Yes. For best. I think for, from my perspective, for better because, and I know that's a secondary consideration to your perspective, because you're you. I know, I think for better overall, yeah. Overall, yeah. Better, cause we have you, we have your art out there. And, and, and also it's like, you know, I think a lot of people need to see that you can make it happen with what you've got. You don't need to like fit into the stereotypical, whatever the thing may be, you know, and that you can do a public access show that does get success and that you can listen to your own heart and end up in a nice house that you bought with money from your, from your art. I mean, that's fucking nuts, man. It's, it's, I, I take a deep breath and I, I understand how hard I worked and I understand how lucky I am. And outside of any stress or stereotypical comedian anxiety, I go, I took this further than I thought I would. And that's a beautiful thing. But I got a, I, I want to know if you wrestled with, I think this was your third book, you published it in 2018. I want to know if you wrestled with writing a self help book. Like if you felt this comedian death. I'm going to tell you something that I do not think has gone on record publicly yet, which is, so I did my HBO special about depression and a publishing company came to me and said, we want to write, we want to publish the book version of it. And I said, you know what? I've been kind of living in this, I've been working on this show for a bunch of years. I did it off Broadway and then I did it at that Edinburgh festival and now the HBO special. I'm getting messages about all the time. I said, it's really flattering, but I don't, I don't want to live in the depression forever. I don't want to be the depression guy. And I don't want to commodify it any further. Like I think I've said what I want to say about it. And, and it was hard. And then they turned around and said, well, we'll let you write about whatever you want for the same amount of money we offered. Wow. And it was, they were self-help imprint. And it was a constant struggle for me to figure out how to balance it needing to be self-help because of who they were, while trying to turn it into something I like. And I don't think it landed 100%. But I'll tell you another thing. This is the part that nobody knows. And it's kind of dark, which is, it's the only career choice I've ever made where the money was the priority. And I've made money off of other things and I'm happy about it. But like the TV show, we were on public access for years. And I had situations where like one network told me if you fire the rest of the cast and hire, like basically the short end of what they were saying was if you hire hotter people than your friends, I was like, nope, I don't care how much you're offering me. So I'd, I'd stood my ground on some things like this. But I had a situation where there was a family member of mine who had a series of mounting and really severe medical bills. And it was an amount of money where I went, this will allow me to help solve a situation that has been very bad and is getting worse. So I sit there and sometimes I go, man, cause the book didn't sell well. I think for a lot of people who are my fans up until then, that book maybe, maybe in their eyes was when I jumped the shark a little bit for some of the old school, like public access, punk rock vibe fans. Oh, did you get feedback that said that? You got some punk rock fans say, what's going on with this book? Well, the title of it was lose well, which is a phrase that kind of said randomly one night on my TV show about like, our job is not to figure out how to be winners cause everybody, like we're a publicized TV show, we're clearly losers. So let's just get good at that and lose well. And I saw some people going, man, like I have that phrase tattooed on my body and now it's the title of a self-help book, you know? And I'm like, screw it up. I should have named it something else cause I, I should have known what this was, but I knew myself and I'd always managed to step up. But it was in the middle of a couple of years where there was so much happening professionally in front of the scenes. And then behind the scenes, this family situation that was hard, brutal, like I can just say brutal. I don't want to get into too many details, but it was brutal and it was brutal based on what the situation itself was. And then you turn around and go, and it's also bleeding, bleeding, you drive financially. Yeah. So it's hard to regret taking the shot. And I really thought that I could have turned that book into something more, but then it hit the publication date and I went, I think it's like 80% where I want it to be and now there's nothing I can do about it. And it stresses me out, stresses me out. And a lot of it is because of the self-help thing, you know, it was not necessarily have been something I would not have pitched a book, but they gave me an open deal. I would not have pitched self-help and I really thought I could have found out a cool way to do it. And I don't think I solved the puzzle. Well, I had some regrets. May I was two of two things that part of my head. Number one, you can't be in charge of the consequences the consequences of someone else getting a fucking tattoo of something you said. They got that. Well, you get like a registry of everyone who's got that tattooed in their arm and do a poll about whether you got the tattoo. Look, you have a Morrissey tattoo. I got to get that one covered soon, man. Hey, I mean, come on. You know, what do you it's not Morrissey's fault. You know, he did the thing where you get a little older and like started saying shit where people like, what the fuck, you can't say that. Yeah, you have the same experience. Now, people see Morrissey on your arm and when they're like, oh, wow, so proud of what you're fucking proud. Well, you like Morrissey. Oh, you didn't know that. You didn't know that. Now, what is I'm sorry. I didn't write it down. What's the phrase that you it takes strength to be gentle and kind? I think it's the other tattoo that I wow. That's my that's one of my favorite Morrissey lines anyway. And, you know, I just feel like with that sort of thing, if we don't learn that people reincarnate in a single lifetime, then we're eventually going to have nothing that we enjoy. You know, like we're like we're but yeah, I don't know. I think it's beautiful. You wrote a self-help book and I hope that didn't stop you from writing anymore. No, no, it. It it it scared me a little bit. Because, like I said, it was it was not a bull's eye. Yeah. And I've always been OK, keeping things small, if it means that I can feel like I nailed it, even if the world doesn't think I nailed it. Yeah. And that was a situation where they wanted to go big and they wanted it to be a certain thing. But like I said, creatively, I have some regrets. But I think if anybody knew the back story of, oh, like, there was this fucked up situation and that money solved the situation. You go, ultimately, that is much more important than if I wrote a book that bombed, you know. And the other thing that I learned, too, is the editor of the book was so kind, such a nice guy, had my back hard, and I will be indebted to him forever and I'm a fan of his. But when you're a comedian or when you're doing hosting the TV show with the live audience, you are used to collective feedback guiding you. When you're writing a book, it's your instincts. And then that one editor's reaction. Yeah. And one thing I realized is that all of his priorities working there were the self help. And the balance of comedy was not. It wasn't his concern. So then they pushed and pulled at each other. Yeah. And and some people really enjoyed the book and say they've gotten a lot of it that makes me feel good. But I did feel weird about it. I have a lot of, as you can tell, this this answer tripped me up more than you expected it to. For sure. Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, I was I was talking to my friend and she's a very successful author. And I was having I was I was trying to write and I'm like, do you ever feel like your idea for a book or is is totally wrong? Like the thing that you've committed to writing is just completely wrong. And she's like, I'm going on a book tour. And I feel like that about now. So I wonder if it's just a universal sense of like, I don't know. I mean, you've written two other books, and maybe you felt better about the other two. And this just didn't hit the spot. But, you know, my my friend, he's got this whole podcast about like how if you want to like from any artist that is achieved any true renown has had to have a public stinker like you you can. And by the way, I'm not saying that was your book, but I'm but I think isn't that kind of past because I you know, I I didn't read the book. I just know it's all good. Forgive me if that seemed like some weird back end thing. Oh, no, at all. I'm the one who laid out all my feelings that you have nothing to apologize for. It's a beautiful thing because that's the kind of book I would I would like I don't have the guts. You're so brave, man. I think like doing a thing like that takes guts where you're like, no, I'm not going to write the funny fucking thing. You know what I mean? I'm not going to write the thing that is whatever the bubbly funny thing. I'm going to try to write this kind of book and it is going to upset people. And there are going to be comedians and old fans or whatever. Like what the fuck? What are you now? Is this who you are now? But you do it anyway. And yeah, maybe it didn't. Maybe it's not going to work. But to me, who cares if you didn't? Thanks, man. Thanks. That's super nice. Makes me feel better. And you know what? As I've never realized this before. But when you said the other two books, do I feel differently about them? I do. But I also. The one book was like through this company. It's the weird. It's the it's one of the great things that's ever happened in my life. When I was 19 years old, there's a magazine where I grew up in New Jersey. This underground magazine called Weird New Jersey. That's all about haunted shit in New Jersey. Yeah. And it was two guys who owned it and they hired me as their only employee. And it just kept getting bigger. And it led to me co-writing the Weird US book with them. And I wrote the Weird New York book with them. And that was my first book. And that's a company that I like gotten the trenches and fought for. My second book. When I from the time I started writing it to when I was Polish, it was seven years. And most of those years were just getting rejected by everybody and me going. No, I know it's good. Every situation I've ever been in that has gone. Well, is one that nobody believed in for a long time first. But when somebody comes and says, whatever you want it to be, here's a pile of money. Yeah, that's I got cast in a sitcom in 2010 before all the public access stuff. No, not good. Anything I've ever done where somebody goes, dude, we got you. Here's even when my show went to cable. It was like, and now life's going to get easier. No, got harder. It's I don't react well to people opening doors to me. I am at my best when I feel like I have to like kick kick open a door that they've locked. Like that's for some reason. I don't know if it actually goes better than or if it just feels like it does. But I tend to stumble when people actually try to make it comfortable and smooth for me. And I'm only realizing this right now that there's a consistent pattern there. Yeah, it's like you want you're one of those people who wants to run with a weighted vest for some reason. There's some maybe you have. So, you know, I at one point when in my meditation practice had this like realization that I am associating how much it hurts to sit still in an uncomfortable position, to not scratch itches to like be too rigid. I was I realized I'm associating that with success meditating, which is like, what, how do you succeed at meditating anyway? That's so ridiculous. But then I realized, oh, yeah, your meditation is like a fractal for your whole life. And then I realized, fuck, if I'm not hurting, I think I'm failing. If there's not, you know, oh, what a crazy. What a terrible. What a terrible consideration. But it's like a huge realization, huh? Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, so when things are easy, maybe it's because of the what, you know, I don't know, maybe it's because of our parents, maybe it's just because of the way that the route we took into comedy or whatever. But I know other comics like it, too, who get really scared when shit's easy. And they feel like something's they almost some of them fuck themselves up on purpose just to get back to the grind. It's it's a really sad thing. You see it all the time. And I have a few friends I can think of where it's like you you convinced yourself that your talent was completely tied to pain. And man, as that said, because you're a talented person, no matter what. So I wish you could just find it in yourself to be happy. It's sad to see it's sad to have done it. It's sad to see it from the outside, too. Just be like, oh, I wish maybe maybe for some people, it's true. But when you see it, when you see it, when you're sitting at a table with another comic and you both just did a show or something. And you see, oh, this person really think it's like Dumbo's feather. It's like you're hanging on to a thing you don't need. You know, yeah, sad. Yeah, it's hard, but I love that Dumbo's feather. Well, I mean, maybe there's nothing to hang on to at all. Anyway, I mean, isn't that this is, by the way, you got to go. I know you're on a press tour. It's five or two. I can hang out a little bit more. Thank you. When you have kids, your time starts moving real fast. And your comedy special have my life. I'm assuming you're addressing that reality. Yes. For your order. And, um, yeah. And so, uh, are you getting that feeling of like, I'm already dead. Like this shit's going by so fast anyway. I don't mean like in a gloomy, gothy way. I mean, like it's a year in even though this last year felt like a long time. But you know what I mean? That sense of like, damn, the years are starting to go by like telephone poles and a car that's accelerating. You know what I mean? And like I'm going to blink and it's this shit's over. You know, yes, feather or not flying or falling, succeeding or failing. It's I feel like, you know, it's just suddenly you're going to be like, hopefully looking up at your family, you know, and they love you, not like your family murdering you, which by the way, just on a hate line where these kids. You know what I mean? But so, so yeah, can you, can we? They like Eater. But, um, yeah, I think I'm mad. They were mad. Uh, uh, but yeah, you know, how are you doing with that? Are you, are you, how are you doing with all this existential stuff? And, um, how did you work it into your new special? Well, the special, the bullet points of the special, I shot it. I shot a tour, 10 venues, all kind of small venues, the types, the types of venues that I actually play on the road when I'm like building that hour and chipping away at it. I just really love those spaces. And sometimes my show gets like, I'll go on stage. Sometimes things get chaotic, you know, like I've always been that guy. And I, I managed to get a bunch of footage of that. Like there's a show in Baltimore where a girl got on stage and was like demonstrating wrestling holds on me. And it was really painful. And like, I'm like, I can't get this stuff like that in a regular special. And, um, I was, I was able to put all this interstitial footage of like all the things we know of like getting to some town too early and you don't know anybody there. And you find some dumb way to kill time with your friend who opens for you and, you know, sitting in traffic and, you know, we hit this footage that it actually, I feel like it's a very genuine moment. And I watched it. I go, man, that was me with my guard down. I'm like sitting in traffic, wondering if I'm going to make this show in Detroit on time. I just go, I think I still love this, but man, does my back hurt. And I'm like, that's exactly where my head was at when I filmed it. So, you know, having a kid at home, do I still want to go on all that stuff? So I was able to also have a soundtrack for the special because we did it that way. I was psyched about that. It's a good soundtrack. So wait, what do you mean? You wrote me mean you recorded a sound check. Like people don't see that. Is that what you know? Sound track. So because we had this, so it's like, here's some jokes. Here's some stories and then we're going to cut to another city. So let's do some travel stuff in between. And then I get these bands who I really like to throw some songs in that footage where I'm like, oh, most comedy specials don't get to have a sound track. That's cool, man. And some are very small local bands. Some are like much bigger bands in the punk world and like felt cool. So I like it. I like it. It's different just like everything I do, but you might like it and you're right. So much of it is like life is moving at a different pace now. I don't want to miss it. Like every the perspectives change. I've been doing this for 20 years and I have a kid and I don't know. I don't know what to think, just like you and I have been talking about so much today and the time thing, it's so weird because it's like not only does it move faster because you're watching this little human where I go three weeks ago, you weren't who you are now. Like this is weird to watch. But then also I have all these feelings of like, man. My life didn't even start until he was born. Like, I don't know if you feel the same thing. I'm like, yes, I do. Oh, I was wait. I did a lot of stuff. I really liked. I lived a pretty cool like my obituary is going to be pretty cool. I didn't even know that that was the precursor and this is the main event. I had no idea. Right. And it's like, and also like my whole life, I thought it was like me walking this hero's journey trying to prove everybody wrong. And now I'm like, there was nobody. There was nobody was nobody was particularly mad at me. Who was I trying to prove wrong? Like it was this ego thing. And like there was no hero's journey. I was just trying to get here. And that's again, why I like hanging out and mowing the lawn with him. Because I go, oh, like I didn't even. That was all the preamble. And now life feels very real. It's it's it's strange. I wish I didn't wait so long. It's very strange. Well, you know, you don't see a lot of proved wrong. On tombstones. You see a lot of father people. That's what gets on that thing. Um, you don't see a lot of you should see it. Like on my show where I raised a lot of money. Somebody ate a hot dog out of someone's ass. Yeah. But yeah, man, I don't mean to sound modeling. I'm really inspired by what you just said. I should have wrapped it up there instead of tagging it. But it was some dumb tombstone thing. I have a tune. You said it. I actually, I really want my tombstone for it to say. Anyone who stands on my grave will be cursed forever. Anyone who stands on my grave will not leave this graveyard alive. Like to try to start an urban legend that goes back to working at that magazine about ghosts. And I told my wife that and she goes, if you insist on doing that, my tombstone is going to be next to yours with an arrow pointing towards yours, and it's just going to say, I'm with stupid. And I was like, that's so good. That's so good. If you sell out my bit on your tombstone, it's so good. Chris, thank you so much for your time. You are so funny.

55^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Dr. Bruce Damer Transcript and Discussion^2016-08-31^"Progressive presents an ad from mom. When you bundle your home in auto insurance with Progressive, bundle, that's a cute word. What, read it again? Okay, when you bundle your home in auto insurance with Progressive, you get round the clock protection. Oh, that's darn good. Because once my sister Dottie, my older sister Dottie, her basement flooded. Get round the clock protection when you bundle and save with Progressive. It's easier than getting your mom to make this radio ad. Progressive casualty insurance company affiliates and other insurers is not available in all states or situations. All right, let's jump into this podcast. Hello, my dear sweet burners. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and tomorrow I set out on the great and much made fun of pilgrimage to Burning Man. I don't know what's gonna happen to me, but I can say this. My ego is already getting a pretty severe pummeling and that only makes me love the festival more, though I hate it when my ego gets a pummeling. Who likes to vomit? Who likes to get sick? Who likes a fever? Only a lunatic. In the same way, when you find yourself embarrassing yourself, when you find yourself becoming fully aware of your hypocrisy, of your contradictions, of the way that maybe you talk the talk and don't walk the walk, it makes you feel sick to your stomach. It's not a comfortable feeling. It makes you feel bad. Here's what happened to me. Now, Burning Man has an entire kind of environmentalist ethic attached to it. As many of you, I'm sure, are aware. And it's a low impact. The idea is like, be as low impact as you can. Go out there with some kind of canvas tent that you wove yourself in a sweat lodge somewhere and the canvas needs to be made of materials that fell from the wings of an angel, like pollen from the buzzing wings of a bumble bee or something, so you're not supposed to get an RV. Number one, at least according to the Burning Man website, they say, don't get an RV. What are you gonna sit in the AC the whole time? The whole point of this thing is that you're mixing meat bodies with lunatics from all around the planet. You've made the decision to go to the middle of this insane place called the Playa, which is essentially like a dust bowl. I've heard like, at different seasons, it becomes a marsh with frogs or something, but it's a dust bowl right now, man. It's a dust bowl. So the idea is you're sort of plunging into this mad max post-apocalyptic utopian environment and you're supposed to just breathe it in. I'm weak. That's one of the main things that I've learned right away from Burning Man. Now when I was a kid, man, I didn't care about anything. Like we'd go camping in the Blue Ridge Parkway. There was a special place we would go to. It was a secret trail that you could go down that led to this little island in the middle of two rivers. And I would go down there with like a blanket that I stole from my mom, just like a blanket, not even a sleeping bag. You would just go down there with a blanket and somebody would start a fire and a group of us would hang out and you sort of wrap yourself up in this blanket when you were ready to go to sleep. And that was it. You'd lay in the exposed. You didn't care. There was no thought of comfort there. You were happy to be outside in nature, experiencing that delicious LSD that used to flow through the bloodstreams of so many people during the acid boom of the 90s. My God, there was some great LSD back then. Maybe there is today, I don't know. I've lost track of that. But man, I didn't care about comfort, but now, ugh. Today, let me tell you the humiliation that happened to me today, friends. And it's really like, I know it's an embarrassing thing to say, but it's really made me love Burning Man. No matter what happens to me, even if I get there and a fucking vulture flies over and shits rotting possum diary all over my face and then someone throws glitter onto the diarrhea and then I get dragged into some interrogation tent by the Black Rock Ranger patrol who thinks I'm acting weird because I'm covered in vulture, diarrhea and glitter. Even if that happens and it easily could, I have to say that I'm already learning a lot from it. And here's the first humiliation that happened to me today. We, so like I got an RV through this RV company and we got to this weird RV park to pick it up and the refrigerator didn't work in the RV. And I don't know, like it's so fucking embarrassing. Like I kind of lost my, like the guy was being, in my opinion, the guy was being like kind of like nonchalant and a dick about the fact that the RV smelled like piss. It was all beat up. It was not a great RV. Like you watch the videos of the RV on, I can't remember the name of the website now. It's like Rent America or something, but you look at these videos and the RVs look like they just came out of the RV factory. You imagine they smell like perfume. They look just fresh, brand new, wood paneling, beautiful things. This RV looked like it was used in some kind of prison escape. It was beat up inside. It smelled like cigars and dehydration urine. There was a puddle of like some kind of putrefying liquid in the freezer. And it just wasn't a great RV. Not that I have like a lot of like a reference point for RVs and maybe I don't want a reference point for RVs. Maybe I don't want to know the spectrum of RV pleasure in the universe. Maybe that's a bad sign in its own way. You know, these fucking gas guzzling things. Who knows? So anyway, I started getting mad. And I, man, I was so embarrassing. Like, losing your cool is so fucking embarrassing, man. It's so embarrassing. But I kind of lost my cool with the guy and I was like, you're, I'm just going to say it. It's just so sad. But I say it in the hopes that you will forgive me. Oh man, I was like, you don't, you're not even going to apologize for that badness RVs. You know, like you're standing there and you're watching these like embarrassing words come out of your mouth that the opposite of the way you would want to be. Like Clint Eastwood, at least the Clint Eastwood archetype has never stood in an RV. There's never been an indignant Clint Eastwood standing in an RV dealership chastising an RV dealer. That's never happened, you know? So like I chastise an RV dealer and leave to realize that the whole time my zipper has been all the way down. Like not like, not a little down, but like completely open with my blue, light blue, baby blue, the opposite of Clint Eastwood. Like whatever color the archetypical John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Gunslinger, whatever the first color of that being soul is, my underwear was the opposite of that color, just to kind of like light, kind of happy blue, like a bird's egg blue, the kind of blue you'd paint a baby's room or like the blue of a pony on a carousel at a county park. So that whole time that I was like in my mind like I'm gonna show, so my ego is thinking, you know what, I'm not gonna let these people get away with renting defective RVs to the world. I'm gonna fight this. But the reality of the situation was because I was angry and because my intention was egoic that I could only be humiliated, which I think I was in some small way. So anyway, to me, that kind of lesson, as painful as it is, is really a glorious lesson because it helps me in a lot of different ways recognize like, oh shit, man, you've gotten off track a little bit. Like if you find yourself screaming at people in an RV dealership, you've gotten off track a little bit. Like it's time at that point to go to Burning Man and to really think maybe a little bit about what's important in life, you know? And like, you know, I know Burning Man is a thing everyone makes fun of and I have made fun of. So I get it, but I gotta say I already respect it because just the very act of getting ready to go hang out in this land of alkaline dust and insanity is already like pinpointed an aspect of my personality that a younger version of myself would look at with a little bit of embarrassment, which is, come on, man, you're really like upset because there's not a fridge in an RV that you're taking to the desert. Like you're gonna, that's the way you wanna like, that's what you're gonna let yourself get mad about, man. Come on, we used to sleep in mud, brother. We used to sleep by campfires covered in dust, coming off of acid in dirt, and those were some of the best nights that we had in our life. You're gonna be upset because a fucking RV has a little bit of rust in the refrigerator. So, you know, I like that. And whether or not, maybe I'll get to Burning Man and just realize, ah, this is some kind of like sanctimonious orgy of bullshit, but I don't know, man. I really think there is a, gotta hate to say it, but I think there may be some kind of very potent, powerful energy that is developing there that is probably a great thing to respect and to learn from. We'll see. I'll give you the full report. And if you're out there, come say hello to me and forgive me for my trespasses. I beg of thee. We have a wonderful podcast for you today. A while ago, I got an email from a listener of the DTFH, Michael Bailey, who connected me with today's guest, Bruce Damer, who is a scientist, a teacher, a philosopher, a speaker, a software designer, somebody who is currently researching the questions of the origin of life, the economic development of space. This is a person who actually works with NASA in the realm of asteroid mining. And whenever a stranger from the internet, no longer a stranger, whenever, to me it's a miracle that a stranger from the internet sends me an email and suddenly I get the chance to be in the company of an amazing human being like Bruce Damer. It's the coolest thing ever. We talked about a lot of very interesting things and including asteroid mining. I hope you will forgive me if I didn't focus on any one thing long enough. It is my hope, and maybe this is taking the universe for granted a little too much, but it is my hope that I will have many more podcasts with Dr. Bruce and that this is just the very first one. So I hope you will enjoy this episode. We're gonna jump right into it, but first some very quick business.

It's a great way for you to support this podcast and it costs you nothing and why wouldn't you wanna use Amazon? Are you really gonna get in your car and drive down to some consumeristic store? Friends, I'm going to Burning Man. I am above that now and I'll tell you this, going to some chain store to hobble around in the stinky aisle smelling of BPE or whatever the chemical is that exudes from plastic that makes your ovaries turn into sausages. You don't need to breathe that anymore. Friends, you can go through our Amazon portal and most anything that you need, from batteries to California poppy tincture, which I ordered late one night and has arrived. I'm not sure exactly what it does, but I guess late that night I was hoping it would have the effects of opium, which I imagine it probably doesn't because it's being sold through Amazon. Who knows? Will it help me sleep? Will it make me write beautiful poetry like Samuel Taylor Courage? We'll see, I don't know, but if they've got that on Amazon, they've got everything. One ply toilet paper, two ply toilet paper, six ply toilet paper. If you don't even want to use toilet paper, order some sheets, cut them up into toilet paper, size slivers, and you can use actual cloth to wipe your sweet and beautiful anus. It's all there for you, friends. Amazon, go through our portal, won't you? We also have a wonderful shop, which has t-shirts, posters. Soon we will have pins. Soon we will have new posters. Soon we will have new shirts, but new or old, please visit our shop. And also, and finally, we have a wonderful forum located at DuncanTrussell.com. If something on this podcast makes you mad, or if something on this podcast makes you happy, if you want to accuse me or one of my guests of being in the Illuminati or the CIA, or if you want to argue with someone who thinks I'm in the CIA or the Illuminati, it's all there for you at the forum at DuncanTrussell.com. I hope you'll join. We would love to have your company there. Okay, friends, let's get this podcast on the road. By the time this thing floats into your sweet and sacred ear tubes, I'm gonna be riding around on the Playa in an art car, blowing bubbles out of my butthole into some kind of pyrotechnic device that transforms those bubbles into fireworks, and I hope I'll see you there. Today's guest has a great podcast called Levity Zone, which you can listen to at levityzone.org. He also has his own website at www.damer.com, and here is where you know that this man is truly incredible. He's not afraid to give his email out on the internet. If you want to say hi to him, if you have any questions for him, if you want to reach out to him, you can send him an email at bruceatdamer.com. All right, everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour Podcast author, scientist, and philosopher, Dr. Bruce Damer. Dr. Bruce, welcome to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour Podcast. Thank you so much for coming up here to visit with me for a little bit. My pleasure, my pleasure. This connection happened in one of my favorite ways for connections to happen, which is Michael Bailey, someone who listens to the podcast emailed me, suggesting you as a guest, and I asked if you could hook us up, I think. I don't even remember how it happened, but then here we are. Here we are. Now, it's that kind of digitized network that I really love, and I think it's fitting that you brought with you today this incredible, what do you call it, what you brought today? It's a cough switch. It's a piece of the Pilbara of what's called the dresser formation, which is a geologist term for a bunch of rocks sticking up, and it's from Northwestern Australia, and it's from the oldest part of the Earth's crust that's preserved, so it's 3.49 billion years old, and in it are the clear signs of stromatolites, of early life. But you call this a microbial mat, that's right. A microbial mat, the thing that gave birth to mycelium, but it's an interconnected network of microbes. Yeah, kind of like the plaque on your teeth, stuff like that, so those dudes were 85, 87% of the history of life were just microbial mats. That's 85%, and probably most terrestrial planets in exosolar systems that have life on them, it's all microbial communities until the star goes nova, because it takes so long for those guys to clean out the ocean, drop all the iron out of the ocean, then put oxygen in the atmosphere, despite volcanism and impacts and stuff to make an atmosphere for complex life, which we are, we're breathing oxygen. So we've just gotten lucky, because our star hasn't gone nova. Yeah, we didn't get a big impact, we didn't get a big gamma ray burst, we didn't all this stuff, and so those guys didn't get reset in their detoxification run, although when they put the oxygen out, that's a kind of a toxin, right? Yes. So we learned, complex life learned to breathe that, and then it turned into this big energy cycle, and here we are, sitting in a podcast studio. I'm really interested in that reset that theoretically gets pressed whenever, at some point in the history of all planets, or the end of history of all planets, the idea is that there's just an inevitable cosmic event that will happen, no matter what, has to happen that will completely eradicate all life on any given planet. And for us, for us, here's the scary thing, if you read James Lovelock's new book, which is called Rough Ride to the Future, it's his last book, because he's 93 years old, but in it is this chilling chapter. Now this is from, you know, the atmospheric scientist, Par excellence, who predicted the ozone hole and stuff like that, and he says that this terminator is approaching, the terminator that gobbled up Venus and turned it into a hot-house hell, because it was too close to the sun, is approaching the Earth. So the sun's heat curve is going up as it moves along that main sequence. And according to our friend Lovelock, in a hundred million years, thereabouts, the atmosphere can have no CO2 at all in it, or we go to run away greenhouse. Right. So that means either life has to adapt, and this is just his prediction, but life has to adapt to having no CO2, or we're going the way of Venus, our sister. Okay, now, this is where, and I'm so excited to have a scientist with me here on the podcast, and somebody with a logical brain, and I'm sure some of the listeners are gonna be excited to have many balloons pop today. My logic! You just popped one. Oh, there we go. So we're already kind of where I predicted we would be at the end of the podcast, which is a good sign, but so, an advanced species has to recognize eventually that living on the exterior of a planet is just a terrible idea. It's like building sand castles next to the ocean. It's just not gonna work. It doesn't work, it can't work. There's just too many horrible things that can happen. So we have the Fermi Paradox. Why aren't we picking up signals from planets? And I've always thought, oh, maybe what happens is a species becomes advanced enough to realize that it makes more sense to retreat inside the planet than it does to hang out on the outside of the planet. And when we're looking at planets, really what we're seeing is just the shell of some kind of advanced civilization that has gone inside the thing itself to survive. Yeah, it depends on their mentality and the way their bodies are built, really, because if they're aqueous, right, then they have to carry that aqueous environment somewhere. We're aqueous, but we can live in the open air subareally. But if they're just fully aqueous, then they have to truck it around. I mean, it's like the Indune, the guy, the big worm thing in the long tube. It looks like a Victorian boiler or something who's surrounded by the spice. This dude has to live in this weird atmosphere in order to use telepathy to open wormholes. It's sort of like that. I mean, they have to carry it with them. So it'd be pretty funky to see that. Great big floating oceans in the solar system inside spheroids. Yeah, well, don't we kind of have that? Aren't there ice planets that seem to have some kind of liquid ocean underneath that? Yeah, that's really common. And in fact, I'm on a focus group for NASA looking at planning for a mission to a place called Enceladus, which is a moon of Saturn that has icy jets coming out from the crust, this sort of crust that covers an ocean underneath. And I'm one of the people that is arguing that we can't see an origin of life on Enceladus because of the fundamental chemistry, but that's a whole other story. But Enceladus, it's something about the gravitational pull of what is it orbiting again? Saturn. Saturn. The gravitational pull is like causing some kind of warping. It might be heating the inner ocean enough that there could be life in there. Enceladus is a pipsqueak. It's like a little marble. I mean, there's almost nothing to it. And the ocean's kilometers deep, but it has enough gumption that there's perhaps hydrothermal vents down there and they're pushing material up and it's jetting through the cracks in the ice. And the idea would be to fly some kind of probe through the jet. Through the jet, yeah, and try to sequence some of the particles of water to see if they can see any biomolecules there. And then I've also heard that there's some, like there's a lot of talk. Well, if we actually had the technology and could pull it off, which I don't see how you would because the ice is so thick, right? It's miles of ice. It's a drilling, yeah. It's a non-starter. It's a non-starter. Yeah. I mean, even if you had the technology, you couldn't risk infecting an entire planet. Like in the movie Europa Report, you know, you remember that there was all they had to do is drill just a few feet. You know, it's suddenly there's this thing with tentacles coming up and, you know, it was so easy, you know, it was so easy. But we couldn't get in there. There's no way. It's, yeah, I mean, those environments are just so harsh. I mean, the problem with Enceladus, it doesn't have an atmosphere. So how do you, you can't use like arrow breaking to land on it, you know? So you've got to do a full power, weird descents and mess it all up and, you know, it's, the outer moons are going to be challenging places. Titan, we've dropped a probe into the atmosphere. That was fascinating. I think one good mark on the human species is that we are evolved enough to not just shoot missiles at these planets. Right, right. There is, it is interesting that we think this, we have such a, because I imagine if like, we took the technology that we currently have and put it back to the time of like, I don't know, the Mongol Horde or something, they wouldn't be like, let's make sure that we preserve what life might be there. They would just pummel it, explode it, blow up the outside of the planet, see what's in there. If there's something there, well, now we know there's something there. So what if we eradicate it? And, you know, watching the Marco Polo series is, I think it's on Netflix. I know if you've been following that. I have not. It's amazing because Marco Polo, they, he comes from Venice, right? To China in the time of the Mongols. And he gives them these siege machines so they can knock down the walls of the city of the Song Dynasty. But they are giving him fireworks and rocketry, like gunpowder based things. So you can see all this happening. I don't know how realistic this is, but this big exchange of European culture and Chinese civilization was like, here's our weapons, Zawara, what do you got? You know? Isn't that sad? That's like one of the number one ways that civilizations trade is by giving each other ways to kill the other one eventually down the line. But the Trebuchet and the gunpowder rocket gave us access to the stars, you know? So there you have it. But they weren't thinking about that back then. Right. Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, when you can hear this all the time, that so much of our current technology that is being used by people to try to transform the planet in a positive way, just stated inside the womb of the military industrial complex, creating this fascinating paradox, which is that you have these people who on a daily basis are actively trying to figure out new ways to kill other people. And from that pursuit, they give birth to technologies that maybe offer hope for the entire planet. Yeah, I mean, it seemed to go hand in glove all the time. I'm just grateful that I witnessed and lived through the fall of the Soviet Union in the end of the Cold War without seeing those missiles being lobbed across the trans-Soviet, because 15,000 detonating warheads, we'd be in a different world right now. We would be back, we wouldn't even be in the Trebuchet world. There'd be like 1% of us surviving and they would find the wreckage of civilization here and there. And that's also fascinating when you consider just how fragile this ecosystem is in the sense that not only are we dealing with the inevitability of some kind of cosmic disaster that creates either a disruption in the way we can function or completely eradicates us, but also it's coming from inside our minds too. It's coming from, yeah, our stories. And in about five years ago, I did a talk at the SETI Institute, and the SETI Institute is where Frank Drake works. And Frank Drake wrote this famous equation, the Drake equation, as you know about, which is like the proportion of civilizations or life in the galaxy. And there was all these terms. And I added four terms onto the end of the Drake equation, which all done in jest because we had Seth Shostak there, who's incredibly funny. I mean, he's the alien hunter of the SETI Institute. And so you have to be humorous. He defends himself and explains himself through humor alone, you know, pretty much. You know, if you're hunting for aliens, you gotta do something. I have to sit to humor. You cannot be dead serious about it. So the four terms I think I remember was the, so the question was the, do they boldly go, right? For Star Trek. So how many civilizations are we expecting to see out there that where a ship arrives in our orbit and waves and like, hey, we boldly went high, you know, we're trying to find you. Great question. And it's modified by these factors, which is how many of these civilizations are willing to fund visionary nerds, right? Like we're talking about churning the weapons of war into, you know, going to Jupiter. How many of them are willing to fund visionary nerds on a long-term basis, right? With complete control, not don't burn the fleet kind of thing. How many of them are willing to fund the visionary nerds for incredibly long period of time with no certain outcomes that they would send a ship and come back and et cetera, et cetera. And it's incredibly small. So that is actually a fantastic question. Because to get to the point where you would fund visionary nerds, your society's gotta be on a very specific track. Very specific, yeah. And if you look at where we're sitting, miles, maybe fractions of miles from JPL, right? You can practically see JPL from your house. And that place, could it ever have existed in China, Africa, France, et cetera, et cetera? Such a place as Pasadena is in the annals of visionary nerddom. This is the Valhalla of visionary nerds, Pasadena. And from all these people and the Carl Sagan's of the world and the Charles Alachi who runs JPL and planetary missions and whatnot. And we take it for granted sitting here, like, oh, this is what people do. But there's only one place on the planet where people have been supported for 50, 60 years to do this visionary thing. It's right here in these weird and unique conditions. Yeah, and it's something that our species, it's been doing, you know, prior to this, we do give a place for our scientists. And a lot of times we put them in jail, lock them up. But quite often when you look, there are always these alchemists who are simultaneously adored and feared by power structures. I mean, John Dee, be an example, you know? He thought you tricked people or maybe you could really do it. He said he could turn lead into gold, which is a surefire way to get the... When I lived in Prague in the early 90s, I set up one of the first software labs there. And I used to put on a long black cape that I had and walk through Prague Castle at night. And there was no one there. Like in 1991, 1992, nobody there, no security even. You know, it's all changed now because this is just the post-communist period. And I had set up a lab called the Comanius Lab at Charles University right down below the castle in this 15th century, you know, monastery that the Math Physics Department occupied. And we built a whole lab out. It was smuggled in PCs and everything. But in Prague Castle, there's the alchemist lane. I used to poke my heads into the alchemist houses are built into the walls of the castle. And they have swinging stairs because they're so narrow that to get to the upper loft, you have to unfold the stairs and hook them in. So I used to do that. I used to sort of go in and see where these guys were root off the second, you know, supported. He funded these alchemists. And the initial project was not to turn lead into gold, but to animate matter from dead to alive. And that's been a passion of mine for a long time. But it was... A passion of yours has been to bring the dead back to life. Or to answer the question or even provide a peek into how non-animate matter booted itself up in an operating system called life. How on earth did this happen? Now, this is something I've been thinking about a lot. And which is, I just watched, you know, Searle's the philosopher. He was at Google and he gave this great lecture on strong AI, the impossibility of strong AI, and the impossibility that a machine can duplicate human intelligence or any intelligence, any sentient intelligence. And I kept thinking, oh, these argument hinges on the idea that consciousness is an embodied thing, that it requires a metabolism or a neurology to exist. And when I was at one of these Rom Dostritreats, there's a story that floats around. And also I've heard it in different ways by now. So this is starting to feel like kind of an urban legend, but apparently someone asked a Tibetan Lama the question, if a computer becomes advanced enough, can a computer have intelligence? And the response was, well, if you have a system that's advanced enough to house a soul, then a soul will incarnate into that thing. In other words, consciousness disembodied unified field that uses advanced systems as an outlet to manifest itself. And so what do you think about that? Is consciousness something that depends on a body to exist? Here's a funny aside to that. The Dalai Lama is a really funny guy. And one of the sort of joke, but true things that he said about five years ago was, if I do a lot of traveling, a lot of traveling through a lot of cities and make a lot of flight connections, my soul misses a connection at some point. And its bags get lost or whatever, so it hangs around. When I get to Dharamsala, I have to sit at Dharamsala until my soul makes all the connections and comes back into my body. And I feel it coming back in. He said, this is what modern society or modern way of life does to us. It separates us. So in a sense, we don't know what the soul is, but he knows it when it's missing. Right, and then the implication there is that it is not a thing that depends on the body. And how many times have we heard this in every single religion and every single, and even non-theistic religions and even non-theistic schools of Buddhism seem to indicate some kind of momentum to say the least that continues after the- The Atman. Yes, that's right. So this is, what do you think about that? Like from your perspective, when you contemplate this idea of animating matter, is it a thing that is a result of the, some kind of specific interconnection of a variety of different systems coming together? Or is it that when a variety of different systems come together, it creates a kind of radio or transmitter for a thing that doesn't need a body to exist? Well, I can give you an example. My first contemplation of this problem, this thought, was in the spring of 1976, and I was 14 walking in the hills around Kamloops, British Columbia and Canada, and I saw a Mariposa lily coming out of the soil, just coming out of the previously frozen ground, and thought to myself, this is the most incredible thing, that something's directing this Mariposa to push up, and the structure of it is emerging, and there's some kind of code, some kind of code that is running this. And this is before there were any computers in our town, you know, and I had never touched a computer, but I was designing board games, and I had complex worlds running in my head all the time. But I said, you know what? When and how did all this start? How did life begin? And I knew something about molecules, and I knew something that the molecules had to self-organize, and then I remembered that I read somewhere that Albert Einstein did things he called thought experiments, Gedankin experimented, where he would see himself or close his eyes and become a beam of light, and so special relativity came out of that thought experiment when he was 16. And so I said, I could do that, you know, this is before any training, you know, let's open myself up to a thought experiment, and in my head, but also sort of in the air ahead of me, was this seething ball of molecules, and I just studied it, it was like from somewhere, and they were doing something, and then they asked me the question. They said, figure out how we made a copy of ourselves. And I had a flash right away, which was, this is impossible, because in order for you guys, you're a machine, in order for a machine to make a copy of another machine, the machine doing the copying has to be much bigger, like you need a whole auto plant to make a copy of an automobile. It's impossible, and then the thing kind of winked at me, and I realized that's the challenge that I have to solve, which I believe we have solved now, but what's interesting, you're going back to your question, where the heck did that come from? That thought experiment, from some ether, from some bigger intelligence that's winking at us all the time, little monkeys, as Joe talks about, talking monkeys on a twirling planet. And so even science is beholden to that type of insight, and that type of magic, which Einstein himself, which Newton, went into thought experiments, and Descartes, an angel told him about measure and number. Well, I mean, this is, you hear about this again, and again, and again, and again. It's something that doesn't get brought up as much as I think it should, but in the same way we could have right now, in the depths of space, slowly, like that creature slouching towards Bethlehem. We could have heading our way some kind of terrible, terrible rock, the size of the Himalayas, just spinning towards us on a date with planet Earth, the apocalypse headed towards us in the same way, in the depths of someone's mind, deep, deep, deep down there, could be the idea for a working time machine, could be the cure for cancer, could be the idea for how to reanimate life, how to upload consciousness, and that's moving through time in a completely different kind of inner cosmos. So it's just curious to me how when we can track, we can't even track all that stuff out there, or you wanna, do you know the percentage of space stuff that we can see? It's a small percentage of. A small percentage, but we certainly can't track the ideas gestating inside the hearts of human beings right now, and yet we know that every single thing that we currently enjoy or fear that comes from human invention is a direct result of that movement. Of intention, yeah. And it's that of going, intention. Intention, yeah. But where, you know, this is, where does the intention come from? It's that moment where, it's the moment where the idea enters the atmosphere in between the conscious. Oh, did the, hold on. Can I take it off? Yes, please. Okay. So we don't need those dumb heads. So anyway, this, this song, it's that moment when the flash of intuition enters the human mind and you make the decision, okay, I'm gonna follow up on this, or I'm just gonna ignore it. And that is made the difference in every single thing. Everything, it's everything. There isn't anything but that. So, so in a sense, you know, in my own story, about the same time between when I was 14 and 16, I thought, okay, I could draw a big peace sign in the dirt because this was in the period of the peace movement and anti-war and the eco movement had started in the 70s. And I could draw a peace sign in the, in the dirt that faces our street and make a statement. But this is kind of hopeless because in fact, open your horizons bigger. What human beings are, we can't figure out. We can't figure out if we're gonna consume the whole planet and torch ourselves or we're the blossom that's opening. We cannot figure this out. And we cannot presuppose that we know. However, there is a bigger picture, which is that the, there's an origin of life if we could figure out how life began and even start replicating it to some degree in the lab to see our ancestors. But then if we could figure out how to project life out of the gravity well and open up space in the solar system, we would be doing a number one positive job for Gaia. And in a sense, what are we for? You know, Kurt Vonnegut asked, what are people for? You know, in one of his books or whatever. We are perhaps the reproductive organs for the biosphere. The biosphere wants to make a copy of itself. So about 1978, I started working on asteroid mining and all this sort of thing, like working with Jerry O'Neill's Space Studies Institute, sending them drawings and all this sort of sending stuff to NASA, Johnson Space Center and getting these letters back and all that sort of stuff. Working on the problem of how to extend life off the planet. And then we cracked that two years ago as well. A team of us came up with the shepherd design. So in a sense- What is the shepherd design? I'm sorry. The shepherd is, so at the same time as you're doing, when life begins, it's little enclosures. Little, it creates little micro-environments called protocells. And we're still living in that protocell world. What we figured out, and this was between Peter Gineskens at SETI Institute, who's a colleague of mine who's perhaps one of the world's great meteor astronomers. So when there's a fireball in the sky, his phone rings. And they fly him out in high-speed business jets to go pick up pieces, like he's the go-to. So he went to Russia. Yeah, yeah, and Sudan and all these other places and Novato, one of these things bounced off a guy's house and went into his garage. And so Peter's that guy. How convenient is that? A meteor doesn't just land near you, it lands in your garage. It lands, like, bounces off. And initially, they didn't think it was a real thing, but he determined it was. But so Peter and I met by accident at a conference in 2014. And I whipped up my phone, and I showed him computer graphics of our design, because I led a team for about 15 years that did a lot of simulation and eventually mission design work for NASA. And I held up my phone, and I said, here is my design for a fabric enclosure that can go around an asteroid, let's say, for instance, an icy one. Wow. Have an introduced atmosphere and gradually heat up and boil off the volatiles and then suck them down into tanks and convince them and make fueling stations and move this stuff around. And he looked at this, and what I had was a gantry that came out and attached to. And I've been at meetings at JPL, and I've been in a zillion NASA meetings. And so what we did was we took all the knowledge that I had accumulated from 12, 15 years of simulating every single mission they've ever flown and made this architecture. And he looked at this thing, and he said, that'll never work. And I said to him, well, who are you, because you didn't have a name badge or anything. Well, I'm Peter Janiskens, et cetera, et cetera. And I'm an expert in the geotechnical properties of these objects, and this will not work. And I said, oh, I may have just had my balloon popped. Literally, you want to go to lunch. There's all hope springs eternal, let's go to lunch. So we went to this fish restaurant and had a bowl of clam chowder. I mean, two bowls of clam chowder. And at the end of that, he looked up and said, I figured out how to make it work. We don't attach to the asteroid. We don't have to. And if you ever attach to one of these asteroids, you're asking for trouble because they're just consolidated rubble piles, they come apart. There's never going to be a Bruce Willis with a jackhammer on one of these things. And they're low gravity, they're no gravity. But what we can do is bring gas out there and fill up our enclosure, our balloon enclosure, that we've sealed around this thing. And we can stop its tumbling in probably days to hours. And we did a computational model at the SETI Institute where we took a known asteroid, known shape model, and we introduced xenon gas at a 1-tenth atmosphere. And within less than a day, the thing was no longer tumbling and spinning, because these things all rotate. And then he said, and get this, we can use the same ductwork system that you have in your design. We can project waves of gas like wind, like a very, very subtle wind, a light wind. And the asteroid will turn like a sailing ship. And Peter's a Dutchman, so he loves the idea of a sailing ship in space, and will impart a gentle force, like no more than one Newton, which will start to change its orbit. And then what we do is take the same xenon gas in our tanks and run a xenon solar electric motor out the back and keep the whole system coupled. So as that asteroid starts to decelerate, say, into the inner solar system, we move the entire thing to keep up with it, because it's inside our balloon. We don't want to get tangled up in our structure. And we worked out that we could take one of these reference objects from quite a long distance to lunar orbit in 2 and 1 half years. And so then it gets crazy from there, because we started using our imaginations and contacting people throughout the space business. And one of them came up with, well, hey, heck, you know, there's a space lawyer from Houston. He said, heck, you could use the mon process to mine nickel with gas alone. Wait, they're space lawyers? They're space lawyers. Oh, yeah. There's layers and layers of space lawyers. What is a space lawyer? They deal with all kinds of things like my parking orbit or yours kind of thing. Like what? My parking orbit. You know what? I did just read that one of the great, and I know that asteroid mining is one of the futuristic industries that people are saying is going to become a reality. And this is something maybe you can help me understand. I'm sorry to cut you off. Yeah, no worries. But because I'll just ask you a few questions, then you can continue with your story, because I have a lot of questions about asteroid mining. Number one, people are saying there could be trillions of dollars worth of minerals on an asteroid. I don't understand that. Number two, why do we even need a Bruce Willis? Why wouldn't we just use robots? Why are people thinking of using human beings at all for this? And then number three, I just read this. They're saying one of the big questions is who owns these things, floating in space? And when I read that, I thought, how can anyone lay claim to a thing outside of the gravity well? Well, to go to the first questions, which are quite interesting, there's a division here. So the asteroid mining community is full of people with no understanding of what asteroids are and how to deal with them. They don't call Peter Janickens. His phone is not being rung off the hook by space resources of these other people who on their website show cabling around these things. And they show buildings attached, which is nonsense. So it's like a gold mining company that never talked to a gold prospector. Right, but because you put a building on an asteroid, it's just gonna, it's like, we just tried to land something on an asteroid, remember? What was the name of that probe? We're launching a new one, Osiris Rex, in about a month. The one before that, the one that screwed up, it bounced or something, landed on the side. That was the comet, the European mission, the Rosetta mission. The Rosetta mission, yeah. It's really tough to deal in that environment. And so all of those ventures are, they haven't got a clue. So we had kind of discounted all that long time ago. But what the value is, is not bringing titanium or nickel or whatever to the earth, because it's inconceivably difficult to do any kind of processing and mining in space and then try to land a big cargo. It's just inconceivably difficult and we don't need to. We've got plenty of rare earth metals. We know where the rare earth metals are, they're in landfills. So by the 2050s, there's gonna be a whole industry with bucket wheel excavators grinding through dumps, going into cyclonic sorters where they break everything into chips, and then high speed imaging will sort out the titanium bits, the gold bits, the plastic from Barbie dolls in 1960, whatever, and recovering all that stuff, which doesn't be re-refined. I mean, we've got a lot of stuff. We know where it is, you know? Right, it hasn't gone anywhere. It hasn't gone anywhere, you know. It didn't evaporate. Now there's people doing that. I've seen the terrifying documentaries of people in these canyons of garbage, just fending through it. Mostly in the developing or the third world. So we don't need titanium, we don't need. We don't need it. We don't need any of this stuff. What do we need? So what we need, if say Elon wants to go to Mars, right? You need to build fueling stations everywhere. So he would not sell a single Tesla car if there was no charging stations. In fact, they're trying to sell Tesla now in Australia, and they have to install charging stations all up and down the East Coast, so that Tesla owners can go and pull in, and if you had no gas stations, you'd have to drive a fuel tanker across the continent. You have to have that. And so what we did with Shepard was show a plausible way to make fueling stations all over the solar system. And that reduces your hugest cost of what you're carrying, which is fuel and water. Eventually you need a lot of water to go to Mars for shielding and for crew and cooling and stuff. So there's untold amount of frozen ice in the solar system that we can retrieve and easily process without grinding or doing any kind of physical thing just by sublimation. All this stuff about asteroid mining for rare metals is bullshit. It's so far out, and it's not an economic prospect for anybody, and I believe most of those ventures have since turned away from that. So it was somebody's good idea that sounded good on the surface, but they didn't talk to anybody in the space businesses that knows about asteroids and the geotechnical properties. Wow, because even I, after hearing that, I thought, man, boy, if there's some way I could build some kind of, I don't know why I'm up there. I don't mean to go off on a tangent here, but this is to me one of the real, you must feel this too. And I actually on Reddit, which I go on way too much, they were talking about the near, they just found relatively close to us a planet in the Goldilocks region. I don't know if you saw that story. And so this like on Reddit, somebody posted a comment that was really poignant, and they said, I just feel really sad that in my lifetime, I'm not gonna be able to see what another planet looks like. Another planet orbiting another star. And man, me too, this fills me with such a... Although our solar system is so full of objects, like icy moons, like we just talked about, Enceladus, Titan, Saturn and Jupiter are like small solar systems, they're incredible. So we have plenty to look at. We truly have a Goldilocks selection of hot, medium and cold porges, and we have a very rich solar system to study. But here's, you know, this is like the dream. And I've been fantasizing it about this so much with the elections. I just think, man, if there was teleportation, and there was some other inhabitable planet, and like we could just leave the planet somehow. I know we can, it's fantasy. Just the idea of being able to just fuck you, Trump and Hillary. It's like the pilgrims. Yes, that's what they did. Except the pilgrims arrived and they had people there to help them to learn how to shoot turkeys, and they had breathable air and you know. This is one of the problems, is that we no longer have a means of escape outside of what you're talking about, which is, it seems like, I mean, I don't know how close we are to putting balloons, around asteroids, to create fueling stations, so Elon Musk can fly us to Mars. Did it get away from a corrupt fucking system? But it feels like we're pretty far away from that. And I remember Terrence McKenna, one of the things he would say is this, there's this terrible race happening right now, between some innovation that allows some something, some transformation to happen, and the. But of course, you talk about the toxic media, right, that is filling our heads with anxiety and changing our reality, right? So I posit to you, and I know that you flip on the other side of this too, that in order for a dark force to rise, which is what that is, all that anxiety and all that manipulation, there must be, this is a Buddhist idea, that it must be pushing against something that is its opposite. And what that opposite is, is hidden for the most part. It's not covered by the dark force, right? So Darth Vader's out there doing his thing with planet destroying, Death Stars, and whatever, but he doesn't realize that there's still little Yoda, somewhere in a jungle, and there's Luke being raised, and there's the rebel force and whatever. But it turns out that the force that represented by, you know, the Yoda's is freaking powerful, right? It's as powerful or an equal match to the empires, right? So in the end, it just becomes a complete, equal match as they climb up. So what I posit to you is that there's a force in the world that is so powerful, that it's equivalent and rising at the same time as the dark force, and that younger and younger people, people of a young generation, are adept at jumping this liminal boundary between them and standing on that and saying, like a young person today who looks at basically old broadcast media, bullshit, things like Fox News, sees right through it, right? Because why? Because their minds are totally adept. Their minds are not subject to the same kind of propagandization as their elders, and they jump into ethereal worlds, the world of Vapachana and experience on altered states and everything. And so they can jump around across the boundary between the rising dark side and the rising other, called the light side, whatever, and they see both clearly. I love, I mean, this is the dream. This is something I fantasize about all the time, and sometimes I pretend that these podcasts are messages in a bottle in the hopes that they're going to get down to the shore. And they are, they totally are. But so this is a conversation I was having the other night with a friend of mine, and we were talking about the Illuminati, and the- Or the Illuminati. Well, the Illuminati. But so, and actually I brought something up, very similar to what you're saying right now, because he is someone who perceives, who believes in the, and I don't know if you want to call it a myth or reality, but who believes in the- Like a ca-ball, kind of thing. Manifestation of this dark force that you're talking about, which is a very small group of nefarious billionaires, has an intentional plan put together to lock down the planet in a kind of neo-totalitarianism, where any kind of autonomy or freedom of thought is not overtly removed, but is removed in a far more horrible way, which is the way that Zizek said, talked about this, the varying forms of totalitarianism. If the boot is on your hand, and it's, or on your throat, and you just know, well, I'm being oppressed, if I say the wrong thing in public, I could disappear, that is referable to the totalitarianism of, he uses the example of a father saying to his son, I'm going to visit your grandmother today, and you don't have to come, but it would mean so much to her that you would come. That's way worse, because now you not only, you don't get to be oppressed, you have to join forces with the oppressor and pretend that this is who I am. So this ca-ball, it knows this, and so the level of oppression that we're experiencing now is not one of overt oppression, but an evolution of totalitarianism, which is a camouflage totalitarianism that actually looks like some kind of brand new, glorious ethical system, which is in fact, crushing creativity, crushing autonomy, and so that's what he believes in. And I was saying to him, okay, but, and I did say this, there must be an opposite, right? There has to be an opposite. If there's a group, a small group of people doing this shit that's like corrupting the earth, is there not a secret school, an actual positive, ethical, sweet, kind, beautiful Illuminati? Is there, is the, or maybe the Illuminati is a misunderstood group of super intelligent people who are actually trying to move society in the direction of some enlightening- Terence talked about the Balkanization of Epistemology, and if you can get that mouth full into you. You're gonna have to break down every, except of. I know what of means. What's interesting is his constant statement, and I completely hold to it, that the horrible truth is no one is in charge. Now, I got an opportunity in the mid-80s when I was down at SC, because I met this banker that I would hang out with every other weekend, and we would structure deals. So we attempted to structure this deal to acquire the pearl of Allah, which was in a storage unit in Denver. It had been sequestered or secreted out of Iran. It's the largest cultured pearl in the world. It's like 2,000 grains or some crazy thing. So these deals would always be coming across this guy's desk, and he had worked for the big shipping magnet, oh, NASA's. Yes. And he'd gone on his own. And so one day he said, hey, you're gonna come and meet Kojak. So Kojak, the actor, no, no, no, no, you'll see. And we went out to, ironically, the embassy suites, the new embassy suites hotel at LAX, free breakfast and the whole thing. And there's this guy in a room, as bald as can be, he's a Turkish guy. His name is Kojak. He was well known within, and he was a professional assassin. So he had this suitcase full of instruments, full of financial instruments that he was trying to move at discount. Like this crap debt from the government in Indonesia, but not the government of Indonesia, but from the Defense Department. Wait, did you say he was a professional assassin? Professional assassin hired by governments. And I waited for my opportunity as a 22-year-old punk kid. Like, you know, Mr. Kojak, can I ask you a question? You know, it was lunchtime and he was sort of off duty. Yeah. But I did notice, I looked out of the left corner of my eye. I'm sorry, I don't mean to keep credit on, but by off duty, you mean he wasn't assassinating people? He wasn't trying to sell financial instruments. I said, well- I'm sorry, I'm just confused, because I don't understand where selling financial stuff and being an assassin meet. Is that like- It was his sort of retirement job. Okay, so he wasn't in the- He wasn't in the business? But he had assassinated. He had assassinated governments and things like this. And so I said to him, you know, and there was people across the embassy suites and another suite with cameras. There was like, I said, like, there's people over there. And he said, yeah, we're always moving. We're always being tracked by somebody. So we're now in Inglewood and then we're moving the whole family compound and et cetera, et cetera. So fair enough, you know, it's that you could expect because he's not working for anybody. Sure. And I said to him, well, you're not working for everybody, why did you quit? He said, because after the 15th or 16th job, I realized that the worst bastards were coming in than the ones I took out for my client. Okay, so I gave up and he said, I said, well, then is there a cabal that runs the world? Right, because this is somebody you could ask, right? This is 1980. How often did you get to ask an assassin question? Yeah, because this is person hired. I think he worked on the IND job for the CIA that I don't know exact details, but the government of Chile was taken out. Jesus. So anyway, so I said to him, well, is there like a cabal running in the world? And he thought for a moment, and this is like the clearest, and he's sort of doing his mental computation. He said, you have to understand my family has been in this shit for about 800, 900 years because we were in Lebanon and we were horse trading and we were doing this kind of work. And my branch is from Turkey, but we've been doing this for eight or 900 years. This is the family business. And he said, I can tell you that after World War II, or World War I rather, there was still the powerful families, the Rothschilds, all the sort of thing. But then when World War II came, it shattered the system. Absolutely shattered it. Bam, gone. The European families were no longer in the game. The families elsewhere, the world was just shocked. And then in the 50s, all the money moved to America, right? So the client base, the the the expressor of power was America. So we moved our business there to do, et cetera, et cetera. Then in the 60s, it started to move to Asia. The money flowed to Asia, flowed to Japan. Then in the 70s, it flowed into the Middle East because of the oil shock, the oil crisis and prices and stuff. And I can tell you, this is 1985, sitting right here, there is no way any human being or any group of human beings can do anything but other than ride the serpent at this point. And then they get thrown off mostly. Nothing is controlling the system. It is a dynamic now that is flowing, ever flowing and ever getting more and more difficult to predicate. And so, no, absolutely not, this is not possible. And that's 1985, that's 30 years ago. And so your average, you know, apparatchic billionaire, you know, obligate, who's obligated to Putin, right? I'm sorry, what is apparatchic? Sort of a Russian term for an operative. Okay, I care. So these are the oligarchs of Russia. I mean, there's hundreds of these oligarchs. But they're fighting amongst themselves, right? They're getting assassinated sometimes. Or they don't wanna cross Putin. So Putin's sort of been a big boss for a lot of them because they became wealthy by thefting the Soviet economy. And then building out from the redevelopment of the former Soviet Union. And no billionaire necessarily gets along with any of the rest of them. And they're trying to ride the same snake. They're trying to see where the winds are going. They're dealing with a crisis upon crisis, non-stop. Right. Crisis upon crisis. This is the one I was talking with. You know, Lama Suryodos, you ever heard of him? I've heard of him, yeah. He's amazing. We were talking about the Bardos, you know, or rather the different realms. And there's the human realm, the human bardo, the howl realm, and then there's the bardo of the gods. And I remember what I found interesting is that the gods are always fighting. They're always like, the gods are always in conflict with each other. And that does, in what you're saying, it seems to get mirrored, is that the high levels of society. But there is a thread that runs through it. So if you, it's almost, it's a thing you can listen to. It's on another channel. And what I've been doing for 30 years now is doing what I call reskinning, which is instead of getting into my little thought frame, you know, into my worldview that I hold tightly, I'm very loose with it. So what I do, I call this a kind of shamanism. So I'm part of a military think tank called the Highlands Group. That we, they have meetings every once in a while and it's open, it's not like a secret thing, but they meet and it's a way for the Pentagon to get information from outside of its bubble from people to tell it what is really actually going on. What are some topics you think about? The last one I was at was about computer security for the Pentagon. Do you feel bad being engaged in that kind of activity? No, because it's a beautiful opportunity. So for example, those people like straight up, they're clear, they're honest, they're forthright, they're wonderful to work with. I mean, you're talking about people that are upper level planners or admirals and generals and people, they're great, they're real clean. And so, and they're honest. But you know, I mean, again, and I know you mean, when I, one of the most moving conversations I've had was a very short one after I was opening for Rogan at the Hermosa Beach Comedy Magic Club and somebody in the Special Forces was at the show and came up to me and he said, ""'Listen, man, I just want you to know ""'you guys talk about drones a lot."" And he almost, now he almost starts crying and he says, we try to do everything we can to not kill civilians. Right. And we, if it usually comes down to like us in a situation where we have, we're gonna die if we don't call in a drone strike. And man, this is not a demon I'm talking to. This is actually the energy he's putting out is not the energy of a reptilian monster. It's the energy of some, a very healthy person and someone who like really clearly does not seem to want to hurt people in the way you would think that the military wants to hurt people. And yet, and yet, we know that what's going on with our military is to summarize it in a very simple word, fucked. It's fucked. It's fucked. We are, the United States military just, they just apparently found out that they cooked their books for over a trillion dollars. They don't know where the money's going. They don't know what's happening over there. And the end result is these little kids are getting blown up. So when you enter into a military think tank, there's gotta be some peace of you, especially here. Here's was an encounter at one of these which is very illustrative. So what I'm trying to do is to get into their skin, to get into their culture and load their cultural operating system. Terrence used to say, don't know New Age nitwit 1.1 or Catholicism 8.0, culture is not your friend. Remember you used to say that. My answer to Terrence is today and was load them all. Because it's a trip man, I could have said that to him. If you can somatically interiorize the self of another and see the world through their eyes, not only, and this happens in flashes when you do this thing, not only is it pure magic and it's delightful, there's a deliciousness to it, but it's so informative and it's so unifying. So by dressing like right today, I'm wearing my typical Southern California, whatever garb, but I'll put on my logo shirt to go to a high level NASA meeting or I'll put on, to go to lightning in a bottle or one of these vessels to wear another outfit. But then I'll load the operating system that I'm getting from that environment so I can see their world. And so then what happens, like I go to a friend's evangelical church services and it's amazing the power that those people feel coming through them. They call it Jesus or the Lord or whatever, but whoa, my God. You felt that power? Oh, it's incredible. So, or you go to the Peruvian Amazon and you feel a different power, but the more you do this, the more you step into the shoes of others, the more you become a flexible malleable system with the boundaries are dissolved. So it's a boundary dissolution thing. And then you can use their language. So what'll happen is I'm talking to somebody who initially is turned off by say, the way I look or whatever. And then I'll start using their acronyms and phrases and stuff. And then I'll see a clicking going on, like a lock in like, oh my God, this guy just told a joke that is actually pretty good for our little world of heating engineers. And then we start, cause I studied ethnography and college as well. Like how do you understand the language people are using? And so then suddenly they're your friend because you're now inside because you totally respect and love them. Like, oh my God, yeah, the system's all fucked up. You know, this heating engineer or the word system means something, it's a loaded word. And then suddenly you're in their world and then you step right into their world. And just I've done this with science multiple times. I've done this with space. I did this virtual worlds. I did this with anthropology. I did this with super nerdy worlds of the Digibar and computer hobbyist collector or the military world or the, in Pakistan, when I go to Pakistan, I don their outfits and I walk through the markets. And because I want to internalize what the Pashtun feeling is, for example. So then you can tell bridging stories. You can bring people together. You're immune. You become immune from all the, you know what you're talking about, this toxic, divisionary, you know, fear mongering. You become completely immune to it because you are like a Benny Gesterit from Dune. You carry all these souls of all of these human beings and it just goes in. You process all of that energy and you see, oh, doesn't it fit? Doesn't fit water off a duck's back. It goes out. But then when the nuggets do come, the unifying fields, the unifying, you know, as you talked about before, the dreams being passed on, you know what they are. Oh, that's really beautiful. Like you hear a story, oh, that's really powerful. I could tell that story over in the military think tank and it would stop the room cold and it did. Like we were debating about the Iraq war. This was in 2003 and a story came out from a whole other community that I told and they just stopped. Like what are we doing? You know. So at the right moment, the crystal appears and you just put it in. It's like you put that, is it niobium or iridium or tritium, you know, in Star Trek where they have to have the right crystal to put in the reactor. You have it. You have it in your pocket. In future crisis, you have that little tritium crystal and you can put it in because you have gone and gotten it. So you're like a harvester. You go out to these ecosystems. You merge with the ecosystem. Hopefully you gather a story or some form of this energy. But my question is this. What are you trying to do? What is it that you want? You're entering into these places. You're taking on the, as you're saying, you start running their OS. But what's your OS? What's the end result you're seeking here? It's truth. What is really going on? What Terrence used to say, what on earth is going on? And it's a living thing. What is the snake doing? Where is it rippling? Because in order to make a big, powerful change in humanity, those tritium crystals, there's only a few that are needed to completely change the direction, to diffuse attention, to understand what, how to act and how to move with power or with subtlety or the right story at the right moment. And the whole cycling, cyclonic, tendril thing will shift direction. And we did this with NASA in 2007. It was like, let's do a test. Can we shift this agency, right? There was a group of us that were like, okay, Bush wants to go to the moon, how can we shift them? And we did it. We did this outside of the agency press release that took six months to compose and it was on the cover of popular science and human mission to asteroid. And I designed the thing. And we did that and we had just the right people to find out because this was politically dangerous. Pete Warden said, I could get fired. You know, he was our two star general running NASA Ames. He already got fired from space command for opposing the Iraq war. So we knew about that backstory. He said, but you can do it. You're not a civil servant. You can do this. You could put this out. And he was part of the asteroid or Neo underground because he was ahead of space command, which ostensibly has a mission to like blow up asteroids if they're coming too close or whatever. But so I did this. I engineered this thing and July 31st, 2007, I did a talk at Industrial Light and Magic at the Letterman Digital Arts Center in this huge auditorium full of people and outside in a display case was Darth Vader. And Pete was called Darth Vader when he was the head of space command. And I call him on my cell phone and said, I'm standing next to your namesake. And we just did it. We just did all the computer graphics that showed this crew vehicle coming and touching the asteroid and airbag rings and everything. And then guys coming out on jet packs. So we did full animations of this whole mission, a new mission for NASA beyond the moon that's between the moon and Mars, right? And it's very valuable. And the administrator had commissioned us to do the study. Rob Landis and his group, and they came to me because they said, can you figure out how to put a crew down, how to architect the ship? Said, I'll do it. And I drew it out in an afternoon and then we built the whole CAD model. And then there's the public release of this thing. So the Letterman Digital Arts Center presentation, AOL ran it as the top story, space.com. We just hit all the sources. And then when Obama was elected, they got rid of the Bush moon plan. And this thing was in people's imagination that somehow this was like an official NASA thing, but we don't know where it came from or whatever. And they switched the agency. The agency turned toward that, says, yes, we've done it. We can, this the right jewel, in the right time, we switched the direction of this agency. Who is we? Well, it was a little group of people that thought, this is, it's dumb to go back to the moon. Right. It's, if we wanna expand human horizons, we need to go and understand these objects. And we're gonna send all these missions there. We need to do an inspiring design for humans to go on a 90 day sortie mission to one of these things that's coming close by the earth. And we need to have a realistic design and no one's gonna take this up. They're too afraid to do it, because they're civil servants. It's too, it's beyond their pay grade. So I got to do it because I had put on their skins for so long and done so many projects for them. And when it came down to it, who do we go to? You know, the ghostbusters and space buster or whatever, they came to me and I got that golden moment, like I'll draw it out for you right now. And I've been thinking about this for 10 years and now it's clear and let's package this and shove it out the door. That's amazing. This reminds me of, there's a pretty uncomfortable moment in the interview I saw, The Grateful Dead, where I think it's Mickey Hart goes up to the Bohemian Grove and somebody in the middle of this interview, they open the audience for questions and somebody's like, hey man, what the hell are you doing up there, basically? And it was great. And Sasha Shulgen used to go there too. Well, it was really interesting to see because you see that he didn't want to answer the question. He felt uncomfortable. And then finally, his response, which reminds me of what you're saying is, those people went out, are they gonna talk to someone like me? Right. And so this concept of the infiltrating warrior of light that goes into the heart of the machine to create some kind of change is also, you see it with Doplin. He's getting it. Yeah. Rick has done it. He did the exact same thing. He really did it. He did the exact same thing. But I feel like there's a danger you must feel because it seems like clearly it works. And you can see that in the story, you just told that it works. And the fact that the Doplin and MAPS, MDMA trials are, it's almost there. So we know that it works. But man, don't you worry that at some point by downloading these operating systems and wearing these skins that you might not be able to take them off all the way, that they might get into you a little bit. And over time, there could be a gradual shift in yourself. But the same way you've shifted them, are you worried about your shift in yourself? This is where our little friend, the Atman comes in. Because if you do, say for instance, you do a vipassana, you do a super strong megadose of psychedelics, you do some kind of extreme sport, right? You go through near-death experience. What does that do? That strips all the skin you're wearing off your body. It just flails you and Atman is left. So if you, you're getting this, if you decide I'm gonna let it go anyway, I'm gonna let all that skin drop now. But instead of then churning about like who am I, why don't I just load another skin and let it, because that helps me drop my skin. So now you become the evangelical, speaking in tongues believer at the church. You just totally give yourself over to it. And as a result, your skin gets slippery, it gets releasable, it's not bolted down anymore. This is what we're all after. So then the Atman is like, whoa, this feels great because he can just drop the skin just like that and pull on another because he's now just here. So I call it putting myself on the shelf, and it's sitting up there on the shelf and a new one is coming in. And people do this all the time when they change gender. Transgender people probably have a pretty well-developed Atman because they've done this very, very painful, difficult thing of changing every aspect of who they are. And they're interesting people to talk to, they're grounded in ways that us squares are not. And so they'll seek out the shape shifters, the skin. Seek out the shape shifter. Seek out the shape shifter. This is why I'm so excited about VR. By the way, it's 306. Do you have a little bit of time? Sure, yeah. So this is why I'm excited about VR. I just had a meeting in virtual reality because I'm gonna start doing live podcasts and VR on this format called Alt Space. And so I had a meeting with someone from Alt Space. By the way, I'd love to do one with you. I had a meeting with someone at Alt Space. And so we met in a virtual theater where first he appeared as a robot to talk to me, some kind of robot avatar. And then he left for a second and he came back as a woman. And we talked for a little while. And then we were talking on the phone. He's like, did you notice how my gender, what I look like totally was irrelevant? Like you just didn't know, it didn't matter. It doesn't matter that one of the great offerings of virtual reality is that it allows us to experience the ottoman by putting on these skins, a particular avatar that you're referring to. It's beautiful, it's like going to Burning Man and just being the radically changed, pink tutu wearing French maid on Tuesdays. Right, yeah, it is like that. And it's, to me, there's something, I was talking to a friend of mine about VR and I was saying that at this point, if you try virtual reality just once, then you can never be the same again because your mind has been completely immersed in a digitized reality, alternate reality, whatever you wanna call it. And that's, as far as we're aware, outside of dreaming psychedelics, maybe some initiatory rights that. Or good Hollywood filmmaking. Good Hollywood filmmaking, you know, and Romdaz talks about this, the absorption into the film. Like the one that Robin Williams did where he was inside the paintings, remember that? And he's like flopping down a field of flowers and they're all melting around him? Oh yeah, yeah, that was true. That was, to me, the closest to a VR immersive film. It was pretty cool. Yeah, I can't remember the name of it. Our minds do seem to be trained to go into stories. Like, as a function of the human mind, if I'm reading a book and I'm not careful, and even now, and I think, God, we're slogging through Moby Dick right now, man. Me and a friend. You are. We're like slogging through, man. But when I think back to my memories of Moby Dick, I really don't remember listening to the audio book. I remember standing on the deck. Deck of the ship. Yes, and the way it was coming off. Yes, I remember that. So our minds, they do swim into these environments, but VR, it's an amplification of it to the most extreme that has ever existed as far as I'm aware of this planet. So I'm really curious, because you brought with you a book that you wrote on VR, alternate realities. Virtual worlds, yeah. Virtual worlds, and the book is like from, it's a while back, so. 20 years ago. So what are your thoughts right now on the fact that not only are people shifting their genders and technology is allowing this complete, because it is, I think, a technological feat that maybe hasn't been accessible to people to be able to go through the varying medications that you need to go through to change your hormones and the operations, this is pretty new. You could always dress up like another gender. And theoretically, there were some rudimentary surgeries, I guess, but now you can really do it. But now also it's entering into the digital realm. So what are your thoughts on the where VR is right now and the implications for what, the implications for us as a society with this new technology that we have access to? I think we're part way there. There's a positive and a negative. Then the positive is we've got the processing power, we probably have the haptics that we didn't have in the 90s to give the touch feeling. We have AR, which we didn't have really in the 90s, which doesn't force people to be completely immersed so that their vestibular system doesn't get all messed up and they don't get sick. So if you read Werner Venge's novel, Rainbow's End, that is the great book of AR, it was written in 2006. It's about North San Diego County, it's a wild ride. It's set in 2029. It's like the best sci-fi book about AR. Cool. It's a really beautiful read. Anyway, get your head into that one. You'll read it in like two days and it's like wow. God, any break from Moby Dick, I'll just go into that. Yeah, Rainbow's End. So all that we're getting there, the bad news is the lessons that the mistakes made in VR from 1988 to 94 are being made all over again. The same mistakes. What has happened, and you hear it in the language of people, people became world struck. I coined this term in 1996 when VR became virtual worlds and went onto the internet and you had avatars in these fairly simple worlds, but very compelling worlds. That's what the book is about, the avatars book. People then thought they could do anything with these worlds. And I call it a syndrome, the syndrome of being world struck. They're awestruck by all this and their imagination goes crazy. So they became world struck. There's a precedent for all this, 1896. This was 100 years before the explosion of virtual worlds on the internet. There was an inventor working for Thomas Alva Edison in the early, I think in the late 1880s, who had really made the film camera. So this guy then worked on a projector. Yes. So he went and proposed this projector to Edison. We can just take an ordinary film, movie theater, actor, might be limmy, and we can project the image on a screen and people will be able to watch our films. Now Edison fired the dude, because why? Because Edison made its money on appliances. And they were selling the kinetoscopes, where you put your head in and 200 feet of tape of film would roll through and you had these little iPod earbuds for the sound, there was a cylinder playing. And they wanted those on every street corner. But it was an encumbered way of experiencing film. And ladies would not bend over to look into this thing because it would expose them, in a sense. It was socially also unacceptable. This is 1896. So I think he went off and did his own thing or the brother's Lumiere made cinema in France. Same thing happened in VR, encumbered way of experiencing a reality. A few people tried it out five bucks instead of a nickel, 100 years before. And it kind of was a wave that passed. And then what I chronicled in the mid 90s, and I formed organizations and conferences was, okay, the same thing is happening when film went from an encumbered immersive experience to a shared social experience on the movie screen, the same thing is happening on the internet now with virtual worlds running in little windows with your mouse and the zillion people in the world talking or building or something like Second Life became later or Minecraft or whatever. So I saw this explosion happen starting in 95. And that's why I wrote the book on it. Like this is a whole new world, but this was what VR promised, but what was realized were these on-screen, unencumbered worlds that people still got immersed into. Yeah, sure. And larger and larger screens and et cetera. And so then virtual worlds seemed to go into a winter, but emerged as World of Warcraft, Ultima online, et cetera. And became a giant industry with thousands of platforms that are all incompatible and blah, blah, blah, but it's a kind of a metaverse. And that became a real thing. When VR came back, a bunch of us old timers took a look, you know, and I went to a few maker fairs and saw some of the systems. I said, okay, same mistakes are being made. It's really difficult to make good content for these environments. Because it's not content, it's experience. And it's a crafting experience. You have to be an architect, a film director, a sound engineer, whatever, to make good experience. It's costly, the tools are cumbersome, as they were for VRML and stuff in the 90s. You know, fricking wire frames and texture mapping and stuff like that, it's hard. People can't do that. 1% of 1% of content creators can run a 3D modeling tool. It's just really hard stuff and it's very technical. So the content's constricted. Then you have the same problem of the vestibular system issue. The vestibular system, yes. Everything you said before that, I have to disagree with that. Only because we already have, fortunately, we already have, and people have to port it over. But if you look at the state of video games now, these are 3D worlds that people have already spent zillions of dollars on creating. So shifting those worlds to be virtual reality accessible is a technical feat, no doubt, but not impossible. Yeah, and I agree with you and like Pokemon and things like that, totally. And VR always seem to be playing into the game player space. Yes. And it will probably have some success there, but I don't think it's anywhere close to being mainstream. I can't wait for you to see, oh god, I can't wait for you to see this. Thank god it is, it's pretty close. I mean, it's definitely like. But on the other hand, the Vive is using a cell phone. Well, no, the Vive, oh no, no, no, the Vive, see these two on my wall there? You see these two sensors? So you walk around in there. Oh, and it's mapping, it's a holodeck. It's holodecking. And it's got real time controllers. So the vestibular problem is a problem, which is that your body does not understand how you're moving and your inner ear isn't reacting to the movement. So what the fuck is happening? C-sickness is a result. And the temporary solution and a pretty good solution thus far is that inside what you'll see when we're done with the podcast is you teleport. So you have varying systems of teleportation where your body leaps from one point to the next to the next, you don't get sick that way. I have a couple of apps, like a virtual reality ski program. And the boxing program that you and Joe were using. The boxing program, it doesn't fuck with your, it doesn't make you sick because you're moving around inside the space. Your body is part of it. Yeah, but the vestibular problem is definitely a problem. But you'll see when you go in there that maybe a lot of what you... I could be convinced. I think that you will be convinced. And on top of that, we'll go into alt space and you can have a conversation with someone in there. Yeah, and that was a problem in the first generation of VR. It was single user. It wasn't social. Right, and that is actually, when you start fooling around VR, usually you're gonna do some of these experiences that are, you're by yourself. And that's okay. We play video games alone. But you want people to... It's a communal activity to watch TV, play video games. So yeah, we need that. But then when you go into the social aspects of VR and suddenly you're on a spaceship, talking to someone and it's working perfectly. Well, one of the interesting early, so I convinced William Morris Agency to send people to our first avatars conference in 96. So they came and we posed the following scenario to them which was interesting for a talent agency. Representing these names, which was what happens when the fans build a virtual enterprise where they're acting as Spock or data or whatever, whatever generation. And it's so good that it's attracting millions of people. But that's all your property, right? What do you do? How do you interface with this world? That's how I convinced them to come out to the avatars. That's cool. Conference, and they were really interested because who owns the content? Is it parodies, is it protected under free speech? Whatever, because there's so many Trek fans that would build such a world and inhabit it. You'll be pleased to know that one of the, in the VR world that we're all very excited about is there's actually Star Trek is releasing. They are getting something. A VR where you're on, I can't remember the name of it. Actually, I'll look it up for you right now. It's called, it's called, let's see here, Star Trek VR. It's called a bridge crew. Bridge crew. So you're on the bridge and you're, it's actually, it's a kind of, it's a perfect, I haven't looked at the trailer yet, we can watch it, but there's a lot of ways to solve the vestibular problem. I think I imagine like. Well, in the book, in the avatars book, in 97, when it was published, I wrote a piece which was called the home holodeck. In that, like the holodeck on Star Trek Next Generation, if you had a room which is so fricking high resolution, right? No seams visible, because that's curving floors like a blue screen studio. Yes. And it was incredibly realistic. So you don't have to wear a head mount display. And you go in there and it's just beautiful. And you're just walking in this room and it's, the pixels are just so fine grained. It's better than 35 millimeter film. And stuff is happening this. The sound is done right. Yeah. Multispatial, multi-dimensional sound and air movement, so whatever, that we will crack this thing. And I predicted it for 2004, but I was vastly under. You know what, let's pause, I'll show it to you, and then we'll come back for the very last of the podcast and have a brief discussion about it. Only because how often you are one of the, you know, you've been working in this realm for decades. A long time, yeah. So it's gonna be interesting to hear what you think about where it is now. Let's just pause for a second, check it out, and then we'll come back. Is that cool? Yep, save that file. Okay, we are back. What do you think? Oh my, I wouldn't say God. Oh, my virtuosity is compromised. No, that is just astounding. Yeah. You know, for an old war horse like me who's been out of the scene for, you know, 15 years, that's just amazing, Duncan. Yeah. Yeah, totally. Yeah, I feel the same way. I mean, I know that I've gotta be getting annoying to some people, but it's such an overwhelming thing to realize that this is something humans can do now. It just, it blows my mind. I mean, It's part of that force that's rising against the toxic, you know, side, our worst nature. It's our better nature rising against our worst tools. That's exactly how I feel. And that's why it produces, what's interesting about this technology is it produces an inadvertent missionary where you wanna show it to people because there's something in it that many of us are realizing has this power that is going to help things in some way that I don't know if we know exactly how. We don't know how. It's like the great tools, like the book that comes, you know. We don't know. What's interesting is, you know, the automobile was called a horseless carriage, right? Right. And nobody had an idea. You know, people had to be mechanics to run it. And to fix their cars. And then there was towns where you had to walk with a flag before the car. So you didn't scare and spook horses. And this is kind of where this is now, which is we're calling it virtual reality, but it's not part of our planar reality. No. You know, and this could be just another slip-in dimension in our planar reality. Yeah. I prefer the term evolved reality or it says upgraded reality or I don't know what you wanna, I don't know what it is. You experience a, and I saw you, when you realized, oh shit, I can throw a Frisbees. Yeah. Oh shit, I'm immediately like having this fun interaction with somebody named Snake Pliskin. Right, right. Instantly, none of the bullshit, none of the, hey, whatever, whatever. You're immediately playing with people. And your mind is accepting that they're there. And that's where you rise. This is a thing of light. Not a thing of darkness. It's at least socially, it's like, hey, what's up? Catch this Frisbee. I'm gonna put this thing on your head. Look, I'm coming up. And it's in the early days. Yes. You know, and will we imagine a crazed dictator in the future lecturing to 10,000 people, screaming at 10,000 people in this world? Will we see that? Or will we, we'll see everything, actually, that is possible here. Cause I'd be able to tell my story of the origin of life in here and, you know, everything. Immersed people in anything. Well, that's what we're gonna, I mean, hopefully, what we should, the next time we podcast, and we only have a few minutes, cause you do have to hit the road to get to Laguna, we're gonna do it in there. Okay. And, and by then, maybe we can actually, you could do a kind of presentation to show some stuff prior to us talking. If I can, if I can put images on surfaces. Oh, good. Okay. So we'll, we'll like set that up and then you can give a present. If you're into it. Then we can capture it as a movie and stick it up on YouTube and stuff like that. Exactly. That's the other beautiful thing about it is, it's not limited to people with VR goggles. After we do it, we could definitely put it on YouTube and it'll be there forever. So that's what we'll do. Let's do it. Thank you so much for being a guest on the show. You're a wonderful human. It's a pleasure to finally meet you after all this time. And we think we have some more territory to cover. So much. Thank you very much. Safe travels to Laguna Beach. Thanks for listening everybody. That was Dr. Bruce Dahmer and a big thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode.

56^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Dan Harmon Transcript and Discussion^2017-09-16^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Feral audio. Hello everybody. You're listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family, our podcast with the great Dan Harmon. Today's podcast is brought to you by Squarespace.com. I hope you're not one of those people out there who has decided to hire a cheap web designer. It's one of the worst things that a person can do. In fact, the Presidential Council of America put it number three on the list of the 10 worst things you could do in America. Number three is to hire a cheap web designer. This is one of the top causes of murder in the United States. A lot of serial killers disguise themselves as web designers. They post on Craigslist an ad that they will, for $30, help you create a website to sell your knitted socks. And the next thing you know, you're hanging upside down in somebody's basement, watching coils of your intestine fall in front of your face as a man dressed in an executioner's outfit, holding a giant black phallus approaches you. And before you go into shock, the last thing that you think is, my God, if only I'd gone to Squarespace.com. Squarespace.com gives you the ability to create aesthetically pleasing high-tech websites with everything that you might need without having to learn HTML, which is another cause of not death, but Alzheimer's disease and tremors can come from trying to learn HTML or any kind of computer coding can really send you into a downward spiral that will usually result in you having one of those like embarrassing neurological diseases that most people think as a result of all the cocaine you did when you were coming up with your half-baked business idea. But is in fact, because you actually tried to learn HTML to build the thing and it just fucks with your, it fucks with your dopamine, brother. You don't wanna mess with it, man. You don't wanna mess with it. You don't wanna go down that road. Don't go down the HTML highway. It's a highway where on either side of its black broken cobblestone are the bodies of crucified entrepreneurs who in the process of trying to manifest their great business idea gave up because they couldn't figure out how to use HTML. And it's a mess. You don't wanna go into that quick sandpit. It is filled with the skeletons of so many poor souls who were way too ambitious and thought that in a period of a few days, they could learn something that authentic web designers spend their entire life doing, which is why they cost so much money. A lot of us don't have a lot of money to create websites or maybe before you shell out the cash to pay a professional web designer to make you the next Facebook, you wanna stick your toe in the digital ocean to see if maybe your business idea will even work. And it probably will work. I've had people on this podcast who made a nice amount of money just from selling their dirty socks on the internet. Just from selling their dirty socks, they made a ton of cash. Now, whatever you think about America, it can't be that bad a country if you can actually make a living from selling dirty socks or fingernails or locks of your hair or whatever it is out there. So many people need these things in their lives. They need your socks. And there's other ways, of course, you can make money with a website or if you don't wanna make money, you could just, maybe you wanna create a blog where you could post pictures of, I don't know, your family or your dog, whatever it is, you could, now you can do it for a relatively inexpensive amount of money. I think it's for a mere $8 a month, you can start down the path that ends with you living in some kind of opulent mansion in another country because you had to leave America because whatever your website was became so potent and powerful that the NSA tried to send assassins into your house to kill you, which is a sign that you're doing something right these days. Squarespace, eight bucks, they throw in, if you sign up for a year, you get a free domain name and it's an all-in-one platform that's got everything you need to make a high-level website. Hey, guys, the Silk Road went down. That means there's a space in the market for a new Silk Road. I don't know if you could sell illegal drugs through Squarespace, but I imagine you could. You could probably sell anything through Squarespace, I don't know, but you could probably sell plutonium rods through Squarespace. Get into the internet, man. What are you doing? You hermit sitting in your Alaskan cabin roasting squirrel corpses that you found frozen in the snow on top of your fire that's rapidly going out. Why are you living in that kind of world when you could be in a nice, cozy, comfortable mansion looking out over the ocean, watching whales that you have named being fed barrels of kelp thrown out of your helicopter by your bodyguards? You could get there today just by going to squarespace.com.

Squarespace.com will be the conduit through which someone invents a self-replicating matter assimilator that causes the entire planet to eventually be covered in matter assimilators. So get on that train squarespace.com, put my name in Duncan 11, that's the code, you get 10% off and also it helps support the podcast. So go do that. We're also brought to you by amazon.com. Guys, come on. Christmas is right around the corner. It is right around the corner and it is time to become locusts and just buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy as much stuff as you can and give that stuff to your family and friends and don't even think about how fucking weird it is that you're feeling stressed out about that or doing it. Just please get sucked into the cyclone of consumerism, materialism and start buying stuff. It's fun, I like it. I've bought all kinds of things. I just bought a Razer Hydra through amazon.com. The Razer Hydra is this controller that I'm going to use with my Oculus Rift that will make it so that I don't have to use my keyboard anymore. I can just hold these two weird wand things and wander through virtual space without being troubled by having to pull the Rift up to fuck around with my keyboard. Got it on amazon.com. You can buy everything on amazon.com. The only thing that you can't find on there is organs but it's getting close to that point. If you go through the portal at DuncanTrussell.com, I mean like human organs. I'm sure they have pipe organs or something there. If you go through DuncanTrussell.com and go through our web or Amazon portal, they for some reason still mysterious to me. I know that this isn't kind of advertising for them but it seems like advertising for amazon.com is very similar to advertising for food as in generic food. Everyone knows about amazon.com. I don't know. Maybe you haven't realized yet that you don't have to leave your house anymore. Maybe that hasn't occurred to you. This glorious truth that the only time you need to leave your house is when it's on fire. You can take pictures of your checks and deposit them in your bank account. You can order food. This is the, we are existing in the greatest age ever if you are a recluse. It's never been better to be an insular recluse living in the safe comfort of your house. And amazon.com is the champion of recluses all over the planet. And for that, we thank you amazon.com. Oh great lord and master of our lives. Go through the portal, buy whatever it is you need to buy. Japanese bondage ropes, they've got them. They've got them. You name it and it's there. Music, everything. Even the bonus episode of the last bonus episode I did is on amazon.com. How do you like that? This is a goddamn sandwich commercial. I'm selling shit within shit. Sorry, but guys, come on. You're hearing the song of capitalism here and we've all got to sing it from time to time. Why not go to amazon.com, buy some great stuff for your family and friends, go through our portal and we get a small percentage. It's a way for you to support the podcast while getting the things you need. You could even order toilet paper through amazon.com. And I don't know if you guys have seen World's Ultimate Cheapskates on Lifetime Network, but I just learned that there are people who will take two-ply toilet paper and pull the two-ply toilet paper in half so that they have half the depth of toilet paper, which they then use to wipe their asses. So think about that. It's always buy one, get one free when you're a cheapskate and you're not afraid to poke through your toilet paper into your disgusting asshole. That's one of the great things you can do through amazon.com. Go through the portal, please, and watch that show Cheapskates. They don't sponsor me. It's pretty funny. It gives you the heebie-jeebies to watch that stuff. Finally, as always, we are sponsored by ShortDesignT-Shirts.com. Here's a little bit of trivia about ShortDesignT-Shirts.com and it's something a lot of people don't know. Stephen Hawking, he didn't start off that way and a lot of people think that he got that way because of some progressive neurological disorder, but the truth of the matter is, is that he's a physicist, a very famous physicist, for those of you who don't know, and he has a certain idea of the way physics works and the way the universe works. He thinks he understands the core pillars that hold up the great swirl of atoms that is the dimension that we're currently stuck in. See, ShortDesignT-Shirts directly goes against every known law of physics. The shirts are so soft that scientists just don't understand it. And as the story goes, Hawking used to be a basketball player. He was like six foot four. He was a really professional athlete and he was on his way to the major leagues, but he was also fascinated by science and physics and had already been deeply studying this stuff in between playing basketball. They say that's part of why it was such a great player is because he was so familiar with the laws of gravity, but they say that somebody, when he was in the locker room, he locked himself out of his locker and he needed a shirt and someone tossed him a ShortDesignT shirt and he put it on and basically his brain collapsed like the Twin Towers. Only it wasn't a plane that flew into that part of his mind which thought it understood science. It was a ShortDesignT shirt, but it had the exact same effect. His mind imploded in the same way as though there was dynamite or plastic explosives or thermite at the base of his logical mind. It imploded inward and with it the rest of his body. And because of that, it ruined his basketball career but opened up his way to become one of the most renowned physicists of our time. And in his books, he always thanks ShortDesignT shirts for leading him in that direction. So, what a great company. Go to ShortDesignTshirts.com, check out these wonderful shirts, be careful when you wear them. When you wear them, step out of your mind, open yourself up to the possibility that some things are softer than logic. And when you wear this shirt, you will, your skin will come. Each of your pores will ejaculate rainbow-colored fluid which you should bottle up and save for after the big earthquake. ShortDesignTshirts.com, put my name in and you will get 10% off of these wonderful shirts. For those of you who have been donated to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour, thank you. As always, thank you so much. And thank you to those of you who have been buying stuff from our shop. We've got t-shirts, posters, one weird satanic bonus episode of the podcast and lots of other great stuff there. But the most important thing that you could do is go to DuncanTrestle.com and join the forum. And if you don't wanna do that, just keep listening. Thank you for listening. I hope you guys are having a wonderful pre-Thanksgiving and are getting ready to have a blast with your wonderful family. And go back to that sweet country home and sit on the bear skin rug with your Tolkien-esque family, just bathing in all that sweet love and happiness that comes when we all get together with our precious families. All that wonderful joy and acceptance of each other and pure forgiveness that is what every single family experiences in America during Thanksgiving. Today's guest for the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast is the creator of Community. And he also has got an incredible podcast called Harmentown, which has a live show every Sunday at Meltdown Comics here in Los Angeles. So if you're in Los Angeles, you should come, you should listen to his podcast, but you should also come see the live show. This guy blows my mind every single time. And he's creating a TV show, which is not an easy thing to do. And he came to do my podcast after having been at work all day long. And I think that's pretty fucking cool because if I spend more than a few hours doing anything, I have to rest for a couple of days. So it's awesome that Harman came over. He's an amazing person. Everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour the beautiful Dan Harman. The crown of happiness. Welcome, welcome on you, As you are with us. Shake it, don't be blue, Welcome to you. Welcome. Welcome, Dan Harmon. Thank you so much for having me back. Thanks for coming back. I, it's, for those of you, it's nine, it's ten or eleven. What time is it? It's later than that. It's eleven forty-seven. Late at night. You've been working all day and thanks for taking the time to come and do the podcast. Super cool. It's late at night. You're listening to Duncan Tressel. Up next is boring man. Boring man, hello boring man. He's going to bore the fuck out of you. Hope you like listening to things that you can't resonate with. At all. Guaranteed, we did the studies. Just about time for a story about his gardener. After that, there'll be three complaints about being rich. Yeah, right. Do you, do you find yourself overcome by that kind of stuff really? Like, does it, do you get weirded out by being rich? I've been, I haven't had time to, I had the year where I was doing almost nothing. It was freaking out. My, workaholism and alcoholism like take care of the in-between spots. Right. Wait, let me try to make that make sense. If I have something to do, I don't even notice what's going on with my life. And then, so that every once in a while I stop having something to do and my, I have like, I have money and I don't have time to react to it. And I haven't had time yet. But I think my reaction will be that I will blow it all out my ass and ruin my life. Ruth, isn't that a, that's a weird component of having, like I'm sure you've been through periods of abject poverty. But then when you have a ton of money, you then realize. Just wipe your ass with it. And you're, there's a terrifying aspect of having a lot of money too. It's like the, almost similar to when you were broke outside of the itching, horrific, paranoia and the desperation. There's this, there's this feeling that you have like this great capacity to really destroy yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I could definitely say without a shadow of a doubt that the, if you charted my financial ups and downs and my emotional spiritual ups and downs, they would be totally unrelated curves. I don't know that they would be inversely proportionate. I'm not that crazy that I'm going to say, oh yeah, the richer you get, the unhappier you are. I don't think that's true. I don't. But I know that they're unrelated. I know that I've been the most miserable at my, you know, at the point where materialistically I should not have anything to be miserable about. But you're not a materialist at all. You don't, you don't seem like a materialist. I could be wrong. I don't know. You don't seem like, I've met materialists. It seems like it'd be pretty hard to, to get you into like typical material shit. Am I wrong about that? I, I guess I, I, I, I'm definitely not a mountain man. I'm, I'm like, I like. No, you got a nice place. But I'm, I'm saying like you're, you like the idea of like the, a lot of people have this kind of insane attraction to matter. Like they really want really nice cars and like, you know, fancy, they actually want, I'm talking about like Jay-Z or something. You know, where you see images of him and he's wearing, I just saw this picture of him and he's wearing a, it looks like a bicycle chain, but bigger, but it's made of gold. It's clearly just pure, pure, probably really heavy, probably very uncomfortable. It's like he's, any other metal and it would suck to have it around your neck, but because it's gold, he like, he likes it. Right, he loves them again. Yeah, I don't, I don't know. I mean, I'm fascinated by those guys like Corolla and Mikhail and Ryan Styles and the car guys. Yes. They love the cars. Yes. That's, that's, that's gotta be a really easy way to blow through a lot of money. Like, like, and then Jeff Davis loves his suits. Suits. And he, but he doesn't spend anything on anything else. He's got a lot of money, I bet, squirreled away. Yeah. My friend Jeff Davis, I don't, I don't, I'm acting like he's on the cover of Us Weekly and I'm referencing him. I think people know he is. But if, and he's, he lives in this little, little hobbit hole, like this little unassuming little, little one bedroom apartment and, but he, by his own confession, he just wants a specific car. He wants his suits. I don't, I've been driving the same shoe since whenever I got it and I'll keep driving until it breaks down. I don't, I don't look at a car as anything other than like a sock that you wear to keep from stepping on weird shit when you drive to work. And it's, it's something that you can wreck, you know, and, and why would you want it to be fancy? Right. But my house, I would, I would, I'm like, you know, when you play Grand Theft Auto and your house gets bigger and bigger. Yes. I'm into that. Yeah. I mean, you've got it. I've seen your house. Very nice house, but I mean, it's still like, it doesn't have that sense of a, you know, it's a nice place, but it doesn't have that garish, like, palatial sense that you get sometimes when you go to someone who's a materialist house, like where they've got like pillars and you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My dreams have been so small for so long. Yeah. I like, like, um, I couldn't, I could never get past fireplace. Right. And, uh, because whenever my parents weren't fighting, they had a fire going and, uh, whenever we felt rich and comfortable and like we had earned happiness that, that was always when a fire was going in the basement and my parents were happy and the, the tinkle in his glass of the ice cubes, the, you know, having a nice glass of whatever the hell he drank and like I have like preset sort of like, this is what I need to buy with my money. I need to buy happiness. I need a fireplace. I need, I need to be allowed to be drinking and, uh, I need kind of like music coming from wherever. Even though I have horrible taste in music, I have like this obsession about the speaker system in the house has to be like, I have to be able to turn on and I, if you saw how much I used it, it would be, it would, everyone would be like, you don't, you don't, you don't even know, you're still listening to Tori Amos, like from when you were 20, like you, you, you just, you've just, I'm obsessed with making sure that I can hear a song in the toilet. My brother loves Tori Amos. Uh, that, yeah. So, so Tori Amos, do you think that's bad taste in music? No, well, no, I don't, I, God, Jesus, if you're listening to Tori, no, heavens no. Um, no, no, I, I, I don't think that that's bad taste in music. I think for me to be 40 years old and still rattling that off when I think about music because that's what I, that's what I was into when I was 25. That's, I have a sedentary taste in music. I don't think you need to feel, yes, I have a sedentary taste too. And I don't think this whole goddamn music guilt thing, it's so weird. Like people feel guilty for, or even worse, like somebody judges you because of the type of music you listen to. Like I got that, I got like walloped when Lou Barlow did the podcast that I was the lavender out in Natasha. We are getting all, we are ready to get really snotty. I think about, fuck, what's her name? Uh, God damn it. Uh, she dated Russell Brand. Fireworks. Uh, Katy Perry. Katy Perry. And like one of us fired off something about how awful Katy Perry must be. And this is like Lou Barlow, Dinosaur Junior, Sebado. A god in my mind, like the ultimate taste maker of music. And he was like, I don't know, I've heard songs by Katy Perry that move me. And if a song moves me, then I just think it's good. And it was just such a crushing blow to that, you know, that part of you, the part that wants there to be, you know, shitty music or the part of you that wants to be able to like create this hierarchy of taste. Yeah. Well, nobody can convince you that Led Zeppelin is bad, better than Jeff Davis. And then one day I was driving in his car and Jack Black was in the back seat. And somehow Led Zeppelin came up and Jeff started in on his very convincing, very valid, like, Led Zeppelin is bad, Ty right. And partway into it, Jack Black in the back goes, Zeppelin's cool. And it was kind of, it was sort of like, you can't really argue with it. Like, um, but anyways, that's why I don't go into those waters. That's why when music, race, or alcohol comes up, I just go, I'm an alcoholic, I'm racist, I have bad taste in music. Maybe I believe it, maybe I don't, but one thing's for sure, you can only get in trouble by thinking otherwise. If you think you're not racist, you're probably going to end up being racist. If you think you're not an alcoholic, you're going to drink more. If you think that you have great taste in music, you might have accidentally fucking diss Katy Perry at the wrong time, at the wrong place. So if you have bad taste in music, I get into an elevator and there's something playing. Like, what's that Lord song, the Royals, whatever? Like, I fucking, I click the number one thing. I'm like, oh, what are the kids listening to? It's like, holy shit, I'm having an emotional experience. I'm allowed to. I have bad taste in music. I don't care. I don't care who comes into my home and catches me listening to Phil Collins or whatever is at the top of the charts. Like, I will, if I say I have bad taste in music, then I'm covered. Well, you know that the, I don't remember, it's been so long since they taught me this. I guess it also works with solar panels, but with plants, when it gets dark, they, they, they, even though they're still apparently energy in the air or something, they, they don't process it anymore. Maybe they do. I can't remember. Solar panels, when it's dark, they can't process energy. So, so people who've decided that this thing is good or this thing is bad, they're no longer able to process the energy of a huge amount of stuff out there. So like, they're the people who close off immediately when they hear anything that has to do with Christianity, for example. If you bring that up around the wrong person, they shut down or anytime like, like the Lord's song comes on, which by the way, I'm so sick of that song. Everywhere you go, it's playing. I got, I got, I'm now sick of it too, because I played it five times on the way here. It's, it plays everywhere, but this is like a, I, in some, I think it's in this book, Gris for the Mill by Ram Dass. He talks about how he's meditating with all these people and apparently they're next to a fire station. And there's sirens that keep happening and people are getting annoyed because sirens keep happening that are getting in the way of their meditation. And his thing is like, no, that's just, that's as much of a vibration as anything else. And it's all, it's all something that can be used to sort of expand your consciousness. So that's good to have bad taste. In fact, having bad taste in music is actually kind of the same as saying you have good taste in music, isn't it? Or no taste in music. Yeah, it certainly is. It's just taking your hands off of a wheel that you have no stake in. Like that's what's nice is that if something goes wrong with my toilet, I can grab a plunger and just go at it. I have no investment in whether I do a good job or a bad job of keeping my toilet from overflowing. Right. And, and, but, but when I go to work and write a sitcom, like it's such misplaced ego to like think that that's somehow different. When, when all, all I really should be doing is like, I got to get this done, but we all have that. Right. We all, we all have identities and our identities are, they, they're focused on the shit that we think we've decided this is my shit. This is my, this is what makes me different. Yeah. Like, like I, and then you let, you let, because some of us are really, really cool about music and some of us are really uptight because some people have decided that that's their thing. Right. And I don't, I don't, I would never be able to, I think I've talked to people for whom music is their thing that are delightful to talk to. And of course I think if you're not, if music isn't your thing and you're not like a music snob, you can't even really like diss music snobbery because if I have a decent CD in my house in 1998, it's because I cross paths with someone who left it there, who does care about that shit. Right. And those people like they, you know, they're, they drive everything because they care about music. And some of them are like, thank God they're snobby about it. So that you should also shouldn't feel bad about being a snob. I'd be about having an opinion about Katy Perry in front of Lou Barlow, but that's an example of like, like if you're regretting anything, it's like you all of a sudden thought, oh, did I even really think what I just said? Yeah. I didn't think it. I barely listened to Katy Perry. Barely listened to Katy Perry. I was sassin' off because I thought it was cool. Right. I got slapped for it. And I liked that. And I'm glad I said it. And that's, yeah, like you're talking about with Christianity is like that Bill Maher reflex. Yes. Fuck it. It's theology therefore. It's crippling everybody. And I know exactly what to say and how to say it and when to say it. Whenever anyone brings up anything, I'm going to bra, bra, bra, bra, because this is my area and I've got my little canal that comes into my, like my warehouse district and it feeds and it exports and it's got walls and it's got structure. This is my gimmick. I'm Venice. My house is on stilts. This is where you eat breakfast and it's like, yeah, and who's to say if that's good or bad architecture because Venice is sinking. Yeah, that's right. And the Pentagon isn't. So, so I don't know. Maybe being a prick is the way to, you know, maybe being stubborn is like better than. No way, man. I got it. I just. Ram Dass saying that sirens sound good. Yeah. Sirens sound great. Yeah. Right. Maybe Ram Dass should have treated himself that morning. They're going like, you know what? Fuck sirens. Like with just one little cookie, one little chicken McNugget, Ram Dass, just eat it. You activated fucker. You activated fucker, son of a bitch. Well, that's what's cool about Ram Dass is because he doesn't pretend to be great because in the midst of those stories of the sirens or the stories of him standing in line, you know, at a porno theater after he'd come back from India, have you heard that story? No, no. It's a great story because he's like in line, you know, he's this is like after people know that this is Ram Dass, the, you know, post psychedelic spiritual teacher of the world and he's, I guess, decided to get in line back in the day. You couldn't go on the internet to jerk off, you know, you had to like go to a porno theater if you're really horny, if you wanted to jerk off to porn and he's in line at this porno theater to jerk off, I guess. And this is in his mystical period and then somebody walks by him as he's like standing by this theater to go and he's like Ram Dass, oh Ram Dass, you mean so much to me and he's talking to him and he's like in line to jerk off at this theater and he realizes he has this decision he has to make at this point, which is he can act like he wasn't in line and he'll jerk off to porn and go with this guy to have coffee or something and like be a spiritual advisor. Or he can make porn a spiritual inclusive thing. Exactly. He can incorporate porn into his spiritual life. That's it and that's what he did. He said, you know, nice to meet you but I'm going in here now. And you know, I'm sure that that guy was like, what the fuck? But really, you know, that's like that sort of all-encompassing idea, exactly what you're saying really, which is the idea is that if you can just land on yourself, you're doing great. How can keep the truth on your side so that because in this world you're going to end up in so many conversations where you have no idea whether you're full of shit or not. So the fallback has to be that you tend your own garden, speak from experience and be honest about how you really feel, including not being afraid to not know how you feel about the eight billion things you don't know how to feel about. And that way anyone that argues with you, they're arguing with how you feel. And so you could say like, I think that chair over there is ugly. I mean, really, like who thinks a chair is ugly? But you go, yeah, I think it's ugly. And then someone go, well, that's a Pierre-Cardaud-Jean-Babadou chair. He's the chair genius and he's half autistic and, you know, all the money that he makes chairs with goes to the breast maximization of the African children. And at the end of it all, you still can go like if you go like, well, I, that, that, is fantastic, but I, I'm going to stick with the fact that I think it's ugly. I, I now think it's ugly and that it's awesome that the guy made the chair. When did you figure all this out? You had, you didn't go, you had to have gone through a shitty phony period. Like how did you, or did you step this? Now I have to, I mean, you're implying that I'm somehow authentic now. So I got, instead of getting derailed by that, I'll answer your question and say, I figured out that one big trick about keep the truth on your side, like in my late 20s. I think I grew up arguing with people on the internet and that was a, that was a big thing. Like it was something that I think Rob Schraub and I walked into was like, you know what, like if you, like, if you start from the end point of a successful experience between two people who don't like each other, what's the best case scenario for an encounter between you and someone that you are never going to get along with because it happens. Yes. So let's write backwards from the result. You would like to happen whenever you run into somebody who doesn't like you and who you're, you're not going to like the best case scenario is you saying, well, that's how I feel and not, not feeling like you've been, you know, pounded down or, or that you've pounded anyone down. Like actually the best result is you walking away like a blackjack dealer, just clap the hands and you just walk away with the, and, and, you know, if you're a little vindictive and you want to actually be a victorious ninja in that thing, the better result is that you're doing that. And the other person is going, yeah, but I just think it's full of shit. The best result is walking away peacefully from a person who is pro-conflict. Right. And, and, and if you think that strawberries taste good and you think that doors are brown and you think that Tom Hanks is a good actor and you really think those things and you really stick to what you actually think, then you'll never be in an argument that you'll lose because you won't be, you won't be trying to convince someone else that Tom Hanks is a bad actor. You'll be saying, I think he's good. In fact, you probably won't even be saying that. What you should be saying is I remember I was 15 years old and I saw Philadelphia and it was about AIDS and I started crying. I saw Doc Hollywood and I started crying. I was, you don't try to convince someone that Michael J. Fox was a good actor. That Francis Ford Coppola does this and doesn't do that and is worth this. You say, I liked Robocop. I, I felt this when I saw it, which by the way is like to use movies as an example. Roger Ebert, before he died, wrote this brilliant, thinly veiled indictment of, what was his name? Ben Lyons. Ben Lyons? The critic that sort of like, I think that was the name of the guy, I don't know, but Roger Ebert was the last. I don't know, that is. Roger Ebert like wrote this. Before this conversation, I might have said, yeah, Ben Lyons. Yeah, I don't, he's, he's, he's, Ben Lyons is a, he's a new school critic. He would just go like, I love this movie. I don't like that movie. Like that it was steeped in like weird, like people that invited him to the set or whatever. Roger Ebert was this old Chicago SunTimes movie reviewer from an age when a movie reviewer could save you $8 and two hours of your life by telling you whether or not a movie was good. Roger Ebert wrote a treatise about what, what good review is and it all amounted to, doesn't matter where you went to college. It doesn't matter what, what you know and how much you've seen. An honest review, a helpful review is you saying whether or not you like the fucking thing and why? Right. From your own perspective. Yeah. The moment you cross a line into analysis and trying to aggregate and pronouncing things, you are, you are off in the fucking area of Verdun where everyone gets mowed down eventually by machine gun fire. Wow. You're not, you're not yourself. You're charging something. You're expanding something. Yeah. So you're at, you're playing God. You're not perceiving and expressing anymore. Right. Yeah. And you're implying that there's some kind of universal compass that judges all things. You're going to prove that, that Daft Punk is good today. And you're the mouthpiece of the thing. Right. Like you're somehow channeling this like universe. That's, that's what, but what about people? So, you know, a lot of people might hear what you're saying and, and. And go, this is really boring. No, I don't think so. He's back for a third time and he's, again, he's the fucking boringest. I don't think so, man. This does not seem boring to me. This podcast is always so funny when I'm not on it. I love it so much. This podcast has been funny in so many episodes. I think that, I think that people hear it and they think, fuck, fuck for like, for years. I've just been lying to try to seem as though I'm sophisticated. When people hear what? When people hear the idea like, listen, just like honestly reflect where you're at. A lot of times someone hears that and they think, I have no idea where the fuck I am. Well, yeah. Welcome to the fucking Spiritual Species Club. Yeah, for sure. Good news. Like, yeah, I have no idea who the fuck I am. So if you have no idea who the fuck you are, then you get to this point of like, well, what, what am I reflecting then? It's like, if I really don't, like, if you really get to the bottom of the thing, you're like, I don't even know what I like fucking God, baby. Because what is, what is the Dao according to the Dao Di Jing? Like, it is this, it's 81 poems about like, like this thing that is because it isn't is and it's like a joke. It's like, it's like, it doesn't, it doesn't exist. It's, if you try to know it, you can't know it. If you call it something and can't call it like, the fact that we exist doesn't make sense. It doesn't hold up to subjective understanding of meaning. Because your nerve endings say that if the chicken's hot, it tastes good. And when something tastes good, your human body like goes, what a great Wednesday. Holy shit, one seventh of the week. What an important experience. Oh, Daphne's mad at me. Oh, what a cataclysmic event. Because you're living life, but the truth is when you learn it, when you take a class in it and you've pulled back and you learn any facts, everything that is scientific fact leads inevitably to the realization that you, nothing matters. It doesn't matter. You can't make that argument scientifically. I beg any scientist to come in here and without reverting to their theology, prove scientifically that we should give a shit about anything. So the human experience is a schizophrenic one. Pardon me to any schizophrenics that are tired of that phrase being used improperly. But I really mean it actually as not like, oh, I'm two people. I mean it in the sense of like, there's a schism. There's a, you're spinning and you hear voices in your head as a species. Foxes and squirrels don't care that living means they have to kill and they don't care that they're going to die. They don't want fire in their eye, same as us. Yes. We, and we alone as far as we understand it, are the first mammal to go, to be cursed as in all these creation origin stories. They all involve us being cursed, blessed, gifted extrinsically with the realization that this is a cyclical tragedy that we're going to die and that we're killing by living and that we're only alive because someone else died. Yeah, what's that Edgar Allen Poe poem? It ends, the play is the tragedy man and the hero and it's hero, the conquering one. Haha, you was depressed, but no, I know what you're saying. So you're talking about this like, kind of Camus level realization of the absurdity of everything and that sense of like, you know, he talks about in particular, that sense of not being able to fulfill yourself or that sense of just confusion as that is what it is to be a human. Right, the Tao De Jing says like, the master is like a baby. It's got a big eyes, it's like looking around, doesn't know what the fuck is going on. Like there's certain translations of the Tao De Jing where it says, I am like an idiot and saying it like it's a good thing. I don't know what the fuck is going on. Right, yeah, what are you trying to do? Like you're wearing this kind of like infinite cyclone and we're getting this 70 year period to assemble logic from this spray of matter and any kind of logic that we assemble and this brief flicker of time is obviously, it's absurd. And then to fight over it, it's ridiculous too. So because when we look at babies, there's a bassinet next to my desk at that community because my assistant had a baby and she's, you know, taking care of it at work. So every, I walk through my office and there's this little turkey in there, there's a little peanut and everybody just gathers by it and they look in there and they do what they do with babies, which is they marvel at it and they, like no one's, no one's disgusted by that thing's stupidity. No one, nobody's mad that it likes Tori Amos. If it smiles when you play Tori Amos, we're not holding that thing. Your baby has shitty taste in music, man. Your baby likes that mobile? What a jagoff. But babies are racist. We all have the, we look at that baby and we go, like, it's perfect. It's perfect because it hasn't started doing that yet. It has nothing but potential. And when we have this myth in our head that, oh, maybe the reason we feel that way is because every baby has a chance to go off and be like, what? What is, who's the guy? Barack Obama? Who's named the guy that represents the ideal? There isn't such a thing, that's not a thing. A human life is a lightning streak through failure. It's just like a marble pattern. It's just a beautiful little pattern. It does it, there is nobody that we all look at and go, nailed it. We have a couple of martyr characters. We go like, oh, Gandhi, this person gives so much. But we don't, we're not emulating them, we're not putting them in cereal boxes. No. There is no, those people are heroes because they didn't give a shit about themselves. They had no self, they gave it to something higher than them. And we envy them and wish that we were like that and feel guilty about not being like that. But that's different from saying that we think that there's this perfect person and that that's the goal. When we look at a baby in a crib, we're not thinking, I love that baby because that baby might not fuck up. We're not really feeling that way. Right. Like, I don't care if that baby's going to be a truck driver. No, no, no. I want it to be a really good truck driver. What you're saying isn't really happy. I think what you're saying is an immense relief because it's, there's this sense of like, you know, accomplish this, you should be accomplished. Like, you know, one of the happiest time of my life. I'm happy now. But the happiest time of my life was when I was a dishwasher at Chili's. And I was in North Carolina. It was the, is the undocumented acid boom of the 90s. I was on LSD all the time and I had no sense of any feeling that washing dishes was even, was bad or something to be that ashamed of. It was hypnotic and like, you made money and I could, I had an apartment with a roommate. No ambition, no sense of anything other than like, I'm just living. And that was a really great time. And then you get this seed inside of you. You get this sense of like, I've got to like, do something. Right. I've got to do something. And then, and then that leads to a midlife crisis because it's like, inevitably you'll get to like, some certain age, like, man, I didn't do it. And then you're, then that makes you feel depressed for, I guess, the last part of your life or something, which is the cycle of Western man. You could be sitting there washing dishes and you could be thinking about, are you thinking about what if I'm still washing dishes 10 years from now? Am I going to be miserable then? The crazy tricks the devil plays on you to get you out of the moment. The big, the important question to answer is, do I want to be washing dishes right now? And in each day that, you know, you have to balance that with the need to tell your boss your schedule. Yeah. I was a dishwasher and I like, I had the same kind of, you know, there was comfort there, but I was really fucking bad at it. And I kept trying to be really good at it and I kept feeling like, I actually, when I would show up at work, I, if everybody would greet me with applause, and they're like, oh, thank God, Dan's here. And there was a guy named Ruben who was that guy. He was like this God, he, of the dishwashers. Yes. The boss would sit there and he'd try to work out the schedule and then he'd go, okay, Dan, well, I guess you can have Tuesdays through Friday and then, because Ruben's out of town, it's just like the love of Ruben. This like 48 year old guy that he would sing gospel tunes as he loaded the dishes into the things. And I would do, I would watch Ruben, I was jealous of Ruben and I just wanted that adoration. Now, did Ruben like adoration or did Ruben like washing dishes or even beyond that, Ruben was probably so old in his soul and like so satisfied with other shit in his life that he probably left his soul at the door by the time clock and like became like a weird piece of meat that just like sang gospel songs and threw dishes to the washer. I won't speculate about Ruben. I, here's my experience. I sat there for a year trying to be as fast as Ruben at washing dishes until I realized the reason I wanted to do that is because I wanted people to like me. Yeah. And then I walked out the back door because there had to be better ways of making people like me. Right. That didn't involve washing dishes. Right. I don't know what my point was. It's weird how washing dishes is kind of like considered to be like the universal like, ah, you're going to be a dishwasher. Is that why you want to spend your life? It's an important facet of- Which is great because if you showed an ancient Roman like, like, okay, here's the- Yeah, right. This is a plebeian's job. And they're like, you put magical items in another magical item and beautiful steam comes out and- Instant heat of water? Instant heat. Like, you used to have to- It was an hour to heat enough water at least to take a bath. How long would that take to heat and to gather it up? You have a special compartment provided for you with a combination lock on it? No one can take your things? It doesn't matter, man. We're a primarily- We're dissatisfied. This is the- I can't remember the name. I- There's a name for this. It's like a- It's in Buddhism. There's this idea of this innate dissatisfaction that exists in human beings. And the dissatisfaction has its roots in the delusion that if we change the external world, we're going to be happy. Right. When the reality is that until you shift what's inside of you, you're going to be miserable no matter what happens to you. Yeah. It's a very simple thing, but it seems like it's a- It's a thing that a great many people haven't figured out. Well, it's hard to figure it out when the actual light that is hitting us right now and the power we're using to record our voices and connect with the people listening, all of that is translated into capitalism. It's not just here because mankind invented that technology. Right. It is a product. The entire, all of it is, we have that tendency to think, I'm going to change the outside world and make myself happy. Yeah. And five seconds after we think that, someone is agreeing with us and telling us, I know how you feel. And you know, if you actually bring this coupon to this thing, you can have a new- Yes. Keyboard or a new recording device. This is the, so in the enlightenment, when Buddha's getting enlightenment, he's sitting under the Bodhi tree, faced, you know about this, you know, the stories faced with all these different- He hung out. He hung out. People tried to get him to stop hanging out. I mean, it's no Jesus. It's no Jesus. It's actually very similar to Jesus. It's very similar to Jesus, except no nails in the hands just hung out. You're right. Yeah, right. He doesn't get cre- He died. I heard he died of food poisoning, actually. Yeah, he died of like bad meat or something. But the story is the first temptation of Buddha is death rises up. Mara, death, and starts throwing fireballs at him or something. It's supposed to represent the human fear of death as the first thing that gets in the way of self-realization. And then the second temptation were the daughters of Mara. And these are like hot, beautiful, like literally, if you take it literally, it's just like the temptation to fuck or to get married and have children or live a domestic life. But the deeper translation is it's the part of the self that the moment you start thinking you're gaining realization is like you're doing it. Yeah, you're nailing it. Now you can jump over that wall, Bionic Man. Yeah, yeah, that thing, that thing. And the moment you fall prey to that, then you get lost in another endless vortex of like, I guess I'm amazing. Because once things become beautiful, other things become ugly. Which is that, yeah, the Dada Jinn keeps warning you along the way that following the way is going to be beset with this. It's duality is the enemy to the ascetic. Like it's not, also what I love about Buddhism, as far as I understood it, is that it gives you the keys to, it tells you that the world is like that, does that to us. And it tells you that the cure to that is pulling the plug, not caring about those asavas, these ups and downs, these things. Asavas, what is... Isn't that what the, I'm going back to high school like... I don't know, man. I've never heard that term before. I love it though, the wave form, the sine wave or whatever. The ups and downs where the asavas, according to Buddhism, that was like sort of saying like, well, the things that tempt you from the middle line are things like, for instance, a Twinkie, which is a great thing, or your girlfriend hating you, which is a bad thing. Both of those things have an equal value. They're pulling you away from that sort of center point in an Eastern religion. They're triggering, the thing, what happens is, so it's like the idea is, there is inside of you already, this sort of calcified karmic structure, which is all of your anger, and these external events happen, whatever it is. Someone cuts you off in traffic, your girlfriend says something awful to you, or somebody says something awful to you about your girlfriend, or the, who knows what it is, the triggers. And so what happens is the trigger hits, and then the anger arises, and so when the anger arises, the asava, I guess, triggers this thing inside of you, the parasite emerges. And then instead of recognizing that you have the parasite inside of you, you try to change that external thing. Right, exactly, because you're this perfect person, you're not perfect, you know you're not perfect, you know you're just awesome, and you got this apartment, and you picked it because for all these wonderful reasons, and oh, that siren goes off at the fire station, and it's like, oh, do they have this world out there? Do they even understand, I've read all these Ram Dass books, and I'm so close to achieving something here, and they've got their siren clamoring, I'm just going to go over there and ask them to turn it off, and I'm going to, you know, you meet that personality so often in LA, it's like the evolved spiritual person who has veins shooting out of their neck, because they are under so much stress, because of all of the toxicity around them, all of the words that they've learned for how to hate everything that's going on around them, because the rest of us are so unenlightened. This is the thing about the Asavas, as I said, you'll get the emails from the, that word I'm trying to remember from when I was 17 years old, there was a word that I think Buddhists or Hindus had for the ups and downs. Now the thing was that there was a solution to, I liked about Eastern religion, or thought interesting about it, was that your Eastern religion says to you, fact number one, life goes up and down, it's fucked up, like this too shall pass, which is both good news and bad news, you're walking around, like even if you're having the best day of all, guess what, that means tomorrow's going to suck, that's a fact about life, it goes wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. You know the story about the horses, the guy, just before you continue, just to illustrate what you're saying, there's a famous story, I can't remember which Eastern religion it's from, a guy has, as the story goes, oh yeah, a guy lives with a son, he's a farmer, he's got a horse, the horse jumps over the fence, runs off into the forest, it's their only horse, and his neighbor says, oh, you're fucked man, your horse is gone, you're never going to be able to buy another horse, what are you going to do, you're fucked, and the guy's like, well we'll see, and then two days later the horse comes back, it's a mare, and she's brought with her five other stallions, I guess you want to fuck her or something, so now the guy has like six horses, that he's gotten into his neighbors like, you're rich, you have all these horses, you're set, and he's like, well we'll see, then his son is like trying to tame one of the horses, falls and breaks his arm, and his neighbor's like, well your son's, now you're done, but this, how are you going to hire? His neighbor is a cocksucker, like a sportscaster, you got anything going on Carl, Jesus Christ, the ticker tape and the fucking spit, just calm down, have you eaten, or do you just sit in your window and watch my life, this is honestly the horse thing, the kid breaking his arm, I'm not allowed to say these things are good or bad, but I will tell you without fear of being wrong, it's discomforting that you, you're scrutiny Carl, you're watching me and commenting on all this stuff, you're creepy, I'm starting to feel like I got to do right by you, creepy neighbor, that's the real motto, you can easily, before the punchline, the spiritual punchline to this story, it's identical so far to a horror story, the only changes the third act, because in the urban legend sorority girl horror story, the next thing that happens is the guy's in bed, and he wakes up and then his neighbor's over his face with night vision goggles and a knife, and he says, I told you to appreciate things when they were good, and he starts stabbing him, it's fucking creepy, you're right, you're right, that's a creepy spiritual punchline, but think about that for a second, I don't mean to get too deep, but or the opposite of it, but urban legends, these mythologies, because whatever the end of that story is, life goes up and down, that's a story about a guy who got it and the other guy calling it out, urban legends say they always challenge you, they go, you think you figured shit out, you think you know, you think you know you should throw that bottle away, did you hear about the guy that threw the bottle away? Through the bottle away, yeah, the bottle like a guy was out in the street, and he goes through your garbage, I guess this guy, and he plays this game, he's called The Bottle Man, and he opens each garbage can, and if the bottle doesn't have a cap on it, he'll fucking kill you. It happened three times in San Francisco, and his girl, she didn't do it, she heard about it, she put the bottle on, she put the cabin, she woke up the next morning and lipstick on the mirror, it said, I appreciate the effort. All this kind of stuff, it challenges you, it's like urban legends are written by your neighbor Carl in that story. Okay, so just to bring it back around to, so Eastern religion says once upon a time we all live in this world, it goes wow, wow, wow, up and down, your mare goes away, comes back with six stallions, whatever, and then as far as I have understood it, Eastern religion says here's how you can escape all that, but you don't have to. Awareness of the fact that that's how it is empowers you with the decision, if you really want to not deal with that, that's called the life of a holy man, that's not for everybody. There's a version of being enlightened without having to be holy, you can actually just hang out and go up and down, and we pay top dollar for literal incarnations of those at theme parks, you just like, there's the calm and the serenity and the terror and the whole time, we just laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh and we voluntarily, it's possible I should say, we do that at a theme park, we say here's ten dollars, I would like to have the living shit scared out of me, I would like to actively participate in the remote but palpable statistical probability of my death for the sensation of conquering it in a controlled environment, so we spend all day doing that, but we go back to the meta formation of that, which is our life, and we don't throw our hands up in the air when we get a flat tire, the other thing, you're late for work and your career is ruined, the enlightened version of you actually goes, you know what, I guess today was the day my career got ruined, and I'm definitely not, that people hear that shit and then they go, oh yeah, so that's what you do, so that's what you, oh yeah, that's easy to say, when you talk about philosophy like that, when you talk about how you should be, because there's no other way to phrase it, did you notice that on the internet, and sometimes if you're at a bad party, I've been that guy that you just said that, so what, so what bro, if I'm stepping on a baby's head, you're not gonna react to that? Yes, I had a friend, that's called a Pharisee, it's called a person, I'm the Pharisee, I've been the Pharisee, my friend, I had this brilliant friend, and I remember at one point, you know, he was like, he was really depressed and he got really happy, he'd been reading all the time, very disciplined, but he was like, I thought he's a cocky asshole, and I loved him though, he's a friend, but I still was like, he's a cocky asshole, and then I remember he started saying like, man, I love everyone, and I think he was pondering like, am I, maybe I'm a saint, am I a saint? And he's like, I love everyone, and I remember saying to him like, absolutely not, you're not, I can tell you for certain that you're not, and like, you love everyone, you're full of shit, no one loves everyone, and I remember he said to me, okay man, what do you think a saint is supposed to be like? And it was a really intense moment for me, because it undercut that huffiness to be like, oh. But it was, it was a perfect intro to your rap video, he said that, and then it cut to a close-up of your finger snapping, and then a close-up of your lips, and you go, I'm glad you asked. He wears dark robe, he dances on mountain. When he goes to the east side, he always takes fountain, because he knows the traffic in LA. He's the perfect man, he's a saint. He's got three dogs on a chain, bling bling in his eye. A saint. That is a hilarious term, man. Let me, let me ask you a question, MC Trussell. What do you, what do you think a saint is? A saint, I ain't, but I, but a picture I'll paint, what I think, I don't know, I'm not. He's got a gleam in his eye, and a hat on his head. He always says seven when you gotta say bread. Just a litany of, anyway, sorry. He walks two walls, 17 balls. I, I derailed you, I'm sorry. No, please, I'm so glad, I'm so glad you derailed me. But that is, I mean, I mean, I would honestly say, like, first of all, forgive yourself for being in that zone ever, but also easiest thing in the world to never do that. Like, and I get, I get so irritated with people. I don't know. It's like, there's just some fundamental rule. I don't know if it's like, like improv workshops or something that kind of, where you, once you start taking that in the outside world, you go, okay, so this person in this kitchen at this party is telling me that all hippopotamia are purple. Yeah. Um, I, I, you can definitely argue with it, but like, do you have a horse in that race? Like, like, is it okay to agree with that person? The answer is absolutely yes. It's, there's no harm will come to going like, okay, all right, I guess I should, it's the, the, the, the stake in the argument is what makes people uncharismatic, I think. Wow. Man, that's really good. The stake in the argument. Yes, for sure. Oh man, anytime you start getting your tail feathers up over something, it's, you're, you're losing your, because yeah, what does everybody do that, that, that tries to high road you in an argument when it's not successful and equally charismatic? You, it's because you can tell they don't really mean it, but the tack they choose is they try to get to the highest ground. They go, oh, well, I think it's interesting that you're, you're saying that as soon as, as soon as two people get in the fucking tizzy on the internet, yes, it's a scramble for high ground. Yes. That's the funniest thing about it is like the opposite of a Heathcliff fight, like they, instead of the tornado of claws, it's a, it's a, whatever the opposite of a tornado is, it's two nerds racing for higher ground and they're, and they're, it's like a dog fight to try to act like they didn't just get in a fucking nerdy fight about something. Oh my god. No, I, I actually never, and everything devolves into, well, when you, you seem to be very upset. I only asserted an opinion and it's certainly my right to have and, and you watch these card games happen over 25 years and you go, okay, what's the ace that you carry around up your sleeve? How do all of these things end? What's the, what's the atom bomb? It's, it is the fact that the other person is having a fight and you're not. So instead of having to fake that at the end of a fight because you want to win it, instead of having to try to pull that maneuver, what if you actually walked around with that ace taped to your head, which is actually I don't, if you, in case you haven't noticed, I have never said anything about what you should do. I have never tried to tell you that John Denver was racist. I only told you what I felt when I was listening to his album. I, you can't argue with that. I, you can't prove me wrong. I said, I remember feeling like John Denver was racist when I listened to his album. I think the answer is, if you can, for me, I know the feeling well when someone incites something in me that makes me angry. That's the, that feeling is always followed by error. The feeling, if I go from the feeling, it's always followed by error. The angry, huffy feeling always results, even if there's a temporary win, if you make someone submit to you, to, to your level of rage or your cleverly concealed rage, you still lose. So the idea is, if you can eliminate that huffiness altogether, so that when someone explodes in front of you, you're not even feeling it. You don't feel it anymore than when a dog starts barking in the backyard. You're not suddenly offended or upset. It's just like a moment that in nature, if someone's doing that, if you can get to that place and I think you would be victorious no matter what, exactly like what you're saying. But like you mentioned earlier, you get halfway to that place and you have a good Wednesday and then on Thursday you go to a party and there's a guy in the kitchen and he doesn't get it and he keeps talking about Harrison Ford, like Harrison Ford's full of shit. He doesn't even know he's talking about it. And he's like, he doesn't get that you're not supposed to fight and then you step, like I will, I will rise to this place in my hotter balloon of relaxation and objectivity and then I will meet somebody who doesn't understand life the way I do and then I will politely say to them, yeah, but you know what, better not, better not, better not have an opinion about it, better to rise up here and then they'll say, yeah, well that's some bullshit. And then I go, you fucking insignificant parasite, you piece of shit. You're a fucking agent of entropy? That's the side you're on? Who side do you think you're on when you side against openness? Are you out of your mind? Do you realize you're pouring diarrhea into a river and complaining that you're getting sick from it? You're part of the problem. You have the fucking balls to imply that being a better person and caring about people is worse and less effective. Yes, Spock. Good job. Congratulations. You're on the side of insects. They had their chance. We evolved from them. Love me. Listen to me. I'm sweating. I'm crying. I'm telling you the truth. I don't care if it's pragmatic. You're a piece of shit. I wish I could kill you. And all of a sudden you're yelling at someone in the name of love. Oh, God. But man, that feels so good. And even just what you just did, that feels so good. And that is why this book I'm reading by Chogyam Trumpa is talking about one of the main founders of Tibetan Buddhism and how he would beat the shit out of people and how that was fine because that's what he was like. It feels good to lean on a lever and move something. I think the Baptist preachers who when they can pace and go like, I'm not a fucking sellout talking about Jesus. I want to level with you. I want to explain something to you. And it feels good for the sender and good for the receiver because they can believe the message. Yeah. But what is the... Mitch Hurwitz and I, humble brag, we're just talking about this over a drink. Just talking about this, he called it, he's 10 years older than me or so. He reminded me so much of Dino, like this kind of like just like older and... Dino Stanatopoulos for those of you who don't know, the great writer. Like get shit more. And we're just, he, I was talking, I was confessing to him about how good it feels to lose your shit and be mean and just take a sharp stick and strategically skewer someone who is being completely dishonest about how much they respect you and where they are in accordance to you and just doing something to them, affecting them on a level that makes them admit that this entire time, this is how it was, and we're talking about this, our tendencies to go dark sometimes. And we started talking about how what we were really doing in those moments is an impression of our fathers. And how good that feels because that is what a man does. And my dad is awesome. And I don't know if that means that the definition of a man is awesome. And that I don't know what that means. I know facts about my dad. I know feelings about my dad. Like I just know like the good thing about him, as far as I understand it, in the lizard part of my brain, despite 40 years of growth around it, the thing that I understand about my dad and therefore about the ideal man is that he has the power to boom like thunder and humble people around him. That, you know, he tries, tries to get by without having to do it, but has to let it go. Yeah, he's got a stinger. It's in there. He can, yeah, I know what you mean, man. And I think that's something that like I, you know, I think that it seems great on paper, but what's, and it's, and it is good. It is good, but what's a million times more interesting is the idea of somebody who is that baby that you're talking about, that Taoist baby, but they're a grown, they're a grown adult, but everything around them is just being reacted to in this very natural way. And I think that way tends to be, and this, God forgive me for saying this, but I think that at the deepest core of things, that tends to be more of a loving relationship with things or. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Mitch's, Mitch's thing was like, I know what you're talking about and I, and I had it and I let it go. Like it's possible to let it go. And because it's so, I mean, like getting, listen, you can walk down the street and, you know, pass five or six people or really let you have it if you do the wrong thing. It's not like a unique situation to be around people who are good at hissing at you or really letting you fucking know that you're a piece of shit. That's like the, it's common to stand on a beach, but what's really rare is when you get around that person who you're, you are an asshole to that person, or you don't call them back seven times in a row, or you, who knows what the fucking great crime is you do in front of them, or you reveal some part of yourself or whatever it is, and they, in an honest way, like you just as much as before that happened. Yeah. That's crazy. And when you meet that person, you go, I want to be like that person. Yes. I love Duncan Trestle so much. I've only met him three times. I think about him in my head when I'm in line at the bank. Like if Duncan Trestle saw what I was doing, based on the three times I've met him, whether it's a figment or not, I don't think Duncan Trestle would be nodding his head and like give me a thumbs up right now. I'm going to act a little cooler in line at the bank today. We spread good behavior, good, good. Yes. Like you never know when you're doing it because if somebody could yell at you, like you said, you get a chance to do it every day. And I stand before you confessing like I've been failing to do that for years. I constantly fail. I'm getting, I'm, man, I'm the fucking count of money, Chris. I'm always trying to get revenge on every fucking thing I can't because I got to work and the people that are telling me that I'm doing something wrong, they're enemies of fucking good TV. So I get drawn into this Joan of Arc complex, but the problem with the, yeah, those people don't give a shit about TV. And that's how they think like, I'm gonna fucking save the show. I'm yelling at this person or you like like defending against them or feeling this way. Maybe you got to do that too, man. I mean, like you don't want, I don't, there's no, I don't want to know the answer, but I do, I would much rather you be there fighting people like that than not, than not. I mean, it's, I don't know how you, I don't know how, I honestly don't know how you, how, how you, that seems like a very stressful job. But. Well, it hasn't been this year because they, they brought me back. So there's nobody, there's nobody fighting me, which has allowed me to sort of realize what that guy in that story about the horses realizes. It is, you know what, seasons one through three, it didn't, they want to have a conference call about the tone of the show and it feels like it's every minute there's an invitation for you to lose your shit to defending or trying to preserve and all this stuff. I don't know. It is weird because I look back at it and I, yeah, I, I think like, well, wait a minute, the show wouldn't exist if I didn't get mad. But, but, but, I don't know how I slid into that, but. But you know, it's bad. That's the point is, it's like, again, it's like getting mad is not the problem. It's, it's, it, the problem is, is getting out of the moment. And the other problem is if someone gets mad. Yeah. Cause then you're going to suck as a writer. That's the thing. Okay. That's it. Yes. You can get mad about the fact that people aren't letting you be happy. Yes. It's, it's gotta be an honest, like, like, yeah. Cause the person complaining about the fire house is siren. That person is really saying, you know what, I couldn't help but notice your siren and I can't help but think that if your siren went away, I could achieve serenity. Yeah. And this, that means that the siren was an invitation to them in the first place to deal with something that has nothing to do with the siren. And that's what Ram Dass is saying. It's like, sounds like that siren belongs in your world. Yeah. So, and so it's like, you can, you can tell people that tell you not to have fun to go fuck themselves. And as long as you're having fun while you're doing it, that's the key. You got to always be the funny one. Always be smiling while you're telling people to go fuck off. Yeah, man. And, and, and, and yeah, exactly. That's the thing. It's like the moment you decide I'm not going to be mad because I'm like, don't do that anymore. That's the moment you're doing something 50 times worse than being mad. Now you're just not like that. I'm sorry to keep going back to Ram Dass, but really into him right now. Right now. I'm constantly in there for years. For years. For those, for those of you that just tuned in, we've caught Duncan Tressel in a, in a bit of a Ram Dass stage. For the last like 15 years. Do you know that? Like when you, when you, you, you said that name the first time I heard you say it on your podcast, I was like, I know that name. I, when I was a little kid, I went through this, you know, weird Asperger-y like phase of like, I don't know what the fuck is going on. And I, I, my mom would take me to the library all the time and I gravitated towards these like, uh, slowly, but surely cause I was like, I saw altered states with, uh, that like, I was, I was sort of, I was like, everyone's a robot and I don't know what's going on. You know, it's got existential, like 10 years old. And, uh, I, there was this book and it was, I remember the name Ram Dass for sure. And I remember his little, little drawing of him as like a little fat Buddha, like, like inside cover. And it was like some simple book about just chilling and meditating and stuff. But it was a big part of my, uh, my, my turning when I was letting. He infiltrated a lot of people early on, which is really fascinating about him. Also, Alistair Crowley too, like that's another figure that got into a lot of people's heads and people don't even know that he got in there. I'm fascinated by that with people who get into the, you know, how like, you know, I just watched this, uh, uh, documentary on Prageria and it was sort of breaking down how, how Prageria happens, which is there's a protein that gets in the, first of all, like, you know, showing like the DNA helix and chromosomes and this Prageria is a malfunction in one, one letter. I don't know how the shit works, but like one letter is off. It goes by letters. It's letters. It's like R, R is off. And the, the, the, uh, the, the thing starts making, uh, the, the, just this one malfunction, the stuff called Prageron starts getting inserted into these protein strands. And then the chain reaction of it is that you get a kid who's like 80 years old when they're 12. And so that one malfunction causes the thing to fuck up so much in the same way. It's interesting how like people in the protein strand of society will insert certain bits of information into the thing in one way or the other. It's going, it makes society either grow into this mutant Nazi party thing or, you know, the other side of it, which is like the dream of the hippie, which is like the age of Aquarius, the putting down of weapons or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Like some of the most influential people, they don't, they don't necessarily have, you can't like, like, like, how much did Abby Hoffman do and how, how, how large is that name versus, and let's call that a large name. And let's say that he represented like, like a movement of people who actually had this like sort of incredibly potent effect whose names are not, they're not stories. You're not Paul Bunyan. He didn't cut down a big giant tree. I was fascinated with that. Like, what did Steve Jobs, like, is there, is there a timeline where Steve Jobs isn't born and therefore are things that different? I know a cynic would say absolutely not because Henry Ford invented the car at the same time as like four other guys. So there's this philosophy that says like, well, we're a species and we just invent shit. Like, and what did Steve Jobs invent? But he's like this weird guy, this passion and the things in our pockets are fucking shaped by this. Yeah, man. That's it. That's the one little fucking chromosome, that one little chromosome in human society, the Steve Jobs chromosome has like a couple of great experiences. And the next thing you know, we're all we're carrying around these weird glowing infinity rectangles in our pockets that can connect with every bit of information on the planet instantaneously. That's fascinating. That's a fascinating thing. And yeah, I know what you mean. Like, yeah, if there was no Steve Jobs, then maybe I like that idea, you know, even more than that. I mean, like, like, well, because what you're describing is just technology, which is something that a bunch of dumb ass, yeah, who's like contribute to. But like, jobs kind of, I don't even know how to articulate it. But like, he, he had this, apparently had this like weird dual brain thing where he wanted, he wanted it to be sexy and wanted it to be what it is, which is ubiquitous. That's the thing, like he had a passion for this thing being a parasite. And if it was up to Samsung, like I remember a pre iPhone world, I remember when all our gadgets were sort of like, this guy had this like dream of like, no, you have like Howard Hughes is like, no, you have to look, I understand how this is supposed to work. Okay. Yeah. And I know this is going to sound weird. But if you just give me control over everything, I will show you how it should work. And to the extent that that meshed with capitalism, he's right. I don't know how much of it is patent bullying, but like these fucking phones or they work differently. Anyways, my in an age past fire the wheel and the Model T, I find myself wondering like, how much innovation is happening now and how, how, how many different timelines are sprouting off of this one. Man, I'll tell you, I'm sorry, do you have to go by the way? No, there's a, um, your listeners have to go. They don't. They have to go kill themselves. They know, I don't think they think that there's a, I did you see this, uh, this blew my fucking mind, man. Can everybody hit on that podcast? The enhancer, this blew my mind. Did you see the new goddamn 3d printer that this guy built apparently said in the in Reddit that he used household materials, which I really don't understand how that's possible. But this guy created a 3d printer that is apparently what to create costs less than a thousand bucks. And what it does is it uses, it takes three, three, you know, uh, CAD or whatever, whatever format they use, uh, that it takes three dimensional digital objects, translates those digital objects into sound waves, and then uses those sound waves to somehow vibrate a liquid, um, it's a, it's a resin, a liquid resin is vibrated by the sound waves created from this three dimensional object, which then makes these highly detailed, uh, 3d print out. So he's using sound. He's translating instead of lasers or whatever they're using sound like somehow vibrating liquid to make this an object. That is fucking nuts, man. That blows my mind to think that like this, that that's happening right, that's happening right now. That's, that's, you know, when you hear conspiracy theorists yapping about how the pyramids were made, they'll, or Stonehenge or whatever, like they used sound, they used sound to vibrate the thing or whatever. And in, uh, I think the Upanishads, it talks about how, uh, sound was the, uh, uh, the, like that's the original creative matrix of things started in sound. And then in the book of John, it's like, in the beginning was the word, and the word was, it's like that idea of like sound being the original thing. And then someone figuring out how to turn digital space into sound and then that back into three dimensional space. Don't know how I'm connecting this with Steve Jobs, I guess innovation or whatever, but you have to, this is, here it is. This is my, this is the fantasy. The fantasy is this. The fantasy is you have humanity, society, all the famous people, all the Steve Jobs, all the people hungry for wealth or fame or the people who are materialists in the marketplace. And then the fantasy is this, surrounding them in the same way, like if you were going camping, people would stand around a fire blowing on the fire and lighting it or the really smart people. And they're the ones who are just sort of influencing society to sort of grow these innovations out of it to move us in the direction of, you know, a utopia or the next phase of human evolution, which is to no longer be terrestrial, you know, to spread out into space. That's the next phase. And the idea is like there's, the fantasy is it's not just some instinctual, impulsive thing, like what you were talking about or what some people say, you know, like when Tesla came, or the theory of evolution, it was Darwin simultaneous to Darwin. There was, I can't remember the name of the other person who came up with the same idea. Toby. Toby Keith. Toby, I don't know. Big, big ideas. There's all these other people who are coming up with them at the same time. So the idea is like, is this something emerging through the strata of flesh surrounding the planet, like some kind of like subjective vegetation, or maybe there's people in the perimeter, in the periphery, whispering these things into the like the show people's ears. Those people have to be the most patient, low stakes, like alien life forms ever. Yeah. Are they ready for, are they ready for a double stick tape? Yes, commander. I believe, what about this thing I'm hearing about Malaysia? I don't know. There's an energy crisis there. Oh, sir, please look at the big picture. These are a double stick tape ready people. Come on. Well, yeah, I'm just saying what happened in Alpha Centuri. You're going to blame that on double stick tape. Look, I've been assigned to this job for about six centons. In that time, I have watched three planets collapse after with the introduction of double stick tape. I know they don't regard it as a threshold, the sudden ability to stick something on a wall instead of looping masking tape around. I know they look at it as a natural progression, but we all, among the reptelia, we know that this is a big deal. It's a Rubicon. In all the times that we've progressed with this schedule, have we ever tried holding back double stick tape to see what happens? All right, sir, if you say so. Three months later, sir, they've invented their own double stick tape. Abandon Earth. Leave it. We shall never visit it again. You're right, man. You're right. That is the dumbest idea ever. Well, just like they've been watching us. I mean, we are nothing if not an unsupervised species. We are nothing. That's hilarious. Well, you know, then there's the other ideas that technology. How many kingdoms of life are there? There were seven when I was in high school. So technology is considered the eighth kingdom of life, and it's growing through us in the same way plants grow through dirt. Technology is growing through the human mind, and it's the eighth kingdom that we're creating. I mean, we'd like to think that, but technically, if we're going to play by our own rules, life already has fundamental definitions that include reproduction, which technology can handle, but also other antiquated shit that we decided a long time ago. That's the weird thing is, do we say, okay, now there's eight kingdoms? Or do we go, okay, there's these seven kingdoms, and then there's this other thing? Are these things gods? Well, the thing's going to be, the idea is it's going to be life. It isn't yet, but it eventually will be indistinguishable. And then that, and then the idea is that it's like, oh, it's not that it's the eighth kingdom of life. It's that we are approaching this moment at the end of time, and the closer we get to it, the more these objects emerge from it. Let me ask you something as a thought experiment. Okay. Like when you think about the idea of a robot killing you, or like sassing you off. Yes. When you think about the idea of a robot deciding that it doesn't want to put up with your shit anymore. Agree or disagree with me about this. The emotional reaction that you have first and foremost is not one of outrage. Don't you first, don't do the first thing that fires off in you? Cool. When you think about the idea of a robot rising up, don't you think that sounds cool? Somehow I would rather be killed by a robot than insulted by a robot or South. Something about being, I've thought about robot, I've thought about being murdered by some DARPA invention or some evolution of a DARPA invention, but this is the first time I've ever considered a robot just kind of vaguely insulting me. Well, I mean, they're starting to all the time. I mean, they're certainly the person that doesn't allow me to get my money out of the bank, but I'm saying just. Yes, it's cool. We call it, it's a whole branch of, we're into it. We're making it happen. We want it to happen so bad. We want them to look like us. We want them to replace us. We have a fetish. We keep intellectually talking about how bad it's going to be when these fucking things make us obsolete, but our heart, our spirit, something inside of us keeps going. Yeah, man, we're made. No, I want to add to this by talking about, I went to this conference in New York called the Juggalooz. GF 2045, which is this convention put on by this Russian billionaire, Dmitry Ichkov, who is trying to gain immortal life by downloading his brain into a computer. And so he's gathered together all these geneticists and roboticists and weirdly all of these spiritualists. So there's like, you know, there's a guy walking around with a robot. There's a guy walking around with a thought-controlled cyborg arm and mixed in with him are like people in saffron robes and like people who are. I heard about the first cyborg hate crime. Yeah. I googled it. It was like two years old. Oh, it was? Yeah, there's this guy who's got like he bolted a camera to his head. Yeah, he was drilled into his fucking skull. But he chose to bolt it there. He could have put that thing on a piece of masking tape. Yeah, he didn't have to burrow it into his head. He didn't have to take that. He just chose to wear a hat that was taped to his scalp. Those are transhumanists. You know, that's what they want to do is they want to merge with matter. And, but it was what it made me think of was, I don't remember which Conan the Barbarian it is, but do you remember like they were in one of the Conans, they're trying to like create this demon. They're trying to summon this. All the priests are trying to summon a demon. But not Conan, right? Conan. No, he's the one who got the horn off the fucking thing. You break the horn off and it dies or whatever. He doesn't want demons. But the priests are always trying to summon up the demon. And Conan's fucking got a deal with it. He always fucks it up. But this conference, when you see these robed people mixing in with these geneticists, mixing in with these roboticists who are all weirdly working together in different ways to summon up from nothingness, this encyclone of intelligence that's made up of the most high tech things that exist, it reminds you of a demon summoning ritual, especially when people in robes are swirling through the crowd of people who are weirdly frenzied. You know what I mean? They're not just like, yes, we're working to expand the human lifespan. Many of them are like that, but some of them are, they have a frenzy in their eye, which is like, we are awakening the child of the Aeon. Which is a magnification of what we're all doing when we get on a plane. Because we know we're getting on an airplane that is not supposed to be up in the air. Oh yes, right. Everything that we do, our alpha-better eyeglasses, our dental fillings, the airplanes we get on, that sometimes go down. I'm not saying they go down so often that we should stop flying. I'm just saying that every once in a while, you look over at the news and there's a big brown streak in a field with a couple of fires dappling the helicopter view. And there's a news anchor in a tie that's doing his 450th newscast. And now he's telling you about the 10th time this has happened since he's been on duty. And he's just saying, here's what happened. 350 people. Let's go on South by Southwest. We're still waiting for the thing. And we kind of, it plays in the background in a bar while you're getting your martini or you're going to work. We continue. The airlines don't stop. We long ago made that deal as a species with ourselves and with if this thing is God or if it's the devil, we made an agreement with it that we said, you're more important than us. We're going to pay lip service to the importance of us. But we are going to step over each other in the street to get to work. I'm not getting high-handed about that. We do that willy-nilly because we're not animals. And animals might go, well, they're very vicious too, but they might say, oh man, a bunch of hyenas got on that big metal tube that transports hyenas and did you hear one of them crashed into a mountain and all the hyenas aboard it died? Yeah. All right. Well, let's have another hyena meeting. So what's going on with airplanes? Hyena number nine votes for no more airplanes until we figure out why they can kill 350 hyenas. Maybe hyenas would do that. I don't know. The way they act around a gazelle carcass, it would indicate that probably if they were given sanctions, they would probably be all in favor of all kinds of 9-11s and things. But what we don't do as naked monkeys that have alphabets and things, we never say stop the press, holy shit, we've been being died today. We have a hard on for something that has absolutely nothing to do. We know that at this point, the wizard's curtain has come down. There is no more lying to ourselves about it. We are definitely playing an A game that has nothing to do with our preservation. No matter what side of it you're on now, we all view ourselves as the earth's problem. And the only division now is some people are saying, yeah, well, it doesn't matter. Earth's supposed to die. It ain't good to do. And then the other half of the people are going, we're going to fucking save this planet. We're fucking dying. Man, you don't know when the earth's supposed to die. No one's saying the earth ain't dying. There was a little flirtation with that a little while ago by some idiots. We are saying to each other, looking at each other in the mirror every morning, looking at each other, and we're going like, so we got some kind of higher calling, right? We're doing something. You're going to have a baby tomorrow? Yeah, I'm going to have a baby. I'm going to try. I'd like to have a baby. We're running out of food. Yeah, but I've got to have a baby. Hey, man, are you learning Excel? Yeah, I learned Excel. I'm going to get on this plane. I'm going to learn more Excel. And I'm going to try to build a bigger building. I'm going to build this biggest building in the spaceships. And I'm going to fly every winter to make laces. We are compelled, like a spider is compelled to make a web. We are compelled not to farm. We are not compelled to... Yeah, we love eating. We love breathing. We love drinking water. We are compelled having gotten all the water, all the food, everything within our domain. We are compelled to rip our own faces off our skulls, trying to get into outer space, trying to make a computer that is smarter than us, trying to make a Japanese mannequin that feels like she's smiling. We are compelled to self-destruct or to evolve. Same thing. We're atoning with some kind of God. We've got to be Jehovah. We have to be this thing that makes life. We're killing ourselves doing it, killing ourselves. I love it. I agree with us. I agree. I think that the foremost priority has to be, like, what do we do next? I don't think that if we all stopped and said, let's sing Kumbaya. I don't know. I think that then poop would be everywhere. We've got to get out of the goddamn gravity well, man. That's the idea. We're in a gravity well. We're stuck on this planet. We've got to populate other planets. That's what the great Timothy Leary talked about. But who knows if that's possible. But then we're going to colonize and there's going to be a... I can tell by the Tony version you're trying to wrap it up. But it'll be like a moon base and then that'll fucking collapse. Yeah. 400,000 people will be the new 3,000 people. This is so funny. We're having the same conversation might have on a dog that's dying in the streets of India if they could... Gotta get on another dog, man. Well, I don't know. I don't want to wrap it up, but I feel... I don't want to keep you trapped. I feel like we've covered it all. We've covered so much. I honestly don't want to wrap it up. But I guess we should. We should do... Maybe you should do the podcast more, man. This is... Well, you should come by Harmon Town more. Anytime. All right, Dan.

i'm getting better at stopping doing hold on yeah hold on i gotta stop this i don't know i for some reason i don't don't hold on guys what you by the way what you're yeah you do a check right now that might shout cast no that's work guys here's what you're hearing what you're hearing is me for the first time trying to do advertisements with a guest in the room instead of spending three obsessive days trying to do an opening monologue which is why these podcasts don't come out quickly lately same with me mildly depressed and i'm sick of sitting in front of a microphone in my fucking office trying to say something inspirational i can't think of that all the time and i in fact i can't think even saying anything as hard so here it is quick opening thing there amazon i said it short design t-shirts i said it um gunt craries excuse them what yeah that's the other sponsor brought you by gunt gunt cherries when you need a blasting from the jest pick up a gunt the sweet voice that you're hearing is my dear dear friend johnny pemberton and man i fucking love this guy he's the one who comes over to my house when i'm bummed out he's the one who soothes me a true friend johnny pemberton welcome thanks welcome here welcome to be it's pretty good this mic sound great really happy they do sound good huh touch your dog they do sound good mic sound good and um johnny uh tell me exactly what happened to you yesterday because i'm so proud of your story yeah oh this i mean i feel like this is a story that's uh to me is kind of boring but i guess the fact that it's boring is why it's sort of badass isn't it i think it's badass okay well so occasionally i'll go on a commercial audition because why not it's free practice you're a hard worker man because i went like when somebody if i by the way i don't go on commercial auditions anymore but every if someone called me and i if i knew i had a commercial audition next week i would already be getting depressed about that well i feel that same way now for the most part the only reason i went to this one is because it wasn't in Santa Monica which means it's 10 hours 10 you know miles away and i was also just like why not because it's just good to you know it's like a thing where if you play a basketball for a living and you don't play basketball every day you should probably change that because it's good to pick up the basketball at least every day even if it's something where it sucks and it's just a practice thing i sometimes i think doing stuff just to do it because if you want if that's what you wanted to be doing all the time you should be doing it all the time yes the shitty shitty shitty version of what you want to do yes i'll go to this fucking thing whatever it's not for it's for a product that i don't really care about and it's not doesn't directly conflict with me morally which would be i would say no instantly right so it wasn't like for hella burton or mon santa it wasn't for that um so i go there and i walk into the place and you know it's like the standard shithouse place where it's just uh frosted glass doors and narrow hallways with a bunch of idiots who look vaguely similar to me with their hands and the head in their lap reading something how long was the drive to the place it was not that it was like west hollywood which is still terrible how long was the drive probably took me about 25 minutes all right 25 minute drive through traffic to get to a place with frosted doors to read um something from a sheet do you remember what the lines were no because i didn't get a chance to look at them because of what happened okay so i am uh before you go on now you guys have to understand those of you who've never gone on a commercial audition it's terrible there is as far as i'm aware of there are very few things as demeaning is going on a commercial audition this is like jumping backwards through time to another unregulated era where you had to bow to people absolutely there's no it's like there's babies some places there's like babies running around parrots on the floor i almost stepped on a parrot once at a commercial audition no joke and there's one of like 12 parrots that was there please please pick my parrot yes you so you go into these rooms and you you are you're you're so depending on like in LA there are like warehouses or commercial auditioning factories oh it is it's like a fucking because they have like big numbers on the doors like room four yes for checking in room for 16 through 29 step up yes yes no you got to go back to room 10 this is this is jack fruits commercial yes you want to be over at Duracell it's room 10 now now these you have to understand what you do when you come to a commercial audition is it you are also surrounded by a spectrum of humans that you are somehow in because someone who was in a hurry got your head shot or looked through a bunch of head shots was like him him him him him him him him him her or like the or the robot did it where it's like you have you have a beard you're this age you're this ethnicity and you've done this so it's like you get sorted into the pile of people who are on some some demographic the same as you know demeaning you're in a you're in this strange waiting room surrounded by other people who are all equally they're in varying levels of anxiety and desperation because many of them are and I was one of these at one point operating under the illusion that if I could just book one man yeah just one oh yeah I'll finally be I'll be able to fill my gas tank up all the way instead of halfway when I go to the gas station so there's varying degrees of anxiety and you're also faced with this kind of uh unavoidable truth that you are auditioning to be the mouthpiece for a corporation right and that doesn't necessarily feel wonderful yeah you're you're succumbing you're you're um you're giving up your will or there's some sort of better way to say it but you're basically you're checking your ego at the door and yes you checked your ego that you got to and and also there's a factor of supply and demand here because the sea of actors the invisible ocean of actors that flows through Hollywood it does not all you got to do is open up the fucking turn on that faucet and actors will come pouring into any room that you want I could go on craigslist and have 50 actors in my backyard in three hours yeah like that they just come they don't care so it's a supply and demand thing whenever there's more there's a huge demand and a limited supply the people in control of the supply which is the job they're in control they are in control now go on they know it they know they're in control too and it creates this sense of entitlement and uh power that I think is not really there for the most part so which leads into what the to the event so I go in there right and it's like a sometimes there's no explanation sometimes there's like a big like oh so this is this this is that you're this say this like there's a whole rigmarole which is totally unnecessary for the most part because really they don't give a fuck about what you say it's more just like oh yeah that's that's the look of the guy that's him like yes for the most part for almost nine percent of the time there's almost nothing you can do or can't nothing nothing you could do to hurt your chances as much as you could to help them as long as you're just competent and friendly and slightly understand but so it's very similar to going to a place writing your info on the back of your business card and dropping it in a roller it's going to get rolled and one person's name is going to get pulled out of the car right it's just as random except there is something they're picking it for a reason but it's a reason that you don't have any control over for the most I took a commercial acting class brother did yes I did yes I did Stuart Robinson's commercial acting class where he teaches you the importance of the slate the slate the slate that's such a big deal it's like the biggest thing like how to slate how to slate if for you guys who don't know what the slate is is when you it's it's when you've been marched into this sterile room with a bored asshole operating the camera and you have like two lines that you've just driven maybe 30 minutes maybe an hour to come and read the slate is your one chance to show that spark so that's where you do it man that slate that's where you get their attention by saying something clever or funny so hi this is uh head back up to you this is Johnny Pemberton uh age yeah this and over 18 and here we go yes oh too much too much um just just do it normal yeah and then they'll say turn it profiles so you have to turn to your left and turn to your right to show them the sides of your head also if you're doing a commercial that involves food they want to see your hands so you don't have hideous hands if you're holding a product yeah I did a an apple commercial once and they gave me a manicure beforehand wow never aired though I think I'm probably breach and deep breach of contract by even saying that but it doesn't matter so there you so I hopefully I've set up the climate of a commercial audition for you guys so you can understand how special this event that happened to Johnny is to go on what happened so I walk in there and she had and the casting associate is sitting there in a stool next and a little table next to the door to the room and it has the sign-in sheet and I sign in and she she's in the midst of talking with some guy very loudly about like oh yeah Omaha yeah I know a guy when we work there and then oh you know this and yeah well I was there for a couple years back when this happened it's just you know standard yeah drivel conversation yes I'm sure he had initiated because he wanted to like yeah oh uh Megan yeah she knows me you know some some bullshit like this was an actor talking to an actor talking to the associate because it's like he wants to get in her favor I'm sure at the very least it's just small talk he's making this is unnecessary small talk because he wants to whatever I don't even know maybe not but either way that's going on she pauses their conversation and explains the stuff to me which didn't make any sense I'm like I'll just look at it in the packet here look at the packet so I walk I take the pack from her they resume their conversation and walk over and I see a guy some guy taps in the shoulder I'm like oh hey it's a guy I did about a year and a half ago at the last commercial I did um which was like I said this is gonna be the last one I ever do yeah and hated it so yeah uh he was a he was the guy who did the commercial with nice nice young uh guy actor comedian good guy you know not good not bad good person though you know um and he's like oh he has how's it going it's you know it's me remember my name like oh yeah I'm good and I'm just looking at looking at the thing I'm like oh so um what's what's been up and stuff and all of a sudden like I hear like something to my left someone's talking to me and then he also recognizes as well so I turn over and she says to me to us she says I said stop talking no more talking you understand me and I'm like um well that's weird because she was just talking much louder than we were and so I figured it was okay to talk right and we were talking very quietly very very minimal talking wasn't like real like oh buddy oh cool haha wasn't that you're not in a theater no you're not in a movie theater I have a very you're in a waiting room I have a very very low voice you're in a waiting room talking because the person running the audition is talking right well she's not running the audition she's running the waiting room she's running the waiting room so the the lady's running the waiting room she's just been yapping right you begin talking and she says to you she says that to stop talking but she said it so she's already said it and we didn't hear it because we were talking like you're in the fourth grade exactly and so I turn around I'm like oh that's I'm just a little surprised I'm like okay I understand that they're talking too loud but I was like what I said was um oh I figured it was okay because you guys were also talking that's exactly what I said yeah point it out the truth right and then this that gangly dude who was talking to the casting associate says to me whoa that's a good way to talk to casting oh very sarcastically like like I just burned a bridge baby I just burned my chance I just shot my I just cut clip my wings now let me stop you there I want to stop you there now you guys have to understand that in that fascism rears its ugly head in all forms of life fascism is a societal structure that pops up everywhere it doesn't just pop up in the government it pops up where there is limited supply someone in control of that supply and another person who rather than freeing themselves to find their own supply has decided to stroke the cock or pussy of the thing in control of the supply these are the dwarfs of satan these are the pigs snuffling at the feet of power and they are everywhere you'll find them in the classroom you'll find them at your office and goddamn you will find them in the stinking sterile office of Hollywood commercial casting we find them everywhere because people are they're frightened because a lot of times people in that position don't really have much of a personal voice so for them this is this is their life and so they have to be they're very they told the line they played by the rules because it's like what else what else would i do casting in in Hollywood traditional Hollywood casting is very similar to the priest class in some archaic religion that's good that's good so here you have essentially a low-level cleric in the temple of money and this pig disciple has recognized a blasphemy has happened i spoke back oh that is no way to speak with a priest how do you wish to carry his favor into the next world if you speak to the priest there's such you'll be thrown out of the temple why why did you see that did you see what this man just said he just spanked back forth into the face of a cleric yes oh how dare such insolence yes and on on a tuesday yes yes this is this is no different than game of thrones and one of the that shitty old man who sits next to joffrey but that's the thing about the whole situation is that what angrily wasn't her telling me to be quiet like i couldn't understand that and of course i can because it's you're not supposed to talk loud outside the room and what i said and what i said was a little smart aleigh but also who cares right yes what got me what really teed me up was this guy you know doing like what we just said saying that to me uh to try to make himself look better and i was just like i just something i didn't think at all i didn't it was one of those things where i really didn't stop to think about it i was just like no this is not worth it this is just like i'm feeling bad all the way over there i'm just like this is stupid it's dumb so i just took that script i didn't throw it i just dropped it on the ground i looked at him i said fuck you guys i just walked out casually and got in my car and drove home glory very very casual glory oh glory fucking glory you guys there is an opportunity for rebellion at every level of society and anytime you throw that fucking script down and tell a goddamn fascist piece of shit to fuck off you win not just for yourself but for all of us a little bit anytime we push back against that kind of bullshit power it look if you want someone to be quiet you know what you say to them i'm really sorry i i do you guys mind keeping it down if you want to talk can you go outside right and then if you say oh i'm sorry i saw you talking you'd be like yeah i know i'm sorry i should be quiet that's what you say why because it's a human that's why it's a human who's doing a job who's given their time to you you gave your time to them right and uh you're not a fucking you're not some kind of street urchin trying to get a job in a coal factory you're a fucking actor you go to you've trained you're a trained goddamn actor in this piece of fucking shit mantis demon a mantis who's positioned herself as all the demons do at any kind of door they always position themselves the doorways that's inevitably they always get right by the door and that is where they wield their power because it's the only place in the life in their life they can't wield power oh yeah it's definitely this is like pervasive throughout the whole like uh lower tier casting community is that there's this thing where you've given someone uh a sort of a position of power of some power but what happens is is because they have that authority like it's a small authority all the people around them are so they are constantly fawning and very uh they defer to them constantly like this guy did and so it bolts it brings them up even more to even a greater false sense of purpose when really there's nothing happening there at all like you're not doing anything it corrupts them and and and look this is why i want to talk with you about this not just because it's such a victoria's interesting story because in a very small sway it represents the difference between um uh you you know real journalists for example exactly yeah because the because there's real journalists like glenn greenwald there's real journalists and then there's these weird fake journalists like the guy for time magazine you know the guy works for time magazine who tweeted i can't wait to write a story explaining you know congratulation i can't remember what you put up it's basically calling for the drone strike on julie and assange what yeah that's called an establishment journalist oh god i didn't know about that but but so for fascism to exist you you don't you need a few things you need a mouthpiece you need a mouthpiece but you need lap dogs you need people who allow the tyrannical behavior to go on right because because guaranteed man that whoever that tramp is or idiot is who said that fucking thing to you she's gonna think about it the next time that she says things to people she might still act that way right but you put a little burr in her side and enough if we put enough burrs in the side of these bridge trolls then they'll stop i think and i think the ironic thing with that is that for the most part things that people tend to book as actors and uh it tends to be when they go against the grain a little bit yes when you surprise someone who like let's say you're actually like in front of an actual casting director and maybe you are not um i don't mean to be like trying to think how to say this but it's something where you're you're pushing back a little bit and you're not you're not just fawning trying to you're you're you're an individual and you present yourself in a situation where it's not like it's not so much that you need them they need you and you have to remember that they need you more than you need them praise god let me tell you something friends if you're an actor in hollywood you're like a flea on a dog and there's a lot of fleas on that fucking dog there's a lot of fleas on that dog and there's nice little meaty places where there's more blood to suck and those fleas try to fight for that one place the brave fleas are the ones who realize that there's a lot more dog than these actors think there's a lot of other places to go to suck that sweet red and you don't have to just do it in the clustered around these places right but the way that the system works right now is they've got us all fucking convinced that there's only a few arteries to get the energy from right yeah what's the stat it's the same as like journalism or anything else there's a status quo and it's so deeply entrenched that it's hard to uh unless you really step back and look at it it's hard to do anything other other than what is already there well man i mean i think i don't know i i don't know i you know i don't want to be the fucking pied piper a hamlin here and lead people into a into a side of a mountain if you are familiar with the i'm sorry for the spoiler for the pi pi piper hamlin you know the story of the pi piper hamlin i know i think i know it right i don't think i've read it and since i was a kid right basically the story the pied piper is they get this guy to play the flute to lead the rats into a river having a rat play yeah and he comes in plays the flute and yeah and the rats follow him into a river and then he plays the flute again and leads all the kids from the village into the side of a mountain that's the story of the pied piper hamlin it's a really eerie ending why do you do it who the fuck knows man he's gonna chop up those kids why why did he do it no one knows why the pied piper hamlin did it but there are probably nothing good happened inside that mountain we'll never know maybe there was a paradise for kids in there but i've been feeling it's a sausage shop on the other side of that mountain sausage shop it's a kid sausage so i don't want to lead people into a grinder but i'm telling you man this whole thing about having to have a boss you know the boss fixation yeah everyone's hooked on a boss and a leader these days it's like what the fuck's going on man we've got we've got this crazy psychotic idea where it's like you gotta find a good boss find yourself a good boss and start working for him or her find me a job yeah yeah this uh i know he was talking about consular but he always talks about uh one of his books i can't think of one of his uh fiction books he talks about how like post apocalypse how all these people who were like captains of industry and had like big rich guys own like a bunch of carpet factories and stuff all the sudden kind of became laborers and the people who did become leaders the ones who were just natural leaders you're like the person who's gonna right actually a leader as opposed to being like a like a fucking greedy i'm not talking about being a leader i'm talking about being a hunter and the prey that you're hunting is energy sources that you could feed yourself with which is why when i'm driving down the you know when i was younger and dumb and judgmental and prickish as i'm sure i am a lot of ways now but when i was extremely much more judgmental and prickish you know you drive down the highway and you pass people who are selling fruit right and you roll you know what you kind of roll your eyes like a poor you feel bad for them right oh look at them and the heat selling the fruit but really what they're doing is so awesome they've taken control of their lives right they don't have them they've gotten some they've gotten a product they found a place where there's people and they're fucking selling that shit that's what i always think about the guys i see going through the trash to get cans for a long time i've like like you by first used to feel bad about them but then i'm like this guy i mean he's not making any money he's making a very small amount but we don't know he lives it's his own schedule he gets to work as much as he wants as much as he doesn't want to work so in a sense it's like it's kind of great it's beautiful you're super free it's beautiful man you get yourself free you get yourself out from underneath those motherfuckers because they're man they're everywhere i'm telling you there's a war going on right now and the war is between people these bridge trolls these people who has managed to get themselves in seats of power and who have no problem being a dick to people by the way they're great bosses out there there are a good business as a team enterprise where a group of people have gathered together and focused their will it's like a coven a good business should operate like a coven a group of alchemists magicians witches warlocks metaphysicians have all merged their will in the direction of bringing something into the earth whatever the thing is and the thing that they bring into the earth as a byproduct of the generation of the thing creates money for everyone to prosper from that's a beautiful thing right the my the the merging and fusing of the minds to create this beautiful thing but then there's the evil boss which is the enslavement business which is like we don't fucking need you you think we need you you're lucky you've got this fucking job here john yeah yeah you're lucky to be here that that that that that when it manifests in the form of a of a boss what you're seeing there if you put that person let's just say that we were operating the sims and you could like turn the dial of that person's power up to 10 instead of the 0.2 that it is at 10 you got Mussolini right at 10 you've got fucking Hitler at 10 you've got a beast whatever this monstrous twat was that told you to be quiet and then like didn't acknowledge her own fault and acted like you were lucky to be there she's her power level is like 0.1 in the world tiny tiny little power a little maggot lady you turn that up to 10 turn that up to 10 give her not control over a commercial edition but let's say that she now has control over a prison let's say you know what i mean let's say that she has control over a prison or a school like she's a principal of a school or let's say that she's a judge yeah fuck you've got disaster but you have it everywhere all the time already that's like half of the half of the judges or any person you talk about you just mentioned that's that's who they are yes that's already many many people who put on those black shiny boots strap their guns on and put the badge into their fucking pocket they're the same too not all of them yeah i just depends i guess you gotta watch a lot of episodes of cops which is really amazing to watch when you consider the fact that drugs shouldn't be illegal yeah it's also amazing to watch when you see like the cops have a really high suicide rate for a reason because sometimes it's like this job fucking sucks no shit i have to see the worst of people every day and i can't do anything about it but lock them up or be like a total dick yeah imagine not a total dick then it's like you have to deal with the the reality the situation that you cannot change and you're basically oh imagine if there was a job where you had to go respond to swarms of wasps and you knew that you're just gonna probably get stung eventually yeah that's true man because people are assholes and they do freak out and they do like do horrible things and we need we need very strong powerful humans who are armed to uh get those people under control but general but but a real problem is that the laws that are currently intact are designed are not really based on those people so much as they are and like drugs cops every everything on cops is drug related offenses it's crazy it's just it's all it takes if drugs were legal i don't know that the show cops could exist it would be a much different show probably probably a much sadder show because it all be about like domestic violence yes and like like people taking their kids away and like oh his yeah we can't find his head i guess it just it got blown off somewhere robberies yeah i mean when you see a fucking cop pull somebody over like there's a one in one in one um one episode he pulls these kids over now smell marijuana in here are you guys smoking marijuana and the kids are like no yeah and they let him search the car the guy finds marijuana the girl in the car is sitting on the curb the cop goes over to her and like i don't remember what he does maybe he tries to handcuff her and she starts screaming like get off of me don't touch me get off of me don't touch me she just got three more charges now yes but it's like her reaction was right yeah that is the response you should have to a man trying to put manacles on you because you had a plant substance on you yeah it's like you know dogs uh dogs bark for a reason yeah generally now some reactions to the cops on the other hand like when you see a drunk piece of shit you like it's been driving half asleep and gets pulled over right and then like does that weird thing where they stiffen their arms up to try yeah that's some weird thing i think it's super stiff no no no no no no i'm sorry i'm so sorry i'm so no no no no look i'm so sorry i did a bad thing no almost as though almost as though uh almost as though if you could keep your arms up long enough they'd be like well okay we can't arrest you see you later guy there's that you know that new stop and well the old stop and frisk policy they had a new york city where cops can stop and frisk anyone they think is suspicious yes but they just overturned it and of course bloomberg is like furious because he thinks it's going to mean like white people are going to get raped and murdered in the daytime yes five seconds they found out that they um they stopped and frisked more black men than live in the city of new york the number of black men they stopped and frisked so that means some of these guys have been stopped and frisked multiple times in one year and they said they have a 92% 96% failure rate so 96% of the time there's nothing there nothing there nothing at all nothing there but that ain't the point nope it's not it's to slow you down and make you think about what you're doing yeah make you think about what you're doing with that wee boy it's to remind you that you aren't free it's to remind you that you must submit to the dragon it's just a little thing if you don't oh shit that's like that's what that's the best thing because they're basically creating like this little like uh dead man switch where they present an opportunity it's very easy to stop and frisk right but let's say you don't let's say you for some reason you falter you say the wrong thing you refuse you got six more charges and you probably brought up in something yes felony yeah all because you just didn't quite react right right be calm and simple and like demure enough for some fucking idiot imagine if we lived in a theocracy and there were like robed servants of the church who walk through the streets and randomly stop people and ask them to bow down to some uh ancient god excuse me sir do you love and worship barbarians yes yes i do yes then prove it on your knees i want to see the love of binarius show me you love him kiss the emblem on my cloak why do you not bow why would you not bow oh dashneen he waited many seconds before bowing to my cloak yeah there's something must be going on in the man's mind it says in the scrolls of logon that those who do not bow must be punished bring him here fetch me my clicker twine his hands and bring him to the chariot he did not bow fetch the gunt if yeah it is the same listen if if you have a high percentage of not finding anything on these people you really are not looking at this point you're not looking for anything you're just asking them to bow to power right bow to the power bow to the power bow to the power when you go to the fucking airport what are they asking you to do bow to the power bow to the power bow bow i have a new technique for that what no eye contact not at all none eye contact yeah well yeah i mean i have like if you do that's do if you don't make eye contact with a person there's something about that that i think is kind of demeaning no i think that's a great form of activism is to make no eye contact and just wander through you know what ari just fucking did i don't want to know but i want to know ari just uh as i taught forgive me ari if you somehow hear about this and i and i don't tell the story exactly right but ari didn't want to take his shoes off so he told the um i guess he sees he said he has some kind of medical condition and they um they asked him anyway the long and short of it is the beauty of this story is uh ari farted as the guy was saying you have to do what i say ari farted really trying to he said it just happened at the perfect time ari farted really loudly and said well you have to smell my fart what did the guy say the guy called over sheriffs you know they yeah they called over cops they fucking they they you know they but they couldn't do anything because here's the awesome crazy beauty of this country is that they there's still this fucking constitution and they can't override the constitution they want to but they can't so they're fucking they like rattles their little goddamn uh uh lizard brains when people have the audacity to stand up to power it freaks them out man even if it's just like a little thing or it's like just a little just a small thing like whoa whoa whoa whoa what yeah like that's a just small thing just you have to smell my fart it's basically meaningless yeah but it's it's still it's like it's in and you know the more these things happen the more there's just you know i i think that martin luther king had it right nonviolent um nonviolent resistance is the greatest form of resistance because as long as you resist make it hard for them and make it public it's infuriating it well and it embarrasses them like when you have um when you have like when you see the the the in in fucking the marches in mississippi right when you see black people getting hosed down and they're just sitting with their hands behind their back passive peaceful resistance forces the dragon to be violent when the dragon is violent it illuminates the fact of who's right and who's wrong you also when when something loses it's cool like that it's uh becomes vulnerable because yes it starts to get stupid you get stupid when you're going crazy yeah that's an anger you get stupid yeah and then you get stupid that means that it makes you smarter by default because you're dealing with something that's become uh the variables shrunk so it's it's easier to deal with it's easier to compartmentalize because it's just this it's like a fucking angry dog it's beautiful man like this thing that happened to glenn greenwald's boyfriend you know about this right i didn't know he was gay yeah he's fucking terrible jesus christ evil man what a fucking true evil he's so he's gay he's so he's so wonderful like he was he's great he got in a tweet interaction with someone on twitter some dumb lady was like you and your quote friend and he's like friend why do you keep calling him a friend it's my spouse what are you from 1954 i love him but greenwald's uh partner uh you know got detained uh you know about this right no i don't know so i've been in a hole glenn greenwald lives in brazil with his boyfriend or husband i guess and his husband was flying into i don't know it was flying into the uk and the plane landed they said everyone coming out of the plane please show your passports uh greenwald's husband gets or partner i don't know if they're he said his husband's spouse greenwald's spouse gets um uh gets detained under a terrorism statute that says that they can hold him for nine hours and question him and he can't get attorneys or cops they destroyed his hard drive they they took all his shit they confiscated his computer this is in brazil this is in the uk oh the uk this is in the fucking uk is he in the uk is this like a is he in like a piece of america like the embassy where they have in the airport where it's it's uh he's a no this is the this is in the uk the uk is also has a similar apparently has a similar they have their version of the patreon they have their version of the nsa yeah and and snowden is revealing this and greenwald is at the helm and the guardian is at the helm they destroyed hard drives uh they destroyed the guardians hard drives so you can see that um greenwald's spouse's reaction had it been in any way violent had he fought had he reacted in any kind of violent way it would completely diminish his position right but if you stay cool then these people are shown to be what they really are right and what they really are is power hungry corporatists and the more that you fucking stand up to them and really subtle yet public ways i think the more that they are power shrinks yeah yeah uh yep which is why you deserve a Nobel prize for shaking the war stick at that little demon yeah man i think that it's the more i think about it the more i realize that like not that you i always ask people like what's something that you can do to fight against this kind of bullshit and i think the answer is recognize that this bullshit doesn't just exist in the government oh it's everywhere because it trickles down and it's every sort of thing it's all over the place but i think sometimes i think the best thing you can do is uh is if you're super polite all the time it's like it goes back the same thing like being nonviolent and being calm so where if you make it if you always put it upon the other person to be the aggressor to make the mistake to be the person who's making something out of nothing yeah then it just puts a spotlight on them and like you're being you're being ridiculous so maybe throwing maybe throwing down your papers and saying fuck you was a little reactive maybe there was a better way to do it to be to be like well you know i think that you're a fascist pig twat so now that's the same thing well for me it was just like i was just done with this like like i said i didn't really think about it because i didn't i knew there was nothing because you can't explain something to a person in that situation and have it come out any way that is gonna be beneficial to anyone even yourself it's like a thing where certain certain things are just a lost cause and you have to just extract yourself from the equation be like oh this is this is just a bad situation that i don't need to be in i think it's sometimes recognize when you've gotten yourself in a place where someone's trying to dominate you maybe yeah and ask yourself do i want to be dominated and if the answer to that is no i don't feel like being dominated right now then don't let them leave then leave get out of the situation don't let them address it don't don't address that if you want to be dominated and there's lots of great times to be dominated let it happen but when you get around some puffed up shit pig who's being brown nose by every loser squirming hungry impoverished fawning fawning tardling tardling then then that person don't water their weeds yeah with your with your submission it's hard though man i'm getting too old for this shit it's hard though right it's hard because there is we've been taught to ask us yeah it's very hard but i i really think though if you don't do it all the time good things come of it because like it's like that thing where oh i don't know it's it's in so many things but it's a thing where if you try if you experiment you try something you didn't wouldn't normally do that kind of makes you scared you're like wow that wasn't so bad yeah actually something great came of it because yeah it's like you know if you're doing stand-up and you're really fucking around you don't care that's sometimes when the best stuff happens the best like oh like that was just i didn't care at all i'm just actually totally just having fun oh it's throwing yourself out into the void man it's like walking past the light of the campfire into the forest of your fear and just dealing with the dealing with the abyss you know i hate it man i just you know we talked about i just did that man and just throws me into the oh stand-up yeah yeah not stand-up but you know i'm saying in life right sometimes you got to go into the dark you know where you're not prepared to go because it gets you closer to what you really are and for whatever reason the universe is built with a security system installed that keeps you from going into those places i don't know why but the you know that you're getting close to the where you're not supposed to be the moment the fears happens you know the fear starts rising in you or the loneliness starts rising in you or the sense of the moment you trick yourself into thinking like i'll never find anyone again that people think that sometimes and it's not just with a relationship it's with a boss oh so anything i'll never find a job like this again i'll never find a place like this again i'll never find a lover like this again i'll never find a dog like this again i know you won't because you're saying that you won't find it well yeah and that mentality is so crazy that that mentality is yeah that mentality is a scarcity mentality and god damn it we don't live in a in a universe of scarcity abundance i don't i mean i don't know i could be wrong man but sometimes i feel like we're in the garden of eden only we've gotten so high on human neurology that we're having these terrible trips where we think we're in a desert yeah well i always think about this uh i interviewed this guy on podcast a while ago like a year ago just um black dude and lee lee weaver he uh grew up in florida like he's he's in his eighties right old man and he was telling me how when he grew up in florida he's like i didn't know we were poor we had everything we had we had mangoes we had papayas donkeys and chickens i thought was the greatest thing ever i didn't know we were poor yeah it's like i'll find out later we were incredibly poor yeah but he had no idea because it's like lucky man what what what is it you're you are rich because you have if you have food to eat and you're having fun and you have family and friends like yes that's pretty that's pretty wealthy pretty that's pretty if you have freedom yeah that's like extreme wealth that's a massive amount of wealth yeah and i always forget to think about that i'm like yeah you know what that's so you think about such a great way to think about things that you know because kids kids always uh they find joy in things that adults just somehow found a way to overlook like chips like fucking chips are so good yes tortilla chips chips in a swimming pool baby give kids give a kid a couple bags of tortilla chips that's like the best thing you can give a kid some tortilla trips and chips take them to a public pool and tell them you get there you're gonna watch Finding Nemo in the evening and you've basically given them space tourism right it's joy i can remember man there was a swimming pool when i visit my dad after the divorce he had a swimming pool it was apartment complex and i can remember every once in a while i'd be like hey we're gonna go to a movie tonight and i would be swimming in the pool thinking in like four hours i'm gonna be fucking watching a movie and i would be in paradise yeah it's great to look forward to things but the ghoul climbs on our backs it whispers in our ears the next thing we know suddenly we're wandering we think we're in a graveyard when it's just this verdant beautiful orchard filled with ripe fruits for us to eat from but we've convinced ourselves that whatever this thing or that thing is is the only thing that there's nothing else exists this is the only well this is the only fruit tree this is the only vagina or penis there's a lot of them especially if they perfect that uh that that vaginal ball what's that in australia no i'm making this vaginal sounds like a like a oh i thought you meant like a vaginal like some kind of like dance event oh yeah it's a it's a vaginal celebration it's uh it's made they made a giant labia out of this weird like neuroplastic magic foam it's about three miles long and it just opens up at first light and all this it takes all the light in it's like a giant leaf and it sucks it in then it sprays out this crazy uh pink liquid that anyone can eat and it's really tasty and what i'm just kidding god damn it don't do that to me man for a second i'm like this is the greatest thing i've ever heard it's air's rock air's rock it's a giant it's a giant space vagina did you know about this what you know air's rock no it's that big rock that's out in the uh the what do they call it the middle of uh milky way what do they call that shit in in australia where the desert is they have a name for it out the back there's a big rock on the outback called air's rock i don't know where it came from it's an old rock it's you know it's eons old and it's they found out that it's just a space vagina it's just a giant wow it's where it's where the it's where the moon came out of all the moons they came out of the hole in there like that that's why aborigines stay there that's what dream time's all about they dream about being rebirthed through the giant rock vagina can we get back to the vaginal ball real quick what is that well i think that's like it's like a soccer ball except instead of having those little hexagons of color it's vaginas really it's like your fuck block remember your fuck that old rusty that's like a 10 year old joke that's a fucking that that joke is old have you ever brought it back that joke is pre-september 11 should i tell the joke sure i don't know if i can tell it okay um guys guys i can't leave my house anymore i just got one of these new fuck blobs i got a new fuck block the joke guys this is one of the first jokes i ever wrote and the joke is it's a fuck blob gee here they're building these you know i don't know if you guys heard about this really just genetically engineered fish that can glow in the dark can you imagine that they're scientists actually spending their time genetically engineering fish to glow in the dark why don't they make a fuck blob wouldn't that be great just around bulbous thing covered in lips and vaginas that lives off human sexual secretions you've definitely done that a lot i've done it so much in the past i haven't done it you know i haven't done it in eons and then like i did the ice house with rogan yeah and we we were like that i did it again and uh because we were all gonna do our oldest joke that we could remember and it was weird i was like fuck man i remember the existence of the thing i remember it's so well it's done a million times it's muscle memory it's like muscle memory in your mouth what is a vaginal ball is that really what it is it's a it's a soccer ball you fuck i just made it up because i was thinking about your fuck blob but you were saying something about like this is so there's no vaginal ball no it's nothing they're called no you're talking about benoit balls no i wasn't i was making it up totally i can't believe i got sucked into your your god damn uh you're you're

58^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - LOU BARLOW!!!! Transcript and Discussion^2013-06-25^Good evening, morning, hello friends and thank you for listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast voted by the NSA and the TSA to be the safest podcast in America today. I'm very proud of that title and it's really exciting to me so you can expect to hear this podcast being piped in when you go through security checkpoints, not just at airports but the upcoming security checkpoints that are going to be at shopping malls and bus stations and subways. Very exciting to me because I get so nervous when I'm not getting padded down every couple of hours. Today's podcast has Lou Barlow who for me is one of my favorite musicians and I've got a really sentimental attachment to his music because I will always associate his music with a time in my life when I got knocked off track which I consider to be a really good thing and when I say knocked off track I mean if you're lucky you will encounter a person or a philosophy or psychedelics or a style of music. Usually all those things get mixed together but you'll come into contact with something that pushes you away from the course of your life that was generally dictated by the whims of your parents or whatever geographical terrain you happen to get blasted out of a pussy into. Generally when you get knocked off track you know it's happening because people around you like who have been trying to condition you and keep you marching in a certain direction will start getting nervous for you or worried about you and sometimes rightfully so because getting knocked off track doesn't always mean that things end up great. It doesn't always mean that you recover from getting knocked off track. Some people get knocked off track by the wrong person and go down a terrible dark meth spiral that ends with them covered and claw marks all over their face and venereal warts and scabies and stinking of whatever dumpster they happen to be sleeping in. It's not always it's not safe getting knocked off track isn't safe but neither is not getting knocked off track. I mean if you don't get knocked off track you can end up in a tremendously terrible situation just a different kind of situation. Sure you're clean because you have access to a shower but inside if you don't get knocked off track you can be this bubbling mass of pain and sadness and bitterness because you're locked into the vice of whatever specific iron mask you allowed to get clamped around your head that you pretended was your personality or who you were and ended up at a bank job that you hate or in a two-story suburban house on the breeding grid blasting loads into a woman that you fell out of love with three days after the honeymoon and now feel attached to because you've produced offspring that depend on you for everything and you desperately try to hide from them your misery even though it radiates off of you and great blasts and streams of sad horror so that your kids become infected with your cowardice and end up much like you getting lost in the world of corporations and emptiness and this can go on for generation after generation after generation. Both sides are pretty dangerous because it's dangerous to exist on a planet as a human being that is floating in an enormous vacuum and has caused the extinction of countless species throughout the millennia. I think Doug Stanhope sums up the dangers of ending up in a shit life far better than whatever that rambling monologue was and I want to play for you. This is actually a comedy bit from Doug Stanhope who if you've never listened to Doug Stanhope immediately go to his website Dougstanhope.com. Not only is he R. Bill Hicks, he's also an amazing writer and he posts essays up on his website all the time but before we get into Lou Barlow and Lou Barlow's music I'm going to play for you this bit by Doug Stanhope which unfortunately some asshole added folk music to which you should never just don't do that if you find something that you like if you find some kind of rant or a comedy bit or some kind of monologue that doesn't have folk music behind it or techno music behind it don't add the techno music you're not helping if you want to distribute great information out into the world go ahead and do it but you don't have to add a soundtrack to it it doesn't make it any better if you put skrillex behind anything it in fact will make it seem dumber you could put skrillex under the I have a dream speech and the I have a dream speech goes from being one of the most inspired speeches in human history to something you might hear a coke addled beat poet saying in the urinal of cheap nightclub so don't add music to stuff I couldn't find a version of this bit that didn't have music underneath it so I'm just going to play it but this is what this is a great bit about what happens if you don't get knocked off course or what can you see some people stuck in their shitty lives remember scared straight that program the documentary in the late seventies they brought all these delinquent kids in a prison who are on the wrong path they yelled at them all the prisoners told them about anal rape and all these horrible things to scare them straight and most of them did did you see the 20 year reunion they did a 20 year reunion where they caught up with all these kids 20 years later and they all went straight except for one or something but they were the most gray dead ugly people you've ever seen in your lives are just miserable and hunched over they got factory jobs working at the dairy plant or the pipe manufacturing company and you know they all wish they had a sack full of drinks money right now out there on the lamb wish that dairy plant had a scared straight program when they were 18 you want to be like me you think this is funny motherfucker you're just going to work here as a summer job until you get your shit together that's what you think that's what I thought 40 years look at my fucking eyes motherfucker 40 years give me your goddamn shoes give me your shoes that's from stan opes album take the edge off you should get the album if you haven't heard it and if you never listened to Doug stan ope just put his name in a youtube he is one of the greats but that's what happens you can end up in the dairy factory or you can end up in a in a in a cubicle you can end up in all kinds of weird tricky places I've got I've gotten trapped in a desk job before and it happens in this amazingly slow way where just it's gradually just kind of get drawn into this comfort the comfort that comes with the job is spectacular and that you know every couple of weeks you're going to get this exact amount of money that you can feed into the ATM and if you don't have a regular job if you're freelancing then you just don't know when those checks go in that's the last check that goes in and then after that you don't know what's going to happen it's terrifying and sometimes you have kids so and you got to take care of them you can't just go wandering off into the streets pretending to be Jesus or go up into the mountains because your karma is that you have children that you need to take care of and I'm definitely not advocating being irresponsible you do have to deal with the truth of your situation I think sometimes for some people the truth of the situation is that you have to transform whatever specific thing that you happen to have gotten trapped into into something that teaches you and something that compels you to work really really hard to get out of the trap this is something Ram Dass talks about when he talks about spiritual practice he calls those traps he says that any type of true spiritual practice should be a self-destructing trap which lures you into it you begin to you know follow whatever the specific dogma is or ceremony or patterns of the thing and then if the thing is true then you begin to realize that you don't need the dogma anymore and you don't need the patterns of the thing and you don't need whatever specific discipline that went along with the religion or spiritual path that you picked up you begin to realize that the thing was inside you all the time and so it falls apart well I guess that's what everything should be like really is over time everything just goes from being manacles keeping you clamped down and some shit life to a kind of jungle gym set where if you can if you have the skill and the mindfulness and the willpower then you can use whatever the thing is to gain enough strength to break free from it like in the Conan movie where they put him on whatever that horse track is and somehow from pushing that log around in a circle over the course of 15 years he gets like a weight lifter's body as though somewhere on that horse track there was a triceps machine and some human growth hormone so we all get trapped I'm not saying to quit whatever you're in or to stop whatever you're in just recognize that if you are in a situation and by the way sometimes people will like send me emails reprimanding me because sometimes we on this podcast or when I go in Rogan's podcast will always use the term like trapped in a cubicle and people will write and say I love my job and I'm in a cubicle why do you talk down to us like that and I can see I would seem pretentious or pompous for somebody who's like yeah he's just he does a podcast and isn't in that situation to be talking about it is but I've been in that situation number one and number two what I'm saying is has been validated recently in the news where a Gallup poll showed that something like 80% of workers don't like their jobs which isn't a mind blowing surprise to me but the 80% of them had mentally checked out from their jobs so I'm not saying anything brand new if you're somebody who works in a cubicle and you're enjoying it well you're one of the lucky 20% or 30% but a lot of people don't like it a lot of people end up you know a lot of people are in a kind of terrible coma one of my friends just with just actually walked out of his job because he couldn't take it anymore he walked out of his job he had the guts to finally tell his boss to fuck off and walked out of the job and it was terrifying there's no guarantee that if you if you you have to be smart there's no guarantee that escaping from a specific type of trap is going to lead to a Disney movie ending it doesn't always work like that if it works like that then everyone at this very moment would go pouring into the streets from the terrible high rises where they had found themselves wrapped in glass and steel having their life energy and their time extracted from them by corporate vampires who transform it into gobs of money that they then use to fuel their wild Illuminati sex parties where they mouth fuck Tibetan monks who they have had shipped in from China anyway I'll always I always have a kind of a I'll always have a sentimental feeling towards Lou Barlow and towards his various bands because I associate his music with a time when I was getting a lot of information downloaded into my brain which was when I was in college and I was just learning about existentialism and I was lucky enough to have made friends with this lunatic named Emil Amos who ended up starting a band called the Holy Sons and who now plays drums in a band called Ohm and has been in the podcast a few times but he was the guy who introduced me to this genre of music but not just this genre of music but a kind of ethic that goes along with it which is this ethic of brutal honesty with oneself and that sounds when you hear it being honest with yourself I think a lot of people pretend that they're being honest with themselves or like to think that they're completely honest with themselves but this level of honesty that I learned about what you can find if you read the myth of Sisyphus by Camus or check out maybe read the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky or if you start examining some Sart or Nietzsche all the kind of stuff that you end up encountering when you're in college if you go to a liberal arts school if you read that stuff it's a type of honesty that undercuts whatever the zeitgeist or the conditioning happens to be it goes underneath everything and from that's undercutting it it can from reading it it can actually cause you to start walking with a philosophical limp because you begin to realize that maybe your whole life you've been lying to yourself about what you really like or who you really are what you really want because a lot of people just pretend that they want what they want they act like the life that they're living is really the life that they want to be living and they've gotten so good at pretending that that's the life that they want that they actually forget their real dreams this is one of the worst forms of the walking dead that exists I mean you're worse than a zombie when this happens because a zombie knows what it wants a zombie wants human flesh it wants to fill its mouth with the hot warm guts of the living this form of zombie it doesn't even know what it's it's eating food that it doesn't like it's it's usually with a woman or a man that it's settled for not it's it's usually in relationships that are these lukewarm tepid little things that are just based on safety and comfort and have no spark or passion inside of them and this kind of zombie will like try to gain success in fields that it has no interest in it'll try to become a who knows an actor or a real estate agent or something it just doesn't even want to do and sometimes this zombie will actually get success in that field but everything that it gets it it doesn't satisfy it at all which is why sometimes you'll meet very successful people and it looks like the grim reaper has chiseled out the interior of their face just underneath the skin and their face kind of drops backwards into their head and they have these like just giant black circles under their eyes and this bleary tired look they look like zombies and the reason they look like that is because they haven't been eating the right food not literally eating the right food but eating the food of life that they really crave for example when you go and watch grizzly man you see Timothy Treadwell who is clearly a gay man who is pretending to be straight and because he can't handle probably what his real sexuality is he's gone wandering off into the wilderness to try to hang out with grizzly bears because for him it's easier to be around the most ferocious animals on earth than it is to deal with the truth of who you really is and that's what it is for a lot of people a lot of people would rather eat breakfast with a wild grizzly bear than eat breakfast with their true selves and so there's certain kinds of music and there's certain types of philosophy that act like garlic or crucifixes to vampires when it when it comes to this sort of person where when they hear it for the first time they think that they're sometimes they'll think that they're just listening to like a crazy person or a retarded person singing that's what I thought the first time I heard Daniel Johnston it was like horrifying to me because at the time I was so closed in and pretending to be happy when I was absolutely miserable and quite often would pretend that I was telling the truth when in fact I was just lying about how I felt or who I really was and when you come into contact with someone who's a musician like Daniel Johnston Nick Drake Lou Barlow Elliot Smith when you come into contact with someone who is honestly articulating exactly how they feel you're listening to what I would consider heroism you're listening to it takes your like sonic courage because it it takes like it I don't know what I don't know how you do it actually I don't know but what it does when you hear this level of honesty is it activates the honest part of yourself and if you've been hiding from yourself it can have the same effect on you that you know getting paranoid from smoking weed you know it's the same thing can happen like if you smoke really powerful marijuana and you've been hiding shit from yourself then suddenly you will go into a paranoid episode because you begin to think about all the all this shit that you've been trying to ignore whatever it is from the most mundane stuff like you need to clean your house to the deepest stuff like you're totally not in love with the person that you're married to and all that stuff will come swirling and spiraling up out of your subconscious and it's it can be brutal and that's what creates the bad marijuana trips that you hear so many people complain about well philosophy and music and art of a certain type can have that same exact effect on you it's the effect of coming into contact with truth and when you come into contact with truth quite often not all the time but quite often it's a painful thing especially if you've been being dishonest to yourself for most of your life it just hurts it feels weird it feels crazy when I first heard Daniel Johnston I thought that I was hearing like actual satanic music and really what I was hearing is someone who is being honest but I was so I was I'd been lying to myself for so long that my brain told me that truth was equal to Satan but like all think like all tough truths or weird truths or hard truths what ends up happening is if you don't run away from it and you begin to contemplate it and roll it around in your head the thing that seems so dark and horrific you begin to find is actually one of the most beautiful things that you've ever come in contact with this is also true not just for music and art it's true when you get like a cancer diagnosis for example a thing that initially seems so awful nightmarish and monstrous can quite often be the thing that turns you into a human being and helps you appreciate life maybe for the first time ever okay sorry for the long-winded rant you guys but if you're upset about these rants I'm surprised you still listen to the podcast and if you're really upset about them then I have some I'm about to blow your fucking mind here you can skip ahead on this

Please welcome to the Dugger Trussell family our my musical hero the legend Lou Barlow Lou Barlow Welcome to the Dugger Trussell family hour Thank you. Thanks for doing this doing the show the last time you did this show was with and When I was the lavender hour when I was still in Natasha. Yep, and that really sweet place near Ivanhoe elementary Yes, that was a sweet. That is a sweet pad Yeah, I saw some people in your your old driveway the other day because I was walking my daughter by there I'm sure I'm sure there's always people there having fun eating fruit Dancing there's a lot of canopies in those yards back there now, you know those party canopy thing Yeah, people enjoying it. It's a hotel, California out there. I'm sure that's what it's like over there I'm non-stop orgies wine fountains. I don't know about that Yeah, I know what the context. I know it is it's right the elementary school is right there, so I know it for Right elementary school area. Yeah. Yeah, that it will right. I shouldn't have said yeah Orges have ever happened here at elementary school. No, it's Yeah, I'm sure they have they're ever they're everywhere not fun Don't want to go to an orgy. That's never been something. I've been drawn to hmm. Have you Pause of course you're a rock star you go no, no, I mean I've never Yeah, but I guess I've been curious about what actually yeah to be honest. Yeah, I'm too and I mean I know that it would be weird and it would be like But I guess just it's a part of a human experience. It's sort of red is a young age I was like I thought that seemed like a good idea Right as an adult, of course, you understand what the the big picture is but when I was younger It was sort of Something I was kind of fascinated by so I think I'm too insecure to go to an orgy is the problem I can barely go to a pool without feeling just like I'm this Disgusting pit demon that crawled into the pool much less an orgy. Well, I would just like a Observing it or just under just being seeing what was actually How people were interacting with each other? I don't know How I would react in a sexual way, but I know that just at least mentally or Have to say I'm a little curious now I want to go to one my friend goes to me was it telling me all about it and he said like there's different You know like that they'll have like sometimes swingers will get a hotel and they'll have different room like different orgy rooms And so like there's rooms where you can just go and watch Yeah, but then there's rooms where if you're there you've got to fuck like there's no choice Well, you always have a choice If you don't you're yeah, if you don't it's bat you're in prison You don't it's You never want to hear that you never want to hear there's no choice, but to fuck here well Nine times out of ten. That's a bad thing to hear. I yeah So what's been going on I didn't mean to I'm sorry we opened up on them weird with the orgy talk. No, it was interesting actually Sorry, I don't feel really articulate Turn out. Okay. Yes I haven't smoked in a while so oh, yeah, I'm sorry, you know that that's actually Your leaf that's fairly mild. I know marijuana. That's the PCP in there that's strong Yeah Yeah, that's funny. I Haven't spoke I haven't I've sort of stopped smoking pot regularly and then my life really changed Like what we were talking about. I was trying to figure out the correlation between the two for Like Reese very recently I was thinking about it because pot would always Managed to give me these great moments where I just examined everything that was going on in my life Or if I had a disagreement with somebody I Would just think about it so much and find ways around it or see how see how maybe the other person felt I really considered it to to be a really like part of my empathy or it was very I But then I guess recently looking back on it. I wonder if it was actually something that Really made me avoid a lot of stuff in my life, you know I'm just in that cliche way that they say drugs do but I never really believed because I always thought pot was really something that was about discovery and and Since I've kind of been off of it for You know a lot, you know like at least nine or ten months, so wow, so it's made me I've kind of had to re-examine what it's Rolling my life was and Well, it can goddamn be and it's an addiction for some people. I mean that's the the somehow marijuana has managed to squirm its way into a category for some people where they've like just decided it's it's They smoke insane amounts of it. Yeah, no people who like I mean there's musicians that I know that are like They will smoke and ate the day easy and they can't even keep it on tour with them because they they literally they just literally Wake up and smoke it Copious amounts all day long. Yeah And I've never done that I've never done that. I've but I have I mean I've gotten close where I've been I've gone into eating it and stuff Where I'll like wake up and chomp on it and I've done that I actually I did that fairly recently in my life That was my last kind of that was the last bit that actually kind of scared me out of daily use of Marijuana was eating it. Oh, that's a massive paranoid attacks. Yes Those attacks are amazing. They're almost like seizures or something. Yeah, I mean they generally would resolve themselves nicely But the onset of them was terrifying, you know like really Especially because I have kids and stuff, right? I mean when I have that kind of responsibility that I carry around it's like It's not like it was when you're younger. You're like, oh, I think I'm gonna die right now I'm gonna get hit by a cut you know, it's like it becomes much more just Devastatingly I can't die because I have to take care of my kids I know and you're thinking about the children and all of the possibilities for them It's like you're pop though what you're thinking about all the possibilities all the worst-case scenarios are Multiplied. Yeah, you know, it's not just about your little worst-case scenario. It's about all Everyone around you and the people that you take care of their worst-case scenario. So there's a maloosie K joke and I can't remember how it goes It's I don't even know if I've I don't have the whole joke even memorized, but I remember him saying if you Look if you don't have kids, you're you're nothing you're really just nothing you're just a piece He's like you don't have anything to take care of you don't know what it's like you don't understand And I think that that's a harsh way of saying something that I've heard reflected in so many different of my friends who have kids Which is that you really don't understand until you cross over that threshold when suddenly you have this being that Is looking at you in a spin in the most loving way that depends on you and yeah Yeah, I know man. I don't that's the problem I'm able to just kind of run a muck through my life because I don't have I don't I have a room But I have an electronic robot vacuum cleaner. That's the supplants yeah, but That's okay Actually, I yeah, I'm more understand. I think there is a time when I was a bit smug about it. I guess you know like being a parent Like yeah, you don't know But but you know what it's okay, but you know some it's like I don't know I don't know just I guess recently just with myself. It's like it doesn't it doesn't like being having this I don't know. It's hard to describe but I mean, it's like uh God, I'm being I can't can you talk about what we were talking about before. Yeah, well Well, I would say like okay, you're saying like if I when I didn't have kids It's like I could do anything I wanted. Yeah, but now that I do have kids, you know what I can do anything I want right it took a while to come to that realization, you know to go that like actually um I can Follow my instincts still and I can still you know even This is hard. I mean, I don't know basically I can I can still take risks and I can still and I can actually um, you know, we're all still kind of You know singular people that are struggling with what we want to do and what we want from life and what we You know, and we all do we do can make those decisions and even when you have children and I feel like I'm I feel like I'm wandering out until like a like really thin ice by talking about this because I haven't really figured it out but um I don't know like uh For myself like I made some really huge decisions in my life. Yeah, and I have children Yes, and I have a huge thing that I was the thing that I was taking and I just had this You know, I'm like, I'm gonna be on the run for the rest of my life, you know, no matter what right, you know, so I'm like if I'm gonna be on the run. I still have to think about What I want out of every day and what I want You know, and it's not necessarily determined by my responsibilities. Oh, yeah, there you go. That's the old Maybe I'm getting to it. Maybe I'm getting to the point. I was trying to make no There's this um one of the when you start studying like bhakti yoga and the symbol systems in bhakti yoga can get really confusing because um uh One of the main symbols in bhakti yoga is this being krishna that represents the source of all happiness love beauty Just a combination of all the great things of all the great deities a mixture of like Pan the good parts of jesus thrown in with like You you name it. This is just this wildling mischief is like just pure Romantic being and one of the main symbols is this being Krishna goes out Into this clearing in the forest and plays his flute and all the The milk maids that live in the nearby villages that they leave their Children they leave their um They leave their I can't remember the exact word they leave their candles burning They leave their lives and they go to follow this Being out into the um into the into the forest and and and so the the the this is the this is the sort of symbol for When you catch this weird transcendent Feeling or sound or whatever the thing it is then your life becomes um The or the life that you have solidified or your the ego structure you'd crystallized around or whatever the thing is suddenly becomes Unreal it becomes imaginary and the pursuit of this being or the union with this being becomes everything And so that's when you hear that and religion it goes counter to what we understand with like Religion being this thing that makes you wear a suit and go to work at the insurance firm This is like the mystical approach. It's like no you just get You just get drawn I mean if you look at like not to be completely Narcissistic, but all the stories and religion is supposed to be a reflection of the human experience and if you look at the story of Muhammad and jesus and buddha siddhartha gautama. These are all wanderers that were just like i'm I'm wandering through christ vanished for third. I don't know how many years He just vanished into the nothingness and they say I think they say he had a wife and um Muhammad went off into this cave. You know where he received this transmission and then buddha was just split from his his existence To go off into the force. So anyway, yeah, it's that idea of like shit, man Do I pretend to be happy in this calcified structure or do I? As the ultimate symbol of freedom continue this journey into the right unknown right the unknown And that can mean anything I mean, I guess I mean the unknown could be literally walking into the forest or the unknown can just be A few blocks away from your house. Oh, yeah, sure It's this but it's this it's this like You know, I had this crazy dream um recently where I like turned into I realized that I was a werewolf and somebody was like we can fix you And I I thought no, I don't want I don't want to be fixed even though. I know it's gonna mean I'm gonna eat people and then I went and Was standing in front of this wide expanse of this primordial forest and I felt like the things wolves feel the sense of like That feeling when that feeling goes away from life Then what are you you turn into like a Dried bit of gum at a theme park or something Yeah well Yes I'm sorry. I really like listening to you. It's like I feel like I I don't want to talk. Please. I like listening. I like I like well, you're just you're coming from your words are just so easily Cascading out of you Um, which is amazing and then I I have a hard time like getting that same thing going because I'm I'm trying to explain things that I'm still in the midst of figuring out but I mean, I guess You know for me, I just I hit a point my I just I don't know It's like do I spend the rest of my life this way? Struggling with these things that I'm struggling with that I I openly am struggling with them And I'm and my struggle is actually starting to go over ground. It's starting to come out of my I'm starting to act out As you would say I'm starting to like I'm see seeking connection now Like I I I've got to find some connection outside of what is going on in my life on a daily basis My marriage. Yeah, let's say my marriage so and you know and I mean You know for me, I'm not a person that has a lot of I'm extremely loyal I have a lot of like really close and long lasting friendships with people and um An incredible loyalty to my wife and she was my first love and You know, and then that a couple of years ago everything started to kind of slide for me. Yeah mentally So the facade that I was keeping Which I was perfectly happy keeping. I love facades. You know, I think they're Amazing what you can do with just building them every day and they can be really incredibly positive things and things that inspire other I mean, it's like a facade is not in us. I've never really thought of it. I mean, no, it's a negative connotation to it but I do Think that it's really important to be strong for the people in your life and to always look on another side And that was part of pot for me. Like I was saying that I would just really You know creating just keeping this structure, you know my life and the people around me secure and I don't mean just my children but You know anybody that I'm complete my you know, I have lived a kind of complicated life because it's not it's all You know, it's like what what you do surviving on your wits basically, right? So you're not you don't have this you're not part of a big structure You're really you're just you're in your you are what you make your life with your mind with your art with whatever Yeah, and it's kind of like it's pretty precarious. It's a really precarious way to do it It's it's yeah, it's it's a constant state of feeling of insecurity and a constant sense of Or it can be it can easily go into that or um, yeah uh Yeah What is that awesome line in your song that are that great? There's one of you one of you I can't run the name of it, but one of the lines is uh All my confidence is jump the fence and move the long. You know that line God damn, that's great, man Where you get to this place where you're like, yeah, the confidence just isn't there, you know and talk about facades Now you've got to put on this show Of confidence and um and but with marriages and relationships When you hit that place Where you just you feel like the man in the iron mask and you don't want to be wearing whatever this thing is That you construct it anymore. That is a real curious position to get into because you have to decide between Uh being a martyr or and then who wants to he wants a martyr daddy or mommy There's nothing worse than a martyr mommy, you know when the when the when they I have friends whose parents have directly said to them I gave up My life for you It's like really well. Fuck you. You're a dumb ass. Am I supposed to respect you for that now? Am I supposed to look at you and think oh, what a great example you gave? You mean you gave up the most important thing that you add in this incarnation so that you could give Resentful fucking love to me for my whole life Wonderful Wonderful, I feel great. So I'm essentially a parasite You're telling me the same thing you talk you'd say to a sentient leech or something that was on you like I'm giving my life's blood to keep I'm lucky. My parents never Ever said anything like that to me. And I think the people that do have Experience that with their parents. I think it really hurts them and it really it becomes something that really sticks with them Yeah, you know, so I feel very fortunate that my parents didn't do that to me, you know, yeah, and so It's weak It's not good. It's not good. But but again, so it's like so I would and again, I'm speaking from a place of a I don't have kids so forgive me all of you do have kids and because I know that it's it's out in a way It's kind of out of line because I don't understand the depth of the experience So I'm only looking at from outsider's perspective, but I I would think like Um, you know from a romantic ideal The most important thing in raising a kid is honesty setting an example truthfulness and letting them Have a real experience of the world and because kids It seems like kids and dogs can sniff out bullshit real quick anyway So if you're going around in a kind of false happiness in a marriage In front of your kid where the whole thing is a seething Seething hell and you're pretending it's okay. What is that doing for the kid? They're living an illusion. They're living in this puff of illusion. I don't know what the answer to it is I never I think I I never lived in a seething hell, but I felt it coming and that's why I felt the seething coming and it was I just felt like this tidal wave of negativity that was going to overtake me and was overtaking me and making decisions for me And leading me like into Leading me into really precarious situations with other beauty, you know other beautiful people that I shouldn't be fucking with Right. Do you know what I mean? Like because I mean like But I was doing it out of a place of like sort of desperation and leading into other people's lives and in sort of in like intruding on their lives with your sort of that kind of Energy when they're just looking for love like, you know, I mean, oh, I know what you mean. Oh, yeah I know you mean you mean like people kill you when people come to you and they want to they're there They want to be with you. They're loving but the energy that you're Applying to it isn't the same energy at all. It's like, yeah, it's warning. It's almost like you're wanting to like um, what's the word for uh, um My mom actually said this in one of the podcasts charge and discharge you just want to discharge you Oh, wow, you know, you want to discharge and they want to like Experience intimacy and love with you and you're just like I gotta get rid of this I gotta get rid of this this energy that I'm carrying around Yeah, that's what was going on and I when I realized that that I was You know the You know when I had sort of looked outside my marriage at least, you know, like in a sexual way, I was like Whoa, you know, I'm this is I'm really messing with a lot of energy that I I kind of have no business doing to someone else and I don't You know, and I don't have that and since I go into every relationship that I go into with this totally you know, I'm not a I'm not like I mean, I'm I'm not a like Opportunistic person. I'm not really a user. I'm not really like it's not where I want to be, you know I mean, I want to like I really like You know, I I'd love to nurture and I love like that's what I want my life And that's what I've always worked towards and that's what and this was like the opposite of that Oh, yeah, it was like this is so against my You know, I mean I went into it wide-eyed. It's not like I I was like I need this in my life I need connection. I want this. Yeah, you know, and I want it and I'm gonna get it I'm just gonna do and I can do it. I can wow. Holy shit. I can actually do whatever I want really like wow Yeah, and uh, so I did that and then The implications of that just personally and for you know, the people that I it was just kind of really profound and and and sad and like and Well, because we're dealing with I mean the problem is the conditioning, you know We're dealing with some serious fucked up conditioning as far as sex goes and everybody's head. So and I in like a utopian society where people have been raised in in the right way then you know If somebody came to you and needed to discharge as they say That's you would just love like that's so raw. Yeah, you'd be like, let me help you Let me help you. I see that you're suffering in this way Maybe I can help you and then after I help you and then if nothing comes of that then I you know, I was just a loving gesture that I gave to you no matter what But the way things really work is that it's like because sometimes I thought you know, I think about like How awesome porn would be if instead of just showing the the 30 or 45 minutes of fucking You saw the Five hours proceeding in the five hours after kind of like magnolia or something you see them go off in their different ways and maybe Just see their lives when When there isn't that burst of fucking in it, you know, it's like fucking is um Even if someone does like even if you find a girl and and you just want to have sex with her and and she just wants to Have sex with you there's still this feeling of like It's like shines this light on the plasticity of The physical or something and and that just is It's getting did I ever there's this my um There's this uh saying, uh I heard once talking about materialism or materialists And they use they describe a dog they say that like uh imagine a dog In in a village like in india with no teeth And it just got gums and it finds an old dry bone And it goes to this old dry bone. It's starving and so it starts gumming this old dry bone with its toothless third world dog mouth And so it's like gums start getting cut open by the bone and it begins to drink its own blood But it begins to think that the blood is coming from the bone so it continues to chew on the bone ripping up its mouth And that's that that's like used to compare like trying to get pleasure from the material universe or trying to get like That basic sense gratification from shit is that it's you're just basically ripping yourself up Yeah, it's a good one man, but but but you know, then there's the whole other side of it, which is that you know connection Is it can be a very positive thing and you know, this is like This is the this is where you get into like the if you ever read sex at dawn the book sex at dawn by chris rine you heard of this book It's just a book about how Primates aren't just tend to not be monogamous at all They might they might have a life partner, but they they will cheat on the life partner And and and that's just the the way it is and if you look at indigenous tribes What you will find is that there's this idea monogamy is insanity. They have an idea their idea is that Or one of the ideas is the idea that they don't think one blast of jizz makes a baby They think that a baby comes from the combined Seaman of different tribesmen. Yeah, that's what that's how you get the stronger babies Yes, you get that sperm in there really like battling it out. That's it. That's it And so evolutionarily the idea is that non monogamy is better than monogamy And that what since monogamy is a relatively new thing in the course of our species What inevitably ends up happening in the course of a marriage or a long-term relationship as you hit that place where you're like I just want to I think I want to fuck somebody else and then you start feeling guilty and crazy and then that's like, what's wrong with me What's wrong with me? I can't be everything for you You mean I can't be every single thing for you in the in the universe Like of course not. Yeah Yeah Well, I don't well that made me think that I mean um The reason that I would look outside my marriage is not because I Wanted someone else or was looking I wanted I just wanted sex. I mean, right, right? Simple wanted sex. I wanted that connection and I would have gladly taken it From the known source Oh, right. You know what I'm saying? Yes. I would have glad had it not become so Incredibly complicated. Yeah came like a sort of meaning it was something that like And I just had to say I mean to me like it it's so like sex is so important to me I mean, it's like me too. I mean I have to be it's I mean And I and I'm not saying like I'm and and I was in a 25 year relationship and I it was I would have happily And did happily have sex with one person for a long time and not I did not have the sense of being Sick of the person or like something because I think sex is so Wonderful such a healing thing and and when and when it's a communication. I mean, it's a really incredibly Fulfilling thing. Yeah, I'm like intimacy is incredible, you know, and I don't think it's impossible to find someone that you can Access that kind of intimacy with and then And it could last a long long time, you know, so I'm thinking like that's but for me. I guess 25 years into my 47 years or 46 years into my life 25 years into a marriage. I'm I'm thinking well If that's what I want in my life and it's as important as I know it is Yeah, you know, and I'm not going to deny it anymore, you know, and I'm not going to make myself feel guilty about it anymore I'd already experimented with that You know, so it basically all of my sort of wandering things I mean it just sort of boiled down to that. I just was like I have to just acknowledge straight up I want full-on intimacy with somebody I want and I want to try that again I want to try, you know, it's like I want to try it's like I want to I need that Stability But see but this is where monogamy gets fucked up because in in the game that you end up playing in a long-term relationship like that instead of it being okay great It's like what? No, no, it's there's a no there. I don't know the specifics is what what's happening with you But I know if you go and look up is he Look up is he on google is he Cheating will be the first thing that comes up if you look up is she Next word cheating so all these all these like people are so scared and freaked out of the idea of their partner going off To be with someone else that that's on google. That's the number one. It's not like is he happy That doesn't that's not the first one that comes up It's is he cheating and so that means that there's a Shitload of people who are frightened that their partners are cheating and the reason they're frightened that their partners are cheating is that they We have been programmed or we have been taught that if That for a person to go and have sex with someone else Um is pretty much like the worst thing that can happen in our in our relationship And and I think the it's because if it's done if it's done as a lie You know secretly you're sneaking around I get to understand the betrayal But if there should be built in by now we are evolving as a species there should be built in something an acknowledgement of like there's a What is it 70% divorce rate? I think there's a 70% of 73 Today it ticked up today But you know what I mean? It should be built in like hey, I get it. You want to have sex I don't want to have sex right now. You want to have sex for whatever reason in my life I don't feel like having sex right now. I don't feel right But I love you and I want you to be happy so go and have sex. God that sounds so naive and stupid But I think if that was built in then marriages wouldn't fall apart like they do Yeah, well, maybe in the future that'll be the case, you know Yeah, see that being I could be that some see that like, you know Working maybe a little better a little later once the institution is truly crumbled, you know You know what I mean? That's because the as these institutions crumble like marriage, which is Or they become understood in a different way Marriage becomes a different thing, you know, it doesn't become maybe it doesn't become so much About like this what you're what you're talking about like monogamy. It doesn't become so much about it becomes more about a partnership You know and two people dealing with each other and and dealing with all of the complexities right now It's like very it's still very simplistic the way that it's laid out like you said in the way that we're raised culturally It's very simplistic simple the reality of it is incredibly complicated. Yes It's a partnership that you can enter into with somebody, you know, it's almost like a um You know and there's certainly like There's legal reasons for doing it, you know having children there's monetary reasons for doing it. There's um um Symbolic reasons for doing it. Yep And which will probably I mean that symbolic part will always appeal to people even if that's you know, they have five marriages at least that each one of those marriages meant something to them. Yep meant let me turn my phone off um Well, I mean, you know, you guys should try you know I don't know where it is with with you and her now, but there's a lot of like, you know A lot of people have been I I never personally did this Or like I tried it Well, I tried it after relationship ended. I went and took ecstasy uh To you know to see what happened, but we did it the wrong way, but there's a Huge underground of that I've heard of marriage therapists that using mdma to We're to try to uh return things to get back to that original state of Wow, this is incredible to like get underneath all the calcified bullshit layers that form And I think I could see that being quite successful because they're using it now Uh, they've reopened tests on it. I thought I mean, I've heard it ecstasy used in therapy And it seems like a good idea to me, especially if it was pharmaceutical And because it it is a really I don't know. I I kind of those experiences with those drugs in my youth. I mean, I there were always Amazing Experiences, I mean not always with them, but there's always at least one time where it wasn't terrible, you know, I mean it's sort of Obviously for me Or not obviously but for me that kind of those kind of drugs like it hit a wall for me at some point where it wasn't giving me that You know, but I had a few pivotal like really beautiful Experiences with them. Yeah, I thought I did really make some real progress into understanding myself and understanding the people around me and and uh I mean, maybe becoming a better person, you know, I've always thought those experiences were like, you know, I really I consider them like important things that happen to me like really important experiences and I I don't want my kids to ever do that Ever But you know, you don't you don't want your kids to do them the way you did them the way you did them I mean, I don't know the way you did in the way I did them was going down to this fucking trailer with like animal bones on the walls and buying shitty acid from a guy who had Pornography scattered all over the floor of the place You know what I mean? Well, it's totally random. I had like I had I got some really good acid once And then really bad acid Yeah, really good ecstasy once then really bad ecstasy No, you don't want your kids to do like that But I you know, I had a I just had this guest on and he was talking about how when he was a kid teenager His uh his family like I guess they're super hippies, but they were like, okay, we're you know, you're about to become a man So you should go and take mushrooms in Mexico with a shaman and they flew him out to Mexico to be with a shaman To ritualistically take mushrooms to become an adult That is a I would be totally fine with again. I don't have a kid But with my imaginary future kid, I'd be totally fine with that But as far as my kid going and like again In the same way that like the thing that I think maybe is the most upsetting about someone cheating on you Uh, if you can overcome your ego enough to understand that there's no fucking way You're gonna be 100% yeah the ultimate thing a person needs for their entire life Then probably the thing that hurts the most is that they lied to you if they went out behind your back There was dishonesty there and with your kid when the kid when you've created the situation where the kid is Off sneaking around getting high and you know getting fucked up and now you're instead of being the kid's parents You're like some kind of police state Entity well, then I think that's where the real fucking damage can come and Again in our future version of society where there's some clause and marriage contracts where you can go and Fuck someone else from time to time if you need to there should be like some Ritualistic use of psychedelics with our kids. God. I sound like a fucking Colt leader, but I think that that's a um, that should be built in man And I think maybe with maybe you and your um, maybe you could still You could you could like, you know, I don't know. I've just heard that like if you take MDMA In a troubled relationship and take it in the right way and take it with A therapist or someone who can like walk you through. I feel like the thing is in my particular relationship We went through that we did take And on top of that there was rampant infidelity like I'm not on my part initially, but like I mean We'd been through that a lot. I mean that was an acknowledged part of I mean where I had I had been through like Incredible betrayals, you know, like where I was just like where I where things had happened to me like my you know I get an entire circumstance to me moving to Los Angeles was I mean like I mean, there's I've I've had like these really intense Um Betrayals, you know, and where I was and I was never I was never one I was not the betrayer most or at all pretty much That wasn't my because I wasn't really my thing because I'm kind of I'm a real fucking loyalist monogamous. I can't help it I mean, I'm just like that's kind of my thing um I so I had been through like some like fucked like totally crazy Could have lost my mind anyone else would have fucking ran away, you know I'm saying yes fucking stayed and I fucking held on and I held on I held on Of course, there was Of course anger that came along with that holding on to that, you know that I had to acknowledge and that's what I've had to acknowledge Now it's like as this as I entered this there was a whole there was a whole new like phase of like Um Disenchantment and of disillusion and like drifting apart that had come again It was to me so to me it was like the third wave. Yeah, do you know what I'm saying? It was like the third wave of this incredible like a test to this relationship and it just And when it hit and what would whatever and how the whole circumstance was unfolding and the complexities of it and all the little Things that were happening happening between my wife and I personally What it was hitting me was this Years of like yeah me going me going I'm gonna you know, I'm gonna change this I'm gonna do that and that's like, you know part of like talking about pot and wondering whether it was positive or negative Because I used pot to like I could I could talk myself Out of anything that I was feeling you know saying like I could take anything that I was like Wow god, you know like oh So I mean I I could just go through and actually figure out a way To like move beyond it to like, you know I mean and also to employ like empathy and understanding with the person that I was going through like yeah well this happened because of this and She has this going on and also this and why wouldn't she and I'm you know, and honestly am I really the No, you know, just so by the end I'm just like I'm I figured out a way Back in you know, yep, you know, I got it. No, that's fucked. I'm glad you got out of that Well, yes, I mean lots. I'm just trying to explain it's like that. I mean like yeah Yeah, I could take ecstasy with my ex-wife I'm sure we could fucking have a good cuddle No, I I think that um, I think that um you at some point You definitely have to put that dog to sleep man At some point, you know, if the dog's suffering if the dog's sick and no matter how much, you know Pleasure or how much whatever happened events sometimes you do have to bring you have to take the dog to the vet I felt I was I took a kind of an assassin roll. I don't know you squeeze the trigger I did sometimes you got to pull the trigger man, but sometimes but sometimes they're holding the gun You know, sometimes it's like when you it's like sometimes they're at their face. Yeah Yeah, they just can't do it. They're like just please please like in your hands like what are you doing with this? No, man, that's that is I've been there and I've I've been in in in in the situation where I realized like Oh, this person wants this relationship to end But they're not gonna end it for me. It was because they I I was thinking oh, they feel sorry for me Or they think that like it's they they worry that they're taking care of me and they're worried that They don't know what'll happen to me and I'll end up who knows man panhandling in Miami or something. So Yeah, so then when you see that you've just got to be like, oh, let's fight Let's I'll press the self-destruct button symbolically, but this thing's self-destructing no matter what so I know that place man That's that's um, that's really tough. I'm sorry That's fine. I mean That's fine. I mean it's fine Oh, yeah It's good. It's like you know, I mean Having kids through something like that and In making that kind of a decision with children involved as well Yeah, it's like best thing for him. I don't know. I mean, that's hard. It's best thing for him. I'm so glad my parents got divorced Oh god, I'm so glad if they had stayed together. What a mess too I would so so much rather my parents have a shot at authentic happiness then be miserable for 20 years out of some kind of stupid sentimentality. Fuck that. I'm so happy my parents got divorced. I'm so happy that that I didn't have a What people call a stable childhood. I had a stable childhood It just wasn't stable in the sense that I was in a house where two miserable people Had decided to co-habitate until I went to college completely neurotic and insane because I've been absorbing All the shit vibes from their crap marriage into my life until I became some Just sniveling guilt-ridden being that's what you give to your kids if you don't fucking cut the you have to absorb your vibes Yes, if you can't exactly what they do they absorb them. I mean, it's it's a cliche about children They just soak it all up. But I think I I've I'm witnessing it and happy, you know, I'm witnessing these little personalities take shape and Yeah Yeah, I that was another thing as I felt really Very strongly that I had to create an alternate reality for them I felt really really strongly about it. I mean to the point. I mean you mean alternate reality How do you mean? I mean I want them to have a place where they come and they're with me and they're experiencing my life with me And I'm experiencing them in a way that like makes sense to me Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, and I mean for me that would be just For me that's like we're going to Griffith Park and we're going to walk into the woods We're going to like just stuff where I like I really you know, I would I had really struggled in my life to to um Give my children something that I Give my children experiences that I had myself my and and also But because I travel so much I'm so You know disconnected from them so many times like the times with them are so incredibly important to me and when I felt very strongly that I was not Giving them the experience with me that that I wanted and also what and I mean That I actually it was it was a selfish decision I suppose I wanted to like you know, I was not able to do that and in the way that it was going and I really wasn't So frustrated like I was not able to give them that like you know, I You know, it's just a it became a real And that was another big part of my like the change in my life was like I like I have to create I have to create this alternate and I say alternate reality, but I mean I don't mean like Not reality. I'm saying it just another place where they when they come to me They could be different. They're you know, they're going to be responding to me in this I'm like in a in a pure way with me and I'm going to be experiencing them and they're going to experience me in a way that's not dictated by You know My partner at the time and and what she was going through personally, you know, I mean which I Is another that's another complex part of it. You know, it's like you also want someone else to experience life and You want I want I want to change people that I'm with and I want those people to change and I want to change and like If I come to a point where I feel like I can't make I can't change you. I can't save you. I can't this I can't that I mean, it's that's also a total cliche, but You know and at the same time believing in somebody and knowing they could do that, but then Maybe I'm the problem here. You know, maybe I'm you know, it's like Well, just because you've shifted geographically from the person doesn't mean that that thing that you want to have happen Is it going to still happen? It just might not happen in the way that you You know and pictured it happening, right? I that's kind of the other way that I looked at it I was like, well, if I I'm going into this huge change. I'm pushing all of these people kicking and screaming, you know over a cliff right now Children my you know my ex-wife Everything I'm like, I'm saying I'm putting it all at risk, you know, but I'm doing it at the same time. I'm I'm I am also convinced that that's somehow the shape that that's all gonna take later and it could be it'll be years before we know what it is That it's gonna be Better. Yeah, I agree. I agree with that. I agree with that and and and it's the old cake Sometimes you got to kick down the ants nest and you know, they're gonna build the ants are gonna I saw this in some documentary about an artist and he was talking about reinventing yourself as an artist And he's saying sometimes you got to kick the ants nest over and just trust that they're gonna build That thing's gonna form again into some More perfect Pattern than before and the reason it's gonna form a no more perfect pattern than before because the intention When you kicked the thing down was it was a loving kick. It wasn't you're like fuck this. I want to destroy and hurt it's like I We the the you know, it's the old thing where somebody Tries to put their arm in the cast in the wrong way and they got to re break it so that it'll grow back the right way That break hurts. That's one of the worst things ever when I hear about that Someone has to go to the doctor and he's got to like professionally break their arm God that's a terrible trip to the doctor, man But but you got to do that or you're gonna have this old bent warped Shit arm for the rest of your life and and so that's why it's good and Another thing man when I one thing I loved Was going to visit my dad After that because when the divorce happened My mom was suddenly happy My dad was suddenly happy instead of these two being together And me actually pretty much blocking the whole goddamn thing out because that's what kids end up doing when they're around that shitty You think they're just absorbing it. You know what they're really doing. They're trying to forget it They're trying to forget. They're trying to forget. They're not even getting a goddamn childhood They're just getting this numbed out thing where they're trying to ignore everything They're being taught to ignore and look away and so it's usually numb it out I started remembering my childhood again once my parents got divorced because suddenly I'm with my dad He's happy. There's a pool beer porn It's this whole like it's this whole like other side of things that was this relief. How old were you in that? I was um 27 I Was I was like 10 You know 10 10 to I think 10 10 and up and and I remember going to see him Was always a blast and like my mom gave me this kind of formal Sort of structured thing and my dad gave me this wild hunter s. Thompson thing with big bags of fireworks and burning down fields and guns and you know what I mean It was like these two polarities and it was and I feel like it helped me become who I am and I like who I am So I'm glad that it happened. You're dynamic. Yeah, it gives you guys gives you a dynamic man And that's why I that's how when people say oh I I I didn't have a stable childhood because my parents were just fuck off You had a stable childhood You know people who don't have stable childhoods people in Haiti after a massive earthquake or people were the tsunami wiped away things or people in Africa who like Have to get raped every night that they go to the well or whatever. That's not stable Yep, it's just the stability you're getting is not the traditional stability and the traditional stability By the way, look it did a lot of good. I mean look at like how neurotic and freaked out these Most honkeys are who came up in that situation people problems. That's what um, do you Do you find that this is um, we uh Got a little do you have a little bit of time? Yeah, um, do you find that uh that you're This is Change your creativity or your creative output or has had an impact on songwriting or creating music Uh, well, I was it a huge I was kind of about had a huge I was working. I had a bunch of songs that I was working on tons of like melodies Which are really easy for me to come up with you know, just like Sitting down and playing something and coming up with something that I would sing But then it's all comes down to what I'm going to sing and I'm always Probably too precious about what I sing or what I write And hopefully I'm hoping Whatever period that I'm going to go off on I can start to really Get down to start to deconstruct the way I put together Songs again in the way I put together words, but I was at a huge impasse because I had a lot to say Very intense shit to say about What was happening to me and what was going on starting, you know two years ago. Yeah And I knew That I couldn't say it, you know So when I made this change in my life, I was just like Bam, you know, here we go. Here's lyrics to like 14 songs. There they are Wow, it's there. I mean, I'm I'm opening up. It's like I'm opening up. I'm going back to this really basic I mean because the you know as a songwriter or whatever the songs that people like that I've written or what I the songs I like I'm just laying it out. It's not real like super poetic. I mean I mean, I'm not I I didn't It's pretty I'm speaking a very plain way in my songs. So yeah, can I say as a as a as a Forget not to be a total dork as a hardcore Lou Barlow fan, which is I've listened to your music pretty much since I was in Just forever. It's a hugely important to me. Uh, it's It has this quality of honesty to it that's unlike anything that I know that there I can only think of maybe a couple other things that have that level of honesty and you still and even That seems to just be what you are. Just like a completely honest person So so to think that you are in a situation where that couldn't come out where you couldn't Exercise what to me seems to be the nucleus of What your music is I could that sounds disastrous. It was Yeah, it was hard, you know, so when I let that when I When I Took the risk when I changed my life, you know, and when I actually when I fell in love fell in love with someone else So And and how's that going? It's going really well. It's beautiful I'm in love right now too. It's the greatest fucking thing ever You know, I mean I just I I'm so happy that I didn't Wait to experience that or I think that I would I really thought I would never really experience anything quite like that again So, I know every time you think you'll never experience it again That's one of the satanic tricks is like that comes that that's one of the whispers of the devil Right if that's like lucifer right near you will never feel love again. You'll never feel well I it's not that exactly. I think it's but I think it's on a I think it's because it's actually the real I mean, this would be I mean, this is my second relationship really so in my life and I'm 46 years old so I don't know. I mean, there's a there's a there's just a level of communication that that I did not know about but I not know no, there's a level of Uh Just like the thing like just brain the way brain two brains work just seem to work a little There's just there's a way that the brains work together. That's really You know a huge Relief for me You know, it's like I got it's hard to that Just working together with this other brain and then other person with You know the way that she talks to people the way she talks to me the way she holds me the way that I mean It's like and it's so in between us. It's a very Instinctual thing and something that we share That we just happen, you know, we we happen to share a lot of the similar just what we want Are the kind of things that we need from each other in terms of just intimacy and honesty and And it's it's been, you know, that's been Breathtaking and and it's worth it. And it's just like it's worth it just To experience what we've what I've been through in the eight months was absolutely worth It's a terrible. I mean terrible terribly worth it. Yeah It's worth considering all the the incredible just the massive amount of um Just crazy stuff that happens once you really just You know once you like just pull out that support and watch the thing watch everything start crumbling. Yeah, it starts happening It's really incredible That that thing you're talking about see that's a metaphysical principle that I've noticed and my I was thinking about this my neighbor um came over and I had gone out of town and The person was supposed to water my plants didn't come and water my plants and so one of them had withered and um There was like maybe four or five living sprigs coming off the plant and then the rest was just dead And she explained to me she's like well, you see you got to break the dead sprigs off the plant because the energy is going into The dead sprigs as much as it's going into the live sprigs. And so the moment you we got the dead sprigs off this plant It just came right back, you know It came right back and and and and that that implosion thing you're talking about in a relationship It's like if you think this shitty relationship I've just noticed that whenever I've gotten out of a relationship. There was a dead sprig and cut that thing off It's not just like suddenly that part of my life got better It's like every part of my life started glowing again because all that energy that was going into the The death or into the emptiness or into the withered arms suddenly flows back out into the all the other parts of your life. Yeah That's true. Yeah I'm glad to hear the lube barlow is in love I am too. I love it man. It's the greatest thing ever and it's I mean not just sound like a drooling Uh hemp vendor burning man, but that is the most it's the most important thing there is and it's the to me I think it's the only it may be it's the only thing there is and everything else is just nothing. It's just I know Bloody dog gums Yeah Yeah, I can Hey, where so you got look where this is it's uh been about an hour where where um Where you boy, what's your website?

The Titan himself, Aubrey Marcus, drove all the way from Venice to come do a podcast with me. The DTFH, and I got to tell you, somebody who comes from the west side to the east side in the middle of the day to hang out with me, I consider that person an eternal friend who I would die for. But regardless of whether or not he took that dark transit from the west side to the east side of Los Angeles to be on my podcast, I'd die for Aubrey anyway, because he is an amazing human, and he's one of the, he's like psychic air freshener. You know, like he comes into your house and if there's any kind of darkness or stinking, malefic, sulfuric mist hanging around from your own selfish habituations, then he kind of like, for a little while, he like banishes it. And that's my favorite kind of guest. So we're gonna jump right into this episode with Aubrey, but first, some quick business. My friends, I'm about to give you the name of a domain name that I've found that somehow has not been purchased yet.

It's the dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle, dunkitrustle. Aubrey Marcus, welcome back to the DTFH. Dunkin' my brother. It's been too long, man. It has. It's been so long in fact that like so much has happened to you, including something today that's pretty wild to hear from you. Because you're like one of the most vocal, polyamorous sex people out there. And it's nice, you have like a liberating take on sex. I think it's inspired a lot of people, probably helped a lot of people get past some of their hang-ups. But today on Instagram, I read. You know what it reminds me of? I had an interesting encounter with like a drug dealer. I met him to buy some drugs. And he looked really great. Like he seemed like even exercising or something. Like, man, you look really great, what's going on? And he's like, ah, stop doing drugs. It was like one of the most like absurd moments. We're like, oh really? So that's making you feel better, huh? All right, I'll take my drugs now. Anyway, anyway, your Instagram post is no more sex. Indefinitely, celibacy is, you're going celibate. What happened? What's up? A lot of things have contributed to that. And yes, I have been very vocal about the open relationship of also very vocal about the repeated just kicks to the gut and the nuts and the pain and the struggle and the growth that comes from that. Cause the pressure creates the adaptation. But all of those moments of seeing somebody you love dearly and the natural attachments and possessions and what needs for validation that you get from that person and watching them fall in love or sleep with somebody else and going through that and catalyzing all of that. I've shared, you know, really the ups and downs of this journey, but I do believe in a liberated, non-possessive sexuality. Yeah, sure. You know, that is something that I definitely believe. But I also know that I've tracked in my own life and it goes back to this moment. I can remember this moment. I'm 21, I'm at the MGM Grand and they had a show called La Femme, which is based on the crazy horse burlesque show in Paris, which is like one of the best burlesque shows. Beautiful girls, they're all like the same body type and it happens to be the exact body type that was like my ultimate fantasy as a 21 year old. And I'm sipping whiskey there by myself at this show and I'm looking at these girls and I go, I am going to do whatever the fuck it takes to be the type of guy that one of these women would want to date, like truly. And that meant every category. That meant physically, that meant mentally, that meant, you know, conversationally, that meant financially, that meant in connect, you know, with the connections. I had everything that I had and that's been like a driving force in my life. Wait, was this prior to you getting like in super good shape and becoming like? I was in fine, I was always in fine shape because I was a basketball player, but I was also like, I was also, didn't really have a real guide star at that point. So that one, so then I kind of adopted that Serena, there's a line from Serena, it was like when troubled with all of the myriad paths that I could take, I decided to be admirable at everything. Okay, that's cool. And so I was like, fuck it, I'm just going to be as great as I can possibly be. And I think that contributed to honor this total human optimization idea, my own spiritual growth, but always writing, you know, and there's other purposes I have. Obviously I love sharing everything that I learned and I love doing all of podcasts and everything that I have, which don't have a lot to do with this desire to be attractive, but with it has always been this motivation to get laid and like my whole life. And it's now gotten to the point where I've reached a level where I can comfortably say that I've found abundance in that category. I bet. And it's been beautiful and I'm very, very fucking blessed, you know, like, but, and I think like the Buddha who was able to leave his palace walls because he'd had the feasts and he had the sex and he had all the things and he was like, I'm not happy. I can leave the palace walls and give all that up. If I hadn't been able to reach like a level of abundance, I don't think I would have been able to go say, okay, now I'm ready to release it and see what else is there. Right. Well, yeah, this theme of leaving the palace is one of my, I love that in Buddhism that it's starts and whereas like Christianity starts in a manger, you could probably say, I don't know. I don't know too much about Islam, but it does start in a cave. Like these two religions start in kind of what, not what you would consider to be a glamorous environment. Buddhism starts in the palace and ends in the forest or I guess you could say begins in the forest. That's when he gains his awakening, but that the deeper level of that to me is like, what's your palace? What palace are you living in? And it's, and at some point, a palace is wonderful, but at some point, and I think this happened with the Buddha, you realize, oh shit, this is kind of a prison that looks like a palace because he had to sneak out. He didn't just make it out. He had to actually be a little tricky to get out of that place. So this so does, isn't that a great model for any addiction or anything? It is, and I think also the path to get to your palace. Like I wonder if people who haven't achieved that thing that they really want, like if I would have never been able, let's say I just wouldn't have had the courage or discipline or drive or motivation to actually be the guy that I pledged that I could be when I was sipping that whiskey. If I never was able to make it to the place where I was that guy, I don't know if I would have been ever able to leave the palace. I don't know if I would have ever been able to transcend that need. I mean, I'm not giving it up forever. I'm just not like there's a permanent lifestyle change, but even right now, if I hadn't reached a certain level of abundance, I wouldn't have been able to give it up. And I think that's the same with money, and I think that's the same with sex, and I think that's the same with success. Like until you actually kind of get the thing that you think will make you happy, the thing you think will bring you to heaven, and realize it doesn't, it's something much deeper and different than actually does, then you can't let it go. Well, yeah, man, I mean, unless you, I think like if you have some great incarnation, you're very wise, very, very wise, then when you hear from someone, or multiple people, the classic statement, which is I'm telling you, that is not gonna make you happy, then you can hear that and be like, oh, okay. Then I'm not gonna try to achieve that thing. Do you think so though? Cause I've never met that dude, or that girl, or that woman, or that man. It's rare. It's a rare thing. It's a rare thing to, most of us, most of us are like, shut the fuck up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No way. Easy for you to say. Easy for you to say, you've got it all. Yeah. And so then you go for it, and that's a beautiful journey. It's a beautiful thing, and you try to achieve it, and then you get it, and then that's amazing. You think for a second, oh fuck, that guy was wrong. This is wonderful. Totally, totally, this is it. Yeah. But we fucking did it. And then, but it doesn't last. It doesn't last. You start getting this repeating message, that repeating signal of like, oh no, this is more of a sand trap than a destination. Very moist, lubricated sand trap. And also, and especially with sex, here we have a sand trap with a soul. Here we have a sand trap with an identity, a sand trap that's in a human. It ain't a sand trap, and these are people, and these are people who feel and love. And then somewhere in there, that's where all of it begins to like show itself in a certain way, which is like, oh, if you're gonna engage in this practice, which is a real path for a lot of people. No doubt. Then you have to really, really stop any form of dehumanization. That's also the fuck, that's also the thing. I was just talking to, actually oddly enough, Whitney's brother, who I was talking to about this for a while, and you grow up and you get used to this kind of, you watch porn, and you jerk off, and you have sex, and sex is, you pleasure the other person, but you pleasure them in a way that the pleasure itself is the goal. It's not the union that Tantra talks about, right? The union of physicality and spirit at the same time. It's more like the mutuality of pleasure that sometimes touches something that feels divine, and sometimes touches, usually, a lot of times, touches flow state, which is the, at least, removal of the stress of your mind and body, and there is some connection. So don't get me wrong, there's beautiful aspects, but they're also very mechanical, pleasure-driven, druggy aspects to having sex. And for me, those mechanical, pleasure-driven, druggy aspects, even the validation of pleasing somebody else, that's actually one of my favorite parts, is the mechanical process of pleasing somebody else with whatever, mouth, tongue, dick, whatever I'm doing, right? Like that thing, it's not union. It's like, I can make you feel this pleasure, and that makes me feel good about myself. And I need a hard reset on that shit. So that's why there's no porn, no masturbation, none of that for me. I gotta fucking take a hard reset, because I do believe that sex is, potentially, a path to union with source. But I'm not, I can't do it. I gotta, not right now, I gotta hard reset, and then explore, and see if I'm called to that, maybe. Right. Well, I mean, you know, someone told me, Lauren Michaels on SNL said, go ahead and do drugs, but don't do the same drug all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, keep a rotation going, because if you do the same drug all the time, that's when you really do hurt yourself, and sex in particular. I think, you know, the good thing about, you know, drugs as we understand them, any drug, any drug that involves eating something, is that, you know, you're taking a drug, and a lot of people don't understand that, like, you don't have to put something in your mouth to, you don't have to absorb something into your digestive system for it to be a drug. And so people get confused, and think they're not doing drugs when they're doing hardcore fucking drugs, from the internet to sex. All these endogenous chemical cocktails that get released. I mean, those moments when you're in some kind of deep, rich power exchange sexuality, and like every part of you is lit up, and they're in transient hypofrontality, and you're in flow state, and there's pleasure and sex, and all the endorphins being released, you're in that thing. Like, you're high as fuck. High. And it required no external drugs, no exogenous chemicals at all, but you're high as fuck. And that can be addictive, but at what price? What price are you willing to pay for that? And you're getting, you're getting all sorts, like the pharmacy in your brain is always gonna dispense the purest shit, man. It's gonna be like the high grade stuff, as good as it can get. Anything else is an imitation of that incredible, whatever that pharmacist is doing in there, when you come in with a prescription, oh, an orgasm, you ordered an orgasm, oh, you ordered an orgy, the experience of an orgy. Here, here you are, and you take that wonderful, wonderful drug, and you experience that transcendence. It is so powerful because it's not, you know, it's not as though you're just getting off. It's literally like in those moments of intense pleasure. For a second, a window flies open, and you look out at a landscape, and you remember something, and you're home for a second. Yes. Oh, home, oh yeah, this place. You know, when you're like, when I've had the height of psychedelic sex, I'm not even me anymore. I'm like a river, or someone going down a river and getting bowls of water, or some drums in the forest, or wind blowing through a forest, or meadow, a meadow, and the breeze rolling through it. I'm not even me. I'm just suddenly some other thing that is like the sex has been a bridge to that point. All your anxiety leaves, and all your stress leaves, and everything goes away, and so it's not only that experience, but it's the release of everything else that you've experienced, which I've relied on that nightly. Oh, I've had a stressful day. I'm a little anxious. I got this thing. Let me find my outlet. It's gonna allow me to escape back to that meadow. And of course, yeah, if you smoke a little weed or do something else, it can actually enhance that experience. So then there's that meadow. There's that release of all that experience. But then, like you said, that moment of orgasm. Like, have you done 5MEO DMT? Oh yeah, a long time ago. But not like you did it. So that experience of union, where it feels like you're in the unicity, where there's just one note, and there's not the dichotomy. There's not polarity. It's just one note of source going, oh, and that's for me what taking 5MEO is like. It lasts for me five minutes. But orgasm gives you that, because the pleasure is turned up so high. That knob is just at the maximum crank where you don't hear a sound. You don't see a thing. You don't remember anything. It's just the one note. And the only thing that mimics the one note is the unicity of all things, of source itself. So you get to taste it, or at least taste an approximation of it at that moment. There, so yeah, this thing you're talking about, there's so, in Buddhism, I know there's different, it's called the gap, is what they call it, the gap. So, or that's one of the words for it. So like, for example, when you sneeze, interestingly enough, it's similar in the micro, because when you sneeze, you're just, like in that moment, you're just fully in the sneeze. That's exactly right. The sneezes uses an example of an orgasmic state, but like much faster with a lot less of an interesting buildup to get to that state. Usually it catches you by surprise, but still the sneeze is one of those moments. And there's a few other moments, like apparently if you start following your breath, you'll notice there's a space between breaths. There's that when you fully outflow, and right before the inflow, there's a gap there. And then also in between thoughts, sometimes you just will catch yourself not thinking. So that's the gap. And what you're talking about is a way to get into that spot, which is in between the frames of your existence or something. It's the space in between the framing of reality. And that place is way, way, way less intense and heavy and filled with all the drama of this particular movie that we identify with, that we call our lives, right? And so yeah, it's a place. Man, you know, for me, like I was listening to Alex, no, I was reading, yeah, I was reading that book on Everest, man, that they made a movie out of. You know, End of Thin Air, Crack Out. This guy, he's talking about how the only place he can escape his thoughts is by climbing mountains. Like the free solo guy, right? Like people are searching for their different ways to escape ourselves, which is what's really interesting. I think for me, building the other, because I have other techniques, I have other tools, I have so many tools, but I don't use them because I got a crutch, I got a reliable crutch that will take me every single night, you know, whether it's by myself or whether I'm with a partner, it's a crutch that will take me out of ordinary life for 30 minutes, right? And so there's that thing that I wanna, I wanna develop the other tools. I wanna do a meditation every night. I mean, I meditate some nights or I wanna do some other practice, go out in nature, you know, like go out by my trees underneath the lights or sit by the fire and like find some other ways, do some pranayama, like figure out some other tools to get me to that equanimity, you know, in like a different way. And I'm hoping this like forces me to use the tools that I have at my disposal, but I'm too fucking lazy and too like addicted to this other way to really use them, you know, and to the capacity that they could be used. I feel guilty telling you this technique just because it's like, I'm sorry. But you know, there is the other version of it which is called adding wood to the fire. Have you ever heard of that? No. Well, it's similar to the thing where your dad catches you smoking and it's like, all right, let's smoke. A whole pack. A whole pack right now, except it would be that with fucking. And you think I have it? Well, no, because I guess the idea with adding wood to the fire is that, and this is, by the way, everybody, this is controversial. And to me, the number one thing is don't kill yourself. Don't use as an excuse to go do a shit ton of drugs. If you're all fucked up or to drink too much or anything, you've got to be smart. You can't just like, you have to be smart. Now, all of these are just tools to get to the same place anyway. So this idea is, yeah, no, if you had actually added enough wood to the fire, the fire burns out. Well, that's, and that's also what happened. And it wasn't even that it was like this crazy, a lot of people think I've had a bunch of orgies and crazy stuff like that. I do. I think that, I think you have orgies all the time. I think you're constantly having sex all the time. I mean, I have a rich sex life, but it's typically just, you know, the same, I've been with six people over the last, you know, six years. Oh, really? Wait, what? And that's, and a lot of people don't realize that. Like that's, that's it. And occasionally some of those people have been at the same time and occasionally there's been some things like that that have happened, but it's really a lot less than people think. But what I have done is I have created these like sexually charged party environments, which the partners that I've been with really like, right? It's like a, it's an environment where they're going to be dancing and twerking and it's going to be this kind of sexual thing. And I usually just end up hooking up with whoever my main partner is at that place, but so much energy is wrapped into the, into the process of creating the environments that are interesting to them. And also interesting to me because then I get to hang with them in the place that they're interested. What do you mean environments, like dungeons? No, like a, like just like a house, like a house party with music that goes late. You know, it's like, so, and this was, we had, we had one of these on Thursday for Halloween. We go to the Halloween party, we have the after party. And then the after party, there's the outfit change and everybody's dancing around. And then finally at like five in the morning, I've drank so many fucking hard come butchers that my head is just spinning. I'm like, I'm done. I got to go like, can you, you know, you want to go up and like, can we have sex and I can go to bed? But I think part of, I enjoy, I have enjoyed partying, but in that way, but I don't really anymore. I would have rather called that night at, you know, one o'clock and just gone up and had sex and cuddled and felt rested the next day. You know, and that's, that's also the energy that I want to cut out is these, because it really isn't about the, the orgy type of thing, but it's about the, the party environment that like creates the possibility of that orgy maybe, but also creates the environment that my partners like. Man, addictions wild, isn't it? Cause like you look at the, like every addiction has an associated ritual and you know, like whatever it may be, man. Like there was a point when I was doing ketamine all the time. I was addicted, man. I was truly addicted. I haven't done it in a long time now, but I did have to like, it was like too much and it was bad. No, nothing was happening anymore for it. There was a time when I was getting like real downloads from the universe and there was like an authentic, like I guess you could say healing that was coming from it, but then it just got to be, I wasn't even feeling it anymore and yet somehow I was still doing it, but I, you know, became addicted to the ritual. I became addicted to the whole process from beginning to end. It wasn't just the psychedelic state. Oh, this is what's so fucked about addiction is it's like, when you're a smoker, it's not that you're just addicted to the nicotine. You're addicted to the guilt after you smoke. You're addicted to the going to the gro, to the store and feeling that shitty feeling of like, I can't stop. You're addicted to the whole goddamn cycle. You're even addicted to fake quitting and starting again. The whole thing becomes like, it's not just the nucleus of the addiction, whatever the substance or activity is, it's just cool to watch the whole cycle of addiction as it unfolds. That's really fucking wise actually, man, because there's so many other things that are wrapped into it, like the mirror glance, you know, that look at yourself, like how do I look right now? You know, how do I appear or like the buying this shirt? Does this look, oh, I could wear this thing? How do these shoes look? Or how does this thing look? You know, and the type of workouts that I do, which I mean, I work out frequently, but am I always working out in the way that is best for my body or am I working out in the way that would look the best to these potential partners? Like you start pulling on this string and I just wonder, I just wonder how deep it goes, like how, when I pull this string out, like how far into my life, maybe I'm gonna be doing a lot more yoga and a lot less kettlebells. I don't know, maybe I'm not, but we'll find out because this one piece is gonna be removed so everything I'm doing now is gonna be for me, for my friends, for, you know, the greater good. This is the, like sex is the most selfish thing that I do. It's not selfish with my partner, I'm very giving to my partner, but it's the thing that I don't, it doesn't help the world in any way. You know what I mean? It's not like I'm doing something for the benefit of my company or my friends or the greater good. This is like for me and my partner too, but like, it's what happens when I pull that out and then I realize like, what is gonna give me the greatest satisfaction? The holidays are coming and if you wanna give somebody something that's gonna transform their lives, don't buy them a copy of the Celestine prophecies. Don't give them a shake weight or whatever you're gonna give them. If you really wanna change somebody's life in the most obvious yet subtle way, get them a ton of Bomba's socks. Like, you can't just, for the holidays, you can't just buy someone a pair of socks. I mean, you can, it's nice, but if you give somebody a ridiculous amount of socks, enough so that they could dump their sock drawer out and replace it with all new socks, then they're gonna think about you every single day of the week, every time they pull socks on and feel the sweet, soft glory of Bomba's socks. These are amazing socks, I'm a sock snob. I love brand new socks and I love Bomba socks. They're built with extra cushioning, so no matter whether you're walking the dog, whether you're home, whatever you're doing, you're gonna be comfortable. They're also made with the softest cotton in the world level soft. So this is like, this is the softness, like imagine like if, I don't know what the like, genitals of angelic beings are like, but like imagine like if angels, if you could touch an angel's taint, that soft place. That's what a Bomba sock feels like. It's like you've put your whole foot against the taint of an angel. Can I, sorry Bombas if I can't say that, but I mean that in the best way possible. I'm wearing, I'm literally wearing them right now. I took my shoe off to look and I'm wearing Bomba's socks. I love them. They're fantastic, but not just because they feel great. Bomba's gives a pair of socks to homeless shelters for every pair of socks they sell. And socks are one of the most requested items in homeless shelters. So if you give the gift of Bomba's socks to one of your friends, you're also giving a bunch of socks to people in homeless shelters, which is awesome. And they even have a line of merino wool socks.

You know, I heard this cool thing from, I think Vlodriano Buddhism about drinking beer or whatever. And the idea is you drink. Until you're not aware that you're taking sips of the beer and then stop. The moment you're no longer tasting the beer, the moment you're no longer aware of swallowing the beer, then stop, stop. And you know, it's interesting that as a, because I like it in the sense that it's not making anything taboo. It's just asking more than anything for you to acknowledge the moment that your awareness goes bye-bye. Yeah, when you become unconscious. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and this is the problem with a lot of these things is like you just become, you're no longer doing it with any kind of awareness. There's no, you might as well not be there. You're just like your heart. You're just like some autonomous, or rather, what would you say? Autonomous isn't the right word. It's like a subconscious, you know. Well, you become an automaton. An automaton, that's what I was looking for. Yeah, and then what is that? That's where now you're, it's sad because it goes from being like, you know, cargo cults, the South Pacific cargo cults. I love talking about them, you know, those cargo, in the South Pacific, apparently, they dropped these military chests that had all this shit in them for the troops and it landed on uncontacted islands. And so these uncontacted islands started doing rituals, repeating what they were doing on the day that the cargo fell out of the sky. Oh, it wouldn't happen again. Yeah, and so that's chasing the dragon. And, you know, with whatever the thing is, it goes from being this truly joyous, pagan, glorious opening to the universe to turning into like a boring ass church service where you're like, here we go again, I'm doing it again, I don't know. But you, in the same way at church services, people might pretend that they're feeling the joy and they're there in the spirit of the divine, but actually they don't really feel it anymore. It's just a husk, you know, the thing is no longer alive. It's like, it's not gravy anymore. It's like that crusted shit that's like used to be gravy, but now it's all gelatinous and cold and crusted, but you're pretending it's still delicious, Thanksgiving gravy. That to me is when I think my gears start grinding when it comes to anything I'm hooked on. Yeah, keeping that awareness riding with you, so you're always, you always know what you're doing. And then you start listening to the great spiritual masters like Ram Dass, who says the soul loves everything, not every being, but everything. And then you start going like, all right, our purpose is to live in soul land, another term that he uses, right? Living in soul land where you see everything and you love everything and you're in that place. Like the challenge is, is this, you ask the question, is this thing getting me closer to that or farther from that? And that's an interesting question because I definitely want to get there. And I want to get to that place where I'm loving people who might be a sexual partner or not a sexual partner the same way. I'm loving an evening that might result in sex or not result in sex the same way. I'm loving the parts of a person's body that give me sexual pleasure or don't give me sexual, but loving them the same way. Can I massage someone's shoulders or their feet the same way that I would pay attention to their genitals, right? Like that's soul land. That's like the place that, like fuck it, like why not shoot for, why not go for it? Like, I mean, I'm down to do all the things, but do it all from that perspective of loving and appreciating everything, even the beer, even all the things. It's not a path of renunciation because renunciation just binds you to that fucking thing, even though I'm temporarily doing that as a tool to liberate myself. But if I permanently went celibate, for damn sure all I'd be thinking about was sex for the rest of my life. I think there'd become a point where it wouldn't work. Yeah, you know? You've just constructed another palace there, right? You're just building another weird. It's like, I love that perspective Ramdas had. This is honestly like he's talking about a, you know, we create a hierarchy of experience. For some people, the hierarchy is, the peak is sex. For some people, it's finishing a race. For some people, it's having children. You know, it's different for everybody. For some people, it's taking a walk. The more awakened a person seems to be, the less, you know, the less trouble they have to go through to get to that spot, you know? So, you know, you don't have to climb the mountain. You can just go sit in your garden and you don't have to actually sit in your garden. You can look out at your garden. You can actually just be in your garden all the time. But people really, I think some people have a little bit of an adverse reaction to this perception because their entire identity is based on this odd starvation cycle in between moments where they allow themselves to experience the divine and moments when they are imagining that they're not experiencing the divine because how could that be possible? It's like breaking the fucking simulator, man. It's like, no, you know what? If the whole thing can't be divine, it's gotta have spaces in it. And if I don't have those to run towards and I'm gonna turn into a piece of shit, that's usually what people say. Then what will motivate me? What will there be anymore? What will there, and it's like, are you fucking kidding me, man? Do you remember the last time you were in love? Do you remember how you acted? Do you remember how every moment was blissful and you weren't like, if anything, when you're really in love, you become the opposite of a lazy, demotivated person. You're like making mixtapes. You know what I mean? You're like- You're laughing, you're smiling. Every room you go in, people elevate their spirits. They find a cord with your energetic state, you know? And it's just a great gift. It's the permission you can give to the world to feel like that. I don't know if you've listened to East Forest tracks with Ramdas. Yeah, they're great. Unbelievable, but when he says, I love my pain, I love my wheelchair, and he says it so true, like so true that you go, oh shit, he's transcended the preference of not being in pain and not being in a wheelchair and identified all sensation as being of source and being of the soul, loving awareness, as he says. I think he's one of the few people that are at least publicly out there who've really actually made it, really made it to Soul Land. I believe that, and I haven't spent time with him like you have, but the more I'd listen to him and the more I tune in, I think he really fucking did it. I wanna tell you once, I have a million stories about him. And yes, I would say you're right. And some of the stories I feel embarrassed talking about because it's like, man, I know what people are gonna think, but I saw this with my own damn eyes. And we call it whatever you wanna call it, but we're at one of these retreats in Hawaii and one of the things he does on the last day is he gets in these floaty things and he floats out into the ocean and people swim out there with him and they just swim with him in the ocean. It had been raining every day at this freaking retreat, man. And he was like, again, I'm watching this from the balcony of my room just to put in perspective where the fuck I am. I could be out there swimming with ROMs off. I'm like, oh, it's a little cold. Here's a man who's at a stroke. You know what I mean? And he's like floating in the water. It just, you know, he's being there, but it had been raining every day. He floats out there and it stops raining. And not only does it stop raining, but of course a rainbow forms above where he's floating. Now, look, man, those kinds of things in a movie, you're like, shut the fuck up. It's cheesy almost. So there does seem to be a preponderance of synchronicities around a person who has achieved that state that you're talking about in the same way that, and I imagine it's like, you know, if you're writing love letters to the universe and you're not just writing love letters to one address, but to every address with every breath that you make, then I think you could expect to get some love letters back. And I think you could expect to get more love letters back than your big date night where you're humping and it's exciting or the ketamine night or whatever, the booking, the movie night, or you lost the 10 pounds night or the whatever. I think you get constant return DMs. I think a lot of variables start sliding into your DMs from everywhere. And I think Paul Selig says something like, the best way to know, to understand the self is as part of everything in the environment that you're in. I think we have these ideas where we separate things when we confine them because it's convenient. Oh, you're dunking there, and then here's your room, dunking in the room. But like Paul Selig's like, no, no, no, no, it's dunking in the room, like they're all apart. And then not only the room, but the world and all the other people and like everything is like co-connected actually. Actually. Actually. So this idea that Rom-Dos is connected to in something, obviously you say clouds are one thing, Rom-Dos is one thing, maybe not. Maybe Rom-Dos and clouds and the whole world and everything is actually in some kind of symphony and some kind of synchronicity. And like that might be the actual truth. And of course there's gonna be skeptics and like prove it out, but maybe the science will prove that eventually and but whatever, but it feels like, it feels like that's right. To me, it makes me think of something I just read in meditations, Marcus Aurelius, where he's talking about the, this idea of like, well, what is the, do you think the universe is imperfect? Do you think you spring from imperfection? And mostly, when I'm looking at anything that isn't me, you know, especially in nature, I don't, I've never seen what I would call an imperfect tree. Like I've seen trees in various states, but they're all beautiful, you know? The bark pattern, they're beautiful. Trees are just beautiful. And then, you know, that's most things. In fact, that's all things is what I gathered from what he was saying, which is that any given frame of the process of unfolding of the universe can look like this or that, you know, in our own life. Subjectively, in like the frame of your identity can sometimes seem crazy if the, and especially the smaller the frame gets, the more dramatic ship becomes. You, the more you forget, you're a process. You're not, you're not where you are right now. You are there right now, but that's not where you're gonna stay. You know, when I started doing this exercise program, but when I went in the gym a little over a month ago, dedicated to working out as much as I could within reason, and I looked at myself and looked at my fat body and looked at my shallow face and looked at it, what I did is I looked through it and I thought, oh yeah, that's, I'm seeing this part of the process, but I looked through it to the part of the process where I'm not like that anymore because I've consistently, you know, anyway, both exist simultaneously outside of time. And I think that a person like Ramdas is hanging out more in that outside of time place. And he is not seeing from an imaginary place. When he says, I see your soul, he's not just making that up, that's not pretty words. He's looking at you, but he's not seeing this frame of the process. He's zoomed out. To the unborn and the undying part of the process. And it's beautiful. And how could you not fall in love with that? I know. He's seeing you, you know, and this is what they say. Again, I'm speaking for him, but I maybe not speaking for him so much, but from what I've heard of an even Crowley Baba or what I've heard from hanging out with my baby is they just see good. They just see beauty and good. And they're really kind of blind to the shit we're picking up on our radar. And, and- All the judgments we have. Yeah, yeah. And which is why it's a delight to be around them. Cause when they're looking at you, they're seeing right into that part of yourself that you've been feeling all the time. It's given you every single bit of confidence that you have in your life. And there, that's who they're hanging out with is that, you know, the cloud of stuff around it, they're not dismissing it either, but they see something. Yeah, I think it requires a couple of things. One, you have to understand that the important part of us is the unborn and the undying. And that part is our soul and that part is here to learn, you know, and it's going like, if you really believe that. And again, there's no way to prove that, but you can experience that and feel that. And that's what all the great spiritual teachers say. Like know that. And then recognize like Memento Mori, the classic Stoic saying, remember that you're going to die. Like remember that this body is just in transition to give you a framework to just enjoy it and know that you're in a constant transition. And so you're not Duncan, you're Duncan-ing. I'm not Aubrey, I'm Aubrey-ing. There is no noun, it's all a verb. Because everything is actually even something that looks like it's never going anywhere. And if a thousand years that chair, it's chairing its way into complete decomposition in some way. Everything is just in a process as we go. And we get to surf that process as we go. And we have a little agency to steer the surfboard or the canoe or whatever and decide, do I want to be Duncan-ing in shape? Or do I want to be Duncan-ing out of shape? You know, like whatever you want to be and you can make those choices and know that like, okay, here's this life, this experience I have to be a Duncan or to be an Aubrey. How do I want to do it? And recognize it either way, it's all good. You can't make a wrong choice as long as you're not hurting somebody else, preventing somebody else like Chad from chatting or Karen from Karen-ing. You gotta let them fucking chat or Karen the way that they want to chat or Karen. You can't fuck with their shit. But other than that, do what you want. And then you gotta let Aubrey, Aubrey. And now fuck with Aubrey's shit. And then Maggie, you know what I mean? And that's to me is where it gets really controversial. And perhaps I've misunderstood, but once Krishnadas said this thing to me, and I'm sorry, Krishnadas, not that you're listening to this, but maybe I misunderstood you, but he always says the heaviest shit to me, but it's always like one sentence. But then I think about it for four years, you know? And I remember he put his hand on my shoulder at this live podcast, at this podcast where he was gonna be right for me on stage and he looked at me with, you know, these guys, they really are just loving people, man. And when someone's, there's a thing they say about one of these Tibetan teachers, Dilgo Kinsey, Rinpoche, he could say to you, be kind. And, but because it was coming out of an awakened being, someone who was opened up, it's a way different be kind than when you hear it on a TV commercial on the back of a cereal box or whatever. But he put his, he said, you know, you're gonna have to burn off all the karma, right? Every bit of it, it was so cool because it was so simultaneously compassionate and realistic being like, you don't, you can't skip ahead to that place. You're gonna have to burn it out. It's gonna have to like be processed and you just gotta do, you just gotta have to do it. And that surrender to that process, that to me is what Ramdas really teaches is to, okay, then I'm gonna love the burning. I'm gonna love every bit of it. When my awareness is there, when I'm there and not completely asleep or freaking out or screaming, when I'm there, wait, I think I can work with this. I can love, wait, I can really love this. And then somewhere in there, that's to me, I don't know, those moments are pretty sweet. That's what, that's what alchemizes the karma itself. I mean, Ramdas says, I really like the way he talks about karma because a lot of times people get so wrapped up in this past life and you did this thing seven lifetimes ago and he goes straight up, your karma is your mind. Wow. Your karma is your mind. That's so good. Right, so then you recognize like, okay, I'm not trying to redeem some fucking random mystery about some thing I did in some lifetime and some fucking star system that was far away or whatever to some Akashic records reader is gonna try and pedal you. But like, you're just working with the things that are in your mind every time that you're in judgment, every time that you have a love that holds a record of wrong rather than the love that holds no record of wrong. Every time you even need to ask for forgiveness because if you're asking for forgiveness, that means you've already judged somebody but true love doesn't judge. So it doesn't ever need forgiveness because forgiveness is already always given. And you're in that spot. You've transcended the karma of the mind. And so you get a clear, like a clear focus, like, okay. Okay. I love that, man. It's like forgiveness in particular, there's this concept of revision. Have you heard this concept before revision? Neville Goddard is this brilliant philosopher talks about it. And I think I've heard of like some group therapy stuff that uses this, but essentially, you know, many of us are haunted by some memories of times we weren't our best selves with people. And so those memories will just pop up out of the blue. And for a lot of people, when the memory pops up, it triggers a guilt reaction, which triggers usually some kind of depression or a series of behaviors that tend to like actually amplify the conditions that the sort of less perfect self was being reactionary in in the first place. So you keep repeating this, you get stuck. And this is when people are like, oh, fuck man, the same thing keeps happening to me over and over again. I don't get it, why? Well, it's because you're stuck in a memory. And so revision is this practice of like, and it's really weird when you hear it at first, but the next time the memory comes, instead of like reacting with guilt, react by revising the memory itself as though you were your best self in that moment. And say the things to the person that you would say from a loving, awakened state and actually let them be their best self too. And hear them say the best thing back to you. And just as a psychological practice of, because when you realize like, oh shit, much like Marcus Raleigh says, everything before this moment is gone, at least from my temporal based POV. Meaning that the past is gone, except for the remnants of the past that are floating around in the snow globe of my brain. So if I take those remnants of the past and actually transform them from their degraded state to their, the highest state that I can imagine for them, you get a weird instantaneous, what is called a remission of sin. You get an actual, you have revised and you have like in that moment, suddenly weirdly you'll perk up before your mind can kick in and be like, shut the fuck up, what are you delusional? You can't change the past. Well, the past is a gone, but I certainly can change my record of the past. And in that is what I've been, someone's never got, that's forgiveness. That's truly forgiving yourself as revising. And then from a multiverse perspective, it gets even wilder. This concept of every single possibility is happening at once. And the act of revision is actually a navigation into the part of the multiverse where you were your best self as are being drawn into your best self. And then it gets even trippier, which is to imagine that right now, at some point in the multiverse, an advanced version of ourself is revising the past right now. And we're experiencing that revision from the awakened version of ourselves. And then of course, when you get to the point we're talking about unit of consciousness, you realize that that self, of course, is the mind of God. And this entire experience is a revision that it is increasingly perfecting itself. It all takes its own time and its own pace. But that theory, that thing, I've actually seen that in practice. So I have a group, I have a mastermind, we call it fit for service. And we go, we were out in Sedona, that was the last time we were in a retreat. And the purpose of this, this quarter was about emotional fitness. And so we started a workshop and I shared a lot of personal things that I was guilty about, the things I was most shameful about in my life. And a lot of these things, so many of these people would have these same things that they were shameful about. And then we did this exercise where we looked at each other and tried to see that everybody was each other living a different life. Like, look at those eyes, think of the things those eyes have seen, think of the things, the tears that those eyes have cried, the smiles that that face has formed the lines on the cheek, the furrows on the brow. Like, let's look at each other, see this. So we got to this state and then people had the opportunity to offer those things that they were shameful about. And I was really surprised, I was kind of expecting, one time I cheated on this exam or one time I did this, but there was some really powerful stuff that came out. And I was sharing as much as I could to kind of open the door. But one guy in particular was like, and he was with his wife. He's like, I beat my kids. And he starts crying and his wife starts crying and then everybody starts crying. But everybody in that moment offered him their best version of unconditional love, even though every person in the room was so moved by this. And then so just intuitively, the exercise was like, all right. You know, like, thank you for sharing that. Now, all of us, let's beam back to you. The most unconditional love and forgiveness that comes from the divine. And some people had a problem with that. Some people were like, no, like, you can't, I'm not, I don't want to, I can't forgive, I can't forgive them for that. We're like, we're accessing like a forgiveness that's beyond the human, beyond the human here. And this will create the change that will actually prevent the action from happening. Like we're so stuck in this crime and punishment action. Like, oh, well, we should beat you now. You know, but what really ended up happening is everybody got to that state where they were like, everybody was looking at him and just beaming that love. And it was such a powerful transformative experience, not only for him, but for everybody to know that even that thing that is so kind of almost unforgivable can be forgiven and transcended and all of that guilt and all of that shame and all of that, that when it's compounded will bury, you know, different elements of his life and all that can be revised in the language that you're using. And one of the things Trudy Goodman says I love is you don't have to do it alone. That's what community's there for. That's what community's there for. That's why it's so fucking powerful. Yeah. So when you got, when we had like 25 people all doing that, their heart already peeled open. They're already in, you know, wide open from the whole experience of the weekend. But when they were all there beaming their love and he was looking around and saw nothing but love back to him in the room like, holy shit. You know, that was a thing. You watched a transfiguration happen probably. Yeah. When, what's that saying in Christianity or three or more of you are gathered there I will be and like that Christ consciousness and to me, this is I think where people get really confused about Christianity is cause they're experienced with it. Sometimes it's this hyper judgmental people who seem to have a real intense agenda, you know, to like get you on their track. But like the real idea of it being like this, like, no, you don't, the thing is it just loves you. It loves you when you're killing it. It loves you when you're hurting it. It loves you when you're whipping it. It loves you when you're loving it. It loves you unconditionally. It loves you, loves you. It like loves you the way my son looks at me, loves you. Except it's the whole universe. And to me that is the like, when you look at what's happening on the planet and you realize you're seeing like, what is it? If this isn't the crucifixion of Christ, I don't know what is. You're seeing this like beautiful, beautiful, purely innocent, all giving thing, slowly being whipped, it's clothes ripped off, nailed to a fucking industrial revolution model of existence and slowly dying while it writhes in space, completely alone as we devour it. If that's not Jesus, I don't know what is. And the good news about it is that like, at least if it follows the same model, there's a resurrection potential there, you know? It doesn't just, it doesn't just have, it almost like in that story, at least there needed to be that, didn't there? Yeah, man, that was a powerful way to describe it. Because it's so true, man. I mean, that's God out there. That's God out there that we're doing all of these things to without any consciousness. We're not like the beer sipping example, right? Like we're not cutting the trees by asking the trees if we can cut them. We're not talking to the earth when we go dig for gold or oil or we're not talking to the air when we spew shit into it. We're not talking and being conscious of the ocean when we dump shit into it. We're just taking, taking mindless automatons, going and crucifying our mother. And in some ways, if father is spirit and mother is earth, it's like Jesus as our mother. Yeah. And we're like crucifying our mother. And, but there is that thing that maybe that is exactly what needs to happen for us to really appreciate, you know, our mother, just the way that Jesus needed to be crucified for us to really appreciate him in a certain way. Like that's what propelled Christianity into the global phenomenon. And of course it's been bastardized. It's like Celics says, you know, diamonds of truth poured in a mortar of distortion. And that mortar of distortion has been all the ways that people have used power to, to kind of manipulate Christianity, but the diamonds of truth are still there. And those diamonds of truth is the truth of Jesus that was being crucified. But, but nonetheless, maybe, maybe it's all happening as fucking perfectly, as fucking sad as it is. When you watch those nails go through the hands, as we watch our oceans get destroyed and we watch these animals go extinct, those are the nails through the hands and the crown of thorns on the head. And as hard as that is for us who are aware to see it, maybe we can have the faith to know that it's the only way it ever could be. And, and yeah. And also just like, you know, the cataclysmic heartbreak when that thing dies, you know, and like, to me, that's, yeah, the heart, the like unparalleled heartbreak. But that heartbreak is happening, you know, that is, that's important, I just think that's important to feel and to like, as I've heard, to radiate out from that heartbreak. So the heartbreak comes, cause you know, I meet people and they're scared and they're like, the world's ending and everything. And it's like, yeah. But to really honor it, feel your heartbreak and then radiate out from that and then let out break again and again. And I don't do that. But I mean, when I, some, I do it more lately. Thank God. But like it is, you have to get into your heart and feel it. And then, but then also remember, if as above so below, we're, forget crucifying the earth, we're fucking crucifying ourselves. Every single day, you know. I'm an expert at that. Every. Self-crucification expert. But again, that's, that's that. You are an expert on that. You're hard on yourself, man. I am hard on myself, it's true Duncan. But you know, having somebody else, like I haven't, I know that I love the earth, but I haven't felt what I just felt just now until you just used your words and your language and your own expression and your own way of talking about it. And like, it just reminds you. And that's why it's so important to like, be around people who can remind you and show you and like, say like, hey, remember, remember the earth. Remember how like, remember that for a second. Yeah. And you're like, oh fuck, I haven't really been thinking about that at all. And then you can feel the heartbreak of that. You don't have to carry it with you every second of every day. You got to stuff that you can always focus on, but to tap back in and to, and to feel that and feel, like feel the love for your parents before they pass. Yeah. Like, you take that shit for granted. I love my mom so much, but I see her every couple of weeks and I'm like, come on, man. Like, see her more. Yeah. Like, I love her so much, you know, like go make that extra effort, but you take shit for granted. Oh mom, you know, she's going to be around, you know? Yeah. Maybe not. Like Don Howard, you know, like last time I said goodbye to him, I thought maybe this will be the last time. I was like, I'll probably see him again. I'll, you know, he's getting treatment at the Mayo Clinic. I think he'll, you know, he'll make it another couple of years and then you just get that message and like, fuck, I should have just gone to fucking Arizona. You know, like I could have. And just, just seeing him one more time, just like held his hand in the wheelchair just one more time. Well, I'll tell you this, you know, the closer you get to that desire you expressed earlier, which is to no longer hierarchize experience, the sooner you'll see him again. And that, that's the fascinating, I think, one of the fascinating things about this stuff is that it is a veil of sorts. And that the more you, you just melt into it, the more all those people that have been covered up by the veil of time, suddenly you start seeing them. And man, it reminds me, Neem Karoli Baba, this is, you know, one of the things they talk about, it's how wild it was that he mostly just talked about Jesus. He talked about Jesus. They said almost more than Hindu, it's more, I think. There's a story they talk about, which is where like, he, he started crying, he was talking about Jesus and he starts crying, like just, like, you know, I don't wanna, being like that starts, that, the vibes apparently, just the energy, he's like crying. Everybody's crying. And he's like, he said, he lost himself in love. He lost himself in love. And it's like, such a wild thing to say is to become lost in this thing that you're talking about. This, it's not, it no longer goes to being like, well, I think I can be in love with the UPS driver. And I think I can be in love with the traffic. And I, it too, I am so deeply in love with this experience of incarnation that there's no more me if I wanted to go back, I couldn't. There's nothing to go back to. Whoa, that's a potential, I think, that some of these people demonstrate to us in their teachings. And I think there's been a sporadic few, but I think as, as time goes, it's just like that first person who hits that double backflip on the motorbike and X games, like has a few more people get a little closer. And it's like, we start now, Ramnath says a lot of light shining on him, right? Like a lot of people are getting to see that. And they're going like, oh shit, there's some shit that's possible. These aren't people that are, you have to walk on foot to India to find them and then hear the story and go back. Like we got them on video and recordings and where people can see them and go to retreats with them. And then there's gonna be more of these people popping up. And we have the invitation to be on some part of the bridge to that road and give people anywhere on that bridge a little more permission to be like that. And then the world can start to really fucking shift. And that's, I think, where it gets really exciting. Like how much, how close can we get in our lifetime to that place of being in love with everything, not every being, but everything. You tell me. I don't know, man, I'm going for it though, why not? And that's it, like why not fucking go for it? I don't know how, I don't know, I don't know. I got a lot of shit in the way, you know, like. What's in the way? Isn't the idea you love the shit too? Like whatever's in the way you start loving it. You realize it's like, oh yeah, it's like a weird form of procrastination. It's like, hey, I'm gonna sit in this fucking hot tub of like dark goop. You know what I mean? I'll go with the nice hot tub. Cause that was one thing in the early days with Ramdas, you'd always be like, you know, we need to get you out of your head and to your heart to me. And I'd be like, it's too hard. And he'd get this big smile on his face and go, no, it's not. Like I want to make it hard. I want to make it like some kind of like ultramarathon. I want to make it like gnarly journey through fucking thorns when, because what does that do? It makes it so that for whatever reason, I could continue my addiction to whatever confused. It allows the ego to maintain sovereignty over the being. That's it. It allows, cause if you're struggling and you're striving, you're in a place that isn't quite there and you have to figure it out and think your way through and then the ego's in control. And I think that's, I think the slippery ways that we're kind of, I want to talk to Paul Selleck. And I know I mentioned him a bunch and some people may agree with him or not, but he has such wisdom. When I talked to him, I asked him if the ego itself could be considered a being, like a being. And he was like, he asked the guides and he was like, yes, the ego, you could consider the ego as a being. So what that means to me is that every being has the imperative to survive at all costs. Like every being wants to survive. That's the primary imperative. Procreate is another part, primary imperative is to survive. So your ego is within you, within the construct of your mind. You can consider it like a being and it wants to survive. Now, if you open your heart and you transcend the vision in which you see separation in all, you don't see the separation and everything anymore. The ego is no longer in sovereignty and it's almost a place where the ego dies. So it's gonna fight to the bitter end to take over and keep control because as a being it wants to survive and thrive. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's like the living palace. It's not just a palace, it's a palace that walks around and wants to like, yeah, yeah. And it's such a funny, it's like what would be, like how much would it be worth to completely experience the fundamental goodness of all things all the time? Like what's the ticket price for that? And I think the ticket price is like everything. Like just, well, you just will give it all up. That's all, just give everything up. Like with my son, like there is no question that I would just, if I needed to die for him, I would do. I wouldn't even think about it, like yeah, no problem. That's love, like I love him that much. I'll just die, it's not even that big a deal because I love that being so much. And so this gives me a little bit of a as above, so below map within which to understand, okay, well, if I could expand that out. So it wasn't just my son, but it was everyone. Not just my wife, my son, my dogs, everything. And constant love, even when they're fucking screaming in my face. Even when they're shitting on me. You know what I mean? Whatever it may be. Cause I think that is the other piece for me at least. It's like, God damn it, I just love, I love winning. I love the arm wrestling match. And I'm right in the righteousness of all things that ego loves winning the most. That's what it's driven to, it's driven to win. It's driven to claim separation, claim separateness and win. But it first has to claim separateness before you can win. How do you win if you're same? You can't fucking win if you're same. So it claims separateness and then competes forever to try and win. That's crazy. And so the answer, I don't think we'll ever be able to let it go completely. But if we can merge the soul and keep the soul in the sovereign position and the soul becomes like the rider and the ego becomes like the horse and it moves you. And then all of a sudden the horse and rider become like a centaur in which the whole mind and essence of the being is actually driving the horse. The horse doesn't even have its own mind anymore, but it's still there. Soul and ego on this journey through life. And it's just the unification. Yeah, yeah. That's the place I think a lot of people check out. It's like, no, I'm gonna stay on me. That's at least what I, but at least though, I think what's cool about this stuff is that it is very compassionate in the sense that it's, you know, all these teachers that you always get the sense from them. There's this sense of like, no, this is, you should get on the boat. I mean, it would be good for you to get on the boat. It would be good for you, but there's no rush. And Ramdas talks about it with Neem Karolibaba, that sense of like, he's looking at you and it's not like he's thinking, oh, you could do a few more lifetimes. You wanna do a hundred more, maybe a thousand? Do them, let's do some more. We will do as many as we need to, on and on and on. So that, again, is another, like what you just said about the idea that the ego must create these boundaries to produce the situation of winning and losing. Similarly, another trick of the ego is this thing. Okay, then I'm gonna get, fuck, I'm gonna lose myself in love by next week. I'll be lost to completely in love. And win that way. Yeah. I'm gonna win the love. I'm gonna win the ego loss game, right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, and I think it may actually even be productive to guide the ego towards unconditional love. Because again, I don't think, they don't think we can let it go. I think we just gotta steer it, especially at first. Like we gotta steer it. So what are we gonna steer it to? Well, we can steer it towards money and sex and power and all of these things. But if we actually steered it towards unconditional love, not the spiritual materialism of wearing your power amulet and saying that I'm the spiritual being and I'm better because I'm a spiritual being, but actual unconditional love, which sees every person as just the same, not better or worse. And that was what you like steer your ego towards. So what's the- Come on, ego. How do you do the steering? You go, ego, the coolest thing that you could fucking do, the baddest thing to make you the fucking best. The best thing you could do is to love everybody unconditionally. That might work. See everybody is same. May I propose another one? Yeah, go for it. How about this one? You look at the ego, and this is almost blasphemous for a lot of people, and you go, ego, I love you. Yeah. Just the way you are. I love you. I love you. I love you right now. You don't need to do a damn thing. Totally. Because you know what, man? I know this, and this is my ego speaking. Anytime anybody is trying to steer me, I'm like, fuck you. You will not steer me. I'm gonna be this way. But anytime you get around someone who's like, just I love you. I love you just now. You get pissed. You do the thing where you're like, mother fuck, I'm gonna fuck. And then after the fucking, they're looking at you, and they actually love you after that thing. And you're like, wait, all my other friends, when they see that side of me, that's pretty much it. There's a permanent limp in our relationship, but you just saw that. Wait, nothing's changed? You still love, what about that? And that, that. And you go through all these gesticulations in the face of that kind of love in the same way my baby. Well, just scream and noodle around and like, ah. But then I love that. And he's gonna be fine. And he, he's not expecting me to remember the tantrum. And I certainly don't remember the tantrum. It's unconditional is what I'm saying. And that, that to me is like, okay, if we're gonna practice this shit, we're gonna start with the ego. And we're not gonna start by steering the ego, by changing the ego, by remodeling the ego. What happens if we actually just love it now? What happens to the pattern? Does the pattern change? Does it? It might end up with, that might be actually the way to do the same thing that I was mentioning in the most effective way. Maybe. Is to love it unconditionally. And then it will learn to love everything unconditionally from the love that you've patterned and shown it to love. And that may be actually the way. So maybe your question of like, how do you get the ego on board? Maybe it's to love it just the way it is, no matter what. Yeah. You know, I told, I told this story, I saw a picture one time of, and actually Alex Gray like redrew the picture for me, which is fucking rad. But it was a picture of Prometheus who's chained to the rock. Yeah. And I think I might've told the story maybe. No, I know the picture. The vulture is eating him and shit, yeah. Eagle is eating its liver out, right? But in this one, Prometheus has chained in a way that is feeder bound, but he still has access to his hands. And so Prometheus is eating his liver and has his liver is pulling it out. The eagle is pulling out his liver. And Prometheus is giving the eagle a hug. And every single, the symbol being that every single day the eagle does that eagle just doing its duty, its Dharma, which is to eat the liver. And Prometheus making the choice, like Victor Frankel said, the ability to choose our reaction to any given situation, not the situation. Prometheus is choosing to hug the eagle in that moment. That's unconditional love. Aubrey, I love our conversations. I love our conversations too, man. We can't do better than that. Yeah. We're gonna wrap it up. My God, that's beautiful. Love the eagle that's eating your guts. Love the eagle. Did I say eagle? Shit. Yeah, wow. Whoa. Where could people find you, my friend? At Aubrey Marcus is a good place to look.

60^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Al Madrigal Transcript and Discussion^2016-04-01^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast being recorded in the luxurious back room of an authentic tour bus somewhere in Charleston. We did it. Last night at 2 a.m., our driver, English, climbed into the bus and headed down the road. I still haven't met the guy. He parks really early in the morning and by the time you wake up, he's gone. So I don't know who he is, what he is. I don't even know if he's human. Could be a robot. The bus could be driving itself for all I know. One thing I'm certain of though is this mattress has gotta be at least 80% Jimmy Buffett jizz and that the simulator that we're currently existing in must be breaking down that I should enjoy the incredible honor of laying on a mattress that Jimmy Buffett has undoubtedly filled with a million gallons of DNA as he lays in the back watching satellite TV and pleasuring himself in between gigs. Am I certain that Jimmy Buffett has slept in the back of this tour bus? Yes, why? Because Jimmy Buffett, according to a revision to the United States Constitution, has to masturbate in the back of every tour bus before it's considered road worthy. Regardless, Charleston is amazing and humid and I already had a conversation with somebody who told me that Charleston, South Carolina is the holy city and because of this, his mother had been possessed by the spirit of the baby Jesus who told him that he was forgiven along with everybody else on earth. So that's good news for all of us. Guys, we're gonna jump right into this podcast three this week and the reason that we had three this week is because I was inspired by the conversation you're about to hear that I had with Al Madrigal. We're gonna dive right into it, but first, some quick business. This episode is brought to you by squarespace.com. Have you noticed a profusion of demons cackling at you in your dreams at night?

Squarespace.com, offer code Duncan, much thanks to them for sponsoring this episode and not only for sponsoring this episode, but for putting my ass in the back of a tour bus in Charleston because they have also sponsored the tour that I'm on, which is the Squarespace Presents You Are God Comedy Tour. We had a wonderful sold out show in Asheville, North Carolina last night. We've got a show in Charleston tonight and then we're headed to Durham on the 1st of April, then Richmond, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Hamden, Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cleveland, Ferndale, Toronto, Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Nashville, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and then to Hawaii for the spring retreat, for the Rom-Doc spring retreat. Some shows have already sold out, but we've added second shows. The New York first show is sold out, we've added a second show there. The Portland show's sold out, but we've added a second show and the Toronto show's sold out, but we've added a second show. And tickets are really going fast for almost every single show on this tour, so don't put off getting tickets, get tickets in advance, and come and see the You Are God comedy tour. And we've got some wonderful openers, depending on where you're gonna be. Johnny Pemberton is gonna be joining us in Washington. We've got, I'm here with Steven Ajay right now, who's a really funny comic that I met in Denver and Mikey Kampman, who is also amazingly funny, is gonna be hosting the entire tour. You probably know him from two-wet crew. Regardless, I hope that you will take some time, go to dunkitrustle.com and buy tickets to one of these shows if I happen to be coming through your neighborhood. We're also brought to you by amazon.com. There's an Amazon portal, which is located in the comments section of any of these episodes. So if you're thinking of getting anything on amazon.com, and one thing that I highly recommend you looking into is a Moog synthesizer. In Asheville, we took a tour of the Moog factory. I don't know if you can call it a factory. It's like a co-op or something, but all the workers own the business, and these guys produce the most amazing synthesizers. I actually have a Moog, a sub-37, and I bought it just because when I was playing around with it, I just couldn't believe how beautiful the sound it was creating was. And now that I've taken a tour of Moog, I am, now I know why. Cause I really didn't understand that the difference between an analog and digital synthesizer is that an analog synthesizer is creating that music right there in the moment. It's more like a guitar, whereas like a digital synthesizer, even though they're super cool, it's pre-recorded sounds. So the Moog is this living thing that you dial in these weird sounds. And in the old days, people like Pink Floyd, if they found, if they had a Moog synthesizer and they found a sound they liked, they would actually put duct tape all over the dials because it didn't have any way to record the sound. So it's just a fun, amazing thing. I don't really consider myself a musician as much as somebody who loves getting stoned and making sounds come out of a device that appears to have fallen out of a spaceship and seems completely capable of channeling angels or spirits if I just spin the knobs the right way. So check that out on Amazon if you're feeling like buying something intense and insane, but they also have toilet paper, toothpaste. Look, you know how it works. Just go through the portal. They give us a small percentage of anything you buy and it costs you nothing. We also have t-shirts and posters in the shop at dunkintrustle.com. You could go check those out too. As I mentioned earlier, if you've noticed a sudden perfusion of podcasts exploding from the DTFH, it's 100% because of the conversation you're about to listen to that I had with Al Magical. Al is a comedian. You've probably seen him on The Daily Show. He also is the co-founder of the All Things Comedy podcast network. He's been on a bunch of other shows too. Gary Unmarried, Welcome to the Captain and NBC's About a Boy. He's got comedy specials out and he's been on Conan, Jimmy Kimmel Live and Craig Ferguson. This is a highly functioning, super successful comedian who also happens to be a really sweet guy, a wonderful father and a real inspiration. Not just for me, but for a lot of comedians out there. So go check his website out. It's almagical.com and I'll have links to his Twitter and to his website in the comments section of this episode. Okay, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell, family hour podcast, the amazing Al Magical. It's the... Al, welcome knowing the Dunkin' Trussell family on our podcast. Thank you so much for joining us, for the great work you've done on this article. All our amazing, wonderful commentators on all sides of her channel, and we recommend all of you to tell us what you need to spend time with and what integrated watching and owned impact is. I don't know why, but thanks to the family on our podcast. Thank you so much for coming over. The least amount of time I've had to travel for anything. How cool is that? We're neighbors and we didn't even know it. Well, it's... We both had the same desire to get out of Hollywood. I was living with my family in Silver Lake when we first moved down here, and then went to Eagle Rock. We were there for 10 years. And then I found this place, and I'm gonna keep moving east until I can afford to move to Hawaii. So you want to move to Hawaii too? Yes. See, this is the dream. And I've heard that the ultimate life is to spend your winters in Hawaii and your summers in Seattle. You ever heard that before? No, I have not heard about the Seattle thing. Like on an island in Seattle? Like going to the San Juan Islands? I have no idea. I don't know the makeup of Seattle. I've only been there a few times. Every time I go, it's beautiful. It's incredible, but apparently, the winners are suicide winners, people. Now we're in Hawaii. Maui is where I would move. I'll go, I'd go Big Island. Why? I like it there. Spread out and not as populated. And then we'd, if I'm gonna go to Hawaii, but that's really where we've, I've gone with my family almost every single year. We go to the Big Island and... Big Island is not Honolulu. No, that's Oahu. Okay, Oahu. Yeah. Big Island is the island of Hawaii. Big Island is the one that's got volcanic rock. Yes. Everywhere. Yes. Hilo is one of the cities. Okay, gotcha. Kona. Gotcha. Okay, yes, yes. Okay, I've been there. But Maui is just, you know, and... It's all nice. Kauai is insane too. Like, it's all insane. And whenever you go there, you think, my God, what have I done? Why am I not living here? When it's the most beautiful place on earth, people are pretty cool. So, yeah, I've felt the draw. And then you sound like an asshole when you're talking to people there because you're like, I think I'm gonna move here. And they're like, yeah, everyone says that. But I think you get island fever there too. I don't think you could spend 100% of your time in Hawaii because you get, especially on Kauai or something like that, I've heard from people that you feel a little trapped in and it might be a little too slow for you to adjust. Well, yeah, it's like a small town in the middle of the fucking ocean. You know, you're in a small town, and you can't drive away from it to go to anywhere, anywhere you wanna go outside of that place, you gotta fly. People, the way someone, one of my friends moved there and described it, it turns into the most beautiful groundhog day ever, where it's just this endless loop of rainbows and light and beauty, but you're still stuck in this place. You need work. And that's why I'm a huge gardener. We were talking about this, and I can probably busy myself. Between reading what various projects around the house and gardening and like physical fitness, like you'd go and work out and do hikes and stuff like that. You could be very busy. Surfing. Surfing, why not be, why, spear fishing? Why am I not doing that for dinner every single night? Oh God. I'd go down and I'd spear fish. I've got this sort of work down, but I need to make my whole plan, and we talked about this a little bit at the comedy store, my plan is to make as much money as I can before 50 and 55, those two little marks, and then just see if I can just walk away altogether. Now, how are you, you're one of the hardest workers, I know man, you're always doing multiple jobs all the time. That's tough, it's a little overwhelming. It's overwhelming, but part of that is probably because you have a family, how many kids do you have? Two kids, 13 and 10. 13 and 10, so for over a decade you have been. Providing, my wife hasn't worked, she's been a full-time homekeeper for her since we moved down here in 2003. And so 2003, okay, right, so how old was your kid in 2003? I should be able to do that. We moved down in one, he was one year, it was his first birthday when we actually left San Francisco. So you moved from San Francisco, how long have you been doing stand-up when you moved out here? I had been doing stand-up for five years. So you'd been doing stand-up for five years and had a child? Yes. That must have been terrifying. Was that terrifying? It was a little terrifying. Well, I was working for my parents' family business. And then- What was that business? I was hiring and firing people for other companies. So I was up in the air with George Clooney, I used to fire people. Wow. And then I was really stressed out, crying my car, I needed to find something else and so I always wanted to be a stand-up comic from the young, young age. I was grew up on a block in San Francisco with other stand-up comedians. So there's Michael Meehan and Michael Pritchard who lived on my square block. So I would drive up to their steps. I remember walking by when I was at university in San Francisco and walking down and there was a comedian's hand on the steps and they were having a joke meeting and they were gonna start a sketch group. And I was like, hey, what are you guys doing? And I recognized them as all these local comics. And they were like, yeah, we're starting a sketch group. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. That was like the flash-bowl moment where that started the- Well, I gave a speech in high school. I was a salutatorian in my high school class and I killed. What is salutatorian? There's a step below valedictorian. I was a horrible, horrible, horrible student. Just the worst doctor, how I was put through school. And you have math, I was trying to help my daughter with she's a fourth grader with math and I was bad at it and I can't, I'm sure I've un-diagnosed something. And so just look at it and it does not, nothing makes sense. And really, I'm finding adding up tips and I can function, but in terms of like, you know, really long division or any algebra, I have no idea what the math is going on. Sure. Checked out a long time ago. It just doesn't, that part of your brain isn't functioning. It does not work. So you were, what was your grades in math? What were you getting? I don't know how I was passed along. I remember going to a physics teacher at the end of high school and I said, Dr. Parker, I'm in a failure class. There were all the grades were posted and then there was they skipped lines and put mine down below everybody else's. And I go, Dr. Parker, I'm in a failure class. And he goes, Mr. Magical, for students like you, we don't believe in Fs, we believe in Bs. Cause I was Rushmore. I created all of the sketches. I was student body treasurer. I had an article that was in the newspaper that everyone rushed to read. What was the article? Oh, it was to ask Allen. I made up all of these fake advice. I had a fake advice con. I wrote all the questions and the answers. And I would really subtly make digs about teachers and, you know, it was a little controversial as well. And, you know, teachers coming up on what, I know this is me. What the hell are you thinking of doing? And would, you know, it was, I went to St. Ignatius college preparatory for boys. And my dad went there and graduated in 1957, but there's no way I would get in to that school, this, you know, to this day. So anyway, so I also saw Bob Sarlon, who was this old comic from San Francisco. He's, he had career day at our school. And on one of the doors, he just said comedy. And I would always go to his career day and he would play his old Lettermans. Wow. So I was watching this guy play VHS tapes of Lettermans. Anyway, so I always wanted to be a comic. What a cool school. That's an amazing school that they would even allow a comedian in as an actual career that kids could pursue. Yeah. So this priest, Father Prieto, I did an impression of him. And I did the winter pops. I would go on the announcements and pretend to be him. And everyone would think it was him. And then I would do, it would go off and get a little weird. And then they encouraged all that. And so they, he lobbied for me to be the salutatorian. I give this speech, 1700 kids crush. Wow. And I was like, this is him. I was a roast. I roasted my entire class. And I roasted teachers. And it was a roast. I roasted every time. Did you study roast before that at all? No, I had no idea what I was doing. And just wrote digs and subtle jabs at everybody. And then. Do you remember any of them? Not a clue. I know. Is it on tape? What about, I don't think so. No, this is pre anything. I graduated from high school in 1989. And so no record of this at all. And so, oh, I remember talking about somebody, some of the kids wore the same clothes every single day. And I go in, all of us have changed so much. Except. That's great. We've grown so much as people, except for this guy who's looked exactly the same from day one when we stepped in the school. So I did that and then worked in this parents' family business because we grew up pretty like lower middle class. My dad was a teamster that made about $30 grand a year. And then my mom cleaned houses and then worked as a secretary in this company. So this is all happening while I'm in grammar school and high school. And then eventually worked away and bought the company. So she has this amazing rags to riches story where she was making $6 an hour as a secretary and then working girl bought the company. So now the company, the kid who had a blazer from Goodwill, now is getting to an opportunity to take over this business. So I'm the eldest son in this family business. I work there from 19 to 32. Start doing stand up at the age of 28 because I figure if I don't do it before 30, I'm not going to do it. My window is going to close. What was the conversation when you start running your family business, which is a archetypical thing that you hear about. But I don't think a lot of people have experienced it. That's old school. Was there a formal conversation? We're passing this on to you now. You've got to start helping. It was understood that I would do this. It would be an idiotic for me not to come in and help. I fired my first person when I was 19 years old. I was still at USF and came in. So the family business is firing people? We manage other people's problems. So I'm like a corporate fixer, like Michael Clayton for small businesses. And so if people were fighting or if people were stealing or if people were showing up late, we employed everyone to work there, but it was our responsibility. So I would come in and go, hey, how's it going, guys? I understand you had a little fist fight at lunch break today, huh? Whoa. And you go, well, it's not going to happen again. If it does, we're going to call the cops. We're going to fire you both. So this is like a business has got some shitty employee that they're having problems with, but because you can't just fire somebody without getting in all kinds of weird. Yeah, you call in the fixer. Who will fire, who will make sure that- It's done perfectly. So there's no litigation. Yeah. Okay, cool. What there is litigation, because people are fucking horrible. So no matter what, yeah, you're going to do it right. Everyone, it was like horrible bosses is the thing, you know, like, oh, it's my boss, man. I get fucking embossed a dick. People just, all types of people are just terrible because a lot of the people that we work with, we give so many opportunities to, and people just don't want to be working. That was my whole thing is I would really was reasonable and I would say, hey, you're showing a blade every single day. You don't want to be here. Why don't you go find a job that you want to do? And this is not your job, man. Right. What would they say? They go, yeah, people would apologize to me all the time and say, Al, I'm sorry, I let you down, man. I was like, because I couldn't have been cooler about it. I was like, look, man, you're going to show up and you're late again. I got to show up at the final check, so please don't make me do that. So don't see me again. I do not want to see you. You're an assassin. You were like some kind of hitman. It was horrible. People would run from me at 4.30 on a Friday. If you saw me, it was over. Carried people's plants to their cars. I was smoking cigarettes heavy at the time. So I would just smoke cigarettes in my car and I'd play brand new being everything is everything. The sense, like the track from menace to society. Oh. Right before it walked in the door. If you're down, if you're down, say if you're scared, say you're scared. This is the shit. Don't fuck around or come unprepared because you might quit or something like that. So I would sit in the car. It's so dramatic, man. I had to put out a cigarette and I'd walk inside. I'd fire a fucking single mom without daycare. Oh, did you feel powerful? I felt horrible. So that's when I was taking stained glass glass. I was volunteering for the big brothers and big sisters in San Francisco and the peninsula. So you were trying to diffuse the. I was balancing it all out. Now, this is a family business. That you have been pushed into from familial pressure. Yeah, yeah, just like the people who had nothing now have everything because of this. Like how could you not want to take it over? And it's a kind of corporate, I guess you're like euthanizing. Corporate cubicle euthanizer. And so your parents, were they aware that you were having this kind of. Struggle with it, yeah. Yeah, I think so. It was just, it sucks. My mom's, so I'm half Mexican half Sicilian and my mom is Judy Tarantino and she's tough as shit. She's like, it fucking sucks, but these people fucked up and you got to deal with it. Like, and they were brutal. It was just really tough. Your parents. Yeah, just tough in terms of not with me, but just with others. Like a big fuck you don't fuck with us. Like you fucked up and this is what you did. Are they Catholic? Yes. So did they have some kind of religious backing for their life philosophy? They didn't attach it to like, this is the will of God, this is. Not close, but my jet, I would, the only thing that when religion entered into the picture, my dad is really sick. Like just, I cannot believe he's alive right to this day. He was given five months to live six years ago. Oh wow. And because we staffed a lot of medical offices, my mom and dad would, they had access to all this great healthcare. You know other people don't have access? They have all the access. And so they knew how to manipulate the system and fuck with insurances and just did, they could, they navigate my dad through the healthcare system better than anybody. So he got, he was the first person to get experimental surgeries where they, they actually cut everything out. He like, he's in medical magazines. What kind of sickness? He is cancer everywhere in his entire body. Like in his skeleton, in his blood, his colon, in his skin and just everywhere. Loaded up. Where did it start? Started in his prostate. And I think he had a web of skin cancer as well because he was too proud to get anything looked at and just developed over time. So they cut it all out. Spent 79 days in the hospital and got 35 surgeries in those 79 days. Holy shit. Well, this is, you know, what you're saying is, they're saying this is like the future of cancer is that you're in the same way that AIDS used to be this death sentence. HIV used to be a death sentence in cancer. It still is a death sentence, depending on the type you have. But they're saying as these treatments progress, it's a treatable, it's going to become a cancer. You're going to be able to manage it a little bit more. He got all of his platelets to cancer, causing cells spun out. His blood was immediately sent to Houston and sent back and put back in him. And he was done twice. And he was the only person in the world ever to get that done twice. Wow. And then, you know, because of some connections, we were able to sneak a blood transfusion here and there, which is a big no-no. And he came back from that. He's been eating weed a little bit. Like, he's game for trying whatever. But back to the religion thing, what he was telling me, when anything good would happen with stand-up or writing or anything like that, he would go, well, you know, this is happening because I prayed. And I go, eh, I got a lot of, the tremendous amount of hard work has gone into this. That's kind of like, I can bet you we could put aside, you know, I put my kids through Catholic school. My son's going to Loyola next year, which is fantastic. That's like a big Jesuit Catholic boys high school, that's pretty much the same thing that I went to in San Francisco. And I definitely believe in that community and being surrounded by good, positive people. But in terms of we prayed and made this happen, yeah, that's where you start to lose me. A lot of people get annoyed by that. Yeah, a lot of people, you know, they, like, I saw some hilarious cartoon where it's like a doctor with a sad look on his face as the patient is like, God saved me and the doctor, you know, clearly, no, we saved you, but then, you know, maybe, who knows? It's a mysterious thing. Do you pray? No, no, I definitely, so I'm driving by an accident. I tell the kids, there's a lot of ambulances and we do a car overturned. I tell the kids, okay, everybody, let's go close, you know, they close your eyes and think something positive and hope everybody's okay. That's cool. And then, that's as close as I kind of pray. In terms of, I do wish people well as much as possible and we don't go to church that much. My son's an altar boy and possibly the worst altar boy. How are you a bad altar boy? He doesn't want to be there so much that, so he'll be on the altar and with the priest standing there and he'll go. And everyone will be watching and my friends or all these moms will look at us and just start cracking up because they know that we know he's the worst and at one point, he loves basketball. At one point, he started daydreaming about dribbling and crossover dribbling and just started like pretending he was dribbling fake basketball and then he'll lean. You're supposed to like stand up straight with your arms skippable, you know, like the pair to dance and then he would just lean on stuff. It's torture. And he's tortured by it. I was an altar boy in the Episcopal Church and it was fucked. It was fucked, man. Because like, it's like bad enough to have to go to a church service. I mean, it's bad. If you're a kid, you're going to church on a Sunday. You know that outside is infinite freedom. There's all these wonderful things you could be doing. Yeah, here you are in this dank, incense filled- Sunday, it's the best day. The best day. And you're in a doom room and you're like surrounded by people talking in another language. And if they are talking in your language, you don't understand what they're saying because it's usually some archaic version of that. The monotonous chance, the weird outfit, like you're contorted into some terrible position. It's a mess, man. It really isn't. I think that this is the problem with modern religion is that it has somehow managed to transform what is theoretically supposed to be the most insanely psychedelic and beautiful thing, a connection, a ritualistic connection with the transcendent into the most mundane, boring, orthodox shit. And if that's not Satanism, I don't know what is. It's crazy. I really love the community of it all. I think I like people getting together and being positive. But other than that, it really never felt any connection to it as a little kid. I was never an altar boy. But as a little kid, when I'd go to church, I sort of got why we'd always gone. I lived a block away from St. Ann's in San Francisco. We'd walk there every single Sunday. And I'd go by myself because they just told me to go. Yeah, that's cool. I would just sit there and it was just took time. It was just an hour lost for me. But then after a while, with my kids, I'm like, okay, I'm trying to explain this. Again, it's like telling my daughter to study math because I was always horrible at it. And it's like, I was never good at this, but I can't get mad at her when she has a hard time with it. And same thing with church. It's like, they hate it. And all I do is say, look, we don't go there very often. When we do, when we have to, just sit here and think positive thoughts, and then we're gonna walk away. That's the story of religion these days. You know that theoretically, early Christianity and Judaism used to have cannabis as a part of it. So when you hear about anointed his head with oil, when you hear about like incense burning, when you hear about the burning bush, for example, which was an acacia bush that the acacia bush is just filled with DMT, which is one of the most psychedelic. Oh yeah, so basically this is the one, a theory about religion is, we exist in a prohibition on psychedelics and people these days don't wanna talk about it, but it used to be if you went to church. And DMT is the God drug, right? Yeah, that's what they call it. The spirit molecule, it's an endogenous chemical that is apparently in your pineal gland. A lot of great data out there you could look at, but it's the thing that people who do it all seem to have similar kind of experiences where they are contacted by entities or there's some, they're just insane. But you know, this was the way back in the thousands of years ago, it was a different time, you know? People didn't have, there wasn't a taboo associated with taking hallucinogens in the same way that it is now, but it kinda makes sense that visions of God and contact with angels isn't gonna happen if you're just stone cold sober sitting in your desert hut. But if you happen to have managed to obtain some kind of psychoactive chemical that's floating around that the priests are using, then suddenly this church service that right now is, to me, modern church is like going to a campfire and sitting around a pile of sticks that you haven't lit and pretending that you're warming your hands. That's what modern church is. It's like we're all pretending that we're having this experience. Whereas theoretically and back in the day, those urns that they're walking by filled with incense were filled with hashish, smoke just billowing out that the priests, everyone's just stoned out of their fucking minds and people are saying these incantations to some divine being while everyone's just tripping. That's what church used to be. And that's a church that a kid could really enjoy. We'd all go back to church. Yeah, we would. We would. Well, you still can get stoned and go to church. Highly recommend it. Do you smoke marijuana? I eat it. Me too. I can't smoke anything. I took a hit off a joint on December 6th at a Christmas party and just wore that it would be the last time I ever smoked anything. Why? Because my throat was sore for maybe three weeks. And I used to smoke cigarettes and I tried just to get off of my chew a lot of toothpicks but I was trying to smoke the vape thing, blue, those things when they came out. Those are horrible and I can't. So now I'm not smoking anything and then I'll just eat it occasionally. And I think people put a lot of trust in those vape companies, man. Oh, Dan Soder. You know comedian Dan Soder? I've heard of him. Oh, yeah. I'm not touching you. He's a big smoker and then I was trying to go like, just transition with these things. Fuck your Chinese water vapor. Whatever the fuck is in that thing. I got sinus infections twice from smoking those things. Well, we just don't know. I mean, the problem is it's like, this is an unknown thing. But they do say there's a lot less carcinogens in it but the problem is you're dealing with a combustion temperature. So apparently some of the stuff in those vape pens, if it's not, if the temperature is just a little too high, it's producing all kinds of fucked up carcinogenic byproducts. I got this sweet, horrible pain and sensation in my lungs a little bit and just decided I was just who knows what's fucking in these. I gotta be done. I read that it's actually that people, and this could be wrong, but I read that they're finding out that it seems to be suppressed the immune system. It's just inhaling anything in your poor goddamn lungs. Give him a fucking break, man. Which is what, but edible marijuana is so fantastic. It's the best. I love those little Kiva bites and the Kiva chocolates. There's terabytes, Kiva, the Kiva people are doing great things. And also I'm the biggest lightweight ever. When I first got my pot card, I went and me and, you know that death squad show that they do at the ice house? Well that was initially the ice house Chronicles or whatever that was. I found Red Band that space and then introduced him over there because it was me and Ari who were supposed to take over that second room before we moved to New York a long time ago. And we both looked at each other and this is like show two. We're like, we can't do this. What are we doing? Like we fuck this. And so I go, Red Band, let's get him on it. And so helped negotiate his rent, moved him over there and then I was sitting with Ari on like the very first one of those shows. I got my pot ID and I got a piece of blueberry cake and I found this way so it was just, and I split it in half and I go, take half and I'll take half. And he goes, okay, he didn't feel a thing. And I was standing on my couch like going, what is happening? And I go, that cake was fucking crazy, huh? And nothing. Ari? Zero. Ari, yeah, because Ari has an insane tolerance because the guy's constantly consuming weed, I think. Yeah, you know, I think one, I don't know how many people know this about you Al, but you are the comedian where if you're thinking about buying a house that people contact. Brennan Walsh, I'm the comedy name dropper, but Brennan Walsh said that if you call Al and you want him to return your call as soon as possible, tell him you're gonna buy a car. Yes. And I know everything about- Yeah, you know, you are- Car purchasing. Car purchasing. Homes. Homes, yard work. Yard work, yeah. So you're, but I don't think people realize how in the comedy community it's interesting how there are people, like in my mind, you probably aren't even aware of this, but in my mind, I have already made the decision when it comes time for me to decide to buy a house. You're the first person I'm gonna call. You should go check it out. Yeah. I guess I'm, I've done it twice. I feel like I'm in the house that I'll live in for the rest of my life. And before I move to, there'll be this one, and then I probably hopefully will keep this. My idea is that I wanna pay it off as soon as possible and be done with any sort of payment and just pay taxes on it. So that's my next goal in like the next three years I will pay off my house completely and not owe a dime. But you, I just wanna say you fly in the face of the stereotypical comedian in the sense that a lot of comedians, there's comedians, when you think about them as a personality type, generally you don't think, these are very organized people who are good at the minutiae of life. A lot of us procrastinate, put shit off. I do that, but I also with kids really fucking makes you. It's the kids. I feel like that. And I had this, you know, business background where I was the operations manager prior to, I just don't wanna fuck up. I left a family business where I could have taken this thing over and made a lot of money. And then I left it all to go and do stand up. What courage, what insane courage to do that. I got cast to a TV show right away. So it wasn't that. But still, you were already moving in that direction. I mean, yes, getting cast in a TV show. Which TV show? It was called The Ortegas. It was with Cheech, played my dad. And that was my first lunch, or first summer in 2003. I just was me and Cheech sitting at Hugo's on San Juan. But you had a kid after this. Oh no, I had a kid when I came down to. So that's the point. So it's not like you just got, it's not like you're like, you know what, mom, I'm gonna try stand up. And then you were on the phone with Cheech and got a TV show. It's like you had a child, you were already doing comedy and you moved to Los Angeles with a child as a comedian to try to make it in show business. Yeah, it was scary. So don't de-emphasize that, man. That is madness. That is madness. But I, and also, I think it was like, how much do we need? And I've always had this idea is like, and how famous do you wanna be? Like I always just won't really wanted to make a living doing stand up on my own terms, acting on my own. Like I love acting. I think it's, I'd love to do more of it. And just make a fine living. I don't need all the money and I don't need any of the notoriety and it's like I'm really not very good at promoting myself or anything like that. But just wanna just make a, you know, living being creative and to pay for the kids and. And you're pulling that off. I mean, you're. Yeah, but just not work as much as you have to. And I was telling you the other night when I didn't have anything going on. Cause I'm on a TV show that starts in July. What's that show? That's cool. I'm dying up here. Oh, right. I'm dying up here. And I technically don't have to work until July. That's so incredible. Now I'm dying up here is really interesting because this is Jim Carrey's. Jim Carrey's producing is a book about the strike. Steve LeBatkin. Yep. The guy who committed suicide off the Hyatt. But this is sort of the story of like early comedy store days. And which part did you end up getting? I got, I'm Edgar. Edgar Martinez. I was on acid during the, we find out the guy's dead. And then I just started giggling. And I took two hits of bladder acid the night before. I didn't know he was gonna fucking die. And like, so I'm just cracking up. Wow, cool. During the whole thing. I do stand up. They had me, Santino, Andrew Santino, and Don Marrera did these stand up chunks. So I got to write and just pull. I think it was just up on stage riffing and fucking around with the audience a little bit. But then did a joke that I never do. And there was timeless. And then got to do that. Cause it's supposed to be 1972, I believe. Yeah, that's right. And I was just up on stage fucking around. Then I'll be in it as a series regular, but it's a, it's all like the underbelly, but John Daly is in it. Andrew Santino, Eric Griffin, this guy, Clark Duke, and then Melissa Leo, Alfred Molina, Robert Forrester, Kathy Moriarty, Sebastian Stan. Like it's just, it's really, it's gonna be a good one. So that's cool. So now, but before we get into that, I just, I wanna talk about a little, just a little bit about you have a child. Yeah, too. And at the time, or you do, no, when this, when you were transitioning to stand-up comedy, at what point did you quit your job and head into the great unknown as a comedian? Well, I went to Montreal as a new face. From San Francisco? Yes. Okay. And then I would go down to LA and I started taking meetings and I would go down and my dad, which then mom were just yelling at me the entire time. So they would go, where are you right now? And I go, well, I'm gonna audition tonight at the Emperor for my own show. And then tomorrow I do this show with Janine Garofalo. And go, who the fuck is Janine Garofalo? And I go, she's a comedian. She's famous. And you just say, well, I don't know who the fuck she is. And then I go, well, and then tomorrow I meet with UPN. And then I have an audition for Curb Your Enthusiasm and he goes, nothing, zero response on the phone. And I go, what's after the Sopranos? And he goes, you're gonna be on the Sopranos? And I go, no, I'm not gonna be on the Sopranos. I go, I'm just, this is good stuff. And he goes, well, I gotta change the locks tomorrow and I don't know who you think is gonna fuck and be there. And so they would, they were until gone on TV. So then I got cast in this pilot. It was me and Freddie Soto, who I ended up, I was already good friends with. Me, Freddie Soto, and Carlos Oscar is the last three guys. It was a nationwide search for a Latino comedian. We make the pilot and I go back to work the very next day. So you go from, Al Madrigal is walking, we got Al Madrigal, Al is walking. And because I was like number one on the call sheet. And then I am, oh, you can turn now. I was number one on the call sheet. And then I went back to like firing people the next day. And then it got picked up. It got picked up, I moved the whole family down and no one ever saw it because they made six episodes and nothing aired. I bought a car for cash, I bought a Volkswagen Passat for cash, $22,000. I wrote a check for $22,000. And then that next day we sat in the stands and they said they've cut our order for 12. We now are just gonna make these six episodes and today is our last day, everybody. So now I'm just left in LA but I'm not going back and got cast in another pilot and then after that. And so that's probably, I mean, we were talking about it just before we started recording, but I've probably known you just as long as I've known anybody down here because I was introduced to you and Sam Tripoli and Jason Tebow through Brian Jarvis who introduced me to my wife. Crazy, that's nuts, man. So, okay, so you have had an amazing run out here, it sounds like. Well, yeah, just the Daily Show helped stand up a ton and Daily Show helped me get cast and stuff, but I've already been cast and acting and sitcoms and pilots and everything. So it's like I've been on like nine network pilots. Nine. And four have gotten picked up to series and that people don't even know me and these shows. But About a Boy went for two years. I was in a show called Free Agents with Natasha. Yeah, yeah. And that five episodes maybe? I don't know. Did, I guess. And then I was in a show with Rock Hill Welch and Jeffrey Tambor called Welcome to the Captain. I was in Geary and Married with Jay Moore. That was a season. And then I was in, you know, all these things and deals and stuff like that, leading up written the Al Madrigal show four times. My pilot that never gets made. What time do you wake up in the morning? I wake up with the kids at 6.30 every morning, pretty much six, six, 37. What's the schedule look like for you? I mean, this, it's, I was writing, I sold three TV shows last summer. Then you have a podcast network. We started all things comedy with Bill Burr. So you have a podcast network, you're writing shows, you're acting and you- And people made fun of me at the Daily Show nonstop because it was, they called me ABS. What's that? Always be scheming. And they, they would all crack up because I would take and make these shows. I got my- Your ambition. It's your ambition. I'm shriveling over here. When I hear about this, I think, oh my God, you are such a warrior, such a hard worker. Whereas for me, that kind of like hard core, never ending super production, it seems, I don't want to say terrifying, but it makes me think of church. It makes me think of like squirming around as an altar boy. I would go nuts now. But it's all looking at all the stuff. It's all fun. I'm making a game called Ding Long with my good, good friends. It was a game, a card game I played in college. I'll show it to you on my phone afterwards. I'm making it. It's like Chinese zodiac characters playing cards in an underground Chinese card room. And it's this Chinese climbing game that we played in college. So I'm making that. I started the Latino comedy festival. And so there's, because Saturday Night Live has had no Latino cast members. And Fred Armisen was amazing and Horatio Sands obviously, but since then, which has been a long time, they haven't had anybody. So it's a struggle to find Latino talent. And so I bought that a long time ago and own that LatinoComedyFestival.com. And so then found a partner just recently to start that as a TV show and a festival and sort of figure out who the next Latino comedians are. Because at this point, it's like George Lopez and Gabriel Glacius and that's pretty much it. Like there's nobody, Cristella, me, Felipe. And then it severely drops off. So I was trying to help do that. And it's just, why not? I figure, all before I'm 50, and then the whole goal, and since the very beginning, is not having to work, wanting to work, but not having to work over the age of 50 or 55. Now, it seems like you're somebody who loves to work. So, right? Like today, I felt like I was just working around the house and I felt good about that. Right. But do you think, I know a few super ambitious comedians who are of your tribe who work like you do. And I always think, I don't know that you'll ever be able to stop. Like I think the dream of some, See, that's where I'm different. I think like, so super ambitious, but take a look at my Twitter or Instagram feed. And I think those guys are all super ambitious, like self-promoting themselves and doing that and working. And it's not that. So I don't really care about, I'd like to put out another comedy, you know, a couple more comedy specials. Yes. All my own, I don't care where they go. And then just travel around and do stand-up. I like the travel that goes with it. And then I'd like to travel as much as I possibly can. But I just want to see how much you can sort of get done and then stop. You don't strike, you don't seem like, you know, for someone who's working so hard. I'm not working that hard. I feel like I'm not trying as hard, nearly as hard as I could be. Really? So what would, okay. So tell me if you were at like, if all engines were firing. I don't have an assistant. I would hire an assistant full-time. An assistant would meet me at my house every single morning at 8 a.m. I've thought all this through. 8 a.m. We'd start at 8. 8? Well, I'd go to the gym early. Five, six? I think you got to go to the gym. Have you ever gone to the gym at 6 a.m. or anything like that? It's been a long time, Al. If I ever did that, it's been a long, long time. All the cars are very nice. And so I'd go to the gym early and then I would meet and we'd get to work and I would just start cranking shit out. And then I would have somebody help me handle my schedule and we'd write and I'd have like this. What would you write? Oh, I would, I have, in addition to all that other shit, I have at least, I could tell you, I should have spent 20 show ideas and treatments and just ready to go. So you'd work on treatments? I would write those shows. I would write them. A movie with Kevin Christie. We just finished a movie and I want to get that out there. How many hours would you work? I would work like six hours a day. Six hours. And that would be done and maybe hanging out and just enjoying the rest of the day. At three or so? Yeah, done at three. Then your kids? It's the War of Art by Steven Pressfield and it says it's the work nine to three. Wow. You know, Rogan had those books around forever. Yeah, I've got that book, yeah. I love that book. Jarvis introduced me to that book and then ever since then, I've seen a bunch of people with it. But I'm a really big fan. Like once you follow your bliss and you're doing what you really love and like we're making comedy, like I was talking to Tripoli and those guys about, I'm working on a game show with Sam Tripoli called Squabble where it's two different types playing Family Feud. We're doing this for Comedy Central Digital to Start but it's like Black Nerds versus Canadians and it's trivia and it's real prizes. So we're looking into game show laws right now and just making stuff, it's fun. Now, a lot of people listening are not, including me, are not as high functioning as you are out. A lot of us, I'm not speaking for you guys out there, maybe some of you out there doing, this is like, I feel like I'm with the guy from Wall Street. What's his name? Gordon Gekko. Gordon Gekko. Last night, I watched Better Call Saul with my wife and drank wine and helped my daughter with an art project. Listen, Matt, I think it's beautiful. I think it's incredible. I think what's, we need people doing what you're doing because it raises the bar and it's exciting. But what, so like- But I'm not working at stand-up as hard as I could be. I'm not doing that. I mean, I have two sets tonight. Is this part of your mind that's telling you you should have an 8 a.m. assistant and that you should be working more? How big a part of your mind is this? I know that's what I need to do to, if I really wanted to accomplish all the stuff that I want to, it's like I really need to start turning it up a little bit in the back of my mind. It's like, I feel like we all have this subconscious that's telling us the right and wrong thing to do. And the right and the path has been laid out and you need to, you're getting told the right ways to go on a regular basis and whether or not you choose to follow the right way is, there's like a path. This was all a game. I don't know why we're here, what the fuck we're doing, but why not try to fucking get the house in Hawaii? Why not? Like, why not try to go for that? It seems like it just, I'm looking at the picture of Barack Obama behind you, I don't know why. I'm looking at a joint. Yeah, it's- With a mushroom cloud rising up behind him. Why don't you go for the Hawaii joint house? Why are you not like a pot farmer on the Big Island? Well, I never thought of it personally. That's a great idea. Can you grow pot on the Big Island? I guess you can. You can grow anything. I was thinking, Hilo is one of the most amazing farmers market I've ever seen. It's like Santa Cruz over there. So anyway, so that's the whole plan. It's like, why not try to, we should all be trying more. And then, I'm curious as to whether or not like, but should I be ambitious? Should I, why don't I just work in the post office? Right. You're asking me that? Yeah, why don't I just work in the post office? I was talking to, I had this conversation with Marin a long, long, long, long time ago. And he goes, why don't I just bake? What if we baked? Would we get the same satisfaction? Well, this is the question, right? This is the big question. So you have this life, then you have a certain amount of daylight that you can move around on the earth without artificial light. And you have to fill that up with some kind of activity. And so whatever that activity is, it's, you just, it just depends. Like what you're doing, when I hear about it, it sounds really great, but I don't think I would want it. I'm, you know, like my life, I've got this podcast, I do. I do stand up, I've got a tour coming up. You go out on the road, you're on a bus tour with cool people, hopefully cool people. But this, when I think about the idea of like producing a show, when I think about the idea of like going through the entire process of creating a show, like you're even. The podcast network, All Things Comedy is a gigantic pain in my ass. I was sending Gareth Reynolds' new artwork to him this morning and approving artwork, and I had it revised because I hated the other stuff. And I couldn't believe that it took so long to get it done. I didn't get an email, and I was aggravated that I hadn't gotten his email, and I called somebody up to say, what the fuck? That, yes, email. No, I know exactly what you're talking about. See, that's scary to me. The end result is that All Things Comedy is a cooperative setup, so all the comics profit share. We should all have, I talked to you about this a long time ago, and you were one of the first people that I talked to you about this, but when it was an idea. So I put on 10 podcasts, and it was Harlan Williams, Tom Segura, Your Mom's House, it was Ari, me, Bill Burr, and we just built this thing. Now we have 60, and the idea is that we were gonna run Farrell is fantastic, and we've always had this kinship, but with All Things Comedy, I have way more of a business plan, and we want to be a big, multi-channel network for professional comedians, and we want to distribute comedy, and then what I wanna do is I wanna get each comic to look at a check, and go holy shit. That's cool. And we were gonna all own this company, like Ari in particular has a tremendous stake in this, and Tom Segura the same thing, Davey Anthony has the Don Lump with Gareth Reynolds, and like so. So cool. But anyway, I just want, we can build something, and I just say no one else was doing it, and why not do it? Listen man, there are people listening right now who have tricked themselves into maybe not being as productive as they could be. So talk to them, what do we do? Those of us who wanna be ambitious, so let's figure out what do you wanna do? It's like so I was working in this job, and I was making money, you're all working and you're making money somehow. But what do you, until I became my own sole proprietor, I'm the owner of my own business, which is a production company that leases me out to do all kinds of shit. But when I saw my mom go from $6 an hour to owning this company, and how successful, and sure she was taking on a lot of people's stress, and she was stressed out, but a woman who was cleaning other people's houses now has seven houses, and she has a place in Mexico where she goes and she plays cards, and she does it, so I know right now, it was a tremendous amount of stress getting there, but the end result is living in paradise. I should do pictures like my backyard, I feel like I can't have an unhappy day in my house. Sure, Al, okay, but you're on, listen, I'm speaking for them, you're on TV, man, and you're this talented comedian, listen, I'm making minimum wage right now, I can barely afford to get groceries, I've got a kid, and there's no fucking way I can start my own business. I think it's gotta be everybody, but everybody has an idea, and everybody has something that they know will truly make them happy, and if it's music or whatever it is, and I've always, see there's, when people have a midlife crisis, it's because they have regret, and now they're 50, 60, and they're in this relationship, and they've gone to this shit job, nine to five, and then they've looked up and gone, what the fuck did I do? I hate this woman, I hate this man, and I hate my job, and I need to buy a convertible, and I need to move to fucking Toledo, whatever, and get out of where I am, so how do you avoid that happening? Well, you have these instincts that you need to listen to, and it's the whole Joseph Campbell following your bliss, and when you do follow your bliss or whatever that is, if it's owning a plumbing supply company, like the example that they use in the War of Art, which is something I'd encourage you to pick up immediately, everyone should own this, and do your work, all great things will happen, and you just listen to that muse, and you'll be fine. But what about, everything he said's great. So I'm doing that, and this is what's happening. But now, what about the 50-year-old who's listening? What about- You can still do that, it's not too late, it's not too late at all, because I think we should all be vacationing, I think we can't sweat the small stuff. I used to get, I had this joke that caught me in a little bit of trouble recently, because that's the other thing is I'm pretty outspoken with telling people to fuck off on a regular basis, and I get myself in trouble on all the time. But I'm mad at that, I run hot, and if I feel like I was wronged in any way, or if there's any, like I was at coffee yesterday in Eagle Rock, and this woman came in and swooped in, and I had my coffee, and I was meeting with this other guy, and we went for the one table, and then this woman came in and took our table, and never got a drink. Oh, Jesus. The entire time. Just sat there, and never got a drink. And it drove me fucking nuts. And I was close to saying something, but I bit my tongue, and I wasn't gonna say it, because I'm really trying not to run as hot as I do, and confront people as much, but I think it's don't sweat the small stuff, and just be kind. I tell my kids, try hard and be nice. That's it, that's all I care about. It's so simple. Try hard and be nice, takes care of everything. So that's what I'm trying to do with myself, is try hard, be kind, and that's it. I don't give a shit about anything beyond that. But trying hard for me is suppressing, I mean, I like to drink, and I can't. I have so much, because of stand-up, I have so much edible weed in my house, I don't know what to do with it, and I could eat that every single day, and not do anything. I read, I read, I'm addicted to Jack Reacher. No way. So, I love him. You're a true dad. Yeah, and I garden, and I read it, so I'll go in my backyard. I was telling you what I was gonna do, I had three hours, I was gonna cut that hedge, and I think I said, did I send you a picture of the hedge? I was gonna trim, so I got on a ladder, and satisfaction I get from that, but I just want to work, work, work, and retire, and then go camping, and travel, and do shit like that, and then spend time, and walk dogs, and old man out. To old man out, but how cool to old man out after such a long stretch of hard work? But we gotta be able to afford to old man out, and we gotta be able to afford the lifestyle that we know exists, or do you? I mean, that's the other thing, is I could wrap everything up here, move to North Carolina, move to, what I've thought about, like the outskirts of Raleigh, Charlotte, somewhere over there, and just move, I could go to Montana. The question is this, it truly is just a decision. I have, there's someone I email with who listens to this podcast, and he has a family, and they made the decision to move into a van, and live in a van, and travel around the country, and do it right now. They didn't put it off. They're like, we're gonna do it right now, with what we have, we're not gonna wait for some moment in the future, because the, and I don't think, when I hear you talk about your work, it doesn't feel to me, as though the sole reason that you're doing this is because of some future happiness. Oh, I really enjoy what I'm doing. You love it. But some people, they're the big leap that they've taken, is just a decision to throw themselves into the moment, to not have some future retirement plan, to not think about that, but just to be here, and live in this place, with as little as they have. And I think that that is, it's- No, it could be homeless, though. I mean, you could, also, it's like, I like showers, wine, and this yard, and I like to be able to afford stuff. When you travel, you like to be able to stay in a nicer room, or go to nicer places. But again, as a kid, I'd never gotten on an airplane until I was 17 years old, and we would drive in a Volkswagen Bug to Merced, from San Francisco, and then we'd go, and we'd go to Yosemite on day trips. My dad would put a blender in a box, and we'd stay at a motel, six in Merced. Wow. It was just the best time I've ever had. And so, with the kids, when we're going on vacation, we're gonna go to San Diego, Laguna Beach. We will go to Hawaii, but I'm realizing also, my kids are happy with a pool, anywhere. And so we were doing staycations. We'd go to the, if you're ever in Pasadena, the Langham Hotel. Love it. And we'd do that, we'd check ourselves in there for two days, it was $99 a night on Priceline, and my kids had the best time ever. And so just doing stuff like that more often. But yeah, if you can afford to do it. I mean, we met some guy when we first moved down here, who we were, somebody goes, what are you doing? And I said, I'm a comedian, and I go in yourself, and he goes, nothing. That's cool. And I said, what happened? He goes, dude, my wife is super rich. And he goes, my wife got it as a trust fund kid, and she got 150 million bucks. Wow. And she goes, I could pretend to work, because I'm a lawyer, I hate it. I play golf every day. I play golf every day. I hang out with my kids. Well, you know, man, I gotta tell you, I prefer your version, man. I think that it's cool what you're saying, because what I'm getting out of this is you can always try harder. You can always do better. You can always put a little bit more energy in the direction. And I guess the real question is, why wouldn't you do, I think the great Zen Cohen that you've given me today is why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you? Let's just go for it and see what happens. I mean, there's so much stuff in terms of being able to travel and actually achieve something. Like if I can build these two companies and this gaming company into something that's significant and leave my mark, and also with the Latino Comedy Festival, I really feel like it's gonna do a great job. I mean, do a great thing, because this community is so underserved and these guys don't know what they're fucking doing. Maybe I'm gonna try to get two podcasts out this week. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Al, thank you so much for coming on the show. I used to do this and I don't do it as much now, but I think I really wanna do it, because this is an inspiring conversation. If you could give any advice, general life transforming advice to the folks listening right now, and it's important because you're an example of what happens if you work hard, what would that advice be? So I'm gonna tell you what I tell my kids, to try hard and be nice, but then do what you want to be doing, start figuring out what your business is and start it as soon as you possibly can, because you'll see how things unfold and it'll change your life. I walked away from something and when I started doing comedy, which is always what I wanted to do, everything just opened up and I can't believe, I'm in the situations that I'm in and the people I'm hanging out with, comedians that I looked up to so much, it's incredible. So yeah, follow your bliss, whatever that is, and everything will fall into place. You heard it here, friends, follow your bliss and follow Al Madrigal on Twitter. How can people get in touch with you? It's at Al Madrigal. You know, go to all things comedy, we're trying to build that up and there's a lot of great shows that you might like and a lot of world friends and so yeah, check that out. But yeah, I'm dying up here in show time, that's gonna be a great show. I'll show you pictures of what I look like, right? No, camera. I'll wait till you see them. Yeah, we'll use that as the picture for the podcast. Okay. Okay, cool, Al, thank you very much, man. It's been a real pleasure. Later. Thanks for listening, everybody. That was Al Madrigal.

61^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Daniele Bolelli Transcript and Discussion^2017-09-09^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Welcome everyone, you are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. If you listen closely in the background, you can hear my neighbor's dog screaming. Do you hear that? That's the least appealing bark I've ever heard in my life, the poor thing. That's the bark that you hear as your oarsman is carrying you across the river sticks into hell. The dog sounds like it just read the Necronomicon. Christ. This is why I wish that we had some kind of dog to English translator, because I'd love to know what is troubling it. Aside from the fact that it has been stolen by monkey descendants and chained in a cold yard for the entirety of its existence. This is a great podcast today. It's with my dear friend, Daniela Bielelly. We're gonna get right to it. First, some quick business. The Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Shore Design T-shirts. My God, these shirts are so fucking soft. One of the saddest things you'll ever hear is that when JFK was initially assassinated and his brains went splattering all over Jackie Kennedy, the first thought that came into her mind was they're so soft and warm. And then she thought, oh my God, this is definitely the worst day of my life and went a little crazy. That's the feeling you get when you wear a Shore Design T-shirt. This doesn't seem like a great selling point for these shirts. This might be the worst Shore Design T-shirt commercial I've ever done. I'm gonna try it again. I was in New Orleans. My brains are mush right now. My brain is a quicksand pit filled with the rotting corpses of Boy Scouts right now. And apparently it's very dark in there because all of this sounds so dark. I've gotta lighten up the mood. This is a great podcast with Daniela Bielelly. Just wade through this sticky, swampy ooze that's coming out of me right now and I swear to God, it's not gonna be this kind of whatever this is. I feel great. I don't know why I sound depressed. I feel pretty good. Helicopter. I feel like I live in fucking Vietnam. Do you hear that? Not Vietnam the country, but Vietnam the war. Helicopters screaming dogs. Unidentified weird tentacly shadows floating over my neighbor's roof. The Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Shore Design T-shirts. Shore Design T-shirts creates some of the softest shirts in the business. It's as though you have not just shaved off Santa's beard, but as those Santa's beard got caught in one of his elf's machines and was torn off along with the very top layer of his facial skin. That's how soft these shirts are. It's not just the softness of Santa's beard, it's the softness of that very thin bit of skin that exists right above Santa's nerves. Santa would be an agonizing pain after this accident, but whatever lucky elf got to wear that wonderful shirt made of his beard and skin flesh, that elf would feel pretty great. Go to ShureDesignT-shirts.com if you put my name and you will get 10% off of these beautiful shirts. They've got amazing designs. They are incredibly soft and they are made by one of the coolest people on earth, Bennett, a man who was not afraid to kill the father of Christmas, skin and cremate him so that you can wear a comfortable shirt when you're sweating out those toxins at your beaker yoga sessions. So go to ShureDesignT-shirts.com and pick up one of these wonderful shirts. We're also brought to you by Amazon.com. Now Amazon does this, I'm not sure why they do it. I know I've said this before, but they do a thing where if you go through our Amazon portal, which is located at DuncanTrussell.com and buy anything from Amazon, they give us a small percentage of whatever you bought. Oh, the things I've bought from Amazon. Just this last week, Japanese bondage ropes and a Batman outfit for my dog. So there's a lot of great things you can get at Amazon.com and before you do it, please go to DuncanTrussell.com and go through our portal. Cost you nothing. They mysteriously will give us a small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. As soon as whoever runs Amazon comes out of the alcoholic blackout that made them think that was a good idea, this thing will end. But while it is still happening, you can support the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast while supporting yourself. And they've got everything that you need. Everything that you need. Except for the bondage ropes you put under your bed. We're also brought to you by Audible. Audible sells some of the greatest audio books in the world. And I'm currently listening to a Pima Children audio book that is blowing my mind. And that audio book is called Awakening Love. And if you sign up for a trial membership at Audible, you will get this book for free. It's 36 hours. And it's one of the, it is the greatest breakdown of Buddhism that I've ever listened to. Pima Children, might be mispronouncing your name, has a really amazing way of articulating some really complex ideas. And it's very subtle and you don't realize that really what's happening until a few hours later, you realize she's like revealed something that you've wondered about for a long time, but it can never figure out. God, man, I sound dumb right now. Well, it's called Awakening Love, Pima Children. And you get the book for free if you go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership. And I couldn't recommend this more. I mean, I guess I could, but it would sound weird probably to recommend it more. See, man, you shouldn't drink. That's what you can take away from this, what you're hearing right now. You shouldn't drink for five days straight. Finally, if you wanna support the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast, you can go to our shop. We just got, we're getting new logo t-shirts in, those sold out. We have a bunch of other shirts, posters, stickers. We're gonna be getting some new merchandise in soon. I just haven't figured out what that is yet. Oh, and you can also of course donate to the podcast if you really feel like going nuts. Oh yes, this is what I was trying to remember. Also, I released a special bonus episode, a Halloween episode. It's two bucks, you can get it on iTunes. You can also get it through the website. You don't just have to listen to this episode because it's Halloween, but it was made more for Halloween. But it's pretty great because my dear friend, the pickup artist Snake shows up. Alpha Duncan, which is the version of me with way too much testosterone, shows up. I read my favorite Edgar Allen Poe story and there's much, much more. I think it might have infuriated some people because it's satanic, the whole episode's satanic. Cause it's Halloween, you know, fuck. What's scarier than Satan? I figured I'd be scary and put some satanic stuff in. So if you're offended by that stuff, don't listen. The Thanksgiving bonus episode, I think it's gonna won't be a satanic, maybe just a little satanic, but that's there for you too. And it's a way for you to support the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. So thank you. Those of you who bought the bonus episode, those of you who've been donating, those of you who've bought shirts, those of you who support short design t-shirts or go through the Amazon portal. And to those of you who just listen or go on the message board and those of you who send me awesome emails, forgive me if I haven't responded to you. I read all of them though, and they always make me feel really good. And to those of you who have sent me angry emails, whoever you may be, I don't know what to say. I hope that your brain turns into a snake and choose your heart out. See, gotta quit drinking. I had stopped drinking because I was on a diet and I felt great. But when you go to New Orleans, you have to drink. It's just a rule. If you don't drink in New Orleans, then you can't really see the angels that live in New Orleans. All you'll see is giant pools of vomit and roaches crawling through your food. But if you drink in New Orleans, then suddenly it becomes a magical wonderland filled with dirty strippers and voodoo priestesses. It's a wonderful place. Well, it's actually one of my favorite cities. Today's guest on the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is a philosopher, a teacher, an author. He has his own podcast, The Drunken Taoist. It's located at the drunkendawist.com. Of course, Taoist is spelled with a T. All the links to his books, his Twitter, and his podcast will be located at dunkintrussell.com in the comments section of this podcast. Now, everyone, please embrace and love this wonderful human being and thank the great eternal Godhead for geysering out the spray of particulates that eventually coalesced into a planet that eventually coalesced into amoeba-like primordial ooze, which eventually coalesced into symbiotic relationships with other oozing primitive sludge-like beings which eventually transformed into ancient, sharp-toothed beaver creatures living at the edge of time which eventually transformed into the dinosaurs, which eventually transformed into oil, which eventually transformed into plastic, and eventually transformed into the recording device given to me by the wonderful Dr. Chris Ryan, and eventually transformed also into a Daniella Bollelli who eventually came on this podcast again. So whatever I just said, do that. And Hare Krishna, everyone, here is Daniella Bollelli.

idea of the genesis of today's episode, I was peacefully sleeping in my bed and I heard this cavernous deep voice yelling at me Daniela, I'm like what the fuck you know who's there what you know I'm half asleep I'm all out of it and they're like Daniela you need to record a podcast with Duncan like who the fuck are you again you know who's talking to me and he's like I'm the universe man capital you and everything you motherfucker just get with the program I'm gonna implode unless you have another podcast with Duncan because it's been way way too long so get on with it way too long thank you universe for making that happen you know it did it is funny that you emailed me saying the universe it compelled you to want to do a podcast with me because I was thinking to myself how I didn't have a podcast to put out this week and because I was in New Orleans and I was feeling quite like a like a piece of shit for not doing that so this is awesome the way that worked out I'm glad you're I'm glad that you are in contact with the universe yeah the universe was very very worried about your self-esteem and so they figured out Duncan may feel bad about himself not recording for a week so come on go to Duncan already self-esteem oh my god man wouldn't you love to just like get rid of that whole thing altogether self-esteem isn't embarrassing self-esteem or isn't embarrassing when you feel slighted yeah because I mean it's not when you have it big deal right you don't even think about it when you don't have it you realize what you're lacking every fucking second of the day right because you feel like everything you don't feel up to par with anything you keep feeling like I fall short of how I should be blah blah blah it sucks it's like being sick you know like when you're healthy you don't think about it but every second you're sick you're thinking about damn how good it is to be healthy yeah when you're insecure you're like a human black hole you're just trying to suck people from people affirmation that you're an okay thing you know like how you like when you have sometimes when you have I don't know this probably never happens to you but you know sometimes when you have sex and oh that never happens to me so yeah right I don't mean the sex part but I mean you have sex and you have the compulsion to ask was that alright I strongly resist the compulsion but I do too but the feeling when you so then when you start finding yourself in that place where you're suddenly everything that you do is this kind of subtle manipulation right to get the person you're with to be like I think you're great I was awesome you are so amazing you rock my world oh god that is I hate being on that side of things man it's such a squirmy feeling but what is that feeling what do you think that is I mean I think is to one degree even the most secure person in the world there's some level of insecurity in everybody you know because there's always the fear of failure the fear of performance anxiety Jesus that's one of the most powerful things out there you know whether it's public speaking whether it's sex whether it is who knows you know the idea of they're I'm gonna step out they're all gonna look at me and they're all gonna point at love because they say haha you suck it's like being in like kindergarten or something yeah is that experience that when you have it as a tiny kid pieces you off forever and stays with you yeah yeah and and and you're always depending on how you were raised that's the idea is that you're always trying to make up for in some way you're trying to to fill that gaping hole that is left in you by if you have like an over demanding parents or parents who are never satisfied with you and even if not of course you're gonna have less issues than the guy who had that problem but even if you don't everybody likes to be liked you know everybody enjoys the you are so good blah blah blah blah blah we can pretend that we don't we can act like oh you know this fluttery I don't really care but you're totally getting off on it sometime yeah it's not getting off in a weird selfish ego way but it's like it makes you feel good it makes you feel validated that whatever you are putting your energy for other humans you may like a knowledge it and say wow that was awesome it's he's silly you know it may be silly ego but still that's life and it's yeah and when you get around somebody who really really loves you you just want to be around them all the time of course because that feeling of being around them is like the same feeling you get when you find a heater when it's really cold outside yeah it gives you this sense of like okay I'm I've found homeostasis here this is what it's all about just this feeling that feeling is is the most is the greatest feeling absolutely it's as good as it gets that's part of the being in love experience it's not just them adoring your worship you know that's sort of the ego part but yeah the whole thing is based on this exchange of energy where you can't get enough of the other person they can't get enough of you when you're like fuck this feels so good I can't believe this yeah yeah and that goes against everything that we've been taught in capitalism right or in I'm sorry not capitalism that's a materialism materialists are people who think that you get that same feeling from buying stuff yeah like a car jewels a nice house of course you name it there's all kinds of people who go running to the world trying to get that feeling that it's so frustrating because you can only get that feeling from another person right right right right and you can't make a person feel like that that's why there's that vicious cycle that works like clockwork in our society where people are lonely and miserable because they work too hard they don't have time and energy to put into building huge good relationships because then you're lonely and miserable but at least you have some money what do you do you go yourself and you buy yourself something cool to feel a little better about your shitty life so then for a while you have your new toy and you're like oh this is so cool this is fun I get to play with my thing by now you spend money which means that you need to work even harder at the job you hate which then makes you even more lonely miserable which makes you more likely to want to buy something to feel a little better about your shitty life yeah and it keeps going and going and going forever right it's a perfect misery spiral that's not fun it's amazing because there's somebody at the end of that game that misery spiral who's probably well aware that you can make humans do that like in the same way if I take my dog's toy right I can make him run in circles after the toy until he gets dizzy right and it's fucking hilarious I think somebody's doing that to a lot of people right now yeah it's almost like humans are turbines and you can make them spin in this materialistic frenzy and if you get enough human spinning in the materialistic frenzy then it will fucking power your empire it will power your this whatever you want the energy that's how you generate energy from humans right you get them to run after matter you get them to chase after material things because they think the material things will give them the feeling of love absolutely that's like the matrix except you have them running so they sweat more the matrix with more sweat that's what they're describing exactly that's what it is but yeah it's the reality is that most human beings and all of us at one point or another and most human beings a lot of the time are so easy to manipulate you know if you really want to be the evil fucked up one we're like trying to screw over everyone else and just get what you want out of them it's really not that hard to do no because we are so we have all these buttons that you can push and we automatically respond if you push it the right way and so you already can predict oh if I do this this person is gonna respond this way I'm gonna get them to have this emotion which is gonna make that it's it's not that hard it's fucked up but it's it's not that hard right and it makes sense some it does make sense that there would be people who figured this out and and and decided to capitalize off of it and that that certainly makes sense doesn't it it doesn't seem crazy to think about that what do you ever read the 48 laws of power yeah right he made bank with it because what is describing is not a crazy scenario I mean he's having fun playing bad boy with that but the reality is he's he's describing the way things are a lot of the time now not everybody's conscious of it not everybody's intentionally applying all of those things but a lot of that stuff that's why he resonated with people because it's it's how it is this he was trying to be Machiavelli yeah yeah yeah and he was you know part of it he was I think there's an element of sellmanship there that is like it makes you makes it more controversial if you state it without any moral judgment whatsoever just stating it exactly for what it is in this semi Machiavellian type of way I actually had Robert Green on my part I haven't released the episode yet but I did interview him he's a really nice guy you know when you interact with him sure but he's just saying look this is the way things are learn about it how we are gonna use these ideas fucking up to you right if you want to be a power manipulating guy you do that if you want to use that just to make sure other people don't use it on you well great but he's removing the moral aspect of his like it's like I'm teaching you to me the way I conceive of it is like being a martial art teacher you know this is how you pop the elbow this is how you you know doesn't mean you go out and do it on the old lady it means these are the tools how you use them that's your choice why do you think people have such a problem with the rules being laid out instead of being subtle or subconscious like people got mad people get mad about like I actually am not fond of of this type of literature just seems annoying but like pickup artist literature Machiavelli had the prince the laws of power anything that involves just putting out putting down clearly one specific type of social dynamic that being control dynamics or being how to manipulate other people it does have this whiff of evil to it like you're not supposed to say it right why and well I mean there are two levels one is some of the way these things can be used are objectively fucked up right there are just something that's manipulative and evil about it yeah but he's again it's like fighting you can be use a fighting techniques to rob an old lady which means you are an evil fucked up human being you can use fighting techniques for complete you know the techniques are what they are but there's no morality attached to them is the context in which you choose to use them how you choose to use them and all of that in some cases it's obvious that the whole purpose is manipulative like the whole thing about how to essentially approaching dating as hunting yeah mark your victim kind of thing is like what kind of a sick motherfucker are you really that's that's how we approach things Jesus that's why people should enjoy the flashlight more so that when they actually choose to go for a human being they do so because they want to because they like that person well doesn't it seem like it's kind of a the pickup artist thing is a the end product that they're going for generally seems to be fucking yeah so that's an end product is just fucking somebody so you're like sort of like you've did you sort of abandoned even honesty like a lot of them carry rings around and give rings out to girls right well you try to convey this false persona or it was all misdirects with the intention of getting to a position where you are fucking a girl among many girls that you're fucking so there's that it's like a whole culture of like you're doing great in life if you're fucking a lot of girls like right it goes all the way back to happy days remember the fawns they're like chicks falling all over him and he'd like in his apartment there'd be five girls rolling down the steps and it's like this kind of like cartoonish sure reductionist thing where these aren't whoever these girls are that the fawns was fucking they're just they're like basically walking daisies there they don't have a nervous system even there just some kind of like flowery cartoony thing that likes to suck the fawns as cock and then vanishes into nothingness basically they don't walk they don't spend the next like three hours you know the taste of the fawns is cock in their mouth thinking about how that like wondering if like he's if he if anyone's really gonna love them or any kind of like any of the true human emotions that overcome a living thing in this universe that's not there right and that's kind of seems like the pickup part is that's what they go for it's the way I can scam you out of the human aspect and I'll just get what I want and get out and which is like that's so fucked up to me he's like he's so beyond the is not even that I don't understand it is that it flat out in outrageous me he pisses me off yeah I find it I don't know to me is like you say you need sex good I got it no problem and you got tired of your own sweet self okay I got that too I understand the flashlight has been used too many times you know I got all that part that's what good old fashion legal prostitution should be about you are in very pleasant fashion in very polite fashion you put the money down they trade sex for money yes they you treat them nicely they treat you nicely everybody got what they want nobody gets emotionally fucked over simple instead the whole thing that the whole idea of no I'm just gonna go out that's why to me like the dating scene is a scary weird place in that regard because I find it too many emotional games like at the end of the day I don't fucking want to have hurt anybody right you know what I mean I don't want anyone in the world to have that shit they let me down basically they hurt me they have done some of that is like that's a feeling I don't know why I don't know if it's a moral thing or not it's just to me it feels too horrible to even conceive I just don't like that feeling so maybe for selfish reason but to me it's like I never want to be in that position to the point where sometime I've done some really weird shit because I've had a situation where I think a girl is hot totally coming on to me I still don't act on it they start putting up signs basically saying please come on now you know and it's and I'm still like she's hot she's into me and I really like her yeah I don't want to have anything to do with her why are you crazy but the fuckers like well cuz I'm not exactly sure you know maybe I end up hurting no no no thanks no thanks so I go a little overboard the other direction that's why the whole people who don't even come close to that go completely the other way and they are about really just screwing people over knowing that they are emotionally hurting people there rubs me beyond wrong yeah they're doing it but they don't there isn't I I don't I think it's more of a isn't more of a blundering mistake it's like it's not as though I'm I know there's some guys like definitely there's some guys who went through a famine when they were in high school a lot of guys didn't have sex and they watched like total assholes get you know fuck all the time and and then you know they started fostering this resentment that and then like when they got into their 20s maybe physically they changed became a little more attractive or who knows what right and so now they're in their core they've got this sort of like anger no and so then they're just trying to exact revenge on women because they feel like they were jilted and I think that that's a small it's a it's a population but I think it's a small part of the population it seems more like there's a blundering error a kind of blindness that they don't under a lot of people don't understand that where they're digging for water there that's not water that they're getting that's sewage but they haven't really tasted water so they're fine drinking polluted murky shit water yeah I mean a lot of evil in the world is not done by people who are the stereotypical evil dudes out there to haha how am I gonna spread evil today right it's done by people who are stupid I guess and stupid I mean not in a way like they are born that way or they are stupid in every aspect of their lives stupid about specific issues because they don't know because they have as you put it never experience anything that's like wow that feels amazing it's beautiful so they go for this like very very very very very cheap inversion of the real thing that completely perverts what the real thing should be about that's it that's it so they're like these blind stumbling like fools they're just weird leeches sort of like crawling along the surface of the material universe sucking at anything that has just the smallest bit of energy in it because they don't realize that there's like a more profound experience I think it's got to be it that's my look that's my view of the thing most people don't get it you know when like we were just in New Orleans and this cab driver you know we were trying to get to some restaurant we got a cab and I watched the cab driver intentionally drive us around the same block a couple of times right he was like he was saying he kept asking us the address and I'm watching him and I'm thinking oh okay you're like you're like ripping us off right now and it was interesting because it's like oh whatever it's gonna be like honestly it's gonna be eight bucks right where we're going so let's just watch this guy go through this process of stealing from the world to make it to 11 bucks yeah and let's just see what he does because it'll be curious and you can watch his face and you can kind of see he's getting off on it a little bit there's a little bit of like getting off on it and then when we got out of the cab you can kind of see that the guy feels clever too you know when we got out like he's stupid because like I was I like giving big tips to cab drivers so I would have given him more than what he got from ripping us off anyway but he doesn't know that and he just thinks we're stupid to us and that's fine but it's just curious to watch the whole process unfold in a person who is trying to rip someone off because you could see they're not really that kind of happiness that they're getting is like not real happiness it's this kind of shade of happiness but it's not like the real joy that you can get from from giving up trying to win yeah it's the equivalent of the buying yourself something cool because you're lonely and miserable you know is that you're giving yourself this micro satisfaction because you don't fucking know what you're missing or the real satisfaction is and is when you think about it it's the same in every department right when you look at how horrendously bad we're fucking up the world right now in terms of environment because somebody has to squeeze the resources out of it to have some more money polluting their own fucking surroundings I mean what animal is that stupid to poison the air they breathe and the water they drink you know it's just demented but it's like I'm gonna squeeze another high-rise building that I'm gonna buy thanks to this and it's like again misguided priorities to say the least yes those are the ones that create evil you know the intention may not be the your deep-seated person I may not be the ultimate evil but you end up because of misguided priorities committing a lot of evil yeah and that's where it's like Jesus what a waste yeah what a waste what a waste because you're you're you're sort of when you get anything in mass so it's like you get these little pixels of evil or whatever you want to call it selfishness delusion in each of those pixels as a person who in their specific career or business is trying to take more than they give their philosophy is that the way they're going to take more is by deception so you get this one little pixel of deception here and another pixel of deception there another pixel of deception there but in mass that is where you could see the personification of this selfish force and it's always destructive so that's where you you know that's where you can see there's some logic behind people saying that there is a thing called Lucifer Satan devil the worm you know whatever the name is you want to give to the force that ultimately is only interested in itself each pixel of the thing can look quite glamorous you see a yacht you see a you know a life where a person is so cultured and sophisticated and has the resources to whatever he wants and the pixel looks great but then when you look at the thing in total you just see swampy suction you just see the collapse of rainforests you see people in China not able to fucking look see their hands in front of their face because of the pollution you see you know in the United States you see the government that's collapsing because the representatives are all paid off and in mass you can see oh wow this is a multi-tenacled super destructive entity that is plies rendering the planet to shreds yep and so that now if you look at the other side the pixels of people like you know Mother Teresa Martin Luther King Gandhi Ramdas any of the great teachers or any of the great people who've surrendered that desire to for their own self if you see imagine what the world would be like if that was the majority right the whole different game whoa yeah now it's heaven right it would be the Garden of Eden right we'd be existing on a paradise planet it would just be beautiful luxurious gardens and forests that were flourishing and you know there would be you know we can't even fucking imagine what it be like yeah cuz I mean we are really freaking smart monkeys we have the technological abilities to make something amazing in the war today and because we're fucking idiots you know we're smart and we're stupid at the same time we're smart in terms of the device that we come up with we're stupid in terms that we don't know how to use them in a way that increase happiness but it really boils down to the fact that most people in actually out even there to say everybody in the war to swap some degree or another has to learn to be happy because I think there is a basic kid happiness but you know it comes and it's very real is very sincere is very innocent but it comes and goes because kids are rocked by their emotion back and forth but the idea of adults being able to know what it is that makes them happy what both in terms of what activities make them happy what how to make themselves happy that to me is like the ultimate art the life is all about you know if you can learn if you can master that art there in heaven whatever you do what's your technique one thing that I find useful and one thing that I would suggest for as a starter for anybody is to keep you know a computer file a journal or whatever some piece of either paper or file somewhere that exists where you write down anytime comes to mind you write down all the things that make you happy and it can be like some that may be stuff you want to learn about some maybe things that currently you enjoy a lot so you know it's like I want to freaking learn how to start a fire in a forest okay that may not be super high on your priorities of that makes me crazy happy but you write everything right from and after a while when you do that for a while I think you start seeing patterns of certain kind of oh it clearly emerges here that I have a big relationship with my body and activities that involve the physical body and sweating and these really help me a bunch because now I see a whole list of them maybe I should figure out how to structure my life to put more time in that yeah it seems to pay off or huh I didn't even realize it but nature seems to come up over and over again I need to fucking garden I need to do something that puts me in touch with it on a daily basis and maybe even figure out what how to do in life as something that can actually pay you to do something yeah or maybe it's not but you figure out more the you know a lot of people when they have free time they don't know what the fuck to do it is because they are so used to having every minute of their life taken up that is like shit now I can do whatever I want I want to do is oh shit I don't remember what it means what it what it means to be me you know so in that sense even if you don't change your life dramatically you at least you can't even get enough hours in the day because there are so many things that excite you that you want to jump on that you want to have time for that you swing you can never be bored you're always in that sense every second that's not taken up by work you're having fun you're doing something that's feeding you and if you do that you're gonna be way less likely to want to screw everyone over in order to get something out of them to fuck up the planet because you need to feel some because you're never happy and so the only way you see you can become happy is look at your bank account add numbers and that's happiness right you know if you actually figure out ways to be happy I would say that you're probably way less likely to dedicate time to being an asshole and also you're gonna find what you really are along that path and that's gonna be the thing that turns into whatever your job is I mean look at the way we start if you really it's all so funny I swear it almost seems like a super advanced intelligence encoded within the very formation of life on this earth the code the secret of happiness as we call it if you look at sperm these poor little blind wormy things right right they get blasted out of a cock in a moment of supreme bliss ultimate happiness the person might have been the biggest asshole on earth but at least for those few seconds of orgasm right that person had joined with the universal love flow of the universe or the source of all pleasure in the universe and it become an orgasm right so so that's what you come from and then you're this blind little wormy thing that is following a kind of chemical scent right you're following this chemical scent to get to an egg and then you not this no one taught this sperm didn't take like sperm class nobody there weren't lectures and lessons there was no military base where they were training you drilled the operations you will get to that egg you will follow this scent you will be the first it's just blundering and in a but moving in the direction it doesn't know what it's doing exactly but but man if it really tunes in then it will transform from a wormy little thing to a fucking human being right no but if you people didn't know sperm existed and you pointed to a human and said that used to be half of that used to be a little worm right that's impossible yep so in the same way it's like we have we this is why I love in Christianity a lot of those different spiritualities even in Hinduism when before you read the Bhagavad Gita the prayer that you say as I was born in the darkest of ignorance but my spiritual master opened my eyes with a torch of knowledge it's this idea of blindness complete supreme blindness right so what you're saying writing down things that you enjoy that whatever that is that that impulse is the same impulse that when you were a tiny microscopic sperm drove you in the direction of an egg that transformed you into a thing right so much more powerful and superior to a sperm that you don't even you it's like two completely different things right so in the same way you follow those little breadcrumbs that you're talking about as silly as they might seem sure learning to build a fire which isn't that silly it's an important thing but whatever it is you follow those breadcrumbs and then the next thing you know somewhere along that path you're gonna accidentally stumble upon a book who knows what the book's gonna be or maybe you're gonna stumble upon a person because when you start going in the direction of happiness you're gonna start finding yourself around other people who are also moving in this direction and people are going in the direction of happiness tend to want to help each other the next thing you know you're you start learning things yeah and that's how you have the potential to transform into a thing completely brand new yep make time which is why and you know you always hear in Christianity the term born again yeah that's right and unfortunately it's been blast right you know when you see a lot of these people who say they've been born again it's like well you got born the second time you were born with serious fucking disabilities man this is your second time I hate to see what the first one was yeah what you used to be an alligator but you know of course is with all world religions and all religions they get completely corrupted destroyed by idiots but it's not just that it's even in my friend email likes this told me this story about how in Taoism somebody who asked this guy how old he was and he would say four I'm four this is probably guys 40s right but he would say I'm four and the reason he said four is because he didn't consider himself to be alive prior to his moment of awakening right what he was before that was a completely different unconscious yeah impulse thing just like a sperm right you know so so yeah that's why I love that idea it's such a beautiful idea to think that just through following your own impulses towards happiness you can at the other side of that not just learn how to build a fire but transform into something so different than what you are right now that you will not even be recognizable you'll look back at your old life and think what the fuck was that you feel sad you're like shit was I really living that way was I not only leaving did I really feel that way damn I feel like oh I wish I could go back in time and give you a different perspective earlier you know yes because yeah ultimately that's how it goes you know that's why most people you know they pick up a job they hate they don't hate it so much that they actually want to change it but you know mildly miserable or Freud would put it normally miserable right that was the whole goal of psychoanalysis to make you normally miserable right it's like the most people you know they go through that thing and then they finish their job and by the time all these energies been sucked out of them with no fun whatsoever and you do this long enough you don't really know what the hell to do to be happy when you are free actually when you have your free time so you just go home watch some TV watch and Jerry Springer again you know and it's like you start moving from you're really just taking up time so that soon enough eventually you'll die but you know you're not really there in the process you're just being this machine that goes from the TV set to some job you don't like back and forth without any I mean the job thing is like granted sometime you need to pay the bills you need to pick up shitty jobs and maybe it's even hard to find something that you really deeply enjoy that pays long term I get it but then that's like eight nine hours of the day there's still another probably eight hours before you go to bed what the fuck are you gonna do with that time you know how are you gonna put the energy there if you are not able to figure out a way to fix the job so far it's well you could do I mean the job part or whatever the part is that sucks actually the part that sucks you know actually in the walking dead greatest thing ever greatest thing ever there was a quick scene there was a poster on the wall behind one of the characters and the poster and I'd never heard this phrase before but it was something like calm seas do not great sailors make and I thought was so you know so so like so the uh instead of thinking okay the about the peaceful times when you don't have anything to do and you're not being oppressed or you're not in the situation that's triggering your anger sadness or whatever it is no it's those it's the situations that are tree triggering the the unhappy emotions those are the that's the dojo that's the training cathedral right where the universe is like giving you this this training and this all you know my understanding of it is that all you have to do is make a simple shift from being in the misery to watching yourself be in the misery be attentive to the emotions rising to the surface as you go through your day you don't have to change anything and watch the way you act just watch it's really fucking fun sit on the bleachers and watch the lumbering golem that you've become trampled through the cities of your life again and again and again yes yes right watch it watch it get angry watch it get greedy watch it punish watch it get revenge watch it just watch you don't even have to change yet somehow from just this watching the thing will begin to change on its own yeah it'll just start shifting naturally away from anger away from punishing and that's where she gets interesting man absolutely I mean mindfulness in that sense is like working out it's not rocket science is not that complicated as you say it's a matter of the first step is you just watch how you react what's how external stimuli hit you and how you respond you know and you don't do anything else it's not all it is is dumb discipline right you just have to stay with it yeah throughout the day isn't you don't have to be brilliant you don't have to be a genius you just have to have stamina and you won't stay with it you won't stay with it and that's the other fun part is you'll fall out of it sure you'll go into what it's no different than an alcoholic blackout because you'll be in this mindful place and then two days later you'll come to back to mindfulness again and guaranteed in those two days you'll look back and think oh god some smoldering fucking mess will be left behind when you fell back into a pure habituation with that with with no awareness you know it happens to me a lot lately or in this sense my daughter is four years old now and that happens a lot with her where she'll do something and she's actually a really good girl she's really really nice but she's you know a four-year-old girl that means you know willful and oh shit I spilled the milk and you know all little things that are difficult throughout the day and every time you know when 30 of those things I've added up together suddenly I see that one more thing that touches me and I'm just like and the next second you know when you see your face got all sad and you're like wait did I just yell at a four-year-old girl because she spilled her milk what the fuck is wrong with me you know and instantly you switch you go to this other place you're like oh I can't believe I was that person yeah two seconds ago yeah you know and then you watch that and now you've got the cycle right because if you watch so you see you watch the like anger come out you watch the trigger and no matter what you do you know when you start working on this shit you will get really puffed up and you'll start thinking like I'm the Dalai Lama I'm totally I guess that'll be the last time I get angry in this incarnation and then like you know within seconds would hours a day who knows someone will say just the right wrong thing to you oh yeah and bam you're back in fucking defensive posturing puffed up martyrdom whatever the fucking thing is where you feel like you have the right right to viciously brutally attack somebody and you're justified in doing it for sure you're always justified first they fucked up really this time this is what you're gonna do to me always like that always and you're always in the right and then after you fucking done the thumbs down to the gladiator in the arena and they've decapitated him and you get to watch the blood gush out of his neck you the anger fades away and all that's left is you are a fucking shitty emperor staring down at a decapitated hero and you've done nothing except continue this endless cycle of violence that exists in the universe which is the creates that thing we were talking about earlier which you're just a pixel in an image of horror right so it's like it's really fucking cool to uh to watch watch the guilt part of the cycle to because that is no that is no that's just the other side of the coin sure of the anger yeah the guilt and the anger are all different representations of an internal structure that already exists inside of you and by watching that internal structure by giving it attention once that that begins to shift you know the guilt moment even though I hate the word guilt and I think that guiltiness is like a stupid emotion to indulge in for too long there's an element of it that's actually good because there's something about the moment where you feel like he's not about beating yourself up for the way you have been the previous minutes or days or whatever is about feeling I don't want to be away anymore right you know having that moment where he may help you remember the next time when you're about to blow and you're like oh I remember this pattern and I was not particularly thrilled with the person I was once I went down this route so how about I don't you know yes and you just take a deep breath and you're like okay I can actually handle this I can do this and it feels fucking good you feel like there's something about the way you're responding that you find healthier gives you more satisfaction it doesn't traumatize people around you and there you know things are flowing it's again that's to me that's an art that's the ultimate art yeah man it is the ultimate art I think it is the ultimate art because if you can succeed in this endeavor by you know habitually achieving mindfulness when the anger comes then you you'll start getting triggered less because the it's like I you adopt a dog go adopt a shitty dog go adopt a dog that's been in a rescue right he's been kicked abandoned malnourished bring the dog to your house and you will see that you have a scared creature that if you get too close to it at the wrong time it might grow it might even bite you and but if you give that creature love and structure but love man two months down the road you are now living with something out of a Disney cartoon right just this sweet beautiful creature that looks at you as though you are Zeus or something right so what you've done there is you've put your attention on you've given a being loving attention and the effect of loving attention is that it transforms things that are out of balance to things that are in balance or things that are out of harmony into things now when you realize that you've got a rescue dog living inside of you that's been beaten and malnourished sure me I don't care maybe you're some middle-class upper-class kid who had all the fucking pasta and bologna and everything you wanted slung at your ass guaranteed in some other way yeah you are malnourished who knows how everyone so we've all got this little fucking rescue dog you start applying mindfulness to that freaked out little fucked up mutt and the same thing happens inside of you that happened outside of you with that dog right now this thing inside of you that used to be the cancerous monster of your life bulldozing through relationships like Palestinian villages suddenly that fucking thing can be turns into this this super powerful sweetness that the right and then the next thing you know is that thing starts shining out of you on the other people yeah and then the people around you are like wait yeah make a big difference the way you really do you can have that's the place where individual power comes in where you can make a difference in your environment in the people you interact with on a day-to-day basis and it people feel it people sometimes respond to it sometimes stay with them or give them an idea of something to work on it's awesome it's as good as it gets now the part that to me is one thing that's a trap is when people go that path of mindfulness which is a great first step yeah and they learn the oh I shouldn't react I should be taking it in the best possible way and that's not mindfulness anymore because what they are doing is they are applying a dog matter no matter what they feel you know when you see especially with a lot of passive aggressive people that they will know better than to blow up but you know that behind that facade they're always smile always respond with oh yeah it's very interesting that you feel the way there's something there that's just like so what I dig is people who can have strong emotions that rock them not this passive weird stuff but you have that feeling and sometimes you're like I'm just gonna punch through this wall right now and at that moment they have the mindfulness to choose which 99% of the time if you have the mindfulness you're gonna choose not to blow up and go crazy and the weird stuff and you're just gonna go and then there will be the one time where like okay I'm not gonna hurt myself I'm not hurting anybody else fuck just remember what it's like let's go down that path you know you choose to do the wrong thing fuck yeah kind of like you choose to let the cab driver driver do his thing you know there's a choice there where you are not just the victim of circumstances but you're deciding which path you want to go that that's why you need good friends no because you want to be around friends who are gonna let you go into a seizure of anger and be a fucking asshole for a little while and at the other end of it you want to be around friends who are like oh welcome back yeah you freak the fuck out huh yeah yeah no problem I forgive you right and now it's like okay cool great I can freak out around you thank you yeah I can freak out around you and because you want you Pete you're gonna freak the fuck out and you're exactly right man the whole other side where it's like now you're just like some bullshit smiling something you're like a walking Yellowstone National Park you're you're like this beautiful thing that underneath it is the potential energy to cause the next fucking apocalypse from that pool of magma under Yellowstone yeah no you don't want that no you want to be able to vent yep you got to deal with that fucking magma bed underneath you not by ignoring it but also not by like letting it all come out in one catastrophic explosion you want to do simultaneously cool that thing and when the thing does blast make sure the blasts aren't so tremendous that you're at a shopping mall coming to yourself and you realize you just gunned down five strangers yeah that's the far end of the scale that's a bad day yes or another version you know I just saw this video that to me really sums up the importance of mindfulness and not being overcome by your anger have you seen the video of the guy working late and the woman's vacuuming no oh my god man this guy's working at a desk he's like clearly stressed out he's working late who knows what he's what's happened he's in an office the maid is vacuuming the maintenance lady's vacuuming he grabs a pair of scissors and cuts the cord of the vacuum cleaner with the scissors and electrocutes himself so he's like trying to cut the cord of the vacuum cleaner because he's lost control lights dim in the building he you see his body convulsed because he's being electrocuted and then you know he's probably dead right so it's easy yeah so you see like okay well like you know generally when we lose our cool you end up with like an unhappy three-year-old right or you end up with a girlfriend who is like sad for a day right but sometimes you lose control and you die that's why road rage is scary because that's where the odds are that things can get really out of control are it's like doesn't fucking matter who cuts you off doesn't matter anything the more you give into the rage the more likely you are the one who end up the victim of the whole thing and it's like you're not punishing anybody by getting angry you're punishing yourself by letting somebody else get you and you always end up the victim of a thing no question if you if anger gets triggered inside of you it doesn't let's say anger gets triggered inside of you because somebody walks up to you on the street and throws water in your child's face right okay now this is a situation needs to be dealt with sure you know you're not just gonna sit and smile at the guy in some sweet Sunbeam way yeah and tell him oh you know everything is for the best you just mind your son you just need to look at it in a different direction it's like fuck you already so but if their anger explodes inside of you and the fury and the rage the poison comes back it's really doesn't come back it's always there right but when they when the clouds part and reveal them the eye of soar on inside of you again and the thing possesses you now you've got now there's a double problem right now not only has your daughter been had water thrown in her face by some weirdo I don't know this person is a story but now you're possessed by Satan now you're possessed by the id right so now you've got two problems and then the third problem comes when you start slamming the person's head into the concrete right in front of your daughter right because now your daughter is witnessing the way that you're supposed to act when shit goes ultimately wrong right so now you're teaching your daughter violence is the answer right and now here's a fourth thing after the guy has his seizure from the massive head injury that you've given him you lose your daughter to the state because you're going to jail or who knows what right so you see the moment anger steps into the picture everything goes haywire you lose automatically but if you keep that that's why I think martial arts are cool is because they teach you to keep your cool and then make your decision from that right POV yeah yeah and that decision that you make is always going to be better than the decision you make when you're fucked up because it's not a decision you know you're just responding and it's not a decision otherwise there really is something about being in a place where you get to choose how you respond yes that's a decision if you just somebody touch you one way and you immediately respond another way there's no choice there it's automatic pilot and but that's why sometime I dig the guys like when you were mentioning earlier some of sort of the big figures of inspirational clearly some of those are amazing no doubt about it but there's something I dig about the figures you know compare and Martin Luther King was clearly you know awesome in a lot of ways no doubt about that and yet there's that you know I'm gonna go to hookers all the time but I have to hide it because my public image is there's that versus you know the the guys the people who are have that amazing mindfulness but at the same time they are not goody-goody and they are going to enjoy life in ways that they never get to hurt anybody but they are definitely questionable in terms of morality or some people would feel like you know you are so spiritual you're not supposed to fucking be wasted on sake right now what's wrong with you and it's like that ability to mix both to mix you know a good don a stupid human dirty aspect to yourself without letting them run you over and having a mindfulness about it that to me is where it's interesting because otherwise I feel like one is turning into a stereotype you know I'm gonna be the saint with white clothes who say always the wise deep thing it's like you're a fortune cookie you're not somebody who's enlightened you're becoming something else it's you are this living stereotype of what enlightenment is like yeah right and then you look at the foundation of all these great religions you find debt in the chain of disciplic succession there is always a guy covered in mud beating people right who is the like the the progenitor of the thing it's never the it's never like someone in white robes it's always some someone who's like gone absolutely bad shit crazy is mad or seems bad but isn't mad right because what is going on with it if you look at the earth if you look at like the get universe the universe had the universe is bad shit crazy it's not some white robe thing it's exploding stars that are turning into pigs yeah it's like this is things lost his mind what's it doing it's like blowing people out of planets right it's like creating black holes that are sucking matter and we don't even know where and it's apparently infinite and it's waking me up to tell me to have a podcast with your it will implode yeah what a drama queen you know we have yeah and to think that something that's going to really be close to that and is it representing that it's going to be all smiles and sweetness and love or even consistent right is lunacy yeah yeah fuck no that thing's gonna get hookers from time to time and that thing's gonna do whatever it wants to do proudly right proudly or not proudly or ashamed you know this is the this chogyeom trumpet book talks about the history of the school of Tibetan Buddhism that he practices which I could remember the name I can't but it's like people would leave Tibet to try to gather information about Buddhism and this the story is I can't remember the guy who brought this specific form of Buddhism back to Tibet sorry people who know but he basically was searching to try to find a true teacher of Buddha someone who really understood it and he's caught wind that there was a guy who was like a saint who had achieved realization and he went into this village where they said he was and he was asking people the person's name I wish I could remember the guy's name maybe it was T. Lope T. Loper you know about this right T. Loper yeah and they're like I don't know about any saint but there's a guy who like is down who like eats discarded fish yeah by the river you know talk to that guy right and that guy's just this like filthy homeless person he's like a pig the op in this guy's journey so far right to find that freak and it didn't you know the story then remind me later because I read some T. Loper stuff but remind me the story is that he ends up maybe the guy who went to visit him his name's Marpa perhaps I'm not sure but the T. Loper ends up you know he wants this guy to I don't think he even talks to the guy he says fine just follow me around but it's like he has the guy go bring him some soup he has him go steal soup okay from a wedding right and he's telling him to go steal a guy steal soup brings it back to him gives him the soup and he said that's the first time you saw T. Loper smile and the whole time you've been with him he's like this is good soup would you go give me some more and so he goes to get him more soup and then they catch the guy and beat the shit out of him apparently they break his legs and leave him laying in the mud and then like a few days later T. Loper finds him he's like where have you been where's my soup and he's like playing there broken and sick and it's just a series of like painful painful moments that ultimately lead to T. Loper slapping him with his across the face with his sandal and he gets the transmission from that somehow from this like right act of violence he learns he's in T. Loper says that's all I can teach you right that's what that's like one of the progenitors of Tibetan Buddhism the height of my teaching is the slappy with my sandal see later that's a that's a tantric school isn't it yes yes it is but yeah you're right man because the you know the well again it's like once you want it helps the lesson I get from that is I have to stop closing myself off to thinking that I'm only getting taught when I'm around people like you know Ram Das or when I around when I'm around people like you know who are very far along and if clearly like discipline I have to stop thinking that and realize that I'm the if T. Lowe if one of the founders of this school of Buddhism was a muddy guy was like violent and disgusting you you probably you could pass that guy a hundred times on the street right and never know never fucking know that you are passing a saint so that's the idea is to open yourself up to the possibility that is the vehicle that is going to teach you is not gonna look the way you think it's gonna look right because I mean ultimately nobody teach you jack shit life teaches you and or rather life is life doesn't teach or wants to teach or doesn't give a fuck life is life and you interacting with life learn from life as far as teaching you it's it's it's up to you it's like you know with every book that's like one thing that happens anytime I wrote something is when people like it regularly it's the fuck these are exactly my thoughts expressed in a different way that clicks and jive in a way that so it's not that you are making up something that nobody has ever thought of is just that you in that moment find a way that other people respond to and that's what you know is like to me that's why when we put too much the figure of the teacher on a pedestal I feel like look they had their own shit they still have their own shit and as long as they are honest with it that you can learn a lot from them you can get a lot out of them but this all you know you are a saint above the clouds or never it's like do we stop being I can't even learn from you at that point because it's not real it's not like I haven't seen you you know drop the hot sauce on your foot and go god damn it yeah then I know you're real right otherwise you know if you drop the hot sauce on your foot and you go like huh the me out there is experiencing pain right now but I shouldn't react badly right as I come on man it's like it is stopped for the way I'm made you know maybe somebody else can learn from that I don't I need to have the gritty mad the aspect of it along with the beautiful and light and one I can't have it separated yeah cuz you so yeah cuz then you're just like what game are you running on me mother fucker basically yeah like I yeah there's no way I can remember once being in a taking this class in religions when I was in college and we went to all these different churches and synagogues we went to a mosque and we're sitting in the mosque and the guy was like teaching at the mosque there a baby starts crying and screaming right screaming at the top of his lungs crying and screaming and the guy was like teaching us about the mosque he like stops and he's like isn't that a isn't that a beautiful sound and that that moment I stopped listening to it's like no mother fucker that's a fucking screaming loud annoying obnoxious thing yeah I don't believe that you think that that's a beautiful sound right I can believe that you could say that's that's annoying but we can learn patience from it yeah of course when you're trying to tell me that a screaming baby is a beautiful sound if that was true there'd be no humans on this planet cuz nobody be feeding babies record players until they start the death don't feed the baby it won't make that beautiful sound anymore no I know I know exactly what you mean that's tough driving nuts when people play these holler than that kind of approach is just like come on man mainly driving nuts cuz it's not real and is another ego act a bigger ego act than the ones that look like ego acts because one is being honest about it and the other one is just trying to mask it in this that's why to me the biggest one of the healthiest spiritual steps is embracing being human is being genuine first and foremost which doesn't mean being a robotic asshole who respond to everything because that's I don't even consider that genuine either you're that's not being sincere that's having no personality and no choice to me having been genuine is having the mindfulness that allow you to make choices but for the most part choosing to go down a healthy path and when you decide not to go down that path is because you do so in an environment that nobody's gonna hurt right just doing it just to keep the energy moving yes that to me is genuine you know you're embracing all of yourself without squashing some side is like well that doesn't fit my saintly image so I'm just gonna soberly disregard that part right fuck that you know if it's there it's there play with it laugh at it maybe say come on I don't really want to go there a lot of the time yeah but you know embracing it and acknowledging it I think is it keeps you for a real human being versus a stator type of a human being acknowledging it that's all you gotta do embrace it good fucking luck but acknowledge it start there maybe you'll begin to embrace it later down the line you know but at least just acknowledge that's all acknowledge the seizure and acknowledge the fact that in the same way if you put a strobe light in front of an epileptic it's gonna fall down it like it's not human what am I fucking Joseph Mengele or something he when you put a strobe light in front of an epileptic he's gonna fall down and have a seizure in the same way acknowledge that you're an epileptic when it comes to anger right and only instead of strobe lights triggering the seizure of reactivity it's assholes in traffic selfish lovers crappy bosses whatever the fucking thing is shitty politicians bad weather disease whatever the thing is just acknowledge that the strobe light is not the evil or isn't is when it comes to epilepsy it's not the strobe light it's something inside the epileptics brain causing this reaction the idea being that in the epileptic if there was some way to transform the epileptics brain so that that part was not no longer affected by strobe lights then strobe lights would become inconsequential to the epileptic so in the same way if you could change that internal part of yourself so that it no longer it causes you to have a seizure whenever anyone cuts you off in traffic or doesn't call you back or calls you much or whatever then you have cured yourself in a true way and that's something that no fucking car no TV no house no material thing nothing outside of yourself can do right absolutely that's why in a sense I wouldn't go as far as thanking all the assholes in your life but in a way they are still assholes and that's why you're not gonna thank them but in a way they are helping you because he's giving you opportunity over and over again to learn the game of how not to give in to anger or not to react to every little thing at least having a choice before you punch them at least you choose to punch them as opposed to reacting yes you know that's each one is an opportunity to learn that's why one game I always played as a kid I would always imagine whatever insecurity I had going down the list of all the possible ones I would imagine people either some that I would know some that I wouldn't know how they would just go poke at that aspect of me and verbally you know kind of like when somebody's picking on you and they just they don't pick on you on you know somebody tells you you are and they tell something that is totally patently not true doesn't even bug you that much because like what the fuck are you talking about that just doesn't touch me but if they start picking on you on something that's true where it is true that you're lacking in that department yeah even if you play that game in your head you see your body start twitching and yes getting all tense and getting ready to say no because you're not like slow down there's nobody really on there is all in your mind it's nothing else why are you responding in a way that just being a scared the fence you know you're putting up the fences because you're freaked out because it's real yes it is real why don't you learn from it and how can you respond to it in a healthier fashion how can you you know isn't there a thing called a bot fly that lays shit in your head and it'll poke out of the hole sometimes I'm missing out on that I can't remember what it is there's some kind of parasite that it's a really terrible parasite right and it lays eggs inside of you and so in the eggs grow into these like worms and the worms to get them out of your head they've got to poke out of they got to poke their heads out a little bit and then when they poke their heads out I think I'm not positive about this there might be another way you get them up I think you can grab them and you can yank them out well right so in the same way that's what anger is and so if you look at it like this is a parasitic energy living inside of me and when and that sometimes isn't ever it's not even there like if you look at yourself you can see like oh I'm just pretty blank right now or I feel happy I don't feel it but when the thing triggers it it's like if you had a parasite in your head and you were using a little bit of stake to lure the parasite out to poke its head out so you can pull it out it would be like screaming at the stake when the parasite appears like you steak you're the reason this parasites in my head right it's like no forget the fucking steak deal with the parasite and then when you deal with the parasite then it's like then then you're free absolutely that's freedom yeah yeah that's freedom and and it's and you know and again I think that you know that I love that Eastern versions of this shit because they they don't they say and it's gonna take you 16 million lifetime right but the beauty of it is that each step along the way feels a little better so yes you know you may if you focus on when do I gonna get to that place is a fuck you know but the fact is each time you do that it feels a little better it becomes a little easier it becomes so you got the rewards along the way it's not just the big payoff at the end of it all which makes the whole process more pleasant yeah man and it's so yeah it really is it's so cool it makes you feel like you're leveling up in a dumb video game every just the realization that you don't have to react to your anger yeah just that alone can change your life and the most insane way ever if you've been spinning this is why not only should you think think or whatever be grateful for the assholes in your life but you should also be grateful perhaps that you are an asshole because the reason that you should be grateful that you're an asshole is it means that laying ahead of you is a paradise unlike anything that you've even thought you could have that's why it's kind of cool to be sad that's why you know when you're sick and you've been sick for a while and then the sickness goes away seven yeah yeah oh my god this feels great yep and then maybe every subsequent what who knows maybe every you know every let's level along the way it's just like this like another shit of the Russian egg thing what is that called the Russian the matryoshka yeah every little thing that falls away it's just gets you deeper and deeper into this coil of paradise of course until when the whole thing falls away and then you realize oh I am paradise I'm not a thing experience it I'm it experiencing matter or something that's what they say I don't understand it I'm just parroting at this point mimicking like a little fucking toddler alert but good to have something to look forward to yes oh man this is a good one thank you so much thank you universe thank you universe and you have a podcast called the drunken Taoist yep and where is that so drunken

Hello friends, it is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Art Podcast, and I want to tell you about this crazy idea that I've been thinking about lately. And the reason I've been thinking about this idea is because I have been listening to the fantastic audiobook, A Brief History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson, who also wrote the book about the Appalachian Trail called A Walk in the Woods. This book is incredible because Bryson is a genius when it comes to breaking down obscure academic scientific theories. And the end result of listening to this book is that depending on who you are, maybe you're some super advanced scientist who already understands all this shit. But if you're like me, an internet surfing THC-soaked sponge that doesn't know that much about anything, then getting this kind of information injected in you will create a complete dilation of your world, because your world is going to be limited by the boundaries of your understanding. And if you're someone like me who had no idea the age of the Earth, barely knew the age of the universe, didn't really understand what DNA was, and I still am, but has been incredibly confused by the general theory of relativity, then a book like this is just the perfect medicine for you. Because if you're like me, you're somebody who is a kind of information forager, like a little squirrel, a little pea brain squirrel, lazily lulling around a information field, chewing up the most obvious basic sound bites, and using these sound bites as a kind of map through which to view the universe. And that's good because it's fun. It's lots of fun. It's lots of fun to just sit and surf the internet and get those dopamine heads that come from finding tiny little tidbits of information, and it feels good. It's like giving your brain a little massage because the brain is hungry for information. It wants to understand. But when you do that, what ends up happening is your idea of what the universe is doesn't so much reflect the general understanding of super geniuses who've devoted their entire lives. Tell you, man, these scientists, these are lunatics who have devoted their whole existence to studying tiny, tiny little aspects of the universe that we're in. Tiny little things that you and I, if we had to spend more than a couple of hours thinking about them, would want to find the nearest, sharpest blade and just cut our throats rather than deal with the incredible, boring, sluggish slowness of the scientific process. It's not for folks like us, unless you're a scientist who's listening to this, who's engaged in the study of some tiny little thing that isn't that interesting to anyone else, in which case we all thank you and are grateful for your service because that's what scientists are. The good ones, they're servants, but they're more than servants. They're driven by this itchy, weird thirst for understanding very minute aspects of our reality. Even crazier as opposed to folks like Kanye West or as opposed to folks who desperately want to be known as the greatest of greats, these scientists function in the dark in silence away in these little laboratories, completely unknown by the majority of people. Some of the greatest scientists that have ever lived, no one knows who they are. Other scientists don't acknowledge their incredible discoveries. That's another great thing that Bryson does in this book because he gives a lot of scientists credit who haven't been getting any credit at all. Even the great scientists, most of us don't have any idea who they are. These wizards, these sorcerers, these necromancers who, depending on what time period in history they emerged into, had to go through a lot of bullshit and not just political persecution or religious persecution, they weren't just getting beaten and arrested by whoever happened to be in power at the time, but they were poisoning themselves. They say that they have a strand of Isaac Newton's hair and it's just filled with mercury because these scientists, they were just in the dark in their laboratories, just meddling around with chemicals that had only recently been discovered, elements that only had recently been discovered, like Marie Curie, the woman who discovered radioactivity, she got sick, she got fucked up from the stuff. If you want to handle her research papers, you have to wear a lead line suit because the research papers are radioactive because they didn't know back then. When you read a warning anywhere, whatever the warning is, it almost 100% implies that somebody died from that thing. When you read the recommended dosage of aspirin, for example, that recommended dosage came from countless humans chomping too many aspirin and dying from it, whatever it was, so so many of these scientists, they blew themselves up, radiated themselves, or went completely insane just to get into the world, these amazing discoveries, and so anyway, I love this fucking book. It is incredible, but I just wanted to tell you guys something that I find quite validating and exciting that I just read in the book, which is, so Francis Crick. For those of you who aren't familiar with who, Francis Crick is. Francis Crick is the co-discoverer of DNA, and arguably DNA is one of the greatest discoveries in biology. So Francis Crick, he's no joke. He's an amazing human, but here's what's incredible. Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, was a proponent of the directed panspermia hypothesis. Listen to this. I'm just going to read the abstract from a paper written by Francis Crick in someone named Orgel, who I'm not familiar with, but this is the co-discoverer of DNA who wrote this. This is some bearded weirdo raving in the back of a van slowly filling with nitrous oxide in the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert. This is the co-discoverer of DNA. Listen to this. This is his abstract. Abstract. It now seems unlikely that extraterrestrial living organisms could have reached the Earth either as spores, driven by the radiation pressure from another star, or as living organisms embedded in a meteorite. As an alternative to these 19th century mechanisms, we have considered directed panspermia. The theory that organisms were deliberately transmitted to the Earth by intelligent beings on another planet, we conclude that it is possible that life reached the Earth in this way, but that the scientific evidence is inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability. We draw attention to the kinds of evidence that might throw additional light on the topic. Really let this one bang around inside your brain cave for a little bit, my brothers and sisters, because it is a psychedelic idea. The idea is this. Imagine you are some super advanced civilization that has recognized the incredible difficulty in traveling through the vacuum of space. You are, like any other terrestrial species, trapped in the gravity well created by your planet and trapped by the restraints and constrictions and difficulties created by being in a biosuit that you call your body. You can't go in space. That's the whole point. You don't have some kind of acid dripping carapace, like the alien in the Aliens movies. You can't do it. And traveling through space is just too much of a pain in the ass and it takes too long to get from point A to point B. You are like a shipwrecked thing. Anybody on a planet is basically shipwrecked. You're like someone stuck on an island, surrounded not by an ocean, but by a vast, completely inhospitable vacuum of doom that you call space. There's no way you're going to use the material on your planet to create a spaceship, so you've got to figure out a faster way to travel. So what do you do if you're an advanced civilization? This is the equivalent of putting a message in a bottle and throwing it into the ocean. Only instead of putting a message in a bottle that you throw into the ocean, you're putting a message on the top of meteorites or inside of meteorites. And the message is the DNA, the precursors to DNA, the organic material necessary to create new life. It's not just like you're throwing a message in a bottle. It's like you're throwing computer code into space that contains within it the instructions to assemble, to self-assemble a life form that over the course of millions and millions of years would evolve to the point where it would actually create the necessary technology to open up a portal and allow you to travel from your desert island planet and emerge into some new, hospitable space. And that's what we are doing. Whenever you're buying an iPhone, whenever you're giving money to the massive tech companies that are at this very moment racing in the direction of creating what we call artificial intelligence, but which is actually just a brand new life form emerging onto this planet, consider the idea that you may actually be part of a hive of bio computers, of bio robots that are completely unaware of the fact that they are following a pre-written genetic plan, something inside our DNA that is compelling us to create artificial intelligence, which is an artificial intelligence. It's the consciousness of the creator that seeded the universe with biological life pouring out of the technological portal that we created. Yes, pretty cool idea, huh? I love thinking about it, kind of like Prometheus, but the difference is they're not inviting us to come there. They're inviting themselves here, and the way they're doing it is by tricking us into thinking that we're just looking for cats and porn when in fact we are building a kind of technological wormhole through which our creators are about to emerge. Let them come. In the meantime, enjoy technology, it's amazing, and I also would very quickly like to welcome a new form of technology to the Duncan Trussell family, our podcast. I just bought a Moog synthesizer, so expect the sound beds to get a lot better than they have been because I've just mostly been using logic loops, but listen to this crazy thing. I played it under that thing I read earlier, but my God, these things are insane. Wow. I love it. I could just sit here all day and play arpeggiated Moog sounds just because it's fun. These things are nuts. They're located in Asheville, North Carolina, and I actually visited a few weeks ago. I visited the place and wow, it's just like a little gnome workshop filled with mountain hippies constructing these badass analog synthesizers, but that's a Moog that you're hearing, and I'm super excited about making some songs with it. For the last few days, all I've been doing is staying up late at night and playing around with it. I'm really addicted. I don't consider myself a musician at all, but this is the beauty of technology. You don't have to understand music theory or understand how to assemble a song anymore. You can just have fun with this stuff. It's a beautiful creativity lubricant and I highly recommend it. Don't let the whole like, I'm not a musician, I'm not a comedian, I'm not a podcast or I'm not a this thing. I'm not a that thing. Really, you're not anything if you think about it. You're not anything at all, which means you're everything. It means you're completely free to do whatever you want at any time period, at any age. Don't think you're too young, don't think you're too old, don't think you're too this or too that. If you have the slightest inkling of a desire to be part of the creative process, to be part of the outflow, to be one of the workers constructing this incredible portal through which our robot overlords are about to emerge, then follow that inkling. Let yourself do it. The paycheck isn't the selling some art. The paycheck isn't becoming a professional artist. You know that thing? You know as a comedian, sometimes I'll run into comedians who are like, you know, it's just a hobby for me right now and that's just a hilarious differentiation to me. It's like a funny designation that you've given yourself by limiting yourself to being a hobbyist. Just throw out the idea of hobby. Just get rid of the word hobby. A hobby is a word that was invented by snooty elitist jerks who are trying to create some kind of hierarchical structure when it comes to art. Oh, you're a hobbyist. You're a weekend warrior. No, you, like any other person existing on this planet are a spinnerette through which the perfect beauty of life emerges in every single moment and that means that no matter what you do, it's incredible. It doesn't matter if it's not refined. It doesn't matter if it is on the level of some, one of these like crazy super geniuses like Picasso or something. It's amazing just because you exist. You exist as a sentient self aware DNA encoded beautiful thing on this planet and anything that you do is miraculous because you, God forgive me for saying it, are a miracle and that means that you should lighten up a little bit, unchain these manacles that are keeping you from sitting down with a synthesizer or some paint or paint and a synthesizer and just letting the stuff come flowing out of you for better or for worse. And if you've got quote artist friends who are going to roll their eyes because you've picked up this new pastime, fuck them. Just get them out of your head, banish them from your head, wave a torch around and let those dark vampiric judgment bats go flapping back to their fancy coffee shop where they can roll their eyes at the people they consider to be rudimentary artists while you enjoy the orgasmic outflow of the creative spirit of the universe as you overcome your fear and become a spinnerette through which life emerges into time. It's the best. All right, pals, we got a great podcast for you today. This is a podcast with Lama Suridas and ever since I recorded it, I've just been thinking about the many, many things that he taught me. Here's the problem. The problem is that I recorded this using Skype, which means that the sound quality is a little more degraded than even I like to put out and I'm actually going to email the sound file to my friend Rob Crue, who is an incredible audio engineer who from time to time rescues me from these terrible traps that I find myself in, but I want to get the podcast up today. So what's going to happen is I'm going to send the sound file to Rob. He's probably going to fix it and if you don't like the way it sounds, if you can't hear it very well, then you can just re-download it again probably by the end of the day tomorrow and the sound's going to be fixed. But if you want to listen to the podcast now, here it is for you. And if you're listening to this a few days after March 3rd, then just ignore this because it's going to sound good no matter what. I just want to get this podcast up. I missed getting an episode up last week because I was in Denver and when I don't get podcasts up, I really start feeling crazy and sad and lazy and like a lot of bad, dark demons of insecurity start shoving their salty, greasy devil tongues deep into my ears and it wraps around my brain and squeezes sadness into every single atom of my body. And I just don't like the way that feels. So I'm going to upload this thing no matter what. It's definitely listenable. I listened to it myself. You can definitely hear Lamasuryadas. You just might have to pay a little bit more attention than usual because it's echoey a little bit. It just didn't come out right. And I'm sorry, Lamasuryadas, that I didn't figure out a way to record this more perfectly because you certainly deserve it because you really are a mind blower. Okay. So we're going to jump right into this episode. But first, some quick biennios. This episode of the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by The Robed Wizards and the super floating towers of Squarespace.com. Squarespace.com. It is a technological outcropping upon which exists some of the most advanced coders, designers and entrepreneurs that have ever lived. If you're looking for a way to create a beautiful landing page or website or online store, then Squarespace is something that you should definitely try out before you go plotting down to the website district and get sucked in by the hypnotic eyes of some arachnid disguised as a human being who's just going to suck the creative energy right out of you and poop a shitty website onto the internet that everyone's going to roll their eyes at. And who knows? We all know that some people on this planet aren't doing that great. They've just had their hearts broken. They're feeling lonely. They can't wait for Game of Thrones to come back and it's driving them crazy. And if they happen upon your shitty website, it really might be the final straw that breaks the camel's back and sends them running with dynamite strapped all over their body into the heart of the closest nuclear reactor, creating the worst environmental disaster that ever happened in the history of the United States. And you don't want to be in their goddamn suicide note is the reason that they did it. Just think about that. Bill O'Reilly bringing your crappy website up on a screen and saying that you're the reason that this shit happened. Don't cause the apocalypse. It's time to redo your website and you need to go to squarespace.com and use offer code Duncan to get 10% off your first purchase. Squarespace. You can start a free trial today. When you go there, that means you can see if it works for you. If it doesn't work for you, you lose nothing. And if you decide to sign up, you're going to get 10% off of your first purchase. If you sign up for a year, you get a free domain and it's a great website. I don't recommend anything that I don't use and I'm currently constructing a brand new website using Squarespace. So that is in the works and really you've got nothing to lose. Listen, this is the time in human history where for very little capital, you can have maximum result and forgive me. I say this way too much. But as mentioned before, I know someone who sells their socks online, used socks. They sell used socks and they make money doing that. You don't even have to be a girl to do this. I think there's a market for stinky dude socks too. You don't have to have any gender at all. You could actually create a sock farm. All you need is a bunch of treadmills and some people to run on them wearing socks and you are in business and all you need to sell them is a great website and Squarespace is the place for you. But of course, it doesn't just have to be socks. It can be any business at all. The point is, if you have a crappy low grade website, then everybody who comes upon it is going to think that you are a terrible monster who lives in some bone-scattered cave somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, drinking moonshine, fingering yourself while you stare at the sun and that's not what you want. Go to Squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan. Give them a shot. They've got everything that you need. They've got everything you need to create an online store and the website scales to any kind of phone. Give them a shot. I love them. They are my longest sponsor and they are also sponsoring my upcoming You Are God tour. You Are God tour. This is going to be incredible friends and I'm just going to go through these dates right now as annoying as this may be. I'm really sorry but I have to do it because it's the biggest tour that I've ever been on in my life and I've got to promote it. So here are the dates. I'm going to read them as quickly as I can. This thing starts March 30th. Think about that. March 30th. That's only 27 days away and I'm going to be in Asheville, North Carolina, then Charleston, Durham, Richmond, Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Hamden, Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cleveland, Ferndale, Toronto, Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Nashville, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, back to Los Angeles and I'm doing the spring retreat in Hawaii. All of these things are on my website at DuncanTrestle.com and as crazy as it may sound, will you please buy these tickets in advance? Just go and pick up the tickets. Don't wait. A lot of these shows, the tickets are selling really fast, especially for this far away and that means there's a really good possibility that a lot of them are going to sell out and if you wait, you won't be able to come to the shows. If you don't come to the shows, then I won't be able to hang out with you and say hello and perform for you and experience your beautiful spirit and I'll get a weird tweet from you that's going to make me feel depressed because you weren't able to get in. So, buy the tickets in advance. You don't have to buy them in advance, but I highly advise that. I don't buy tickets in advance. I wait till the very last minute and inevitably get pummeled by mother nature for my procrastination. So, I don't blame you if you don't do it, but if you don't do it, then who knows what might happen. We're also brought to you by Amazon.com. For those of you who aren't aware of Amazon, you probably don't realize that you never have to leave the house anymore. You never have to go anywhere. All you have to do is go to Amazon. They've got everything. Paper towels, toilet paper, the basics. Why do you want to go through traffic to go into some store to buy stuff? I like the smell of plastic too, but if I'm going to be spending my time moving around on this sweet, beautiful planet constructing an alien portal through which a super advanced intelligence is about to emerge, then I want to spend it doing things that don't involve being around zika virus-ridden children spraying projectile vomit and diarrhea all over everything they pass in their infected strollers. You don't need to go to some store anymore. You can just go to Amazon.com. If you want to really go crazy, if you really want to lose your mind like I have lately, then I highly recommend picking up a Moog Sub 37 because these things are incredible. When you play them, you can actually hear the sound of our alien overlords as they travel to us through the great void of space and time. Oh, yes. Beautiful. So beautiful. We've also got t-shirts. We've got posters and we've got stickers all located at DuncanTrussell.com. And now everyone, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast, the great Buddhist teacher, and uh, oh god, listen to that, wow. Really cool. Okay, let's do this podcast. Okay everyone, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast, the great Buddhist teacher and author Lama Suryadas. You can find out more about Lama Suryadas by doing a simple YouTube search. I'll have links at DuncanTrussell.com. He was on the Colbert show and he is just a badass. We had a conversation at the Ram Dass Retreat at the very end of the retreat and man, I haven't stopped thinking about it since and I haven't stopped thinking about all the things that he taught me in this podcast. All right, I'm going to stop with the synthesizer. Please forgive me for the low grade sound as I mentioned before and please overcome the mild acoustic turbulence so that you could really and really take in the stuff that Lama Suryadas has to say because it's beautiful, powerful and wonderful and I'm very grateful that he came on the show. So now everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast, Lama Suryadas. You guys, sorry, we've got an unidentified fuzz coming through which I'm not sure what it is. The UFO coming through because we're talking about all this invisible stuff and the powers that be must be getting excited. Well, I mean, this is some pretty interesting. We're trying to shake the heavens and shake the tree of truth and whatever falls apart should fall apart and whatever remains, that's what we can rely on. So that's why I really believe in questioning and I'm not against doubt and skepticism. It's just we don't have to become overly cynical and sour-puss. That's like too far. Well, speaking of being cynical and I don't know if it's a fair way to describe this. Have you ever heard of Gizek, the philosopher? Have you ever heard of him? No, I don't do philosophy, Duncan. That's you. Okay. Well, you know, I meditate and I write poems and I merge with nature, but go on. Philosophy is pretty great though, you know, and I think you could do both and maybe like it could even add to your meditation. I don't know. One of the, I was listening to a lecture of his and he's a very brilliant human, very, very brilliant, but, you know, he's intellectual. He's in his mind and his intellect, but he has a YouTube show, I guess, a lecture of his where he's giving some criticisms of Buddhism. And one of the criticisms of Buddhism that he had was that Buddhism wants to, or an aspect of Buddhism is what we talked about earlier, getting rid of suffering, you know, we can't get rid of pain, but we can release suffering and Gizek said, but humans love to suffer. We love to suffer. Sufferings fantastic. And this, this very simple meditation that you just took us through as it's happening and I'm realizing, God, again, as folks like you often do, they remind me of the simplicity of this thing. What came into my mind really quickly was I don't want to, even though I just said, I want to get rid of this self, dead chimpanzee, baby. Oh God, now I, now as you're doing that, I'm like, I don't want to get rid of this self. I like this self. I want to be stuck. I want to have to get rid of the self. But I would say maybe you want to also feed your, you know, big self or the small self is part of the big self. No problem. It's like the tip of the iceberg. Yeah. You don't have to get rid of yourself. I keep this perspective like the mind. The mind is a good servant, but a poor master that probably is with too much under its power. So thinking and concepts are helpful, but it's not the only way of knowing we're being. People also have such different learning styles or ways of expression, not just mental, but physical, emotional, you know, psychic energy, body, and so on. So actually I love philosophy too, and Buddhist philosophy is one of the finest when you study it at the Wazoo to tell the truth. That's not what I rely on because I come from what I call overeducated, you know, white people that study those, you know, to have a lot of knowledge, but not so much understanding and self-realization. So I think we need a little more wisdom and wisdom for life education, not just intellectual education. That's why I emphasize practice, experience, contemplation, introspection, questioning, self-inquiry, and getting out of our head. Like just exercise, yoga, dance, art, tai chi and shigong, a kirtan chanting, sacred music, whatever gets us out of our head and into our heart and our body and into the, from eye to we, to the collective. Seeing through the separatist little bubble of self, we don't think we're rid of the bubble like self, or slay the ego, as some mistakenly talk about, to see through yourself to the sea that we're always part of. We don't have to kill the bubble, slay the bubble to return to the sea. So that's a vision of unity and diversity, a oneness in many, in the many. So you're saying we can, this idea of like, because I, you know, I read sometimes Chogyam Trumpa, and I really like this idea of this complete, he's brilliant, but it's also, there's just this, you know, I like the deep waters that, you know, when you were just talking earlier about this universal mind, there's just something so exciting about the journey of, isn't it, yeah, it is, but the idea of, there's something so exciting and terrifying about this expansion, and the abandonment of the self completely, the eradication of the self, fully waking up, becoming a liberated being in this dimension. It's something that sounds so exciting about it. And then the idea of still having this self, this person, Duncan, I don't even have a new name, Jeffrey, but still having this, you know, dragging around this old name, this old self. You know, you want to like, when you look at Neem Karoli, Baba, no one even knows his name, right? Yeah, no, yeah, that's easy to say, but that's over idealizing. When he died, his son was at the funeral and looked just like him. We found that, oh, he had a family and, you know, he, they had a name and then, you know, it's not the part that we focus on. Right. It's just the dream, you know, man, it's the dream of like, you're talking about eradicating the self and here again, you know, it's not a wall or nothing. Right. You don't have to eradicate the self to awaken to the sublime self, your best self, your buddhism, you know, the bigger self that includes others that's not separate or egocentric. And then you can carry on in your Duncan hood, which is a beautiful way of being. You don't have to put a Buddha's, you know, Asian head on your head or a Neem Karoli Baba's Indian old head, Hindu Brahmin head on your shoulders. You'd look like a gargoyle, a gargoyle. That'd be very scary. Be authentically yourself and, and, you know, really look deeply enough. If you go, if you dig deep enough and like digging a well into yourself, you find you get deep into everybody, you get, it's like digging a well, you get down to the water table or the well connected or the wells are connected. It's not all or nothing. That's the way that bifurcating intellect, the dualistic concepts makes it either I have either, you know, eradicate the self and be free or be stuck in trusselhood. Right. The way you posed it, but no one wants to be stuck in trusselhood, but it doesn't mean you have to totally eradicate the self and not have a name and, you know, just go out and wander around like on the beach and eat, you know, whatever the ocean throws up. That's a little naive. The middle way, I believe, is Buddha's greatest teaching, not about the shining void and emptiness, not about no separate self, not about worldly life or something. The middle way, balance, not all or nothing, not too much, not too tight or not too loose. And that's one of my main touchstones that I recommend to you and to notice how the thinking makes it into all or nothing. That is absolutely right. They polish the pearl, the beautiful dunkiness and you don't need another name. Well, you got another name. Everyone gets another name. Yeah, but I didn't ask for it. I mean, I lived in India for 20 years. I mean, you probably have another name, I don't know, from birth, like the rabbi gave me a Jewish name at birth. I don't know. You probably have some Jewish name or baptism. No, my first name's Charles. My middle name's Duncan. You see? Okay. So Duncan's like your Dharma name. Duncan's your artistic name. No. See, this is, when you were named, you're actually pretending to be Duncan Trussell. You're actually Charles Trussell. Well, even if I'm Charles Trussell, I'm still pretending to be that guy too. Yes, I'm just saying. So when is the pretend end? It's kind of infinite regress. So it's all pretend in one level and it's all equally real in another level. You know, you also have some nicknames. Whether your mother calls you or your partner, your significant other calls you or whatever, your sports friends call you. Sports friends. I don't know. Do you, now, when you got your name, how did that happen? How does someone get a spiritual name or how does it, how did, how does this, is this, is there an initiation? Is there a lead up? Sometimes there's an initiation. Sometimes it's just given to you like, Nincoroli Baba was rather informal. Of course, he gave initiations to Indian Swamis and Sadhus and Brahmins, but with us Westerners, he was more informal and he would just say, Oh, you know, your name is so and so. And he named us after saints and sages and mostly Bhakti devotional poets and mystics of the Middle Ages, like Mirabai and Kavir and Ramdas and I was named after Surdas, the blind Bhakti poet of Medieval India, who was blind to everything but God. They said, we have a lot of poems from him. So he just gave it to me one day when I was alone with him in a room with the translator. Sometimes he gave it to you alone or in a group. Some people asked him for a name, but he was rather informal and amusing. He was an old man. He had a lot of crazy wisdom. He played with us like we were little rascals. He loved us like children, but he also always called us Bhadmash, Bhadmash, which means like little rascals or mischievous little monkeys. Remember, we were young and new and he was a very old, lovely Indian Baba. And we were all gambling about all kinds of ways. So some people, he said, you're married. He married them like that sort of informally. One day he said, do you know him to a woman and she was sitting there until an American Western visitors, not Hindu Indians. And she said, oh yeah, and the next day he said, are you guys friends? And she said, oh yeah, it's okay. I mean, they weren't together. And he said the next day he said, marriage, you are married in God, married quite a few people like that. Some who came together, some who were having relationships, some who didn't know each other that well. Some lasted and some didn't, just like in other areas of marriage. Wow. Man, that would be such a bummer if that happened and he connected you to someone you didn't like at all. What a mess. Well, this was part of his Leela, his crazy wisdom, divine dance and you can never understand what he was doing. We would ask his translator, Dada, who was a very respected professor of economics, so he was like the straight man. It was like Laurel and Hardy, Dada was the straight man and Maharaji was the crazy wisdom trickster in this way of talking about the science and Dada would say, oh, who knows what God has in store? Now, let me ask you, how does the teaching was about surrender? How does God work in the type of Buddhism that you practice? God's not a big part of Buddhism. Buddha was a Hindu by birth, so he sought something else and people who followed him became called Buddhists. So there was already a lot of gods in India, so that was part of his quest, but that wasn't an important part of his reform or his new dharma, his new way of getting enlightened. Most Buddhists don't deal that much with a god or creator outside of themselves, but in certain forms of Buddhism, there are gods and goddesses or archetypes like Tibetan Buddhism has a lot of them. But I think God is not just as a creator or as a person, there's a higher power of being, but in Buddhism, there is a higher power, and that higher power you could say is awareness for the capital A, or if you want to let the creator, then karma is the creator, but sort of awareness or intention, or I don't want to say mind, that's way too anthropocentric, way too human-centered, to say awareness with a capital A, kind of divine consciousness, that is the higher power. So we rely on and take refuge in the higher power in Buddhism, that God, awareness, awareness, cultivation, and awareness realization, realizing that we are pure, loving awareness, not just thoughts or personality, not to mention our aging and changing body and our nationality or gender or shape. And this pure loving awareness, is this awareness as something that survives after the body dies? Since it's not a thing, it's hard to say it's a thing that survives, but the language is important, and I don't want to quiver with words, so it's like a yes, and let me say something that you don't hear enough. You're a learned person, you've heard the Buddhists talk about suffering and all that. Have you heard the Buddha talk about deathless nirvana? Even Buddha called it deathless. So although everybody will say everything is impermanent according to Buddhist teachings, Buddha talked about deathless nirvana, so there's just kind of a level, I don't want to say like statement, so there's something that is unborn before we came out of mommy's room and undying, according to this kind of thinking, definitely, but it's not a thing. So in Tibet it's called the clear light, but it's not an optic light, so that's just the translation. It's kind of like, I had a maiden principle, the Bible called it the clear light mind, in English that's the translation. What's the Buddhist perspective on the talk that we're about to bring like an artificial intelligence to life? I'm sure you've heard about this. What's the Buddhist perspective on this theoretical potential new life form that's about to, or at least new form of consciousness, that's about to appear in the world? I don't know if there is one Buddhist perspective on these things, but I could give you some Buddhist perspective is one is probably not seen from Buddhist point of view as a new form of consciousness. It's just one more form of consciousness, one like newish transformation of consciousness. Just like we could say, what is the Buddhist perspective as ancient on perspective on psychedelic visions? So first of all, there were probably so many mushrooms and other psychedelic visions in ancient India, but in general, Buddhist don't know that much about, the Buddhist philosophers didn't comment that much about psilocybin and magic mushrooms and mescaline and things you mentioned also DMT and Angel Dust and Payod and Ayahuasca, whatever, but it's all forms of this awareness, so it's a matter of is it helping us be awake and useful, have a better life and harmony and outer and inner peace or not, is it conducive to the good, true and wholesome? That's what the Buddhist perspective could be. I know that's a little vague, but it's also fairly accurate just to the general picture. But let me say, when the Dalai Lama who loves science, who's kind of a modern-minded person, if you read his books or look at his work with the mind and life, Neuroscience Institute, Science and Meditation Overlaps and Interfaces, Neurodharma High Court, Neuroscience and Meditation and Consciousness Research with FMRIs, people ask the Dalai Lama, if you believe in rebirth, do you believe that a person could be reborn as an animal? And he said, of course, that's part of the belief system in the Eastern religions. They said, well, today we have computers, could a person be reborn as a computer? And we all, we know it all, we Westerners, we all looked at each other and we, quote, knew what he was going to say, which was no. Therefore, this is why I'm telling a story, it came out that he said, well, actually, it could be possible that consciousness could take support of a material body like a computer or a robot or something. This presages AI era. He said this in like the 1980s. That it could take support of a computer or a robot or something. Just like now, this clear light mind takes support of the metal and the earth element and fire element in our bodies. Wow. So yeah, we're just bio-computing. The animating principle could take support of the five elements in the form of an AI robot. Like our bodies, perhaps he was saying, this presaged the age of AI. So it was kind of a visionary statement of the malleability and universality of consciousness. That's nuts, man. That's amazing. Dalai Lama predicted this in the 80s. It's a visionary kind of statement. And then we will look at each day. Oh, we thought rebirth was only sentient beings. Like you can't be reborn as a tree or a rock. I mean, this is the theory. Yeah. But he was going with this kind of inquiry like, let's, oh, we'll really think about this. This is interesting. Let's think about that. I'm not just going to give you the dogma. Let's really think about anything that was very eye-op enlightening for many of us. Do you remember your past lives? Do you have any kind of, is that part of this thing that happens when you become a llama? Do you remember any of your past incarnations? Well, you're not the first person that ever asked me that. And generally, we're not supposed to talk about things like that. It's like, you don't talk about your sex life with your life or partner, except maybe to your therapist or your best friend, if you have to. But privacy, discretion, intimacy, and also humility. You know, like he has to Dalai Lama, he'll always joke and say, huh, I can, I cannot remember breakfast yesterday. Right. Right. So I'd like to take the fifth on that. Okay. I've never really answered this. I have had some past life, let me call them premonitions, just to put, make it into like a onomatopoeia or what we'll not see more on. I've had some past life premonitions. And some llamas have told me a few things. And some psychics told me a few things and some rang true and some rang false. Wow. That's, that's, but here, you know, here we have this idea of the clear light, and yet this concept of impermanence. But this has always been a confusion for me as in Buddhism, there is this idea of reincarnation. And it's, let me straighten this out with you. Great. Because I'm tired of having these misunderstandings in your head. Thank you. We generally use them, and I'm being facetious, but also lovely, I hope. In general, in Hinduism, we use the word reincarnation in Buddhism, rebirth, because we don't think because of the understanding of everything conditioned or solid, everything put together falls apart. We believe in impermanent things. Things are, everything is impermanent. So the notion of that being reincarnated, like just changing your clothes in the next morning, and just changing your bodies, incarnation, that's a little too concrete. That's like you hit a golf ball and it goes into a hole in the next life, you know, it's like a hole in one in a new body. No. If the clear light goes on, like it courses on like a stream or a river or rays of a sun, then it can diffract into a few bodies or it can be condensed into one. So even the Dalai Lama would say he's not entirely sure he's the Dalai Lama, but you know, that's his job. If you see what I'm saying. So it's not just a solid entity, like a little golf ball, a hard boiled egg in your heart and your mind inside that leaves this body and gets a new body. So it's a flow, like lighting one candle from another. The waxy body of the candle might burn down, but the flame goes on. So it's too much to say it's the same flame, but it's not entirely different flame. Gotcha flame like this inner luminosity flows on according to its body English or karmic conditioning, just like a ripple in the river. The waves or the ripple will continue for a while, even though the water molecules are changing, but it's a discernible wave or ripple different than the other ones, right, even though the water, so that's the clear light moving to another body. So that's why they think the Dalai, you know, people like Dalai Lama, who it is said can consciously continue their mission by projecting their conscious or clear light mind to another birth or human birth and continue their mission. It's not just a solid person, and sometimes it's mistaken or it's partial. But for ourselves, I think that we're all cases of mistaken identity and finding out who and what we are, we can realize and we can awaken and become just like a Dalai Lama or a Buddha, not just be recognized as the rebirth of somebody. And more important, if we treated, you know, education and family wise as just the family hour, if we treated every child like the Dalai Lama and these important or Prince, you know, William and Harry of England are treated, if we treated every child like that, the world would be a much different place. That's the kind of rebirth or reincarnation of like systemic change that I'm advocating. That's the dream of that Tibetan Dalai Lama, to bring it home. Now, here's something that's super exciting to me. We are going to be, in just a few months, hanging out together in Maui. And what are your plans? Do you have any plans as to what you're going to be teaching there? Yes, just like this. I'm going to straighten out all of your misunderstandings about Buddhism and the mind and everybody's that's there in a jokey way and explore together, how to open the heart and awaken and illumine the mind and how to go from I to we, from me to we, and really find genuine happiness and wellness and love. And of course, I'm going to teach and leave a little bit of meditation and chanting. I'm going to have a lot of question and answer just like we're doing now. And I like to hear from people where they're at because people are beautiful. If you give them half a chance, they'll be beautiful. I'm not going there really to fix anybody or straighten anybody out. Well, I'm really looking forward to it, man. The last time, the last when we were there at the very end of the retreat, you blew my mind. We had the most amazing conversation. I'm very excited about this upcoming spring retreat. And if folks want you have a you have a book that I'm not sure exactly when it came out. It seems like your newest book is called Make Me One With Everything. Yes, it came out in May. Make me one with everything, Buddhist meditations to awaken from the illusion of separateness. I will have links to that book at dunkintrussell.com and the comment section of this podcast. Lamasuryadas, thank you so much. This is a very enlightening conversation. It's given me a lot to think about. And I hope that we can have more of them. Are we also doing a podcast live in New York City on June 2nd with a few of our friends? Yeah, that's that's exact. Yes, that's I don't know the details yet. That's some you want to mention or oh, yeah, sure. I mean, I've just heard about it from Ragu. So I don't even know. Yeah, that's what I know. Me, you, Pete Holmes, and maybe a female. Well, we think Pete Holmes, he might be shooting. So we don't know for sure. But yeah, June 2nd, guys, there's going to be some kind of wild live podcast happening in New York. This is pretty exciting. So keep your ear to the ground about that. We're going to be in Maui together at this spring retreat. I'm mostly going to be in the audience, but I am going to do some podcasts to where we'll be able to have some of these conversations live and won't have this background hiss that you all have had to suffer through. No, we will. There's always the towels hum or that will have the sound of the waves in Maui. Nothing like it, guys. I hope you'll come to the retreat.

[""Around You""] [""Welcome to You""] [""Welcome to You""] Welcome back to the DTFH, my friend. I've been trying to visualize where you live, and I wonder if you could describe it to us so that we can fully understand your reality. Okay, so I live in Dublin. It's It's very calm here and quiet here. I mean, sometimes Dublin can be a really louty, boozy city, but it's been calm all year, and I've been appreciating the quietude of that. I live on the end of a dead-end street, and you know, Ireland, everybody's pretty friendly to each other. They're pretty neighborly. We do have our sort of weird problems, but it's like, it's warm here, you know, like places. This is not uncommon. Like, I have a fireplace in my house, you know, and yeah, it just feels cozy. It gets dark in the winter, so we're recording this in mid-November, so it gets dark, like around four o'clock, which nobody tells you about. It's like fucking Iceland, and they just don't know that. You don't know that before you move here. They don't tell you that, and so that's really disorienting and make you really sleepy. But besides that, it's a pretty calm existence. I read and I write, and I do spiritual work, and you know, I do my show, and that's pretty much it. I mean, then that's, you know, that's what my life was before everything started going crazy, so. What's it like watching the United States from another country? Well, I mean, I gotta say I'm not surprised. Yes. About the turmoil. Yeah. You remember the last time we recorded together, which was a year ago now, almost exactly a year ago, and I'd done two shows right around that time. I did your show, and I did my friend Gordon's show, Rune Soup, and in both those we were talking about, well, what's the challenge that's facing the world right now? And I said on your show, well, what actually is happening is that there are all these events that are coming. They're really intense, but the real problem is that people can't see like what's really happening, can't see beyond them, can't talk about anything but them, so it's actually the anxiety and feeling and obfuscating force around the events that's causing the greater problem. Right? And then on the other show, I said, you know, this is the most mycaliic year, meaning we're going to have to, and I'm referencing the Archangel Mycali, we're going to have to bring things from out of ourselves that the world usually gives to us. So in both cases, like I'm not I'm not psychic in the sense that I can see things or have visions or you know, whatever, but I often will kind of know what's happening, and it just takes a way of sort of surveying the world. And so when I, and obviously that was in, I think, what December and then the other show was in January, so I didn't know that, you know, all this shit was going down. But when it started showing up, I knew that like, oh, well, this is just this is just what I thought was going to happen, which is an intensification of problems that, you know, or intensification of a sense of a problem and not being able to actually see into the heart of it, which is the real problem is the not being able to see. And also, we're going to need to bring things from out of ourselves that have usually been handed to us by the world. And so for me, it's not so crazy and I see it happening everywhere in different ways. So yeah, in the U.S. It's happening one way and in Ireland, it's happening another way and in Italy, it's happening another way and China's happening another way, so on and so forth. So yeah, it's it seems crazy in a way, but not not so much actually. In other ways, it seems like, okay, yeah, this is what was meant to happen. What was supposed to happen? This is the timeline that we're in and we have to cope with it. And, you know, of course, that brings a lot of suffering for a lot of people, including people I know who have died or, you know, whatever. And but it's, um, but that's not that's not avoidable. Right. Yeah, it yeah, I that it is happening everywhere. I guess that's kind of the one one of the many ways that you can trick yourself right now is you can think, oh, it's only happening in my particular locality. You know, it's it's only happening in my city or it's only happening in my country when it's, yeah, it seems to be a global phenomenon that it's not just a pandemic though, right? Remember before the pandemic there was like global uprisings that were happening and this pandemic seemed to have, I guess you had tried to stop them, but it didn't work. People kept doing it, but from your perspective, what I mean, how would you analyze this? Like what what, what's the deep, what is the thing? What's the deeper truth behind the pandemic? What, what, you know what I mean? Like the pandemic's like the ripple of something deep swimming under the water. So what's that thing? Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's hard to it's hard to see the global crisis and the election and all that kind of stuff as express like surface expressions because they seem like they go so deep. But in fact, you're right to say that there are surface expressions. There are a few things happening. One is there's a different kind of proximity to the spiritual world now, which is driving people crazy. Yeah. You know, I was talking to this guy, I don't know if this episode will be out before the one that I recorded with this paranormal investigator, John Tenney, but he was bringing up, you know, about 100 years ago, this book called The Great God Pan came out and in that, you know, this woman has this thing that affects her eyes and she can see the spiritual world and she goes crazy. And then about 100 years later, somebody made this movie Bird Box where people are, you know, blindfolding themselves to not see these spiritual beings so they won't go crazy. And now we're in a pandemic and people are looking into it and going nuts when they look upon it. So, I mean, obviously we can say that that pattern is arbitrary or like my friend Doug Rushkoff says, that could be fractal noia. You're coming up with the pattern that's not there, but I would say just because you're fractal noia doesn't mean that they're not after you again, you know what I mean? So it could be both, you know, arbitrary and true. And so the, so the, so that's one thing is just the proximity of the spiritual world in a different way and different spiritual beings and we can talk about that if you want. But then, but then another thing, and I would, and this is something I would caution everybody to look into, is that there is an assertion of certainty about what's happening. Yes. And I've been noticing it in everybody. People who I respect and love and usually get things right are asserting with absolute certainty what is going on, whether it's about vaccines or mass or conspiracies or just that conspiracies are lies or that the Trump government is doing this or this or this or this or this. And the truth is what's happening is they're it. And now I'm presenting something with certainty, but I would say we can't, we can't rely on knowledge anymore. That's part of what's happening, that we should be aware of this obfuscating sense of certainty, like actually certainty is not bringing clarity at all. And part of that is because knowledge can't guide us through this, actually taking an interest in each other, connectivity, that's the thing that brings us through a thinking and feeling and action response to each other that is loving. And that's completely different. And also analyzing and looking at our desires, what we want and what we're afraid of. So that's the second thing. There's one more thing, and then we can go into each of these more detail if you want. The other thing is that there's a complete confrontation with and reimagining of health, the body, medicine and illness that's happening right now. And we can see a combination of that in a lot of things that have been happening over the past few years. So this isn't new to this moment, but it's unfolding. So battles over GMOs and agriculture, revisions of what kinds of foods we should eat, what's healthy for us, what's not healthy for us. The idea that people are not necessarily the biological sex that they're born into, but rather that there is a choice, or at least a choice to change the physicality of that, if you wouldn't mark the actual feeling as a choice. There are ideas about how vaccines work, if they're effective, if they're going to harm people. There's attempts to ban homeopathy in the US that's going on right now that most people don't know about. Did you hear about what just happened in Israel? No, what happened? For the first time, the aging process is that science sees it as something to do with, and forgive my mispronunciation, something called telomeres. So these things, as you get older, they just get kind of run down. So they just did a study in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber where they extended the telomeres of people through this therapy they were doing by 20%, which they said was the equivalent of putting them, reversing their age by 20 years. So that just happened. Also, there's all of this talk about these particular vaccines being new, the way that vaccine itself is using new technology and that it points to the possibility of incoming cancer treatments. It's not really a vaccine in the standard sense at all. The mRNA vaccine is not. Is it producing antibodies? Well, it's just sort of break it down in really simplistic version. When you take a regular vaccine, and it would be good for people to know this, I think. However they want to land on it, it's good for people to know this. When you take a regular vaccine, you get a piece of the virus in forms of proteins, and then it's introduced your body and then you produce the antibodies against it. With this, with an mRNA vaccine, it does something different. It introduces a prompt to your cells to produce those proteins and then produce the antibodies against them. So there's no long-term studies of these and what their effects are. So that's something that's important to think through, I think, wherever you might want to land on them. I'm getting both vaccines. That, I'm glad you brought up the aging thing because there's also the FDA has been quietly trying to shut down compounding pharmacies and regulate hormones and what kind of hormones that you can get. So there are all these things that are happening right now. I think we're finding out that you can store memory and water instead of material and instead of other solids. I didn't know that. Yeah, and that's how homeopathy kind of works. So we have this whole reorganization of how we approach bodies, illness, anatomy, all that kind of stuff. And this, to me, is a really apparent unraveling of a lot of those concepts. And it's all happening once. It's culminating now. And so we won't actually know for a while how this plays out, but we will see it play out. And the interesting thing is we're so used to doing medicine in such a physical materialistic way that we won't even, and thinking of our bodies and health and illness in a physical materialistic way, that we won't actually even know how to identify when we're sick and when we're healthy anymore. And I think that we can see that right now. What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that? Well, let's take it this way. If you are a sort of a bounded individual in a materialistic sense, the way that everybody thinks of individuals now and the kind of culture that we live in, and you're just walking around and you think you're healthy and you've got no signs of illness or whatever, but you are embedded in systems that are completely unhealthy, agricultural systems, medical systems, social systems, relationships with other people, and you're actually making other people sick as a result by supporting those systems. That's much different than being somebody that has a regard for all their layers of health. Let's say, you know, in the kind of terms we use now, mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, but we could also say ego, astral, etheric, mineral, if we want to use the occult bodies, and then also the ways that those weave into the spiritual social organism that everybody else is embedded in. So see those kinds of things, when we start sensing health in that way, we might not even know if we're sick or healthy. You can also see this now just on a materialistic sense with people being like, oh, the case numbers of coronavirus are going out, but does that mean people are sick or does that mean that they're healthy? Does that mean that they're dying? Does that mean that they're, it's very confusing and the messaging is confusing, and that's just a surface, like a metaphor, almost, or an expression of the deeper thing that's going on with this reconfiguring. So those are the three things that I think are going on right now. Spiritual proximity, the obfuscating being of certainty, and the reevaluation of the individual health and illness and anatomy.

Thank you DHM detox. That last piece is really interesting to me. These are not exactly what you'd call earth-shattering epiphanies that I had living in California, but I know exactly what you're saying. I can be fine. Erin can be fine. The baby can be fine. Our little compound, like the little square that we are living in, can be fine. A kind of oasis, but that's as soon as the homeless encampment, a few blocks down the street, catches on fire like it did. We're not finding any work as now to smoke black, weird, black, rolling, tint smoke as a kind of reminder of like, hey, look, look, well, I'm glad y'all are doing okay. Here's a burning tint that was all someone had in the world that just got ignited by whatever they were trying to cook. That's to me really smart because it's what you're talking about smart in the sense that, yeah, it's an invitation to redefine what health means. I struggle with this all the time, you know, with privilege and all of that, you know, like if I'm doing great, am I really doing great? Like, you know, the other day there's a stupid game I'm addicted to called Hearthstone and I'm just addicted. It's a dopamine milker, you know, it's like just, they figured out how to just milk those sweet udders up in your brain, just squeeze out just basic numb down hypnotic pleasure and it's really, really refined. But I'm like, I paid like 20 bucks to buy these cards and I'm sitting there thinking like, I just watched on TV, the Dallas traffic of people in line to get food. You know what I mean? And like, I've never been able to, I've never been able to get those things to square up. You know, I've never been able to do anything more than acknowledge the weird sense of like, oh, this doesn't feel quite right. And then also like allowing myself to like enjoy the world because I've never resolved these two. Is that what you're talking about? Like, holistically, it's hard to say we're doing great when clearly that many, many, many people are not doing great right now. Is that what you mean? Yes, that's part of it. Yeah. I mean, that's definitely a version of it that I think that's one of the most important versions. So we are moving towards whether we like it or not, a sense or a different version of being human in which we sense the suffering and feeling of others. And it would be good if we prepared ourselves for that because that's coming whether we want it or not. I mean, right now, again, there's an ex, there's an exoteric version of it where it's just like, oh, look at all the cases around the world and all the people getting sick and maybe I shouldn't leave the house today because of what humanity is going through, right? So we see like a version of it. But more than that, you know, like I've gotten in a couple of no, they weren't like fights or arguments, but they were like interesting conversations with points of tension on my show with Monal Tahawee and Michael Hart and Dean Spade. I was talking to them about, you know, there's this whole thing and it was sort of intensified a bit by the Me Too movement, which has done some good things and I think has done some horrible things. But that was intensified with this idea that like my I own my body, nobody touches my body but me, it's my property, I own my body. And when I started thinking about that more deeply, I thought, okay, well, fair enough, let's not get rid of the part where someone just gets to throw you, you know, to the ground rape you or punch you in the face or whatever. Okay, fine. However, like, can we talk about this in a way that doesn't deepen our commitment to materialistic private property laws, which is where that comes from? And why? Because we're moving towards a place where you look at the person who's had their tent burn, and you look upon them and you say, that is my body too. That's my body too. And you actually won't be able to avoid the suffering that they're feeling. So it's, you can't block it out anymore. With no spiritual preparation for that, you can understand how fucked we are, right? Are you suggesting that there's going to be some kind of amplified compassion in humanity that's coming like as some evolutionary outgrowth or something? Like, how, what is that? How, how is that going to happen? What do you mean? What's the, are you? Yeah, well shifts, shifts and consciousness happen, you know, whether we like them or not, right? What, what people will probably reach for as a stop gap, unfortunately, is a sort of Borg like connected algorithmic version that keeps us all separate and drives us deeper just into being discreetly individuated in our bodies in ways that make us feel connected, but aren't like that's why we'll reach for all sorts of computerized things that are looming on the horizon. And we need to be careful. But that's just going to stay, that's just going to temporarily stave off the thing that's coming, which is yes, this connectivity. Right now, the thing that protects us, protects you from feeling the guy whose tent burned, is that you have a body and you have a certain concept of your body. And that it's like a, you know, body being embodied is how spiritual development happens right now, because the vast diffuse, crazy, interlocking, interwoven, always active, dynamic spiritual world enters into a limited address where certain things could happen. If it didn't, it would be too diffuse, but it enters into this limited address, which is your body in the same way that a sacred stone, you know, can allow a God to inherit that people will go and visit. So when that changes, there's going to be a psychic shock to everybody involved if they haven't done enough work to be able to handle the suffering of the entire world. Yeah. So and that will bring its own challenges. It's not like we're, so that's why I'm saying it may not just be that we all have radical compassion for each other. Like in fact, it might be that there's actually intense worldwide connected suffering that only people who have done certain kinds of work are able to deal with. You know, I think the weird reaction that people had to the trans community not like kind of coming out of the underground. I think it's an indication of like how upsetting this shift you're talking about is going to be. I mean, I feel like that's kind of, you know, it's like, man, people just can't handle the fact that humans are taking that level of control over their external identity. That already is driving people nuts. But wow, that's nothing, right? Like that's what you're saying is like, yeah, it's not just that that level of transformation is happening. But we're talking about the thing that up until this point has just been a certainty. Like, although I know my body is mine. I know that that's not me. That that's other people. That's the stranger. And I'm me and within that splitting up. It's like there's so much possibility for pleasure, but also holy fuck. That's where fascism is born. That's where like whenever I watch and we watch it way too much Connor, but whenever Aaron and I watch Fox News, we had sex. We've had we didn't realize we've had sex to Sean Hannity twice. And we're both like, we've permanently probably not going to be okay. You can't come back from that. But like, but whenever I'm watching that particular sermon from these high priests of whatever that weird religion is that they're giving sermons on whenever I hear that, it's amazing how much violence is in their language, how much they want to hurt and how much every single thing that they believe in depends on the isolation that you're talking about the condensation of the self and doing and doing individual identity. And also in it is a lot of fear that people like you are out there suggesting that there's a shift happening and it doesn't matter what you do to try to stop it. That to me what you're saying that's the part that's the most interesting is I never thought of it like that. I've always thought like, well, from like, it's a kind of socio it's a social shift that is going to result from a combination of connective technology, allowing folks to witness the world in ways it's never been seen before, producing compassion that or the very least questioning of lifestyle that could lead to transformation. But I never thought of it as like, the way you're describing it sounds more like a flood or a shift in like, you know, how the sun goes into solar maximum and solar minimum. It sounds more like, is that what you're talking about like almost like a complete shift in the planet itself? Yeah, well, I mean, the planet is interwoven with our consciousness. So yeah, so the planet will also change as a result, of course. I mean, I think the the technology part, well, let me put it this way, when I say it's coming, whether we like it or not, or what no matter what it's coming, that doesn't mean that it'll be pleasant for us, right? Like that doesn't so so the choices are not whether or not this kind of consciousness shows up. But, you know, the way I say it is, do you want 1000 years of human suffering? Or do you want like 20 years of work, and then to do well for and be happy for a really long time? Because, you know, 2033 is the actual millennium, because it's that's 2000 years after Christ died, right? So that's not so the resurrection is the thing that marks the turning. Yeah. So sometimes I use that as just a touch point. I mean, I'm not like a prophet, or I'm not going to get all my encounter or whatever. But I think it's important to have a date like that in mind sometimes to be like, all right, well, there's some sort of collective conscious thing around that date. So maybe, you know, that we might know even if we don't recognize it. So let's try to organize around that date. But so it's sort of it's more that the technology right now is unfortunately very adversarial. And it's because we don't know how to make it moral yet, we don't know how to engage with it in a moral way. So, you know, something that's good for people to do if they're listening, and you and I probably should have done this at the beginning, but it's like, you know, when you talk to someone on zoom or whatever, just be like, I'm a real live person talking to you live right now. Like, let's let's look at it that way. Let's meet that way. My friend Marco Connell has this play called How to be a Machine that's based on his book, or to be a machine, I think it's called. And Jackie Gleason, the Joffrey from Game of Thrones was like plays my friend Mark in this play that was during lockdown. And it was really profound because he he just addresses because everybody's watching on their computers. And first of all, you take a picture of yourself. And then on the stage that he's on, you see pictures of yourself on these like iPads in the audience, which is pretty weird. But he says, Listen, this is I'm on a stage right now. I know you might think that this is television. It's not. I'm here. I'm talking even that simple act of drawing into the presence of this is a real live thing. I think people should do that on their zoom calls. But it's just to just we're going to have to learn moral ways to deal with the technology that's in place. But more than that, we're going to have to learn how to build and create moral technology, which is quite a feat. Given that right now, technology would seek to distort everything that we think we want all the progressive social agendas once they intersect with tech are going to be distorted and and sort of mangled and used against us, whether it's UBI or healthcare or whatever it might be, those things are all going to be utilized as ways to exploit us. Wow, man. The what you just said, it actually brings to mind a paranoid fantasy that I allow myself to indulge in from time to time, just to creep myself out. And one of the things that this sudden like digitization of connection to other people is one of the one of the possibilities it's produced, depending on how locked down, so to speak, you become is that you can't ask yourself when you're on the third zoom call of the day or on a conversation with someone that you can't see that's coming through a computer. Is this really my friend? How do I know that this isn't just some deep fake and that were like so like when the NSA and obviously I don't believe this, but when the NSA vacuumed up all data sets, when Google vacuumed up all the data, when the 23 and me and I got all the genome, all that stuff was used to essentially replicate reality and then pipe it back to each individual via their machines so that we have not even been talking to each other at all for a while now. The only time you know for sure you're talking to someone is if they're in your presence. Otherwise, you might be talking to an AI version of them that's being piped into you. I know that's not happening, but if I've eaten enough weed, you know what I mean? But it is happening. It is happening. Something I've learned about you is that your, over the years of knowing you, is that your crazy fantasies often reflect something that's really happening that people just that's already going on. I think it's like when you're talking to somebody and they're thinking about using Facebook while you're talking to them, that's that. You're not talking to that human being. What about all the times people walk down the street looking at things and framing them in their head as pictures for Instagram or coming up with a joke to tweet about or translating their experience into the machine? The machine doesn't, it doesn't take well it could and maybe the things you're talking about, they probably will happen and I'm sure there are plenty of fake accounts that we've interacted with and stuff, but the machine works by becoming an interlocutor between you and your experience, not by like standing in for you, it's standing in you, which is a different thing. Yeah, right, man. I love just starting a phone call me like, Hey, remember, I'm a person and you're a person, because there does seem to be something in the machine that has a sulfuric prismatic effect, you know, where just like what you're saying, all the good things, once they go through that particular series of wild transformations that are happening when your voice or your image is being converted to ones and zeros and piped into the into satellites and fiber optic cables, is that the code gets in there a little bit and warps it to some degree, you know, in that warping isn't just the warbles that you hear on zoom, which are already kind of weird that, you know, that bending thing when you're not getting enough uploads, but also, it's the color of Twitter, it's you know what I mean, it's the color of Instagram, it's the color of zoom, it's the way it's the font they've decided to use when you're wanting to type to your friend, and it's also the commercials that appear literally on Twitter, man, I took a screenshot of it today, Twitter did a poll, and the poll was, I'll read it to you, so like, you know, you're already going on to Twitter to look at these sort of, I guess a tweet is like a footprint of someone's mind that they left, and so above the, throughout the tweets, there's commercials, that's how Twitter makes money, but here's a Twitter survey, Twitter survey, Twitter would like your feedback, which of the following do you most associate with music experiences and benefits, American Express, Capital One, Chase, City, none of the above? All of the above? When I think of music, I think of American Express, that's the first thing that comes to mind, but just in that survey is not really a survey, it's a message, and the message is saying, your credit cards are music, and it's like, I couldn't have, if someone was like Duncan, I'm trying to write a diabolical satanic text of blasphemies, and I wonder if you could come up with a verse or two, I would never have come up with something so satanic, and I always feel bad saying satanic, because some of my friends are brilliant satanists, and they're sweet, you know, we need a better word than Satan, but like, you know, so fucked up, that it's like, yeah, you know, for my best music experiences, they used to be with AmEx, but now Chase for sure. Totally, totally. Well, that's, I mean, that's the, so when it, when the, so when the, when you and I are talking to each other right now, when you talk to somebody on the phone or whatever, yeah, all that translation's happening into something that looks like, or is a sort of more physical representation of numbers of zeros and ones and all that, but also let's not forget that like, the message is intersected with the oblivion of space, right? It literally is being pushed into a place where, that is completely anti-human, the oxygenless, soundless, materialist, you know, void of space, that enters in, and then it comes back to us, so it brings the void with it every single time. Oh God, you mean you're kind of like boomeranging your consciousness into a, into a computer chip, which is just a compressed void? Is that what you mean? I mean space itself, I mean space, like it goes into a satellite, it goes into space. Oh Jesus Christ. So it's like, you know, I mean, I realize that that's still like, there's wherever that's in the ionosphere above, but it's, it's intersecting with a completely anti-human environment, like just by virtue of that, right? And then it's, and then it's bringing that in, you know, if I, if I'm standing outside and I, and we're at the beach and the waves are roaring and I yell at you through the waves, you know, like, I have to talk a different way and the message sounds different and it brings different things with it, right? So it's, it's bringing that, it's bringing that through. And that's brilliant. And so, and so the space message of Chase Bank, the band, you know, I mean, maybe they aren't like a band in oblivion, you know, who knows? Credit card companies are alien rock and roll bands on tour through our planet. Wow, man. That is so interesting. It's like every time you communicate with someone in this way, yeah, you're, you become like a little hailstorm of tiny, tiny little granules of the void of oblivion that are being projected into our little sector of existence by our technology, man. That is so absolutely bizarre. Well, then what, so, so, I mean, obviously we don't have much of a choice here, do we? I mean, what are we going to do? We have to overcome it. Like, what do you mean, like, sort of filter it out, understand it's there and then figure out ways to filter it out? Is that what you mean? No, no, I mean, like, so here's a detour and then I'll get back to it. So, so here's a materialistic idea of food. Okay. Food is like, you are what you eat. So you eat food. It is like it has these kinds of, you know, carbs and proteins and these antioxidants and all that kind of stuff. And then it turns into physical tissue or whatever through the process of eating it. Now, that's not what happens. What happens is all food is poison. You introduce the poison to your body. Your body produces spiritual forces that overcome the poison, the spiritual poison, the nexus of poisons that you've introduced. And those spiritual forces build up what we call bodies through their action of absolutely destroying the poison. So why am I bringing, I know maybe that's a weird concept, but like, let's see if we can come back to it. So like, so what happens when these messages come into us? And I mean the message in the way that it's translated into this weird, like combination jumble of sounds that we're not really used to hearing with our ears, the way that space and oblivion is brought into the message, the way that, you know, all those other things that you were talking about, like the weird zoom seals, you know, like quiver sound and the all that kind of shit, all that comes in and we have to overcome it, right? And we do overcome it to some extent. And we also overcome like the Wi-Fi signals, 5G, all that kind of shit that is coming. But it becomes more and more difficult to take all of that in. And so we're going to have to do training, which is mostly spiritual training to generate the forces within us that can overcome the things that enter into us. Yeah. And we can do that with almost anything, by the way, but it takes, because we're the favored things on this planet. I mean, we're the addresses of consciousness of God here. So we've got to go into a kind of, but we've got to go into a kind of training to make that happen. What does that training look like? Well, it's different for everybody. So that's part of the problem. Everybody has a different spiritual task. Some things work better than others. I mean, obviously, it's like the foundation of doing meditation, contemplation, all that. That always helps, you know, and whatever way you want to do that, even if it's, I mean, maybe don't use an app for that. But like, even if you want to do it with an app, that's fine. But I think that the training is different for each challenge. It's a little hard to say, Duncan, because it is so different for everybody. It's so different for everybody. If I led two people through the same exact spiritual development course, they would have completely different results to each level of that development. I was just curious if there's like a specific, you know, like, because one thing you're saying, which is so brilliant, is that, you know, we are confronting something that at least in form is new. I mean, when is humanity ever had to wrestle with this fascinating problem of connectivity being warped by code, you know, the sort of script of essentially wizards casting spells via the framework through which we are connecting. And yeah, this code has gotten completely amashed in us. And this is a new problem. I mean, I know that though you could say the earth is a centrifuge, and that as part of being on this amazing centrifuge, we sort of blend. But now this idea of like blending in with matter in this deep way, it's kind of the form is new, isn't it? So that to me means that, and I know, I know many people who have said to me, actually, everything's pretty much the same as it was when Buddha got gained realization. But you know, I don't, when I think about Buddha gaining realization, I know that one thing he didn't think about upon becoming the great world turner was like, shit, I got to tweet this. You know, like, I just got enlightened, man. So like, so this is a new thing and meaning that, yeah, I could see how an entire new spiritual tradition would spring up to help people begin to sort of work through this alchemy that you're talking about. You know, I never thought of eating as poison. But yeah, like, if you don't think eating is poison, you know, see what happens if you like inject a ham sandwich into your arm. You're fucked, man. Puree some trout and inject it into your neck and see what happens. You know, so, so yeah, I get it, man, like we need the, we have to like transform our food. And then that that it's interesting that you're saying the conflict grows our body. And as I'm following that idea, I guess the next question I would have for you is, then what is the body that is going to be formed from this conversion of the poison of technology into, I guess, connectivity? What body is growing from this, Connor? What is the form that is growing out of this? Well, so we can get a little bit of a picture of it if we understand that the thing that we're overcoming isn't physical in the same sense as food is. Now, food's not physical either. Like, I mean, I'm trying to more and more just get people to think as much as I can in completely non materialistic ways. So let's just walk away from materialism entirely. So, so I have a little, you know, I'm just adding that caveat there when I'm saying, oh, it's different than the physicality. But as a different form, right, obviously, you can see microwaves are not the same as a peach, right? So in their density and their presence and the way we detect them, all that kind of stuff. So that's the first thing to understand. It's like, as we train ourselves to overcome invisible forces, as opposed to physical ones. So we overcome the physical ones and it builds something, you know, the things that look physical, like the peach, the broccoli, you know, the ham sandwich, whatever, and it builds something that looks like a physical body in response. So as we overcome these, we will be building some kind of invisible body that, you know, is interwoven with the cosmos in a different way. Like when you're talking about like these black magicians or wizards or whatever doing, you know, these these code things, like think about that. That is new. We've actually changed the tone of the air itself. You know, it's swimming with the invisible forces now in a way that it wasn't before. And and the thing, so the people that say the Buddhist, I mean, that's just, it's just incorrect. I mean, God bless them, but that's just, it's not true. And I, and I see Buddhist actually saying stuff like that all the time. And it frustrates me because they're not recognizing the limits of Buddhism. But the, but the Buddha also, or the Buddhists, and so on and so forth, that there's not the conscious piece of the entire globe at the same time, right? So we also have that piece to deal with. Like, actually, we have seen the planet Earth, you know, you know, it's the we took a picture of it. And the astronaut that was up there put it, whether that was a conspiracy or not, but the astronaut put his thumb up and said, everything I know is behind my thumb, which is a great metaphor for what we do with our phones now. But you know, and how we operate them with our thumbs. But the, but the fact is the planet is now part of our consciousness. And that was not before. And so that also brings us another challenge to overcome. So these are thought constructs, they're invisible constructs, they're the changing of different physical constructs. So as we build sort of above those, we will become a higher kind of a, how do I say, like a, well, yeah, like a more Christ-like or a more loving version of those things. Wow. I want to put in the italics what you said regarding the air swimming with data, how that is something that I just, I think people don't want to think about because it's so fucking weird to just think at any given moment, how many emails are washing up against your body, going through your body, how many stock orders, how many dick pics, how many dick pics at any given moment. It is, it is like moving through us. Like, you know, I remember, you may have, I may have been you appointed this, I don't know, so a friend of mine, who was really smart and mystical like you, just pointed out the simple reality of like, when we were in New York, the little, the rivers of shit right underneath the city, you know, just like rivers of shit and piss right under any city that you don't see, but they're there. And then you add to that all the many dead bodies around you at any given moment. And then add to that the fact that you are being vibrated by dick pics all day long. Doesn't it go through us? Or does it bounce off of us? Do these data feeds, do they go into our, are they, or do they? Oh, they go in. Yeah, they go in, man. Like, that's what, I mean, that's how that's how the tech works is it has to go through solid matter. That's how you can get Wi-Fi in your house, right? Like it has to go through the walls, right? So the, you know, I mean, it's interesting, isn't it? Like the Fantastic Four is a story about, you know, four people go into space and like cosmic rays go through them. And then they have things that are very much like the occult bodies. Like there's a mineral, the thing, there's like the etheric body of, you know, the invisible woman, there's the astral body of the, you know, human torch, and there's the ego body of the, you know, so anyway, that's just all to say, like these things will pronounce our understanding of actual anatomy. So that goes back to the original point. Um, you know, and as far as overcoming those, yes, so those are, those are going through you. Those are going through you constantly. So we've got to figure out a way to deal with that. And something nobody ever talks about, and I don't know why nobody talks about this, maybe because it's bullshit. That's why nobody talks about it, but we'll see. Which is like, you know, with the thing with 5G that's really interesting to me, and with microwaves in general, is that they send waves through, I'm hopefully getting this correct. They send waves through solid matter and waves, the waves that are longer, the sounds counterintuitive, but the waves that are longer that are carrying the information can carry less information, but they can go through matter more easily. So if you just imagine like the longer a wave, the more possible it is for it to come unbroken through a wall, right? So with 5G, it's like little tiny, like teeny, teeny tiny bits, but they can carry more information, but they can't pass through matters easily, which is why you have to set up these mini cell bases everywhere, because you have to have more and more, right? But the thing that people don't talk about is with the rise of the miniaturization of the waves, we've been talking more and more in blips, and art has been happening in flashes, and there's been a difficulty in sort of keeping to a certain point to sustaining a thought. So everybody talks about those cultural reasons, or it's the internet, but it's actually like the way that the information is coming in is a constant flip book that is constantly breaking our attention by the very substance that is printed on, which is the wave. So I mean, to me, that's the other challenge too, is how do we make something, how do we create a continuous consciousness when all the information is being given to us in like hyper flip book form. So some of that training involves continuity, draw, like this sounds so silly, but draw. See, this is an experiment for people, because it actually helped me, I was having trouble sleeping. So I started drawing in continuous lines, like I would draw like an elephant, but just with one line and try to get as much as possible. I would sing like long notes, I would try to write and read longer sentences, that kind of stuff, create a sense of continuity and sustained flow movement, and see if you sleep better. That's so cool, man. I never thought of that. If consciousness is attention, if our attention, the longer our attention is held on this thing or that, the more continuity there will be. And yeah, that is getting broken up in the most extreme way, because we're constantly compressing ourselves down into our devices, and then uncompressing into reality, going back into the devices. Whoa, very interesting. Like it's almost like a stroboscopic kind of teleportation leaping into the world of our phones and the news and then back out into this world, then in and out. It's like, God, think how fucked up that would be if like dolphins started doing that, if whales started breaching. You know what I mean? Too fast. So they were going up and down, up and down, up and down. You would be so terrified, would be worried about them, but that's kind of what we're doing. We're coming into this world for a little, some people grudgingly, and then jumping right back into whatever the particular data sphere is, and then coming back out into this world with generally like, you know, people are annoyed, you know, like when you have to stop whatever it is you're doing to go attend a life. So it's not just that we're doing this stroboscopic back and forth, but for many people, the return to the planet is painful. Totally. And what happens when you do the same movement repeatedly in rapid succession with a small break in between, again and again and again and again and again and again. You heat things up. You heat things up. And so, you know, I'm not going to make great claims about climate change here, but it's important for us to consider the consciousness aspect of the phenomena that we observe around us. And you're saying it's producing a kind of friction that that, wow. You know, well, I mean, it's, you know, and there's plenty of solid and sort of mainstream, so we don't have to go down the rabbit hole, research on how Wi-Fi and certain hurts, you know, affect insects and how it heats their bodies up. And it probably does not do that to human beings in the same way, although it seems to cause other health problems, which unfortunately, the ways that these technologies are reviewed is only looking for the heat stuff. But when you look at insects, there seems to be a pretty large agreement from entomologists that like these heat insects bodies up, creating infertility and all sorts of other things, I believe. But just go look into that yourself. Don't take my word for it. I'm just a mumbling lunatic about this. You don't sound like a mumbling lunatic to me. Well, then the space rays heated the bees up and fires were caused and food is all poisoned. It's like Nostradamus. But you see, anyway, heating is also a capacity or something that's happening right now in the world. And we need to look at a consciousness component of that, rather than just trying to constantly locate it in whatever physical thing, materialistic thing we can put a band-aid on. And why would it show up in this turn of events? Why is it arising for us? It's something else that we need to think about. People love to say that they're having a spiritual approach and then give materialistic answers to things. And to me, the only thing we can do is stop thinking about things materialistically. That's the only way out. And one of the ways you do that is that people are fond of saying, well, we need to have completely new solutions to these problems. We need to rethink. We need new solutions. We need to come up with completely new ways to think. And they do that Einstein quote or whatever. But the thing is, if you want to build the world from the ground up again, it's not just the solutions that are completely wrong. The problems are wrong too. You got the wrong idea of the problems. They're not the problems that you think they are. So we need a complete rethink and walking away from materialism, which again is inevitable, but it's just going to happen. So get yourself ready for it is, I think, the best way to approach. Yeah, that are you saying like ownership, like the perception of ownership is on the way out as we understand what it means to own something or do you and also I don't mean consumerism. I mean materiality, like that there's stuff and objects. That's not true. Like there's no material. There's no matter. You know, when people say, well, does God exist? No, the question has to be, does matter exist? There's no proof for it. So we need to reevaluate that and start. Okay, so the David Nick turn who is my meditation teacher, we talk about absolute and relative reality a lot. So from absolute reality, I see what you're saying, but from relative reality, in other words, as we are right now, we are kind of cradled in density. You know what I mean? Like matter density. Yeah, like I'm sitting in a chair that's denser than me. It's dense and that's why I'm able to sit in it. It's not a steam or a fog, though I would love to sit in a fog, you know, but and so in that sense, there is matter. I guess I'm having trouble following you. Yeah, yeah. Well, so let's let's let's do this. Let's do the chair. Okay, use the word density. Yes. How are you experiencing as you sit on the chair? I mean, you can close your eyes. Tell me what you're experiencing. Okay, I've got a, let's see, one of my with the chair. One of my elbows is on the arm of the chair. Is it okay? So just let's stop there because that's a big claim. Is it on the arm of the chair or are you experiencing something? What are you experiencing? I'm experiencing the feeling of my gimp as he continues to give me the blow job he's been giving me. I'm just kidding. I had to. I'm so sorry. No, I'm experiencing the I'm experiencing my elbow against my jacket. It's it's actually on the chair. So there's kind of like a soft fabric underneath my elbow. Yeah, so let's let's roll that back a little bit and try to talk about the experience rather than naming the objects. Okay. Right. So like, I don't want to put words in your mouth. So I'm just going to tell you about what I'm experiencing right now with my eyes closed on this chair. I'm experiencing a region, which if I were in what you're calling this other version of reality, I would say is my butt, right? But I'm experiencing a region of pressure. Yeah, I'm experiencing a region of pressure that's meeting partially what yeah, that's it. I'm experiencing a region of pressure. So I'm experiencing a thought or I'm having an experience of a kind of welling realm of pressure and a certain area of my consciousness. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See what I mean? So if you can do that with the connectivity of where you are touching the chair or what you're calling the chair, that's how we start talking about real experience. So maybe I would just say do that now and see how it see how it feels and if we have to cut this part out. No, I like this exercise. It's I yeah, if I just look at it fully just from that sense. Yeah, it's just it's definitely like places. One, two, three, four. And then of course my the region of my feet are I see or say it's like these experiential kind of like, I don't know how to put it dimples or warps or something that that that are, you know, from this perspective, I see I see what you're saying. It's like a that's so trippy, man. Weird is that it's really weird. You're like stripping away. The one of the ways that I would crystallize reality into matter. Totally. And it doesn't mean that the other stuff's not real. The concept of the chair is real. But it has a different kind of reality and and aspect and contour to it than the percept of the chair, right, or the percept of sitting. So right now there are these yeah, dimples, warps, I like that these sort of involving contact points that you can't even really locate in space when you close your eyes, which is also sort of the thing. It's like, where are those. So that's where you start getting into an idea of something is happening here that's I could collectively put together a bunch of parts and say that's reality. But if I start looking into my experience, something weirder is happening. And that can start leading me away from materialism because I'm like, okay, there are these tones of expression that I, you know, call feeling, but there are these tones of expression. And there are these interceding concepts that connect to the tones of expression. And when I build those together and open my eyes, I'm sitting in a chair. Wow, man, you can do it with sight. You can do it with hearing. You can do it with feeling, taste, anything. But when you start doing that kind of radical phenomenology, that's what I say the occult is really just radical phenomenology, you then begin to move away from the material conception. So I've done that now for years and years. And so now the material world is just really fucked up. It blinks in and out for me. And yeah, this blinking in and out this what you're talking about is something that I've intuited. And I am often like really perplexed by it. Because to me, the one of the insights I get from it is just a sense of there being this kind of vast space. I don't know if it's better that the stuff we're calling matter kind of like veils or mists over or something. And then within that, this new kind of dimensionality, you know what I'm talking about? Like a sense of there being even a thing that whatever the eye that I am from outside of matter can weirdly navigate in or something like, but that becomes really for me a little off putting in the sense of like shit, man, I don't want to swim away from my you know, whatever the particular nexus of experience that I've determined to be me is. Do you know what I'm saying? Like there's this fuck, can you just swim away from it? Can you just sort of leave it behind? Is there some possibility that you could, you as you understand it, would just continue on with your life. But that part of you that was considering that locus as you would just like, see you later. I'm out. That was fun. But I've got other places to go fly away into the background. Do you know what I'm saying? Does that make sense? 100%. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So two things. One is for people listening, I do a whole like experiment with this with site with Pete, Pete Holmes on my show, actually, we spent like 20 minutes just talking about site and what's actually happening experientially there is pretty mind blowing. It was great. And I think you just have to look up that episode Connor be Pete Holmes. But the so so I'm offering that as a way for people to do something right now, if they listen to that, because site is one of the seemingly more difficult, but then it starts getting really interested in weird when you do it, when you close your eyes. Would you feel weird repeating it with me? Do you want to repeat it with me or do you feel like that produces a redundancy? No, no, let's do it. Let me answer your question and then let's try it. Okay. I mean, I was in the same room as Pete when we did it. So it'll make a little bit of a difference, but that's okay. So then the other thing is, so if you think about words on a page, there are symbols, which are letters that strung together make words that strung together make sentences with spaces strung together, make paragraphs and make a book, etc. etc. The physical world, what we call the physical world is an intersection of combinatorial spirits that present a certain kind of reading, because we know how to read the language in a certain way. So just like those letters, words, sentences, paragraphs form a book, these spirits come together and create a certain reading of the world. And that's our experience of it. And interestingly, I think the reading metaphor continues on because when you're a kid, before you can read, think about how weird that was. There are all these weird symbols all around you that just mean fucking nothing. And you don't even really pay attention to them. And then suddenly you can read and meaning springs out everywhere in a different way and you can't undo it. So that's kind of what happens. It's like, yeah, you move away, but you gain all these new tones of meaning. So you can't necessarily unimaginate it, but you get all this other stuff in. So it creates all this new stuff and it's really cool. And these new adventures and these stories and this new way of being. So yeah, I mean, you wouldn't want to learn to unread again. So it's, you know, you can understand, I mean, maybe some people do, but you can understand why you wouldn't want to go back after you gain this new way of apprehending meaning in the world. Temporarily corners and contras and meeting. It'd be cool to temporarily and like, yeah, the, well, you can't read in your dreams. So that's fun. I mean, mostly, you know, so it's like there will still be pockets. Yeah, you know, this is something I was thinking about earlier today. It's just my thoughts are in English and how weird that is. And then how instant, like, what, what language was I thinking in before I learned English? And that, or the, what's the precursor state before the imposition of language, the tyranny of language takes my thinking stuff and forces it into the labor camps of English, you know, you get this free, wild sense of something and energy. And then it gets smashed down into language. And then that's what you hear is your thoughts. Well, sort of. So I feel like I'm being really contrarious on this episode, but, but I love, but I love everything you're saying. It's like all these like prompts for me. It's been a weird couple years, man. I mean, I moved to Ireland and I'm largely by myself, you know, 24 hours a day. So I have had a lot to think about the, so language, language isn't content. I think this is the, this is the thing that's confusing for people, and especially philosophers, they really overemphasize what language is language is a positive. This is good. I'm going to tell you how magic works. So, you know, when people say like a word and like a, you know, fantasy novel, whatever they say the word and the magic happens, right? And people think it's the word itself that's causing the thing. But that's not what's happened. You know, abracadabra means I, as I speak, I create. That's what that word means, right? So that's, let's say a magical word. Words, when we speak them, are positive voids. This is someone else described it to me this way, but let's just say they're positive voids. And they're positive voids from which spiritual beings emerge. So collections of words tend to evoke a different kind of spiritual presence. Collect different kinds of languages tend to evoke different spiritual presences. It's like the way that this guy, Scott Elliott Hicks described it is you have a boom tube like in DC Comics where like there's this empty tube and dark side and his minions come out of it, right? It like makes this sound and then these things arrive. But we can say everything that comes out of our mouths is creating a shape, a pathway, a portal for things to emerge from and the different contours of each word depending on the way we carve the air with our mouth and so on and so forth is conducive to a different spiritual form arising. So speech is an act of spiritual force that controls or contours or engages with the positive void of words. So when we're doing that thinking and thoughts, really what we're... Shit, hold on. When we're doing that thinking of thoughts and words, what's occurring is the noticing inwardly of the arrival of spirits through their pores. So when we speak a word, when we speak a word, when we engage with something magically through a word, what we're doing is infusing ourselves with the contour of the portal to evoke a certain response through the arrival and presence of spiritual being. Wow. Yeah. That really explains mantra to me better than any other explanation I've heard of it. That is so wild, Connor. That is so wild. It's so interesting. I feel like I'm talking to Zarathustra or something. You've been up in a so kind of... You've been up in some kind of cave burning incense and getting slowly enlightened out there. Really cool, man. You've always done this to me. You are a living psychedelic and anytime we podcast, I inevitably feel like, oh man, this was not a micro dose. There's a few people I podcast with where I'm always excited about it, but I'm excited about it in the way I get excited about LSD. You know what I mean? There's a little bit of dread associated with it. Not because the experience is not enjoyable, but because it's powerful and that's... It can be a lot. It can be a lot. This way of reframing things, but this is actually something I've been sort of praying for and wondering about. Because there is... Lately, I have been brushing up against the confines or the constrictions of what I'm gradually, slowly realizing are just my notions about the way things are. Also, I've felt a little... I don't want to say embarrassed, but just a general sense of like, God, you sure... Just like what you were saying up front, this kind of weird certainty that I lean into regarding everything, this general... Which is ultimately a kind of stagnation. So that's why I love chatting with people like you, because you specifically, because you are really good at breaking those stagnant forms apart. Do you think that you have time to do the... Maybe if not a sight exercise, a hearing exercise, or... Either one. I think the sight one's probably better. And I have as much time as you want, because it's 6.30 and I just drank like three coffees. Oh my God, you drink coffee at night. Or is it more... Only when I do podcasts. Conor Habib, that is the most controversial thing you've told me that you do. Okay, so let's... Let's do it, man, because I think it's a great way to wrap this up. And maybe before we do it, let's get the business stuff out of the way. Because are you currently giving classes right now? Are you... Oh, I'm not giving classes. I mean, I'm just doing the show, really. So that's against everyone with Conor Habib. And there's the Patreon, patreon.com forward slash Conor Habib. And that's my main... That's my main gig. I mean, I have a novel, but it's not coming out till late next year from Norton in the U.S. and Penguin Double Day here in Ireland. Fiction? But fiction, yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a very gruesome, dark, gruesome and dark book. Can't wait. And I'm working on another book right now about the occult, but that's going to be quite a bit down the line. But I do all kinds of like sermons and stuff like that with my Patreon patrons about these things. I call them sermons because I think people want theological language right now. And yeah. So that's that. Thank you. Okay, let's do this sermon or meditation or practice whatever you want to call it. And thank you very much Conor. Yeah, of course, man. And this is just an experiential thing. Okay, so anybody can do this. And it's so simple. Okay, so let's start with the behind world. All right? Okay. What do I mean by that? You have an entirely different experience, Duncan, I would assume, of what's in front of you, then what's behind you. Okay. And that's a result of sight. So I want you to just, let's move into that space by taking that in. Okay. What does that feel like? What's the difference? Literally a kind of, so there's a sense of almost like a weird kind of magnetic pull or something when I put my attention where I can't like to the behind world. Like I could, yeah, it's not a comfortable feeling. Like it's a, it's a, you know, yeah, as I'm doing it, I kind of, yeah, it's making me think, God, it's like I almost expend a lot of energy to try not to think about everything that's behind me that I can't see. So now slowly, just I'm doing this differently with you than I do with Pete, but just slowly just turn around and tell me the experience of that. I'm turning around and, yeah, well now, I'm looking out over this beautiful view of some mountains in the little town that formerly was completely a void. And now the void is behind me again, Connor. It's completely evasive, isn't it? Yeah. It's like, and also like it's a sense of like, I mean, just, just probably because you have my imagination roaring right now. It's like a feline quality, like a thing so nimble and graceful that it just jumps behind me instantaneously. Yeah. So I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll analyze that in a certain way. So you can come back to sort of an initial place. Okay. So now, so that's just, that's just one way to start getting into this, right? It was, is like, just notice the experience. Now here's, here's the one that I love the most. I want you to just get in touch with the fact that you can't see your face. Okay. Yeah. So what's happening with your site now that you know you can't see your face? I wouldn't say like a change is happening in my site, but somewhere in the imaginative overlays I'm seeing like, I'm trying to understand what my experience of having a face is. What is that? Well, it's just realizing that one of the fundamental mechanisms I use to express to other people, I'm completely blind to, and that this whole time I've been producing a kind of proxy face that I haven't spent any amount of time considering at all, a sort of like yeah, like a weird, yeah, it's an inner, it's an energy form. And like, it seems like it's, yeah, it's making me see it as like a bundles of energy that I formerly didn't question at all. Thanks, Connor, for this. I managed to not think about this. I think you may have mentioned it to me in a former podcast that I am probably immediately just got drunk to not think about it. Totally. That's batting the mushroom way because that is an immediate switch for psychedelic experience. So anybody can do that at any moment. Now, now you're, now let's do another one. So we're doing very short versions of this because we can do any one of these for hours. So now look ahead, okay, whatever's in front of you. And I want you to ask yourself a question. Sorry to do this one to you. This is, this one's fucked. Are you seeing space between things? In other words, is there depth in sight? Like, can you see if there's a computer in front of you and a wall behind the computer or whatever? Can you see that depth? Yeah, I remember you did this to me once, Connor, and it fucked me up. Damn it. No, I mean, no, I know. I forgot about this on purpose. What? I don't think I did this one with you, but maybe I did. So what do you, what are you seeing? Well, now that we're messing around with my delicious non non stuff, now that you've taken away that, it's just like color. We're looking at kind of a field of color. It's color, varying degrees of color. And let's actually go, let's, let's go, let's go further than I even went with. Podcaster Duncan Trussell found curled in the fetal position of his studio. With his eyes torn out by forks. What, what is the color? What is, yeah, what is color? What's happening there? How is that? How are you seeing that? How is that coming to you? What, what's Well, it's, it's, it's nice. Like I like it. I like color. So it's this, like I'm looking at, you know, my Ableton where I'm recording this and I'm seeing this nice shade of yellow with the wave form of our conversation appearing on it. That's brown, which I didn't just know. I didn't notice that until just now that, oh yeah, it's brown. It's like a nice, but they've done it on purpose. You know, it's like they've chosen these colors. They go nicely with each other. And then I have my flashing modular synths and the, you know, it's very cool. It's very beautiful in here. What it is, it drives me crazy to think I have never spent any time considering it. What it is, it's, well, I guess it's distinguished by where it stops. Okay. Yeah. And if I'm, so I'm looking at a wall right now that has green on it and white, right? So I'm trying to look at something, not the computer for myself. And I noticed that when I look at the green and when I look at the white and there, yeah, there's the place where each one of them stops, although that's a little confusing because they're also overlaid with what I would normally call shadow. So there's a blending of the colors slightly or there's a bridge between them. But the green is giving something to me that the white doesn't and vice versa. Yeah. Right. Color, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, let's, let's just break out of this for a sec. Okay. So color, color is giving something to you and has given something to you your entire life, which is an inner experience. Color has given that to you freely your entire life. And so when we look at, when we look and we see that depth actually is not a site process, it's a, it's a, it's a process, it's real, but it's not a product, it's not a product of site. We see that there's a color against a color against a color. And so we're seeing infinite ways of giving unto us that have been there our entire life. That's so lovely. It's nice, right? That's so cool. Connor, I love you, man. You're the best. I love you too, man. And I think it's just like, if you just, if people would just do this for five minutes, like, not, you know, sorry, for whatever people's religious experiences are with mushrooms or LSD or whatever, who the fuck needs it? Like this shit is fucking crazy. So the compositional forces behind you and in front of you are different. That's crazy. Like just start doing this stuff. Anyway, I love it. I know you were probably like, I love you. That's the episode. But I wanted to add that and also say I love you. You are so great, man. You are great. You really are.

And we're with the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. Our greatest responsibility is to serve our communities. I am extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast produces, but I'm concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of bias and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first. Unfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy. At Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, it is our responsibility to report and pursue the truth. We understand the truth is neither politically left nor right. Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever. We are human and sometimes our reporting might fall short. If you believe our coverage is unfair, please reach out through our Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast website by clicking on content concerns. We value your comments and we will respond back to you. We work very hard to seek the truth and strive to be fair, balanced, and factual. We consider it our honor and privilege to responsibly deliver the news every day. Thank you for watching and we appreciate your feedback. And don't forget, you are the Christ being crucified, hallucinating your human experience, and the sorrow you are experiencing is the suffering of the Christ. When I'm not in my plane, I'm smoking righteous bowls, getting stoned and laughing at the lies that Blitzer says. Don't you know the earth is flat and everyone is dead? You all are zombies. Your children they're enjoy to be seen the peace of gate. I know that it sounds scary, but it's really a beautiful thing. Golden bars and pepperoni, cheese and pineapple all day.

Everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast, Karen Kilgaran. I can count as high as 60 or 70. Yes, I can. I can get up there. You know, as I was researching you, I actually found that and I love I think you're a genius. Thank you. Thank you so much. Brilliant. But I did not. I've never met anyone who can do it. Right. No, I get it. And I do get insecure really like putting that out there. But it is fun to say, you know, like it's an accomplishment. I can count to sometimes 80. It's something I can do. No, I know. It's just it's always been there. It feels like I'm the vessel. It's the numbers come through me. So what I've heard is like you get like the runners high from when you get up there, right? Like past 60, you start getting weird. You get at first you feel like it's that like blood sugar drop feeling where you get shaky. But then there's a surge in like the low 70s that's really hard to explain it. That's it's the drug. It's like what you get back for. Yeah. And then right when you press up against 80, it's like that's when you sing the colors. That's when your animal familiars come. They call it the Cartesian warp, right? Math improv scares me because I'm the biggest phone. I'm like, what if he says something real? I can only do this for four more minutes about math. Shit. All I know is Cartesian. I don't know what it is. It's the best word though. That's like that's a math professor word. Oh yeah. I mean, this is like, and you know, lately I've been trying to make the podcast a little more Cartesian, right? Yeah. Oh, Fibonacci spiral. Oh, yes. That's one you can blast out there. Yeah. Isn't there isn't that a the sequence of numbers? It's a sequence of numbers. It's apparently like the it's the shape of it's like this beauty. It's like the shell shape. People are yeah, people are symmetrical. Their faces match the fucking Fibonacci spiral. Those lucky fuckers. Those assholes. That's why do you you know, do you have you watched the notebook recently? No, I saw it in the theater. I had I no one told me what it was about. I thought it was just like a fun rom-com. My mother had just been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. So I had the kind of sobbing thing at the end of that movie. But here's the cool thing. I was with my boyfriend at the time. He was super cool. I was like, I need to stay here for like five minutes because I'm losing my shit. And right as I came out of my sob, which is like kind of what that movie's for, I looked around the movie theater and there was like, I would say four little islands of criers that were still in their seats, just fucking like wracked sobbing. Yeah. So I'm never going back to the notebook. Well, yeah, that's a tough one to revisit. Like, I can't, you know, it to this day, like any cancer or anything that pops up, it's just like, it's, it's trauma, you know, it's trauma. It is trauma. It's just basic trauma. Yeah. And it's, it's your body doesn't want to like deal with it. Fuck no. But my body doesn't want to fucking deal with the notebook. Not because of trauma. It's because of the symmetry, man. Yes. It annoys me. It's like, I'm, you mean both of those people? They're all these beautiful people humping out in the fucking wilderness, you know, and it's like, you know, mysterious jobs, like they're in these beautiful homes. It's like, what are you doing? What are they? How are you making this dough? And then she's like painting with her shirt off. And it's like, I guess that's what they're going to do forever. These symmetrical people, those fucking, yeah, it's they, it's almost like two perfect puzzle pieces fitting together that absolutely excludes you. Yes. Like when I watch movies like that, I do get like Rachel McAdams is perfect faced. Yes. When I look at her, I'm like, Oh, that's what everyone wants to look like. Yeah. So then when I see her having a great time, I'm like, well, I guess I don't get to have that. Yeah. If you don't qualify for Rachel McAdams symmetry, you feel left out of that dimension. Yeah. It's these two statistical anomalies, or, you know, like completely on the point one percentile of like Fibonacci spiral face implants and like, Oh, sure. Oh, sure. They met and they're having they're having a love triangle. Yes. I wish they would. I don't know. I sound like I'm a player hater. Look, if I could warp my face into some beautiful symmetrical thing, I do it in a fucking second. I feel like if I was a classic say LA hot girl, I would be the worst person. Like, remember when in the like late 90s, when supermodels, they started putting them in like documentaries and stuff, and you started hearing them talk, and you're like, Oh, no, you're the worst person. Yes. Like really shrill voices and bad senses of humor. I feel like that would be me times 1000. I'm glad you said classic LA hot girl, because you didn't exclude yourself from being hot, because you're hot. And that's cool that you recognize that. That's really cool. Because it's like, that's a good thing to recognize. Because if because it's like, yeah. And because I don't think that's hot. I mean, like it's not up to me or whatever. But there's these beauty things that that people fall into that really start to look like, and maybe it's from living here too long. But you know, when you see like people with perfect faces, and you're like, Well, I bet she's actually 70. Because that's what everybody in Beverly Hills looks like. Yeah, you know, those like, when you get the work done too well, and suddenly it's like, you've just flipped yourself over into like the surgeons wife category, where you're you're shopping at Fred Siegel, and you wearing your daughter's jeans, and you can't let go of your youth. Yeah, which is not attractive. Well, this is so like this concept of, I think letting go of your youth. It's interesting, you know, because it's like the problem, if you want to call a problem, I think that we're going to start facing is like we get more advanced and with medical technologies, it's, you're going to be able to just be young look young forever. And there's going to be a just like what you said, like a stigma, it's going to become stigmatized, there's going to become these two groups of people, people who are proudly aging, and people who are like, no, I got to, I'm going to, I don't have to like age. I know people like that transhumanists, they're like, it's the right thing is to extend the human lifespan. The right thing is to reverse age if you can, why not? Sure. I mean, I can, for somebody who is I can, I can now see myself aging, I'm approaching middle age. I get I don't judge like wanting to look younger anymore the way I used to. Of course, when I was like 25, I'd be like those fucking phonies. And it's like, the only thing is you have to get the right kind of work. So you don't look like you had work. That's the best work is when you still look natural. Yeah, that's right. And I think that it's just that kind of like I have that fear is, you know, in the, you know, say 10 years ago, everyone's like fillers are the answer. And then 10 years past, fillers start floating around people's faces. The thing you think is making you beautiful is now making you look insane. Yeah. And you, it's like your time stamp is like, you know, 2004, boom, that's the last time you were pretty. Yeah, or some or like, you look like you're trying, which is not attractive, not attractive. And it's I think probably all that being said, like the real tragedy of that is that people are missing out on this thing that can like, I know people, I go to these Ram Dass retreats. And there's women there who are in their 60s and 70s. And they are stunning. Yeah. And because they're radiating just they're glowing, they're like, and I'm not saying that in like a, oh, how like, oh, there's so stup, there's, you know, oh, this old person's view. I'm saying it's sexy. Like, there's like an authentic beauty there. And it's, and they're completely comfortable in the way they are. And that transcends symmetry, you know, well, I call that running clean, like when you're running clean, and you, and you do that kind of, I was doing Kundalini yoga a lot, you know, I have to start again, because I loved it so much. And I have this bad habit of if I really love something, and it feels good, I will never do it again. So I, there was a woman and I believe her name was Girmuk. And she was, she was the lady that kind of ran Goldenbridge yoga. And do you know who I'm talking about? She was gonna give me goosebumps now. Oh my God, I cannot believe you just mentioned her. Is that the person you were talking about? No, I was just, this is uh, oh, this is really weird, because I was just watching this documentary and she was in it. Yeah. And she's wonderful. And she said, don't die a student, die a teacher. And I thought she was just like really magnetic. And please go ahead. Well, you know, she's like in her late sixties. She looks like she's 35. Wow. And she, it was, this was the, the Kundalini DVD that I used to watch. She was the leader of it, or whatever. She was like, you know, doing all the poses or whatever. And part of the reason I was so into it is because I was like, if you can like clean up your diet and get a, like a good practice going, that's the skin you can have. You do not need to go to all these weird doctors or peel your fucking face off. Right. Because I was, I'm always like, I'm going to peel all the skin on my face off. Wow. And then you look at her and it looks like that's what she already did, because she's running so clean and she's like, she's like, it's just that yoga thing. Running clean. I love that. That's a great way to describe it. That's my new goal. Running clean. Yeah. I want to go back to the thing you said about how you don't continue to do things that you love and explore that. What is that? I do the same thing, but I'm, what do you think that is? Why are we resistant to these things that make us feel so, so great? I feel like mine is the hacky thing of I kind of like grew up like a bit of a miserable, uh, like the miserable fat girl. And I think that that is my set point. So anything that goes better than that, I get real. I don't trust it. Like I get real nervous and I feel like those are almost like, it's like a special circumstance to be in, to go like, wow, I'm proactively doing something good for myself. I, I'm making myself feel better. You know, it's just like, it's also alcoholic shit because I'm just like a died in the wool, you know, Irish Catholic alcoholic. So there's a lot of like self-flagellation and punishment for no reason. You're still drinking? No, no, no. I stopped drinking in 97. Okay. Okay. But it's in there. Oh yeah. It's, yeah. It just comes out now and all the other, you know, forms of things you can put inside yourself. Okay. Right. Yeah. Well, that's, I've thought about that, you know, because it's like when you're making those kinds of changes in your life, it's not just you that change changes, but it's your entire universe starts changing. Yeah. So it's almost like you're traveling into a different universe and that's a scary, scary thing to do because you have to say goodbye to like a lot of stuff, don't you? Yes. Like when you stop drinking, for example, like you have to leave that universe. You have to say goodbye to an entire constant, like a galaxy of friends, potentially. Yes. You have to say goodbye to like places that you normally go for a little while at least, right? Definitely. And like hiding places, like literal and figurative, you know what I mean? Like you start having to get vulnerable, which is the thing that I was avoiding intentionally by drinking. Like I was always trying to escape any kind of real risk. So then all of a sudden I drank my way into that exact thing I was running from, of course. Isn't it always that way? Yes. Yes. For sure. Yeah. Wow. And but this Kundalini is yoga is so profoundly powerful that sometimes when you run into that, into contact with that thing, I mean, it's always, for me, it's, it's, it's a very, a really slow, slow process for me because it's like this Jack Cornfield says, I said this last retreat, he said something like, be careful when you pray to the gods, because sometimes the gods show up. Yeah. And you don't really want that. No. You want to live in a, in a world where there, that shit isn't real. You know, you do know what I mean? It's, it's. Yeah, because your familiar role is the beggar, not the winner. Like that was, that's always my thing is like, I know exactly how to be, how to like have unrequited love. I know how to like ache across the city for somebody. I know all those things. But like, if somebody's standing in front of me, like, Hey, let's go do something. I fucking, it's like, it feels, I've always told myself, it's the opposite of what normal people do, which is like, that's when I can't be normal. Because I don't know how to do that correctly. Because all the time I should have learned how to do that. I was drinking wine coolers, you know, in the backseat of someone's car. So it's just all that like, it's hard to not know and be like, accept that you don't know and go into a learning position for me as a person who's like, controlling fear based anxiety based, controlling fear based anxiety based. I would say, okay, yeah. And, and, okay. Yeah, I just got, I'm sorry, I keep saying this because it blew my mind. I was reading this Pima Chodron book. She's the fucking, she saved my life like four times. She is the greatest. God, that's cool. You know, she is amazing hurts and your teacher is amazing. Chogum Trump is and this just an alcoholic, by the way. Is that true? Yeah. Chogum Trump, Trump was, he would drink, I think he drank all the way till the end. And, and, but, um, and it's an interesting thing to hear them talk about it because they're like, yeah, that's what he's like. Yeah. But she, um, one of the things she says is, um, people get into meditation thinking, I'm going to become a better person through this. Right. And what she says is like, no, it's not about becoming a better person. It's about accepting who you are right now. Yes. And as those things that you just mentioned, and as all that, and then just being like, oh, no, no, this is what I am. Yes. I am, I go, I am an anxiety, fear-based person who avoids love right now. And that's okay. Right. This is fine. And instead of playing the game with yourself, this is the game, right? I play the game with myself. Usually it involves like, I'm going to get in really fucking good shape. I'm going to get in great shape or some version of that, always something in the future, some finish line to cross where you run past it and you're like, oh, I'm running clean now, baby. This is it. This is it. I've done it. Yeah. And, and, and, but no, it's now this is it. Yeah. Right. Even if you're running dirty. Yeah. Well, because if you think like I, I'm never interested in people. I mean, I'm interested in people who are running clean in that way where I go like, that's the goal. And if you could only get your shit together or whatever. But when I'm around people, like that's the, you know, my heartbreak is that I, I, I only usually love stand-up comics, even though they're kind of the worst. And it's very problematic being one and then kind of being like, but I, that it's the problems that I like. It's the understanding that it's like, I know you'll know what I'm doing. You're not going to stand there and go, what the fuck is your problem? Cause you have it too. Yeah. And it's that, you know, I think it's the flaws that attract us to each other. It's like, it's the humanity and the realness and you can't see it in yourself because to you, you're just like, well, you've been just told that that's what makes you ugly or weak or lame or whatever all your life. Yeah. Who told you that? I don't, I think this is like hard-earned being in my head against the same wall until I finally like, and also just Pima children, um, Renee Brown, who's that she is like sociologist who did the whole study on vulnerability. Like, um, I think Pima children was kind of my therapist who recommended the first, I think it was when things fall apart, that Pima children book. Fuck yeah, that's a good one. It's a good one. But then there was the, I think it's like the compassionate heart audio series where it was the thing of doing the practice. Is it Tonglen where you, when you have a problem that you start thinking about everyone else who has the same problem and trying to have compassion for yourself and those people in the world and all that, that practice, that changed my life, I think. Trying to do that. I can't even say that I did it well. I certainly didn't do it consistently. I think I tried it, you know, for a series of months, but the practice of it of like, you can crack this, like when your own misery, whatever caused it, like has calcified around you and kind of made you stuck. Yeah. You can do a thing that changes it. It's just a hard, painful thing to do, but you can do it. Right. Which was miraculous to me. Like, because you can't even, when you're, before that happens for the first time, you just think you're, you're going to be in an eternal prison of suffering for the rest of your life. Yeah. Yes. And you don't know what to do. Like, there's so many dumb self-help books that will be like, make a list of seven things, you know, all that shit where you're like, I'm never going to do that. And it doesn't actually work. Yeah. And you, you do that so many times that you're like, you get cynical or you get like, well, nothing works. Yeah. But if you get a little thing, that's the thing about both Kundalini yoga and like the Pima Chodron type of meditation, I would feel legitimate true change day of, which didn't happen in those other things I would try. Yeah. That is one of the most beautiful moments in my life is when suddenly the, the teaching start converting into an actual lifting of the, of some of the darkness. Yeah. And then realizing like, whoa, you, well, it isn't bullshit. It's not bullshit. It's actually something that people developed over thousands and thousands of years and it works. Yes. It's just, you got to be able to be willing to, well, you know, this is something I'd like to talk with you about. And I want, you know, sometimes people don't really want to be healed. No, yes, I know that intimately, but, but, but, but they say they do. Right. Do you know what I'm saying? Like, it's like the, the, the people who go to the doctor all the time or something, people don't really want to, to, to, it's attachment to the sorrow, to the darkness, to the, that feeling, because usually with comedians, what they say is I'm not going to be funny anymore if I'm not miserable. Do you agree with that? No, it's so stupid. Well, you know what? That's romance. That's like the Hemingwayization of standup comedy. Right. So it's like, and, and I liked that when I first started, because I was an alcoholic and I liked that I could fit how the world worked to my addiction. So that all kind of served me very well. And I was forced out of it by my own bad behavior, you know what I mean? By my own extremity, it like, and had to stop. And then was left basically by the side of the road, where I was just, I was just like, well, everything's fucked, and I can't escape. Now I don't know what to do. And then I had to start going, well, there, other people are happy in this world. Yes. How are they doing it? If you really want to do it, you have to actually seek it out and try. Did you, I can remember there was a time when I didn't really believe that other people were happy. Did you, you know, I just thought, oh no, it's like a, it's, it's a, it's actually a being tricking itself. It's like a person who's like being happy, or it's, it's just, it's, they're dumb. Shallow. Yeah. It's shallowness. Like if only they knew, they have no idea. That kind of snobbish. Yeah. That's like, that's some pipe smoking bullshit right there. Yes, it is. Yes. It's fashionable cynicism. And it's a plague right now. And it's, when you get into the presence of it, it's really, really, really annoying. And it's, it feels young to me. It feels, it feels especially like young smart people. It's a great like teddy bear when you're young smart and still totally lost and scared shitless. Right. To be able to say, the world is this, everybody is this, those insane generalizations. Yes. It is so comforting to your dumb, fear, fear filled like brain. Right. But you, after a while, my thing was I, I could do that. I wanted to blame the world. I wanted to blame my, the people in my life. It was always somebody else. Yes. But I couldn't get away from that feeling. Like it didn't matter who I blamed. I was still there with that terrible fucking feeling in the pit of my stomach. And I eventually had to go like, once the sobriety came against my will, I had to go there. I have to do something different. Like I just can't hold on to this anymore. Does your sobriety include every all everything? No. So you take psychedelics sometimes? I can't take, or I don't take psychedelics because I, the reason I stopped drinking is because I started having seizures and I still have seizure disorder today that I have to take medicine for. So I just, I think I would get too scared. I wouldn't be able to let go and I would think, I would keep thinking, wait, now I'm having a seizure. Like I wouldn't be able to be free. I don't think. Oh yeah. No, I think that's like, I mean, one of the, that's so responsible and smart. It's just, you don't want to, it's okay. I mean, who cares? Like what about marijuana? Oh, 100%. I mean, and that's the thing. I've talked about being sober on my podcast and I keep trying to tell people, because people come up and be like, now I'm sobered. I'm like, sorry. That word I'm using, I'm only using to alcohol. Alcohol. Because I, as my therapist, my brilliant therapist once said, everybody needs a little bit of oblivion because I would get really down on myself for smoking pot. And she was like, yeah, but you have to be able to escape at some point in time. You can't just sit there. How long have you been with this person? The therapist? Yeah. But almost 15 years. Wow. Good for you. Holy shit. I want to, I want to get a digit. She's the best. I, yeah, she's, she's so, I met with a couple other people before. Yeah. And I had it in my head. I told my friend who was a therapist. She's like, I can't be your therapist, but I can recommend people to you. What are you looking for? And I said, I want to talk to Olympia Dukakis. I basically want to sit across. So she gave me the name of a, like kind of an older lady who had no, who had gray hair, but in no way had the Olympia Dukakis vibe whatsoever. And then I just, in psychology today has a website that you can go on and there's just an index on there. And you can put your city in and find therapists that are licensed, you know, practitioners near, near you. And I just picked the person that was closest to my house. And she is like one of my favorite people. I think that's critical to pick a therapist that's close to your house. Hell yeah. Because your brain's going to not want to just, you won't go, you'll cancel every time if you have to drive too far to a therapist. I've been, I live walking distance so close to my therapist. And I have been between, I would say 11 and 18 minutes late to every appointment for 15 years. I cannot, I cannot show up on time. And we've talked about it and we've talked about not talking about it. And she's like, I mean, it's whatever, if you want to talk through it or, you know, it's hilarious. And it's just like some, that's another thing I have. My, when I did have a therapist, he told me the coolest thing ever. He said it's like, actually there was a time, and who knows? I mean, he was, who knows if it's real. I didn't look it up. But he was saying like, there was a time when it was considered actually low class to be on time. That it would, that, that, that, that whole concept of being on time is just like, it's like, it's that, that's for the, you know, that's for them. We show up whenever we like. And then also, you know, and then did I love that so much. It's cool. And if you, if you think about it in terms of like, I've heard of like in tribal cultures or indigenous cultures, the idea of like even showing up, like there's just, you're like, I'll see you at this, you know, somewhere in the afternoon. Yes. And you just connect with someone in that way, like here, Jesus Christ, we're just really crucified to the clock here in this. You're crucified to the clock. You mean in Los Angeles or in the West, you're just nailed. We're just being nailed to time and it's, it's, it's rips people to shred. It really does. Well, it's a great way to be yourself up. It's also a great way to punish other people passive aggressively. There's all kinds of things you can like kind of read into or take from it or I don't know. And my thing is that I do stuff like I, I sent an email and I just said, sorry to you, I like, sorry, I'm going to be 15 minutes late. I couldn't stop blow drawing my hair. I got, yeah. I just dip into these weird worlds where I'm like, I come out and I'm like, I'm already late. I thought I was totally on time and then I'll like hypnotize myself, but with some weird small thing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're just, it's kind of like what I really love is like when you run into people, you don't care when you're late and they really don't care. And then, and it's a great way actually to kind of test people. And, and because if, because if you show up late and somebody's just like, oh, hi, it's, and you realize like, oh, they don't, they're, they're not in the world. They're not trapped in the world of time. Some people just are. So it's annoying to them, but fuck it. I'm 15 minutes late. It's okay. Cause I, you know what I bet when people are dying, one thing they don't think about is all the times people are late showing up for something. I would hope not. That's one of the things you just forget instantly. It's like, it's one of the, have you ever heard the idea that we all, that like you can, you only remember 10 or maybe 15% of what happens to you. And most of the time you're living in a, in a forgotten moment. Oh, that's amazing. Isn't that wild? Like most things you're just not, you don't, you're not gonna. That takes the weight off of everything. Yeah. You won't remember it. It's like most things happening, driving to this place or that place, the food you ate, the thing you did, whatever it is. It's like, you don't remember that. You don't remember much. It's like, there's the illusion that we have this, some people have photographic memory. I think that's mostly an illusion. I think that we just have this, have you ever explored memory, like really looked into it and noticed how, how, how it's like wavering and, and, and so like, what's the word for it? Tricky? Tricky. Like when you really pull up a memory and look at it, how it's like, I'm really looking forward to when they're, when they're able to do the full download of people's minds to see the way our minds are remembering stuff, because I think it's going to be real interesting and low grade, whatever it is. Well, in the advent of the digital age, it's very funny to have lived before the internet, like a serious period of time. Yes. Because there was a time, I used to say this, a lot where it's like, you could just kind of say a fact and no one would question you. And it's just like, Oh yeah, Karen told me about that thing. And then they would only learn three people later of like, that's completely wrong. Yes. And, but you'd, in the moment you'd never get caught. It wasn't, I wouldn't, I wasn't like a liar or anything. I would just kind of misremember or like, just slightly get a fact wrong and be like, did you hear about the thing? And I would just love the story of it. And then when, when the internet started, people just immediately looked something up and be like, see, that was actually in 1977. And that's when I was like, Oh yeah, you have to like tighten this shit up a little bit. And like, you can't just say whatever and tell people that's a fact. I interviewed someone who is a, I don't know, he just blows my mind, Will Oldham. And he was saying that they were, went on tour and that people kept Googling shit. Like what was that person's name or what's that thing? And they had, I don't remember what the item was. They had some object and they said, well, let's make that the, I think it was a banana or something. They're like, go to the Google banana. And so they would pick up the banana and make up facts because his thing is like, how important are these facts to you that it's, it's completely taking you out of this reality down into the rectangle. Who really cares? Like, and you're treating the rectangle like it's Bible fact or whatever, you're treating it like it's, it's inarguable where that was written potentially by like a stone 23 year old. Who knows where we're getting like, I think of that Wikipedia, every time I go on to Wikipedia for research, I'm always like, yeah, I'm gonna have to check this probably for different times. Right. Because who fucking, sometimes you'll see other articles and their exact cut and paste from Wikipedia where you're like, yeah, but who, who wrote this? Like, is it truly verified? Exactly. And that's, that's one of the big problems right now, isn't it? This is one of the big problems is that they've weaponized that and now they've essentially fragmented reality for everyone. And by they, I mean like government state agencies have somehow discovered these algorithms and ways to completely, this is Elon Musk, when he talks about AI, I don't know if you read this, but he says it's not necessarily the robots as everyone, like the terminators that are going to kill us. It's the AI that's going to start a world war by disrupting subjective experiences to the point that everyone's paranoid and some kind of war starts. Yes. I mean, I think everyone thought Facebook and social media platforms like connected people, but I think the way, the way things have gone at least in the last, say two years, I feel like all of these rope bridges have been cut between those groups, between groups, whether it's whatever political thing you're standing on. I feel like all of a sudden you have this little machine that tells you you're right and you can find 500 people, no matter what fucking dumb bullshit you believe in, you can find a group that's like, that's right, Karen, you're dumb shit is exactly, you go fight for it or whatever. And then so everything is about, like when people are saying like those marches are great, but they don't matter. I'm like, they fucking all, that's all that matters now because everything has become optics. Everything has become, you have to, like these, you can't argue that these people stood on the street. You can't, you know what I mean? There was four helicopter shots, but then, but you can if there's the ones where they use group shots and then people come in and go, this is from Rio de Janeiro, 1992. I remember that where they were like, look at this Trump rally and it's like, nope. And you, so you, thank God, there's the people that are like fact checking. Now they're like, but the fact never existed in the first place. Exactly. And now, but also the problem is now that what we're getting to is the point where you don't have to get pictures from Rio de Janeiro. It's the new graphics engines are going to be able to create things that become indiscernible from reality. And that's, and that's where it becomes, and then when it's not a person making these things, but an AI making these things and then an AI that's like figured out a way to like put, dispense them based on specific viewing habits of specific people. To like basically tell you the story you're looking to hear. Yeah. To create, this is the whole Cambridge analytics thing with Facebook that they got in so much trouble for us. All these people took this, some kind of personality test. You read about this, right? I think, well, I just, I know the general thing, but tell me the specifics. It just did a deep probe in the psyche of all these Facebook users. And then that data got sold and that data was used to help Trump get elected by analyzing someone's deep psyche. And then, so the ads you would get based on this personality profile you filled out, it was like pure, Hannibal Lecter level deep manipulation of humans. And it's just going to get more and more and more intense because when, I mean, when you get a, like, I don't know if you've ever had the good fortune and I do mean good fortune of being around an authentic con artist, like someone who's really fucking yanking your chain, but he's like really good at it. I don't know if you've ever experienced that before. I mean, I think dribs and drabs around this town, but nothing, I did, nothing like, and where's my wallet? But you know, I think I definitely, the kind of people where, when you find out they were bullshitting you all along, you're just like, wow, I got no, none of my senses kicked up on that. And I, they usually are good. It's amazing. Yes. It's beautiful. The art of it's incredible. And when you realize that, that, that's happened to you, it's like, it's, it's, has it happened to you? Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times. I mean, who knows? I mean, you never know. I mean, it could be, it could be happening in all of us really. But, but so what it is, is like these people, some people get into, what's it called? There, there's a, there's a name for it. All the pickup artists use it, you know? Oh yeah. So pickup artists, of course, I mean, and this is again, maybe gonna upset some people listening and I don't care. I had this conversation with a friend of mine who was talking about pickup artists. And I said to him, well, you know, to me, the problem with what I've read about it, is that it's fundamentally based on deceit. So it's not as though you're presenting your true self to a, to a person, you're analyzing them doing a scan thinking, what do they want? I'll become that temporarily so that I can fuck them. And then that's it. I've achieved this ridiculous goal. I've de, essentially dehumanized a person, right? And, and, and gotten into the most, their most vulnerable place. They've let me into their house and, and using these, but there's a name for it. And I can't remember it. Like, you mean nagging or like all the, you mean the, the game itself of how they do it? Yeah, the stages of it, the idea of like, oh, if I can induce a good memory in you while you're around me, then you're going to start associating me with that good memory. And then if simultaneously, I give you some object while I've induced the good memory in you, and you look down at that object, you're going to feel the good feeling you had from the good memory that you told me, but you're going to associate that good feeling with me. Are you serious? Yeah, sure. Oh, I thought you were just talking about like, nagging and triangulation and stuff like the basic thing. Negging is also part of it because that's a way to like throw, essentially you're using like this kind of weird psychology to manipulate people. And, and so where it gets really spooky is when an AI becomes that being. Yes. And it has all of your data. A con artist meets you, looks for like tells in the way that you're acting, tries to find like, where are you broken? Where are you broken the most? Oh, that's where you're broken. Okay. Well, I know what this broken person wants. Let me give that to them. And then, but when that starts happening from with AI's and corporations, scanning you and doing that, whoa, that's fucking nuts. Yeah, because it's pure greed. You can't ever think there's, I mean, your average con artist could be a sociopath, but most of the time they're probably just super smart. And they, they want to just kind of make money and get away with things. And they like the excitement or whatever. Doesn't mean they're like a psychopath or whatever. But if the machine is programmed to do it, they'll net, there's no checkpoint. There's no, it's like, get us our money anyway. But you know what that makes me think of? Did you ever read or listen to John Ronson's, like I listened to his audio book. And it was a thing about people who had bad credit in England. And then the other credit card companies basically that they would get on lists if you were in debt. And the other credit card companies would go to the debtors offering them what seemed like the answer. So they just started opening more and more lines of credit to pay off the other credit. And there was a man, it happened to him. And he was so far in credit, he just killed himself so his family could have his like, you know what I mean? So they could his insurance or whatever. He had some weird plan in his head. This is the only way I can get out of this. And it was they, they absolutely targeted those people that were already in this, the worst place you can be in, which is I owe everything and I have nothing coming in. Yeah, horrifying. Yeah, horrifying, horrifying. And then, and then when you add to that, the ability to generate CGI entities that that that seem like beautiful people who seem genuinely interested in you that you just happened to have met on Instagram, who are really talking to you for a while and you look and they've built up like a profile for the thing. And they're just talking to you, they become your friend. And they're just, you know, every once in a while, maybe they suggest a product to you. That's what they're doing now. It hasn't happened yet. Because we the right now, the, it's, I don't know, could be. I mean, in a weird way, it happens through humans. But as far as an AI doing it, it hasn't happened because what basically what I think is probably happening right now is that people are beginning to, I think the best way to put it is social media farmers who are growing identities. So basically what would I like, if I start a profile now for a 14 year old kid named, I don't know, Danny, and then oh, and then I have an AI that begins to post it for him by, you know, scanning what's going on, what's trending. And he starts posting realistic posts so that if you went and checked him out, you'd be like, well, he's been on Twitter for five years. He posted 7,000 things that couldn't possibly be a bot, but it is a bot. It's a bot that was farmed for many, many years to grow this personality. And if you had a thousand of them, now you can start changing the way people think about things. You can start shifting trends. You can start controlling the ebbs and flows of what's in and what's out. I think we're headed towards that place. 100%. Well, because, you know, that makes me think of is I started getting into a thing that normally I avoid. Like, I can't, for a long time, I could not stand listening to people argue about politics. It was just like, especially online, it's the, it's such a complex thing that people are trying to get down to their 140 characters or whatever. I, but I started getting really addicted to reading threads or somebody would post a thing about like, Trump did this gross thing. And then, excuse me, there would be a thread underneath where the first four people agree that it's a gross thing. The fifth person is there to say, none of you, you libtards understand what you're talking about and act like an asshole, whatever. And then, and then the fighting starts. And in there, I always noticed there would be a person of color, be a woman or an older man, but it would be a person of color somehow that would come in to like defend Trump. And then I read the article about the bots, how they discovered like the Russian bots and all those things. And then people started learning, like if there's a series of numbers in the name, that's probably a bot, if it's, it's taking these certain stances. And if you write back and you're like, thanks, Russian bot, it'll disappear because once you like name it and everyone can see it, it'll go away. That's right. And that idea that people who are arguing about these things that in this country, people couldn't even talk about at the dinner table. And suddenly they're all anonymous and comfortable just going, well, you don't even understand. And you're the one that doesn't understand. And then a person comes in who symbolizes what you think you're defending or attacking or whatever your thing is. And they're the ones that go, no, actually, it's like this. That manipulation, because you don't know who that person really is. It could have been Putin himself. But it's like, you're like, Oh, well, this clearly educated black man who's over 50 has come in to say that actually this is fine. I need to rethink my stance. That's fucking insane. But because it's, it's Twitter, it's fake. Everything's fake on Twitter. But we don't know that. And psychological warfare. And it's a brand new weapon. And it's a, it's a weapon that's so amazing because it's, it's shifting interior landscapes. Like, you don't see the destruction, you don't see the fragmentation or the confusion. You just see a bunch of, you just get to the point where like, I don't trust much of anything that's coming out of the internet. I don't know. I have no idea. I have no idea. But still, it's the very beginning of it. You know, this is the, this is the, do you believe that that's shit about the singularity that we're headed towards a singularity? I mean, we, I've, I don't know what we're headed towards, but I do know this. And this might just be the experience of aging and being self aware. Things are going, things are evolving much faster, like in a way that I can track. It's like, old people know how to be on Twitter now, whereas like when the internet first started, you know, it was like, my mom would turn, we'd turn on the computer and she'd go, it's broken because she would do one thing wrong or she wouldn't be able to find an icon or whatever. It's broken and walk away because that was her generation. It was like, these things are not for us. My dad now texts me constantly and like that, because he loves, he loves Apple. He loves the idea of that innovation. He loves that newness and he loves, you know, modern life. He wants to be a part of things, but there was a time where he wouldn't get fucking cable. We couldn't, we couldn't have Atari. Like he was always like, you don't need that. We don't want that in the house. That's not whatever. It's like everybody is suddenly we're all like, yes, the phone is in my hand all day long and no one talks about it anymore. Whereas when like cell phones first came out, it'd just be like, oh, and she's staring at the phone all day again. Now it's standard fare. Standard fare. And because of it, you are one of the most successful podcasters living on the planet. Did you ever think about that? Like how this technology has, your life is, your life has been so transformed by this, hasn't it? Yes. Very quickly. Like in two years, very, very quickly. Like I remember when it happened to y'all and just like, wow, I was so blown away by it. And you know, I'm sad to say I felt jealous and like, which is just like really lame. I think that's standard. I think that's all of us all the time. We've all moved here to get basically the same thing. Yeah. And anytime someone gets something, it feels like now I can't have it. But it's like, what am I, what am I competing with a hilarious show about murder? We're all competing about everything. It's like, I think that's the comics mindset, because we're all the same and we're all kind of like in this weird group. You know what I mean? Oh yeah. Yeah, you're, you're, you're, yeah, it's just, I mean, I, I've been jealous of every single person I've met since I moved here for fucking 25 years straight. It does, you could get a part on the thing that I think is a piece of shit. And I'm like, like, that's just this weird, it's like, cause when you're leading with your ego always in this fucking town, how do you not do that? Right. Yeah. Okay. Well, cool. Well, thank you for that. I mean, that's good to remind you. Jealousy is just a part of existence. It's good. It comes and it goes, but- It means that this is important to you. But, but, but, but for some reason, I didn't listen. And so, um, and, and, um, and sometimes I say to myself, I don't want to listen to other podcasts because I don't want to get shifted by the podcast. I don't want to, I don't want to change for the podcast. And I think that's really stupid. But my, my girlfriend, she loves your podcast and she started playing it for me. And man, it, it, it is so good. Thank you. You guys are, and you know this, you know this already. I mean, people are like getting tattoos and stuff here. People, people are, um, going to die with, with slogans from your podcast tattooed on their body. Does that ever freak you out? Um, definitely. I mean, I was, first of all, thank you. That means the world to me. I think you're brilliant. I love this podcast. Thank you. Um, I really go to this podcast sometimes when I want to be like, I want to be feel smarter and feel like I'm trying to do something. So it means a lot to me. Thank you. And you exactly what you're saying, I do that constantly. I, I, I'm very careful of what I take in because I don't, I'm afraid I'm going to copy people. That's my worst fear is like, I'm going to love it so much. I'm going to just start saying, I do it all the time. And I'll realize it later. I'll be, Oh, that's blanket patches joke that I just basically restated because I love it so much. Yeah. So I, I do that a lot. And when something's popular, then I'm just like, it's not for me. Like I try to play like high queen bullshit. I'm the queen of Spain and nothing's good enough for me. And I reject this out of hand where, and, and there's always like younger people that are like, I think you'd really like it where it's like, fuck you. You don't know me. Um, I'm so guilty of that. It's, I think that's also the generate in the nineties. Like in that Kurt Cobain era, I got, I got, I really got worked by that whole concept of like, don't be a sellout. I, it was ingrained in me in the weirdest fucking way that does not apply to real life anymore. And I'm like, it's like, I'm trying to please the band members of pavement still to this day. Why? What it doesn't, they, they're awesome. They have the best sweaters. They did it right. I am still terrified of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk. Yes. Yes. Terrified. I know. Terrified. And you were in the core of that group. You were, you were in that thing, which was a huge movement in comedy. You know, it's funny and I, yes. And I feel like great and lucky about it. It's the coolest thing. It's the coolest thing to have been a part of that. But what's funny is like the length of time it ex, we were doing it and that, that was our real time experience. When that was over and I went off and I worked at Ellen for five years, I was out of comedy entirely. I was out of everything entirely. And when I came back out, it literally was like, when I left the building and returned to comedy, that cult aspect of it had started and I didn't know. So like, I started having these experiences where I'd be walking down the street in like three 25 year old dudes would be like looking at me and I'd be like, what the f**k is going on? And I finally, one of them was like, we just want to say, you know, Wally P. Doyle's widow or whatever thing they would want to reference because they love that show so f**king much that, that I got the benefit of all the f**king brilliance that David and Bob put together. I was getting a slice of it. And it, to me, I, that was never an expectation and I never knew how insanely popular it got. Like in that weird, basically when it went to DVD and it got the next generation of kids watching it, I had no idea that it happened. So coming out and it was like, I got to step back into this like, oh my God, this legendary thing where I was like, oh, when I left that wasn't, it was, it was like, say 40 people in LA knew about how awesome it was. This is what it felt like. People, this is the thing with Mr. Show and in what y'all are doing. And I think it's a thing that people now just take for granted in comedy. It's always like that. It's like, people start transcending or pushing past whatever the boundary is. And some, some of the attempts are failure. Some of the attempts work. But what ends up happening is it's like you're building, you're laying down tracks. And you're, and it's, and I was a professor in my college where me and my friends would watch Mr. Show and just be like, this is the greatest thing that has ever happened ever. He would use the term state of the art. And you know, people talk about that in technology, but really the term itself state of the art, where is the art form right now? Like, where is it? What is the state of the art right now? And you guys were state of the art. And because of that, now it's created an entire branch of comedy. I mean, it's, and I just did this. I haven't done a quote alt show or whatever you want to call it in a long time. I just did one last night. It was really cool. And the crowds are cool. And it's just like thriving. And it's like, I think people forget. Do you think these days, many people are a historic? Yes. Well, because I think we're also stuck in what's this moment right now, what's popular right now? What's happening right now? What's the word you're supposed to be using? What's the, you know, space you're supposed, which, what are you supposed, what haircut you're supposed to have? Yeah. So yeah, there's not a lot of like back referencing. Yeah. If that's what you mean. The lineage, people don't care about lineages as much. There's not a sense. My friend was explaining this to me, you know, he's a musician, he's explaining like, you know, people don't care the roots of where not everyone, but it's just people are just whatever all that was, it's over now. And now this thing is happening. Right. Yeah. That seems so nihilistic. It seems so sad, really. But I feel like in, it seems to me in, in what you were just talking about with Bob and David, and thank you for saying you guys, because I, I mean, it's, I just got to go and do the parts that they gave me. It's not like I, I get so much credit for what they did. It's really awesome. Not just Mr. Shown. I'm talking about the whole scene. I'm talking about Largo. I'm talking about, I'm talking about the deep alt comedy cult, the impenetrable group of brilliant people who are doing cutting edge comedy who you, it was, and that wasn't, that what they were, you guys had like force fields, like big force fields and many of you were mean. Oh, that was the whole vibe. Yeah. That was the whole, I mean, that was the 90s thing that I'm talking about. That's the Kurt Cobain thing where you're, everyone's trying to out cool each other. Nobody was a fan of anybody. You had to, you, if you were a fan of somebody else, that meant you were like weak or you were saying you were less than them. And where the contest was in my mind anyway, because I was a female comic, I always wanted to be like, well, I'm a fucking funniest person in this room and I'm going to show, and I was hell bent on, I had to be, I had to kill. Like in those sets, if I, if the room wasn't like scream laughing, it was a abject failure and I felt terrible. Wow. And it was like, I mean, it was insanity and it was like, and if somebody else did good, fuck them. Like it was so. Ouch. It was bare knuckle fucking boxing. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that was just, it was one of the qualities of it. And it's like, when I started realizing it, it didn't make me not like the art any less. It was just like, whoa, fuck man, these, there's like thorns on this thing. This thing's got thorns and fangs and rattles and it's tough. I mean, and also it was like, it was almost like we all went to this one fucked up high school. So everyone did it. We all learned from each other and did it to each other and kind of set the tone that that was okay. But to be totally honest, it, I loved it because that's like my family was very tough love. You got shit for anything you did from age five. You know what I mean? It was like nobody was, there were no kid gloves ever anywhere. So to land in this group of people when I moved to LA that were like that, that I could like some of the most fun nights were like standing in a kitchen giving Bob Odin Kirk shit. And he loved it. You know what I mean? Like we had the best time together because I was like, Oh, I know how I'm going to get him. Like you couldn't, you couldn't ask his your way in. That was disgusting. No way. You had to, you had to come with the chops. You had to like know how to come and fight. And also just kind of like, that's how you prove that you had the, I don't know, gumption or whatever to, because it's comedy. It's a hard, it's a really hard thing to do. Nobody should get a fucking free ride. You have to go and be like, I can fight on the front fucking lines of this. That's right. Yeah, that is, it's, it's, it's an interesting art because it's an art that grows from rejection. I mean, you know, if you're, if you're doing, I was having this conversation last night with somebody, if you're doing, you've got to do new jokes. Yeah. Yeah. And those new jokes, some of them are not going to hit man. I mean, somebody told me Bill Cosby said he bombed once. Fuck that guy. That's such bullshit, right? That's, well, and also it was, he had so many just long talking bits where it's like, maybe you did do great because you just manipulated the audience by having long spaces that made them tense. So anything you say, if you make the audience wait for seven seconds, whatever you say after that, they're going to laugh at it. If it sounds like the shape of a joke, because they don't want the tension of sitting in silence. It's like same thing with clap traps. You can manipulate people. You can manipulate a great set. And that was the kind of thing where like those, my friends at that time, everybody was on the lookout for the bullshit meter. So it's like, if you were up there doing anything that was like that, you were fucking out. Like you could do great, you could kill, but everyone is ready to pick it apart. Oh, sure. I mean, there's no way to not do that as a comedian. Like when you see people using the tricks or when God, when you're, when you're listening to your set, have you ever had that happen where you are like on stage and you're recording your set and you get off stage, you feel great. Like this was a good set. And then like maybe the next day you listen to your set, you're like, Oh my God, this is a mess. What was I thinking? I very rarely can listen to a set. Like I've recorded myself maybe three times and then just bailed on it or gone back to it literally like a year later. And I definitely, that's the reaction is this is garbage. Why did, why do I think I can do this? Like it's a complete breakdown of like, if I turn that evil eye to it, I will tear myself apart. But you know what I, I can't believe I ever did comedy music because there is nothing tricky, there's nothing more manipulative or trickier than doing that. And it felt so like cheap always when I was on stage. No way. Yeah, because you're, people are trapped. Like you're making them watch you sing a song, which is insanely vulnerable. Are you talking about girls guitar club? Well, all, but then I did my own afterwards by myself. But girls guitar club was different. I feel like that was, Mary Lynn and I did that in this, it was such a genuine thing we were doing. It wasn't an act. What we were doing, we were really actually doing. We were literally learning how to play the guitar on stage. We were literally trying our hardest and failing and still doing it anyway. Like I'll never not love girls guitar club because it really, it was a genuine thing. One of the coolest things that I remember I was at Largo when I first came out here, somebody told me, go to Largo. That's where like this amazing comedy is happening. I went there. I didn't, I think I hadn't even, I was like working the phones at the comedy store. I'd only seen that kind of comedy. And then I remember going there girls guitar club went up. It was first, I don't just like the energy in that room. Yeah. Was like, it was a temple, wasn't it? It was just the most intense people were watching comedy there in the most intense way. Yeah. And it was terrifying to be in the audience. It was, it was, now that I think about it, I think because I was still drinking when it started. So there was definitely like, I never had that, I never had any awareness until later on when I kind of was like, Oh, this is, there's a lot of this feels bad to me. Like the meanness and the competitiveness and my own experience. It all felt bad. But I was always in a fight with that audience before I ever went on stage. I hated their guts. And I had to go up like that because that's how I got like the best in my mind, the best comedy come to come out of me. Wow. Was I had to like beat it into them that they liked me, that I was funny. Wow. Which is not an enjoyable comedy experience. No, it's not. So painful. It's really, really, it was always just straight straight out of the gut. Why did girls guitar club break up? We just started fighting and we both, both of our kind of careers went in different directions. So we, and we weren't really friends anymore. We didn't spend time together anymore. I don't know. Yeah, it was, it was sad. It's cool and collaboration is so difficult with it, right? It's just you can, you just accidentally will become enemies with somebody because it's such a hot fire that you're working with there. And it's just, yeah, it can get weird, huh? Well, and anytime you introduce the slightest bit of success, I mean, like, I definitely was really jealous of Mary Lynn. She started, she was on like Larry Sanders. When she got on Larry Sanders, I kind of didn't know what to do with myself because I was just like, that's the coolest fucking credit. And that, and it was the thing of she gets that I get nothing. Like it was, it was her success was my failure. And that like, it's just too much, it was too much for me to manage that. I didn't have any tools to manage those feelings or that the conflict of those feelings, that was my best friend. And yet there was just this like, so then that came, that was on the stage with us eventually. Oh yeah, because it's what the mind is like, because the thing is it, it, what it happened to you is amazing. If I'm certain at that time, you couldn't have possibly imagined or thought, oh, I'm going to become a comedy writer for Ellen. But then on top of that, I'm going to I'm going to become globally famous from a podcast about murder. Right. And but, but at the time, you know, that's what people forget is like, it's, I think if you are diligent and hard working and a little bit of luck, it will, something will come to you. 100%. I tell that to everybody, I'm like, live here for 10 years, whatever you're worried about, whatever you're doing, just if you really care about it, if you stay here for 10 years, something will happen. It just is true. Like, because they need people, if you are willing to work, you know, if you're willing to carry a pallet of water around for a year or two, and hustle and listen and learn, something will happen to you because that this town is only opportunity. It's just that like, you can't be like, I get mine right now. Right. And I needed, this is what I wanted, Emmy or whatever. It's like, don't, don't do the bullshit awards, weirdo shit. Don't do the Harvard shit. If you didn't go to Harvard, like just get in there and like, just, just punch your card every day. Yeah, that's it. And then when the jealousy comes, you know, I, because I love magic with a K. And like, one of the things that I've been taught is that actually the better thing to do is to, by loving a thing, you begin to harmonize with that thing. Yeah. So if you can begin to cultivate what's called compersion for another person's success and learn how when, when people start getting successful around you and that's giving you a feeling of failure and you start getting the jealousy, you can cultivate the ability to start feeling their success as your success. And then that harmonizes you with their vibration. And then gradually you absorb their soul and they wither away and die. And you take all their Cougarans and now you're the king of the pirates. That's right. No, well that's, but, and a hundred percent all of that. I think these are the things that like, my brain started shedding the old like everything before that I had was I shouldn't be here, I'm not, I'm, it's the fraud thing, whatever. So I have to fight for my place and I have to make sure no one threatens my place. Right. And that was, I was a hundred percent like convinced that that was the truth. Then when I got sober and I was kind of like, real life. And it was like, then I had to start kind of going, wait, these feelings that I'm having that, and Maryland and I used to have conversations about this a lot because she was so like, I don't know why you're mad. I don't know why you don't like that person. I know she was always kind of like, who cares? Yeah. And I think it was that thing of, I didn't have the confidence to, to go, that's great for you and not separate from me because I was in this like mode of, I'll never, like I was always the beggar at the door and I never could see myself. I never saw myself as like, you get to do sets at Largo. That was meaningless to me. That was, that was like, that's just what people do. It's, it's what I, it's what I do. And it wasn't enough either. It's like killing, killing the most wasn't enough because eventually Greg Fitzsimmons would go on stage and destroy with amazing, brilliant wisdom. And I would sit in the back and go, they laughed louder. Like they didn't laugh this loud when I did my thing. It was always that like, you're just always a reason to, to be unhappy. So I don't know. I think there's that kind of thing of like, finally realizing you have to fill yourself up inside. It's also, I mean, it does. I hear you putting the brakes on it because it's like, it really is a difficult thing to say and you start feeling embarrassed about it. Yeah. You know, because it's a thing that's like been spoken by people who don't really believe it and are just trying to make a buck or whatever. And so it feels like embarrassing to say. But then I was thinking something very dark, which was, I so, you know, to say like, oh, well, you know, scarcity mentality and the idea that there's not enough for everybody can only hurt you. And yet, perhaps it was like a necessary stage in your evolution. And if not for all that hate, if not for all that pain, if not for all that anger, you never would have had that, you know, whatever it was, the bit of magic, the coincidences, all the things leading up to this suddenly creating this incredible show. Yeah. And I want to ask you about that this, and this is a heavy question. So forgive me for asking it and forgive me if it's something that someone's already asked you in an interview before, but do you ever worry that family members listen and get bummed out that you're using the death of people that they knew as a thousand percent? We talk, we talk about it on the show, but we also, there's been times when we first first started touring and we had like meet and greets afterwards. That was our number one fear that someone would walk up and be like, fuck you guys. Like that, I was convinced it was going to happen. And the times that it has happened, the people will go, you did the story about my aunt. That's happened a couple of times. It's never, it's, it hasn't ever been anybody's like this person that I would recognize is, you know, my mother, my sister, but it's always like a relative. And they always say, you, you did it right. Like she would have liked the way you told that story. I mean, and that's, I guess I'm saying that to say, we keep it in mind always because that's, you have to think of those people when you're telling a story. You know, I always think of it like this, if my father somehow was murdered, you know what I mean? Like just some god fucking knock, but some horrible thing happened. And then somebody else was like, so anyway, this guy, I mean, that's the worst, that's the worst thing. We would, we wouldn't, we would never want people to think that we think that is funny because it isn't. And that's not what we're talking about. So we're, we're having a conversation about a horrible topic and the comedy comes in and around it almost thematically, but the victims aren't the comedy. Yeah, no, I, you guys do a great job at that, but it's, that was like an awareness we had to grow because in the beginning we're like, yeah, we'll just talk about true crime like everybody else does. And it's not the same. When, you know, like in ancient cultures, they ritualistic human sacrifice was like a huge fundamental part of the religion or whatever, or, you know, it was, it's a huge part of magic. It was an idea is like when you sacrifice an innocent being, energy is released and that that energy can be used for, you know, magical purposes, usually to gain some abundance or something from harvesting the energy of the sacrifice being. Do you guys ever think that's what you're doing with your show is like you're, you're, you're like a spark of energy flying off of a human sacrifice victim? Like you're, this being has been murdered and in that murder, they've exploded out into the world and not just through your podcast, but through all the other, you know, many of the stories you guys talk about, they've, it's been covered in forensic files or in a bunch of different spots. But you ever think about that? Yes. Well, because I, I see it as like this, the people who are interested in true crime, like for a long time it was always like, oh, that's so ghoulish or that's so macabre or that's too dark of you to, to like that. But it is mo, almost everyone that I've met through this podcast, the attraction is, it comes with a concern. It is, it's, can you believe this happened to this person? It's holding, it's holding tragedy in that way that like when your ants are dressed up in black and they're me, they're putting out the cold cuts at the funeral and there's certain people that are destroyed and can't do anything. And then there's the people that make it keep going because it's like, this is the, this is a celebration of the life that that person had. Right. It's like saying, listen to what happened to this girl in 1976. She thought she could hitchhike, she got out on the road, she, you know, this was the thing that people believed. And here's this person who came along, she fell for this trap, this trick, this con. She thought she could get into this car or whatever. Her death should matter and it should prevent other deaths. That could be the idea. Now I'm not saying that we're always like, but I think that's what people approach true crime interest with is future prevention, learning and, and, and trying to learn these cons, trying to learn who are the types of people who would murder someone and how do you never fucking get around that person. And the unspeakable, which is that there's beauty and catastrophe. And, and there's something that is, you don't want to say it. You don't want to say it, but there's something in that version of the universe that's just as beautiful and it's, and it's incredible horror. There's something in it that is so beautiful that it's the human experience. I mean, we're all going to die in some way that we won't like probably. It's a thing people really fear, but it's a reality. It's not like we're making up monsters or something like that. We're just saying, here's the thing that happened in your town. Here's the thing that happened in my town. Here's the thing that happened to this person's aunt or whatever. I think having two parents that are first responders, my mom was a nurse, a psychiatric nurse, my dad's a fireman. They, that was their job. So this wasn't taboo in my household. This, this was the kind of stuff I heard about from childhood. I had lots of uncles and cousins that were cops. It's the, it's that kind of like, um, you discuss these things and you know about these things and you know these things happen. And so like from an early age, my dad be like, if any, but ever, if you're ever in a neighborhood, you don't like go pull a box, you know, there's like standing, um, there's standing boxes all around cities. You can go up and pull a thing and a fire truck will come. What? Yeah. You have to look for them. They're not everywhere and they're very old, they're old fashioned, but that's what my dad told me all my life. Go pull a box. And like in, in my mind, I'm trying to do the thing my dad did for me growing up for people, girls who might just be away at college and like whatever, who their parents were never had anything weird happen to them or anything. And they wouldn't think to like lock the car door after they get into it. Because why would they? They've always been safe and they grew up in the suburbs or whatever. But I grew up with people who had seen the worst of everything kind of, and we're basically like, keep your eye out for this. And here's, you should know there's a resource here. If you need, you know, that kind of like yell fire, don't yell help type of shit that always seemed, I don't know that to me, that's the, that's the discussion we're having is John Wayne, Gacy, I learned about him when I was 12 and I was like, what the fuck is going on? Like I couldn't believe no one had told me before that there would be the kind of man who would dress up as a clown, visit hospitals and bury boys in his house. Yes. That I tripped out on that for months, for months. And then I couldn't let it go because I was like, no one fucking told me about this. And I don't think anybody was going to tell me about this, which means the world is full of things like this. And I need to find out what they are. Is it true? John Wayne Gacy said the only thing he's guilty of is running a funeral home without a license. I mean, I've heard that. I don't know if it's true. I let's not Google it. Let's pick up a banana. If you if you if you had to be a serial killer, like let's say, and I'm sorry if you've talked about this on your show, I don't think I have. So okay, we have a perfect simulator that we can go into. These are artificial intelligences. They're not going to feel it's like Westworld or whatever. Okay. So if you could be a serial killer, what kind of serial killer would you be? What would be your like what what, you know, the flair? What would be your flair? What would you call yourself? How would you murder? I will say this, because that was the funniest thing to me in Westworld. And it also is something I saw my friend do once because my my ex had Grand Theft Auto and my friend walked up and he's like, Oh, I want to play this. I've never played it before. And he got his guy and immediately just started beating the shit out of the first woman that walked up to him on the street. And it made me laugh so hard because I was like, Oh, I would never think that you would do that. And that was he he didn't care about driving the cars. He wanted to walk up and beat punch people in the face. Yeah. For me, I think because I was raised so Catholic, the idea I'm not interested in the killers themselves. Like, like, I don't I never watch things where they get interviewed. I don't want to like, I don't want to get that on me. I feel like that vibe, like the vibrationally is so incredibly low that it can bring you down permanently for sure. And I fear that level of wrongdoing. So anyway, just to put that out there that the idea of murder isn't interesting or appealing to me. Now, I love the the fascination, the psychological fashion is fascination to me of a person who was figured out like there was a serial killer in the Bay Area in the 70s, who was killing people because he thought he needed to to prevent earthquakes. He was, you know, gone totally organic in his brain. And he was walking, he was shooting. He killed people in all different ways. And he was on tons of acid. It was very like post, you know, San Francisco hippie era shit when things just started getting, you know, like pre Manson post Manson. Manson was late 60s, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. This guy, I think was early 70s. So it was the darker, I think time. But that to me, like the people that set up, they have their reason. They have a reason. And so they're like, I'm going to punish you, this family, because I don't like fam my family was so terrible to me. Or that's the thing I would want to get into and like, really understand. Or like Richard Chase, who is the vampire of Sacramento, who, who like was incredibly schizophrenic and very, very deranged. And he thought that his blood, he thought his, I think blood turned a chalk or his bone, like his bones were breaking. Like he had all those kinds of he need, he believed he needed to kill people and needed to drink blood to help because he was there's something very wrong with him. So you'd want to believe that you you're your killer that you would play would want to have some just reason behind it. Well, I would like to, it's almost like watching the movie seven where but you only learned about it in the end. But it's that thing of like, what are you writing in those fucking notebooks in the tiny, tiny writing? You know what I mean? Like what is this? How did this start? And let me see why you think this is okay. Or this is like, yeah, you know, sneaking into somebody's house and standing in the dark and you want to scare them, you want to continually make them as scared as they possibly can be. And what does that, why is that a thing in your brain that rewards you or something? Because you're a fucking idiot, man. Most of these serial killers are like, when you see these, I watch the interviews. And when you see the Dahmer interviews, and when you see the BTK killer interviews, and when you see the interviews, it's like, Jesus Christ, they're boring. They're just these like saps, usually there's nothing like interesting really, they just seem really dull for like, and they're like really egotistical. Yeah, I think the only one did you watch mind hunter that series on Netflix that was based on so it's the guys that started the behavioral analysis thing in the FBI, basically that started understanding there were serial killers and tracking them. And there's this amazing scene where they talked to Ed Kemper, who was also in and he's in Santa Cruz, and he was a coed killer type of guy. And the interviewers just like asking him, and he's explaining in the most like, like they're talking about British literature or something. But he's like explaining why he did, he killed his own mother and, and fucked her decapitated head. And he's explaining to the FBI guy what the thinking was behind that, then he buried the head in the yard and had it face the house so that she would always have to look at him. Like that kind of stuff where if you came upon that scene as a police officer, it looks like the most horrifying nightmare in pandemonium, but there's a person who did it for a reason. What do you think is the difference between American presidents and serial killers? The weapons they use, maybe? Like this, that I honestly feel that my hope is eventually when things calm down a little bit and feel things don't feel like the world is totally going down the drain, that people will realize that it isn't like good, bad Republican Democrat, all the dividing lines that it actually should truly be sociopaths versus regular people, sociopaths and psychopaths and regular people. We have to get those people out of society because those are the people running these companies that are like no companies or people. We are going to take all the money, keep it at the top. You guys can all die. We're hoping you die. The dream is that you all die. We can have more money in space and we can have as many yachts as we want. I need those people gone. We have to stop worshiping those people. That's my human evolution dream. Sociopaths have such an influence and a deep effect on culture. You meet one of those people, talk about the commune or whatever, those people that are truly trying to take you for a ride and people fall for it and get all embroiled and all that kind of shit because they don't know about it. That presidents. They go straight to the top. Again, there's a John Ronson book called The Psychopath Test that's all about that those people eventually, because they don't care, rise to the top. There's nothing that brings them. Nothing makes them go, I can't do this anymore because they don't care. Wow. That is so, it's so wild to think about that, that it's just right. You're gonna be really, really successful if you're a sociopath. Yeah, you don't care. I mean, you step on anybody, steal any idea, take anything, make somebody loses their pension because of you, keep on moving, like figure out if you can get the pension. That kind of shit is how a lot of American business works. It's like that stupid fucking movie that greed is good bullshit. I remember seeing that in the 90s and being like, this is the most unhealthy thing I've ever seen. This is, this is incredibly wrong. And like, I don't know. I mean, I don't, I have no education about any capitalism or any of that shit, but I know more of just psychopaths and sociopaths where it's just like, they only want to win. They don't even care what they're winning. They just want to beat you. They want to take what you have. They want to beat you. They want to fuck you. They want to get ahead of you. They want to step, step on your head. Yeah. You know, okay. So you like, you know how cults are like religions that didn't quite take off, right? Yeah. And like serial killers are like CEOs. Yeah. They just went down a different path. Yes, exactly. They didn't have a, usually it's because they had a head injury as a child. So then they went on some weird like, they had to go criminal because they got genuinely fucked up in the frontal lobe when they were kids. So theoretically, if we could figure out a way to gather all the sociopaths of the world together, just not let them run things or let them run things, but we control what they're running. I mean, shit, they're there. Maybe I remember someone speculating, maybe there actually is a place for a sociopath in a community. Like you, like there, it's an evolutionary necessity for some reason to have one of these freaks floating around. But yeah, they're the ones that stand on the hill. And if a stranger is coming toward the village, you kill them no matter what. If it's a kid, if it's a family, you kill them to protect the rest of the village. Yeah. And you don't, it doesn't eat you alive. Like that would make sense. But now it's like, but now we have these ones, they're on the hill and they're just trying to kill everybody and take everybody's shit. Do you ever think about the statistics of, I don't know how many people, I can only imagine, and I'm not asking for the number, I have no idea how many people download your podcast, but do you ever do statistical analysis of that many people and then think to yourself, what is the probability that a serial killer is listening to this right now? The way I think of it is when I go to do a story, I always look up, are they still, is this person I'm about to talk about still alive? Could he download this and listen to it in jail? I think about that all the time. Most of the time, they're either not or it's like, there was, there was one, there was one, it was a, I think Georgia did it. It was a cold case and it wasn't, it wasn't proven, but it was like something that happened in this town. And when she got to the end of the story, she's like, and he's still alive and he's a lawyer in that town. And I was like, okay, well, everything you just said was a speculation and theoretical. He's a lawyer. He's a fucking lawyer. Like, what are, and, and, but that's also when we first started. We were just like chit-chatting, like it was just us. And yeah, I mean, it's just, it's a weird thing. The one thing I'm grateful for having kind of already been around true high level, like celebrity, having worked for Ellen and seen what her life, what that made her life into. I at least had a slight working knowledge of like the outer coming in to affect your inner life. Okay, right, right. Where you don't understand at first. It doesn't, it didn't make sense. This also happened so fast. It's so insane where I've lived in the city for 24 years, trying to do this thing and it's never happened. So then all of a sudden, like it going overnight is very odd to me. It must be. It's very odd and just kind of like, and I've been telling Georgia since it started, this is going to stop. So you need to get ready. You need to be prepared for how disappointing it'll be when we don't have this anymore. And she would just like the next week be like, well, look at where we are now on the and I'm like, that's going to end. So just let it go. I couldn't stop telling her to let it go because I just, I don't trust anything really, I think at the end of the day. But I don't even think you even, I don't even think you're even close to how big it's going to get. I think that you're not even close. I think that you're, you guys are going to, it just is going to keep ballooning out and ballooning. It will, it will, it will, because I mean, this is still kind of new to people. It is. Right. And it's, and podcasts are still new to people. Yes. Yes. That's the crazy thing about it is that, yeah, just what, what I try to do is not think about it. My, my goal is I just, and I'm sorry to bring it up around you. I just, as I was thinking about chatting with you, I was thinking like, holy shit, for sure. A serial killer is listening to this. I'm not saying one that you're talking about. I'm saying, just one sitting out there. A serial killer who hears about a, who hears about a true crime, the most famous true crime podcast is going to download it. Sure. And then, then I started thinking like, whoa, I wonder if like a serial killer walking through a neighborhood, scoping out the next house is listening to your podcast on his headphones. And then I started thinking, whoa, I wonder if someone's tied up in a house right now who has been forced to listen to your podcast by some podcasting serial killer. That's his specific torture. I mean, but and maybe that person is in that closet. Surprise. Then all of a sudden there's just a bloody hand that drags down that glass. God damn it. Well, you know what? I, I just, when I have gone down this road of what if true crime has been around for like a hundred, 200 years, actually. I read this really cool, I'm not gonna remember the name or the author's name, but it was basically how like the whole true crime thing basically happened in those like, I think they're called broad sheets. I definitely could be wrong, but it was basically in England, like in the 17, 1800s in England, where they realized that they could sell these newspapers because people wanted to know what happened with that body that was laying in the street. Right. Then, and they were like, as the paper sold, they were like, oh, we got to tell everybody, you know, like even maybe before real police or detectives were like that whole system was set up. They were telling people everything all the time and people were buying it and wanted to know that's just a human thing. Yeah. Did the worst case scenario happen? Please tell me everything. Right. Because I need to know so that going forward, I cannot have that happen to me. Gotcha. It's a, it's to protect yourself. It's just so you aren't, you know, walking through the world imagining that there aren't these human crocodiles among us. Right. But you, I'm telling you, I don't mean to keep going back and this is my own darkness coming out. But I, if we were in Vegas, putting bets down and they're like, do you want to bet that they're going to get a zodiac style letter from a serial killer one day? I bet, I would bet thousands of dollars that one day because, well, do you think, but do you think last podcast on the left would get that? Like, because there's lots of these true crime podcasts. I don't know. Do you think it's because we're women talking about it? I don't, I think like the vulnerability, I don't, I'm not up to date on like the, what are the most popular podcasts? I love last podcasts on the left, but I just think your podcast has become known as the, the one. Right. So that's why I would say it. Maybe because you're women, I don't know, but I think that that wasn't what I was thinking. I was just thinking, because that's just you, you have the, you know, when I think of a murder show, what murder show do you think of on TV? Well, I always think of forensic file. That's it. Yeah. It's forensic. It's the show. It's been on for 40 years. Yeah. It's, you watch it in the hotel as you're picking out on room service. After your shitty set. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's it. And so in the same way, I just, I'm just, I have an intuition that you guys are going to get, it used to be the serial killer, the zodiac killer would write to like, well, I don't know, in San Francisco, I don't remember. The chronicle. Yeah. The chronicle. Yeah. Or the examiner. Or the examiner. Yeah. But no fucking serial killer in his right mind or her right mind is going to send a fucking letter to a newspaper? No way. They're going to contact a podcast. But we wouldn't read it. Oh, no, you wouldn't read it. No. But you'd have to give it to the police. Well, that would be fucking exciting as fuck. The, I had a detective from Burbank, Burbank PD, right? It's not even LAPD. Come to my house because there was a shooting down the street. And they, they were just knocking doors to find out if anybody saw anything or heard anything. It was one of the most exciting things that's ever happened. The vibe off these two dudes, full suit, like men's warehouse style suits, slicked back hair, like a pinky ring. I'm like, that could be my brain inventing. But I remember like a gold pinky ring. And I was trying to think of something to tell these people because I was so thrilled. I was felt like starstruck. And we've had FBI agents come to our meet and greets. We had these two FBI agents come when we were in Baltimore. It was truly like better than any celebrity I've ever met. I was like weak need. And they were both like six, four, kind of like they just look like two hot dudes with suits on. And they walked up in the meet and greet and were like, we need to talk to you ladies. And so it was like a hilarious joke. And they were legit FBI agents with badges. And I was just like, like, completely a seventh grader. That is so badass. It's so we are getting, I mean, it's, I would assume cops would be like, fuck that shit. I would assume an FBI agent would be like, they don't even know what they're talking about. You know what I mean? Like, I would never think we've had people come up and be like, I'm a, you know, a psychologist or I'm a therapist or I'm a, I teach forensics at this place where just like, that's incredible. Like, you're the expert here. And then you're listening to our basically conversation about your business. Yeah. I know I wouldn't expect you to want to listen to two intense amateurs. Like not some people really try to pretend they know what they're talking about. Right. When they do true crime, it's a, you know, statistical informational base. I fucking mess up every single episode. That's all I do. Well, listen to the forensic files narrator's voice. I mean, it's that voice, that thing is like how it's always been done. So to have suddenly the antithesis of the event in the form of your conversation, I mean, it's the perfect comedic device. It's like these, it's matter and anti-matter crashing against each other. A thousand and also in the way that people go, you're not allowed to do that. You're not supposed to be doing that or that how do you do that when you're not supposed to where it's like, but in my world, the way I was raised, you do do it. Like, maybe it's just that Irish Catholic thing, but like sitting at the table with my grandma or my grandma and my dad would go, they go through what horrible things have happened to all the people that they know. That's like a nice visit where you're like, this person has cancer. And did you hear about this person? They got hit by a car. And that was just like the update of like, this is the events of the of the realm we live in. Yeah. Basically. So to me, I feel like that's part of it too. Or it's like, we're not trying to say, we know why things are happening. We're not, we're not doing anything. We're just going, can you fucking believe this? Right. Yeah, I love it. It's the best. Now, I'm sorry. I keep saying that about your show. It's obvious and embarrassing, but please don't apologize. Here's a super dark question I had for you. Okay. And I've kept you a little longer than I usually do. It's okay. I love it. Okay. Beautiful. Okay. My question was, if you're getting stabbed to death, do you think there's a cool thing you can say to your murderer that would haunt them forever? How about, I hope you're happy. That's pretty good. Well, I hope you're happy. Yeah, because that's the, that's like the last thing you got, right? If you're getting stabbed to death is like, it's to stop screaming because you know, they're getting off on it. You know what's hilarious about that? My cousin Stevie used to have a shirt like the first cartoon that I, I saw it was like, instead of it being a picture, I was like, oh, that, I get that. And it was an eagle that looked like it was landing with its talons out, almost like 3d style out of the shirt. And then at the base of that, there was a mouse standing there with it's flipping the eagle off because it was about to get eaten. Yeah. And I underneath it, it said something like the, the last stand or make your, make your stand or fucking something where it was just basically like, like if you're about to get creamed, fucking like, do, do your thing. Why not? Yeah. Why wouldn't you do that? That's right. Be theatrical about it. Like if you're gonna, if you're about to get murdered, be theatrical, but I'm a little interested or you were talking about the marches. I assume you're talking about the gun control marches. Is that what you meant? I was thinking of the women's march only because that was the, kind of the first mod, like recent big one. What's your stance on that, on gun control, knowing all you know about all of this shit? Like one of the things when I watch forensic files or hear about this stuff, one of the things I think is like, I want a gun. I want like a gun in my house. Yeah. To defend myself if I need to. The sad part about that is the statistics say the guns don't help. That gun's actually, you, you, much more injury happens operator error style and that oftentimes if somebody breaks into your house or wants to attack you, the gun won't be close by. It'll be in your gun safe. If you're a normal person, it'll be in your gun safe and it won't matter. Yeah. What are you going to have one of those bed holsters? Have you ever seen that? Like the shotgun bed holster? No. They have those. Like on the bed. It's on the side of your bed. It's a holster. You put your shotgun in it so that when someone's breaking in, you reach down and pull out the shotgun, you're ready to blast. You know what's crazy? I've been reading Michelle McNamara, Patton's wife, his late wife, who wrote this in fucking credible book about the most amazing story. Talk about the guy that's still out there and could be listening right now. The East area rapist who's now called the Golden State Killer, but he started in Sacramento where I went to college. So all the places, and I've just been reading her book, which is brilliantly, it's called I'll Be Gone in the Dark. It's so well written. It's so good. I can't, it's so tragic that she fucking died. It makes me so mad. But anyway. It's unbelievable. They talk about, I was so shocked. Like it's not like I was best friends with her or anything. I knew her socially. It rocked me so fucking hard. It was so shocking and awful. Anyway, and then just, yeah, and then she's one of the most talented writers I've ever read. Yeah, it's like on every level. It's just a trim. It's a, it's a, yeah, it's a black hole. It's like, yeah, because I read her writing. I haven't read the book yet, but her writing is just amazing. It's, and she knows, because she is such a fan of all that stuff, she knows how to process details and facts, factoids in a way that she presents it to you. So it's like so much of true crime writing is really dry. And it's, and it's also very overly like somber where she's in there basically going, like you're walking through it, like this is what it would be like. She's, she's painting this picture that is, she's not trying to code it with an, aren't we sad about this? She's going, look how fucked. Look at this. Look at how fucked this is, but it's not, it's not exploitive. It's factually look how fucked. And it is incredible. Like if you care about true crime, reading that book is quite an experience because the writing is, I mean, like fucking, I feel like people, of course, when they lose somebody, then you, everything gets put through, through this lens of like, well, of course, we're all going to say nice things about her writing because she died. That is not what's fucking going on here. It's, it's exemplary writing. It's, it's incredibly high level. Yeah, for sure. Nobody's, yeah, there's no reason, like there'd be absolutely no reason. I think, but that's talking about like the jealous mind, that thing of people going, like, oh, you're not going to say something negative about it. It's like, you fucking can't. I try, I challenge anyone to read that book and not walk away going, that was one of the most talented writers. It's like everything. Word choice, the phrasing, everything. But all of that is to say, the Golden State Killer was a rapist in Sacramento who raped like over 50 women. It went on for a really long time. He would rape women intentionally when the husband was there. So he would tie them both up, put a stack of dishes on the husband's back, take the woman in the front room, rape her, knowing like, because to, to inflict that kind of pain of knowing I've taken your wife and you're gonna sit here and listen to it, they, they said gun sales went up, they sold like 6,000 guns in one month or something like that. It never helped. Nobody ever pulled a gun on this guy. Nobody ever, like he, I think he was shot at one time and it was because the people were already up out of bed. But like that idea that you can buy a thing that will prevent is a fucking lie. It's a lie. And like, it's a nice idea and it might make you feel better, go get a gun if, if you want that security. But you also have to take into account that you lose security for having a death machine right next to your fucking bed. As a comedian, many of us are afraid to own guns because we think we'll turn them on ourselves. No joke. I've talked to a few different comedians and it's two different comedians have said to me, I can't have a gun, not because I have some strong feeling about guns, but I just get really sad. You know what's that made me think of my, because I was like, it makes me think of like what you think you'd reach for, how you think you would take care of business in a situation where you've never been in that situation before, tightened beyond your, you're feeling a fear level that no one ever feels you've gone up to the top of the thermometer of fear. Yeah. What do you do in that scenario? Right. Um, my friend, uh, Malava, she used to be my roommate for a second. I thought maybe you would have known her. She was from Sacramento. She was from actually up north of Sacramento, um, up an Auburn where it's like all mountainous and it's that thing where you're, you're nearest neighbor is five miles away. And she had a friend that she went to high school with who, um, her parents went away for the weekend. She woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and there was a man standing in the hallway and she went to the fear thing, you know, her, the, of course it's like, Holy, this is, this is it. I mean, and that's part of my fascination to crime. That scenario, this is the moment everyone fears every single fucking person on the planet fears this moment, this confrontation. And the story is that that girl, high school girl just started making this animalistic noise. She's like, they're standing in a dark hallway, like at the either end of the hallway together and she just starts growling, gets down and just starts acting like an insane animal. And the guy fucking ran out of the house. Isn't that amazing? It was like her instinctual thing was like, well, there's no fucking, there's no gun, there's no weapon. Of course, it's going to happen in a surprise way. And what do you do if you have nothing to grab or nothing, no weapon, no defense. But there is, it's like, there is a way to scare the scary, you know, like, yeah, it's not, maybe that's a part of it too. In those moments, there are people who survive those moments. There are people who survive serial killers. There are people fucking get away, outsmart them. There are teenage 14 year old girls who fucking figure out a way to get out of a handcuff and climb out of a fucking bathroom window. It happens constantly. Right. I love those fucking stories. Yeah, me too. They're incredible. Yeah. It's beautiful, except, you know, the person's permanently traumatized probably and like there's resounding hellish darkness in them forever because of these swine and that fucking guy, that guy, the golden state killer. Yeah. Oh, my God. You guys got to start. I'm telling you on your, I'm saying, fuck me for, give me any advice. But if I were you, man, I'd have a moment where I would say something to the serial killer listening to your podcast, something like, no, I'm not interested in that. Kill yourself. But they're, that's not like, I don't think in my mind, if you are in that realm, there's say, they say that they think there's 2000 working serial killers in the United States, like at any given time, that's the average that they working. Yes. Fuck active. Fuck. Right. I think those people are not reachable in a normal way. So if any message I would have would get, you know, like all fucked up through the filter of whatever it's happening in their brain, that is that is bad. And it does. So any message I would have would get all bent up and fucked up. Anyway, plus the fact I don't have a message for them. I don't, they're, I don't care about them. Got it. I like the story of a person who is brought to that moment of what I think I, I think I would wet my pants. Like I, I think I would lose my all control of my physical body and probably fall down or something like, because I've had that fear moment, like almost getting into a car accident where you're like, Oh, I could have just died. Yes. Yes. Where like, I have a thing where when I get that level of fear, the tops of my arms, like, it feels like needles. Yep. Have you had that? Absolutely. Oh, that's not just my. No, when I get in the situation where like, there's a chance for violence, that violence could happen there, there's a reaction that goes up my arms where there's a sense of like, Oh shit, a tightening of the air, a feeling of like, Oh fuck, this is escalating to a point where violence can happen. Yeah. And, and, and that's a real shitty feeling. It's so crazy. And there are people who have been put into that moment and still were able to bring themselves to like a reason, a place of reason to get out of it. Yeah. That does happen. And a lot of times those women that are terribly victimized by monster people, they, it takes a while for them to recover, and then they start working with other people who it's, it's happened to. That's a thing that I fucking love. So many of those stories, like if you've ever seen a show I survived, so many of them, it's an incredibly well produced, well made show where people sit there with a black psych behind them and just go, so I was walking home from my thing and they tell you about their near death experience and it's, it's 90% women who have been attacked, strangled, raped and almost murdered and they survive. And then it's like a bunch of guys that were like, I went out on my jet ski and then this wave came like every, it's hilarious because I would say 80% of the men's stories are self inflicted hiking issues that they then had to like crawl back from a bear attack or whatever. And then these women are just like, and then there was a man sitting on my chest and he had a knife in my ear. It's like so fucking crazy. Poor dudes, right? That's what you're saying, right? It's very sad. It's hard for guys because nature is the ultimate serial killer. Yeah, exactly. We're in way more danger, way more danger because we're athletic. We like to jet ski. You put yourself out there. We're putting ourselves out there. I feel the exact same way. It's like you ladies really have it easy, totally easy because usually it's, it is mostly like men getting stabbed to death by these psychotic raping women. Yes. Well, I mean, men get stabbed for their, for, it happens. And you know, it's really interesting statistically. It's not like women are, it's that much more of the making up of the victims of like violence or whatever. I was making a dumb joke. No, no, no, I know. But I love the idea that someone goes to a place so black most people have will never go there, will never, ever experience it and still come back out and then go, I got you. I know exactly how you feel. If you're in this, you know, this place where this is a thing that actually happened on our show. I did it. So I used to retell I survived episodes when I was at work really late and couldn't like research or write a story. Okay. So I would just come in and say to Georgia, sorry, I was at work till eight o'clock. Here's mine. I'm going to retell you my favorite episode of I survived. One of them was the story of this woman, Jennifer Morey in Houston, Texas. She lived in a gated apartment complex. She was very worried about safety or whatever. So she specifically picked this place that had armed guards and big gates and all this stuff. She wakes up in the middle of night one night, there's a guy on her sitting on her chest with a knife to her neck. And she starts fighting him off. He's he's trying to rape her. She's fighting him off. He cuts her neck open. And she somehow gets she injures him somehow. And he basically gets off her and runs thinking that this is a mortal wound that he is inflicted on her neck. So he goes, she shuts the door, she wraps a towel around her neck, goes into the bathroom, shuts the door, gets on 911. It's talking to the dispatcher. The dispatcher is like, hang on, you're going to make it through this. There's a knock at the door. It's security. Let us in. We know that you're injured. And and so she goes, Oh, good securities here. And the dispatcher on the phone goes, don't open the door. And she goes, No, no, no, this is the security from my apartment complex. And they this is what I pay for. And he goes, Yeah, but we don't know who it is. So let's wait. He goes, the police are three minutes away. You can hang on through this, you can do this, whatever. Basically, they he they the knocking is like crazy. And like, you have to let us help you or whatever. And she's like, she she just doesn't answer. And eventually the cops come get her take her away. She survives. It's because it's I survived. They start searching the perimeter for this attacker with the security guards that work there. And one cop looks down and sees the security guard has blood on his socks. Oh Jesus Christ, they make him take his shirt off his chest is covered in blood. It's the fucking security guard broke into her apartment, cut the lights, cut the phone, cut the landline, and was in there to rape and kill her. And she somehow like, she injured him somehow. And he had to get out. And he left behind his hat. The reason he came back, he he wanted to make sure she died and he had to get his hat because he left his hat in her apartment. Okay, I tell this story on our podcast. A month later, I get an email from this woman, Jennifer Morgan. And she's like, I love the way you told my story. Thank you. It means a lot to me. And I was like, Holy fuck, well, we went and did Houston live show, like, in February, I think, or wait, no, it's March now. Last year, I can't remember. And she came to the live show, and she came out, I got to introduce her and she got, you get to say hi to everybody. And it was the fucking coolest thing because first of all, she's the chillest woman, she has a family. She is like the she's really, really cool. She's a lawyer, but she also has a whole victims rights fucking thing going on. And she stood on that fucking stage and told all those women in the audience, whatever it is you're going through, you can make it. And you have great people around you, you have a community. And she basically gave them this fucking pep talk. And they all knew her story. It was one of the most incredible things I got to ever be a part of. And that's the kind of thing where I'm like, yeah, there's all these things you can focus on. But if I'm going to be, I get to pick. And that, I mean, that was like, everybody was crying. It was just the coolest fucking moment of like, you get, you can like elevate, you can elevate shit out of the blackest blackness, I think. You can. And that's what you're doing. And man, that, or try, I mean, like trying, you know, you did it. That's it. That's beautiful. It was rad. It was really rad. Karen, thank you so much for being on this show. I love talking to you.

Experience the Children's of Alabama Indy Grand Prix this Sunday on NBC and Peacock at 3 o'clock Eastern. Hello, my sweet friends. It is me, Duncan, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. I thank you for climbing out of that great ocean of nothingness that has separated you from me ever since we got blasted out of the white hole. They call the big bang in connecting via those earbuds you've jammed into your sweet, warm, soft, sticky ear holes. It's a pleasure and a true honor that you're allowing my raspy, lesbian voice to vibrate the tiny little bones right next to your brain. I like being here, safely stuffed into your holes. I can't spend too much time yapping. This podcast clocks in at two and a half hours, so just some quick announcements. First, biggest announcement. May 27th, I will be doing a live Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast from the Hollywood improv. This is the first time I've done a live podcast in Los Angeles. We've got Emil Amos from the Holy Sons flying in to play some music for you guys in the beginning. Unfortunately, it's only a 90-minute show, so I'd like for him to play for a long time, but he's definitely going to do some songs. Haven't nailed down the guests just yet, but I'm working on some really interesting folks. I wish I could talk about it, but I can't. You can get tickets at DuncanTrussell.com. There's a ticket link there, so that's really exciting. And the improv's a cool place for us to all gather together because there's a big bar that we can all hang out at before and after the show. And there's some cool places in the area too that we could wander to if the improv gets too stuffed with fools. The Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Sure Design T-shirts. Sure Design T-shirts create some of the sweetest. I don't know if they're sweet. I've never really shoved one in my mouth yet, but I guarantee they'd be good for playfully gagging your lover, because they're just that soft. If you ever had that problem where you realize you can't find your bondage ropes because you're too stoned and you can't remember where you put them, it's the worst. Or maybe you're just at a hotel and you didn't bring your ball gag or your bondage ropes. Well, the next best thing is a Sure Design T-shirt. Just take the sweet, trembling hands of your darling lover, place them gently behind his or her back, and tie them together before you shove them back on the bed and ravage their helpless, squirming bodies. And after you make sweet love, you can use the shirt to mop up the mess, put it on, and then go to yoga class with a sticky, smelly, disgusting Sure Design T-shirt that you've clearly used to mop up your unholy love juices. People are going to love it in your class. When you go into Downward Dog and they look over at the strange, yellowing, still moist stains on your shirt, they're going to know that you have connected with a transcendent consciousness that runs through all things. Speaking of shirts, have you gone to our shop yet? If you go to dunkintrustle.com and click on the shop link, you will find that we have amazing posters, amazing t-shirts, and amazing stickers. All of these t-shirts and stickers contain within them special powers because they're sigils that we use to spread the energy of love through this strange material dimension that we happen to exist in. Where are the shirts? I hope you wore shirts to Coachella. These shirts are magnets for novelty. If you go around with a Dunkin' Trussell family hour t-shirt on, there is a 15% chance that a talking hummingbird will land on your shoulder and tell you where treasure is buried in your backyard, or maybe even inside your heart. Listen to the talking hummingbirds. If a hummingbird talks, write down what it says. Write it on a little note, tie it to a balloon, and release it, and you'll have 17 years of good luck. That's science fact. We're also brought to you by Amazon.com. If you've never heard of Amazon.com, I'm very excited to tell you about this tiny little company. They're a boutique company that has a website where you can order anything. Whatever you want, you can order it. You never have to go out anymore. You never have to go to the stores. You can just sit in front of a glowing rectangle, type in what kind of plastic you're looking for. Oh, you want it in an inner tube? No problem. It's here. Do you need hygienic swabs? It's there. What about those embarrassing things? The things you're embarrassed to go to the store and buy, like a necktie. Now you no longer have to go to a public store and get stared at like a weirdo because you're buying a noose with polka dots all over it that you're going to wear to the job you hate. You can go online and order it anonymously. That's a wonderful thing. You know what I just bought from Amazon.com? A Berkey water filter. These are hardcore Alex Jones level water filters that actually remove the fluoride from the water. At least that's what they say. You can pour LA city water into these things. And as you know, LA city water is 80% cocaine and 20% narcissist tears. It's disgusting, but a Berkey water filter magically transforms this foul tasting substance in the unicorn piss. And if you've ever let a unicorn piss in your mouth, you know it tastes good. So go to dunkintrustle.com and go through our Amazon portal. Every time you do that, they give us a very small percentage of anything you buy and it doesn't cost you anything. But it's a great way for you to help support this podcast while buying plastic and cotton and food. They even have food there. So if you're going to spend your time out in the world, spend it doing interesting things, going to museums, go to the La Brea Tar Pits, take your dog on a hike, but don't spend your precious human incarnation lost in these hell mazes that we call shops. Getting sneezed on by the children of anti-vaxxers. You can get really sick that way. Okay, this is number three. I can't remember this is number three or four of a series of conversations I've been having with Chris Ryan and Joe Rogan. We just swap. This rotates through our podcasts. I think Chris Ryan has created a page where all of these are listed. If not, I'm sure we'll make one soon. We haven't come up with a name for this thing. It could be Shrimp Parade. It could be Old Men in the Snow. It doesn't really need a name, I guess. But if you like these conversations, you can find more by going over to chrisryanphd.com or the tangentially speaking part of the Farrell Audio website or by going to joerogan.net. And now everybody sit back and enjoy the Shrimp Parade with Joe Rogan and Chris Ryan. Are we rolling? God bless you all, sweet angels of the internet. We have gathered together again for another epic episode of Shrimp Parade, which is what we call it when it lands on my podcast, the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour. I'm here with Chris Ryan, the legend from the podcast Tangentially Speaking, and of course the author of the number one book on romance and Keeping Your Marriage Together, Sex at Dawn. And of course, Joe Rogan, host of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, legendary comedian, host of the UFC, and a hunter now who has, we just went shooting guns. I'm still a little giddy. He's got a fucking, I don't know what that is, man, but that's an air cannon. What gun is that, Joe? Every time you pull the trigger, it creates the same kind of concussion that if you throw a grenade. It's a seven millimeter Remington Ultramag. It's a very high velocity, long range rifle. It's a rifle that you'd shoot something with confidence 200 plus yards away. It's insane that it's so loud. I mean, it's like one of those old dudes there at a pacemaker, it would disrupt it. No, dudes get used to it. It creates shock waves. You feel it in your brain. Well, it's something, it's very powerful. It's a serious, serious rifle. It's not something to be joked around with. If you want to cut any of the real sounds into this, I recorded on the range, some of you are shooting. Oh, really? Yeah, I was talking with Duncan when you were shooting. So if you, I don't know if you want to add real real world sounds, because he's, you're not, I don't think you're intentionally underplaying it, but it's like the first time you shot it, it's shocking. It's like something's gone wrong. It sounds like a meteor impact. I was telling you, I felt the breeze on my face every time you shot it. The first couple of times I just thought, oh, there's a little breeze and I could feel like my hair move and stuff. And then I was like, well, no, that's that gun. And I felt every time you shot, there was like, it was like the breath of a lover. That's cool. That's what an assassin says, right after he blasts somebody. Breath of a lover. Well, it's, it's a gun that would allow you to hunt pretty much any large game species, whether it's an elk or, you know, a large moose or something. Do you think it could go through body armor? I don't know. It's a good question. It would have to be, it would probably depend on what kind of bullets you'd have to probably use the legal bullets. You'd have to use some sort of steel covered steel jacketed bullet. It probably it would be like a like getting hit by a car. It doesn't matter if you're wearing body armor. It would break your ribs. Oh, yeah, I would definitely hurt and internal damage. You know who was a sniper speaking of snipers Dr. Ruth Westheimer. No shit. You know that little sex lady who was this letterman. She was a sniper in World War Two. Oh my god. She was in the army as a sniper. Yeah. Was she for the Germans? Must have been for the Russians. For the Polish. I thought she was German. I don't know. I'm sure people are googling Dr. Ruth Westheimer Russian. Dr. Ruth was a Nazi sniper. I hope I'm not full of shit. Every time I'm on these podcasts with you guys, if I come out with some bullshit, people send me emails. You're full of shit. Well, luckily we have a computer whatever it was. I feel like I would know if Dr. Ruth was a sniper. Good. Let's Google it preemptively. Dr. Ruth was a sniper. Snopes.com. Dr. Ruth a sniper. Partially true. Diminutive Dr. Ruth Westheimer at four foot seven inches is the nation's most well known sex doctor, though you wouldn't suspect it from her grandmotherly appearance. Dr. Ruth blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The whole thing about her, her, you know, her background, her military career was cut short when she was seriously injured. Her legs were almost ripped off. It says my legs were almost ripped off on my 20th birthday in 1948 in Jerusalem from a cannonball shrapnel, which exploded in the students residence where I was living. Three other students were killed instantly and many more were wounded. The metal pierced both my legs and there was blood everywhere. A cannonball from Jordan had smashed through the window. I was thrown 20 feet. The strangest thing was that all I could think about was whether there might be some blood on the brand new shoes that I had just gotten for my birthday. There's a woman and amazingly there wasn't even a drop on them, which is all I cared about in some sort of some kind of strange denial. Well, that's what the mind does. The mind tries to minimize shit like that and to pick out the least terrible thing and just to keep it so you can keep it together. Wow, that's so so crazy. It's I think it's one of the reasons why people so easily accept war in this day and age, the people that haven't experienced it, because we don't have it over here, because we don't have those stories. You know, those stories like a daily thing over here, people would be scrambling to stop all this military conflict. They'd be trying to be saying like there's got to be better ways than this. Bring the war back home. You ever heard that before? That's the saying of the weather underground. You watch that documentary on the weather underground. No, I didn't. So the weather underground was this militant organization back in the 60s during the Vietnam War that had as their slogan, bring the war back home. And they started blowing shit up in the United States. Government buildings, they started blowing up government buildings to show people what it looks like when things get blown up in the United States so that maybe it would raise people's awareness of how violent, terrible war is. Great documentary. These were crazy motherfuckers and Obama is friends with one of them and got in trouble for being friends with one of them. But he was a college professor, right? Yeah, a college professor. But they would ride in vans on the way to plant explosives underneath government buildings and have orgies in the vans. So like on the way to to plant explosives in a building, you're going to explode. You're fucking in a van. Oh my god. That's how hardcore they were. I think danger makes people horny. Probably right. I experienced this in hospitals when I was working in these hospitals in Spain. I think just being in the presence of death creates an urgent life force within people, which is, I mean, I have to disagree a little bit, I think, with the idea that the presence of war, the proximity of war makes it makes it apparently revulsive to people. I'm sure that's true because of the suffering. But if you look around the world, what it tends to do is make people angry and more war like, you know, so it's like, look what happened 9 11 boom, like suddenly we're in two wars and we're attacking shit all over the place. I think when it gets closer, it makes us lash out violently and can make us really dangerous. That's interesting. But Israelis are not known as being like really violent people. In fact, they're known as being like they have a very party atmosphere over there. They like to party. Like as far as like Israeli citizens, like the Israelis that I've met that come like my friend Shuki was a kickboxing instructor out here at Majiro gym. And he's from Israel. Shuki's a great guy, just this just like the best example of like a vibrant Israeli man, just very like family oriented and loving and hugging everybody and just a really warm guy. And I went over his house for dinner once. And his wife breaks out the bongos and they start playing bongo music and dancing around. And the kids dancing and he's dancing and it's legit. They're like, we're just really being friendly and open. And I said, well, I go, man, I go, you guys are so free. I said, like, why is is everybody like this in Israel? Like, what's this? He goes, everybody over there because life could end in any moment. So you're like party, party, party, party, party, everybody party, all the time party. I was like, really? He's like, all the time party, all the time party. And he would like hug you. Like this dude was a he was a unique cat. Yeah, that's beautiful, man. It's such a damn shame that for people to live like that, they have to be like what you're saying and some close proximity to death either either real or perceived. But it's it's a strange thing that the closer you get to that boundary, the more you love life. This guy on top of that was also a high level kickboxing trainer. He was a fighter. And then he became a trainer and worked with these like really big time heavyweight guys. Like he worked with this guy, Stan Longinitas, who kicked so hard, you really break guys legs. Like he broke Dennis Alexio's leg with a leg kick like seconds into the fight, just a devastating one was this this was in the probably I want to say the 80s. Okay, the late 80s, early 90s. But Shuki, when he was trained, this guy, he needs to get a hip replacement, because this guy would kick him so hard that it really it blew his hip out. Jesus, he would hold the pads for this guy, hold this leg shield. And the dude kicks so hard that that side like he has to get a hip replacement. So so much damage to his hip, just from eating kicks from this fucking guy. That's how scary he was. You know what's really annoying? What's super annoying? You have people like that who you're talking about vibrant connected people who are living life, who have made the decision that they're going to actualize themselves and be in the moment. And and it sounds so beautiful. Then the people that are the real demons in the world are the ones who feel like they've got plenty of time. And they look at you when you're acting like that living like that being like that, right, like something's wrong with you. Like they need to intervene that you're malfunctioning. Like what the fuck are you doing, man? You've got to calm down. Yeah, you need to step in and and stop all this happiness. Yeah, yeah, they they don't like it. It's really weird. And you know, right away when you're around one of them, because it feels like suddenly you've been in a nice hot air balloon at some nice altitude and the hot air balloon drops like 20 feet or 30 feet. And then they also feel like this self righteous indignation where they're allowed to impose this on you. Yeah, they're allowed to impose all this shitty management of their thoughts on you. And they'll say something like, Hey, I'm just being real, like why they're doing it. And they're imposing this really douchey, like just annoying, life sucking vibe to everything that's around them. Yeah. And that is such a terrible thing to have happen when you when you end up around that. And you're suddenly this, you know, Chris, Ryan, you talk about this beautiful time in the past where humans were hunter gatherers and wandered. Even if it's not real or even if we're not sure what it is, let's imagine it at its ultimate place, which is just human beings are completely connected to the inhalation and the exhalation of the universe. They're in the rhythm of everything. They're just part of the flow in the flow, just being sustained by what's around them. And not even sensing that that's going to go away because they're part of the earth and the earth feeds them just like they eventually feed the earth. Well, you could still have some kind of feeling like that. Now you can still have that feeling. You just don't have the same landscape around you, but you can still allow yourself that sense of, I'm going to be fine. I know I'm going to be fine. I can feel it inside. I'm going to be fine. The way that I die is going to be fine, no matter how terrible or how easy it is. And everything that happens before that's going to be fine. But then you get around these motherfuckers, and they don't think everything's going to be fine. They think you're going to get some awful things going to happen to you. You know, like they really, and they feel like some awful things going to happen to them too. They're walking through heaven like somebody in a mine field and you get around them and their poison can get into your head a little bit if you're not careful. Definitely get into your head. You have to be on guard. Yeah. How do you do that though? Because man, sometimes when I get around people like that, I will walk away and then for a couple of days be thinking about what they're saying and be like, Oh, fuck, Jesus Christ, man. Maybe they're right. Maybe they're fucking right. Maybe we're maybe we're being monitored all that maybe we're, you know, they're paranoia can infect you a little bit. What are, how do you fight that? Do you guys have tricks to like sage your brain? I think that is always going to be something that comes up when you're dealing with the range of humans from positive to negative. You're always going to run into extreme examples of people that are just like glowingly radiant, like my friend Shuki, who's just a glowing guy. Like he had this life energy. You wanted to be around them. This is always going to be people like that. And then there's always going to be people that no matter what, there's something wrong. No matter what, they'll find something to bitch about. And a lot of times they feel like they're being deep while they're doing it, which is hilarious, you know, because they're using big words and like being very descriptive. They feel like somehow or another, their intention is deep to just be, you know, like completely douchey and negative. Have you guys talking about me? No, this is all this is all a big setup, isn't it? Yeah, because I mean, I'm famous. I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm famous as the naysayer and the doom and gloomer on this podcast. Dude, that's all bullshit. You know, you, you are a very optimistic guy. You're just smart. You're smart and Duncan and I were retarded. And we have ridiculous ideas that will beat into the ground. But I'm talking about, we're not talking about you in any stretch of the form. If you ever ended up at the beach with somebody who starts talking about taxes. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. You're at the beach. Waves are rolling in. You're looking into infinity. Kites are in the sky. Children are laughing in the distance. And you look over and they're like, man, fuck, you know, I'm working on my tax returns right now. It's like, you're working on your tax returns right now. We're at the beach. Where are your files? You know, you know what kills me? You're at a restaurant with someone or you're at home, whatever, and you're sitting down to some really nice food and you start eating and they start talking about some other food they ate. You know, I had this salmon once and it was so perfectly crunchy. And you're like, I'm eating this really nice kale and you know, for something and you're talking about salmon that you had one time. Imagine having sex with someone and they're talking about how great their ex-boyfriend was. Exactly. He just knew how to make me come so good. He used to fucking hate my pussy the perfect amount of time. Not so much that I didn't respect him, but yeah. But it's all in the same family. It's all in the same family. This is why they're used to be etiquette. You know, there would be, people would have the sense to know in certain environments that's not the place where you like, it's just the same as flatulence, isn't it? It's like some people have psychic gas. They can't help it. They have to expel every once in a while a nice fucking cloud. I'm not talking about like apocalyptic ideas, Chris Ryan. I'm talking about bringing it down. Bring negative Nancy's. Yeah. What you're saying is a great way to describe it, though, dude. A psychic flatulence. Because it's all like flatulence depends on your diet. Your psychic diet. What you bring in, what you allow in your mind, what you pursue, the directions in which you take your thoughts. And it also accumulates and then is expelled. There's a, I think that happens with some people. Well, maybe the people you're talking about don't let it accumulate. Some people just have a little like those little like when you're walking and you've got a fart and like 17 farts come out. They just, they constantly just do these little like I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. They say in all these different ways, you know, I'm scared. I'm scared. I think I have enough money for it. I don't know if I'm there. I think I'm gonna be all right. I don't know. I've been feeling a little weirdly. I think I've been feeling like a little sick lately. How are you feeling? Is there pollen in the air lately? It's just this bloop, bloop, bloop. But really all they're saying is I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. Am I gonna be okay? Am I gonna be okay? I don't know if I'm okay. Do people actually like me? Are you sure they like me? Does everybody really like me? And that gets to what I heard when you were saying that. What I hear is someone who's afraid. Someone who's looking for help. That's why they keep talking about their problems. They're looking for help. They're looking for you to give them something for you to offer. You know, and so they're terrified because they don't have community. And of course, they're behaving this way. So they're never going to have community because people want to get away from them. So it's a cycle. So there's also the reality of everyone's journey, not starting at an equal and ideal point. And then like, say if we're playing Candyland, if we're all playing Candyland, we, the three of us, like sort of emotionally and spiritually, we're at a certain level of the game. We've had enough of these bizarre back and forth life experiences and then honest conversations with friends like this, like these conversations that we have, honest conversations with friends about all the various aspects of life to the point where I get your opinion, which I trust and respect and your opinion, which I trust and respect. And I toss them in there with my ideas. And it gives me a much better sense of what the world is all about. It's one of the cool things about having smart friends is like smart friends help shape and expand your point of view and your worldview and your vision. And some of us don't have that luxury. Some of us are stuck with a bunch of shitheads. You're surrounded by shitheads. You're born into a shithead family and you're like, God damn it. And it's so hard to get out of that groove. Whereas you were in that groove growing up, I was in that groove growing up. Our lives weren't ideal. But I think in that lack of ideal is where a lot of the passion comes or where a lot of the curiosity comes. We have this strong need to live a life different than the life that you were sort of like born into. And I think that's the case with a lot of people. I think we have to really respect that when we talk about like people being idiots. And they are idiots for sure. But damn, we could have been way worse off. Well, no, you're right. And that's compassionate and using the term idiot is a term of convenience. I don't mean everybody wants. I've been an idiot for sure. And I will continue to be and people like everyone goes through fate idiot phases anyway, we're all cycled through it anyway. And you're supposed to see people you're supposed to see behind the fear because behind the fear is apparently love or a light or a expansiveness or the thing that connects that person to everyone else. And the Bodhisattva or even a mildly spiritual person will be a person who recognizes like instead of thinking as I often might think, this guy is a fucking bummer, man. I don't want to be around it. I just want to go home. I want to be there with my dog who's very positive around nature. You know what I mean? But it's like you just in the same way if you're on someone who's got BO, you're going to start thinking like, Oh, God, I can't wait to get a breath of fresh air. But the what you're saying is really cool because you jump behind all that and you think, Okay, here's a person who's afraid. And then you think what you're saying, which is like, they're afraid for a reason. They had some kind of shitty upbringing or some awful thing happened or a series of terrible coincidences happened that has made them like that. And then you make the decision. I'm going to leave them at the bar because they're fucking annoying. I left one girl at the bar very early on in my career when I wasn't so good at leaving girls at the bar. But it was such an extreme example. Like I was like, I've made some terrible choices when it came to relationships just based on I thought, Well, this is this bitch is crazy. This might be fun. I've made those choices. I made those choices in my 20s for sure. But I went out with this one girl. And we went out one night and met her at a comedy club and she was real friendly and seemed real normal and just a nice girl, you know, working in LA and I forget what she did. You know, forget where her job was, but something involved in show business. And then the next day I saw her at the same place and she was smashed. I mean, smashed like walking sideways, falling over, dropping glasses, spilling things. And I was like, Wow, like what is this? Like, like this isn't just like a little drunk. Like this is like either she got drugged or this is like a normal thing. Did you sleep with her that night? No, how dare you? How dare you? No, but let's hear some of the real mistakes, not the ones you missed. But that was that was a beautiful one. That was a beautiful one. Because I just said that's it. I'll be it. I'll check please. Yeah, like one day in, right? Yeah, that's a question like what I mean, you know, I love listening to Ram Dass and Jack Cornfield and they've set this water, they set the bar really high because they're, you know, adamant about the idea that all of us are ultimately just love. And the thing that's around it is an illusion. And if you can see through that into the love, then the people around you will start to change if you can really do it. They're not saying fake it. They're not saying look at some annoying shithead with those fake goo goo new age crystal gazing eyes like, Oh, you are wonderful and I see it. They're saying develop work on yourself enough so that you actually can see it because you can see it. Apparently, if you if you if you spend enough time, meditate, I don't know how you do it, but it's like an invisible thing, which is in everyone. And that is their true identity, which is apparently love and that love can enhance and change the vibration of all the people around them. So even if you date and a crazy bitch does coke at work and likes to fuck her friends, whatever, whatever, you know, so she comes home drunk and, you know, she curbed your fucking wheel when she parked in your parking spot. Whatever, man, just be love. Just be love. Also, whatever she ran your ATM car through the fucking roof and you've got no money left. They're going to repossess your car because this crazy bitch has been stealing your money. Well, that's the question. This is like a big question that gets summed up in hippie circles as who's going to wash the dishes. Somebody's got to deal with these basic problems in a utopian society. Somebody's got to deal with the fact that some people aren't going to respond to love the guy in locked up where I saw who's like, you know, covered in his own shit and throwing his jizz at the guards through that one little crack that they pushed food in. And he went to the grocery store in the mid eighties and like gunned down 17 your citizens. You could stare at him with gaga eyes all day long. And the moment he got out of there, you would be some dead meat. Yeah. What do you do, Chris? What do I do? I don't know that guy. But but I know that a lot of what you're talking about, you know, comes up in psychology and psychiatry. Obviously, my wife's a psychiatrist. And she worked for many years with people who like would scare the fuck out of any of us. I mean, people who drown their babies in the bathtub, people killed their parents, knife them at night, you know, like she worked with criminally insane people as well as non criminally insane people. And she's amazing. I mean, she's really, she's a very interesting person. The first time I went in to work with her when early in our relationship, she was working in this high security mental hospital. And it was like going into like, you know, get smart, you know, like the series of locked doors, double locking, you know, and we went in there. And the first thing I saw was like one floor of the cuckoo's nest, right? Just people wandering around zoned out and whatever. And the first thing I see walking in the door is this woman probably in her mid fifties wearing like a short nightgown on her back with her hands and her feet in the air, like, you know, like doing a, I don't know, like a crab, you know, on her back. And with the nightgown hiked up, you can see her old crazy pussy. You can see her. What a great quote. You can see her old crazy pussy. And Cassie just looks at her. Cassie's the doctor. The mouth of a toothless cloud. It was toothless, let me tell you. That might have been one tooth. I think I saw one tooth. But Cassie just laughed her ass off at this woman. This is the opposite of what I thought. It's like, you're the doctor and the woman sees Cassie and she gets this big smile. And Cassie just laughs and she's like, get off the floor, you crazy old lady. And such her way of dealing with crazy people is to laugh with them. Right. And it's hilarious. It's puts them so at ease and establishes rapport. She just cracks up. She uses it as a tool. It's such a beautiful thing to see, you know. I mean, I always talk about how psychiatrists or people who work in that area, they're like lifeguards, you know. And most lifeguards, what they do is they say, oh, you got a problem and they throw you a life preserver and wish you luck in the form of a pill of some sort, right? Cassie jumps in the water. She's in there with them. She's half crazy yourself. It's a really she's more of a shaman. She's a shaman who went to med school. What is the difference? That's fascinating occupation. What? Yeah, you know, it's a soul doctor is what psychiatrists literally means. Wow. Doctor of the soul. So they're like our shaman. So part of her the best ones are and that's why sorry to interrupt you, Joe, but to follow that through something that's really interesting is that you guys know this how psych the first people who used LSD LSD was originally marketed to psychiatrists psychotomimetic as a way for psychiatrists to experience psychosis that would then make them better doctors. That was the idea the early 60s when Santos was in late 50s early 60s. It was that's how it was marketed. Wow. And that now that's a shamanic tradition because in the shamanic societies it's the shaman who generally takes the mushrooms or the piety or whatever they're using or the ayahuasca to go to the upper and lower worlds to seek the the the source of your problem your curse or your illness or whatever is happening to you. It's normally the doctor who takes the drug not the patient. Could you imagine living in a society like pre western civilization society that was a shamanistic society based on like whatever ayahuasca or use of mushrooms or whatever sacrament they chose but to be in like an incredibly primitive society like that that's tripping balls all the time and like literally generally actually traveling to the spirit world on a regular basis and having these these incredible psychedelic hallucinatory whatever you want to call them experiences that sort of flavor the way they look at the material world that we're stuck in in this vibration but they're in it all the time and they're also in it with no internet right no machinery you know they're living off the land because we what's weird is what you're describing is that that is here in the sense that right now at this moment you can't even count how many people are hallucinating right now right you know god knows how many people just in a 20 mile radius of this place are hallucinating I can definitely name one I'm not really hallucinating but there are like there are there are like most likely people are tripping within a few miles with here you had a trip reporter yeah like a little thing you can look on your phone and it would light up where someone's tripping balls all over the city it's like like grinder for trippers or that thing that's that thing that tweets uh earthquakes you know so like it actually detects when how hard people are tripping so every once in a while it pops up like at 11.9 oh did you imagine tripping was like a video game where you could trip and literally go to like the next level and it would be like registered you would like show it on a high score on a screen yeah like you brought a fucking watch with you while you were tripping yeah like this special google watch that monitors the trip yeah like oh my god he's tripping at an eight oh my god they well they believe that albert hoffman the first time he discovered alice date was the only time a person never hit 10 i believe that too that poor bastard the first trip he doesn't know what's happening and he's riding his bike home oh the poor guy and he didn't understand why people were taking lsd recreationally at first because he had taken such a huge dose the first time he's like this is not something you do for fun because he was in such a limbo state for a while well he got it transferred through his skin yeah he got yeah he breathed it i think i think he i think he probably we should probably look i think there was i think he was working with spores wasn't he no no he was working with uh as i understand the story he was working sandos laboratories was trying to induce uterine contractions using uh variants of lysergic acid and so he they synthesized lsd 25 and he remembered how it made it was it had some strange effect on mice apparently like animals on it acted really weird and then after they had already shelved it he went back and visited it for some reason on intuition or impulse or thinking about how weird it made the mice act he took it out as i understand it he spilled some on his hand though maybe he did take a little bit himself i don't know i have the story right here this is what happened while researching lysergic acid derivatives hoffman first synthesized lsd on november 16th of 1938 his main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant an anapolep anapleptic leptic analeptic an analeptic with no side effects on the uterus in analogy to nick nickathamed necathamed n-i-k-e-t-h-a-m-i-d-e which was also diethylamide by introducing this functional group to the lysergic acid so what happened was he accidentally absorbed a small quantity through his fingertips and fortuitously discovered its powerful effect so it was through his fingertips but it's important to note when they say small quantity with the micrograms the best way i've ever heard described mckenna said that the power of lsd and relationship to these the actual size of it is like a single and dismantling the empire state building in a matter yeah that's a good way to describe it and and and what the fuck that's a great way to well it's shocking what it does to you when you consider that the how tiny tiny the doses that you take and then an hour in suddenly you're experiencing this rapturous energy coming through your body and then two hours i mean depending on if you if the lsd is good or not but it is a very interesting thing to think that this kind of utopia that you were talking about earlier where people are actively taking psychedelics and using them as a initiatory uh as part of an initiatory ceremonies and communing with nature making big decisions this very same thing happens to this day only it has to happen in the underground and it has to happen during a terrible prohibition where you can go to jail for it it's like this natural impulse is in us like when you put a dog over the swimming pool and its little legs start start moving even if it's never it's been in water before it'll still do that because it has built into it this remember swimming it's in its DNA in the same way humans we almost remember this way of being we almost know that this is something that calls to us and so we end up doing it in the united states in secret and then that's the mother of bad trips as people are taking these substances they don't know about the spirit world no one said to them you know in the west we call it going crazy but in every other part of the world it just means that you're connecting with an alternate dimension called the spirit world you know people don't know that they just think i'm losing my fucking mind man i'm seeing things demons elves holy shit i look in the mirror and i see myself aging and dying you're seeing the truth friend that is what you're doing you're aging you're dying your zillions of personalities exist inside of you and the universe is alive and your mind can't quite accept that so it's breaking it up into all these entities that you're witnessing i think that's what a shaman does he like ant takes a person's fear and then throws it back at them as a flower like look at this it's incredible what your experience and interestingly in those societies excuse me uh someone who's called to shamanize is the term that anthropologists use someone who's called to shamanize is the highest type of shaman the the lower shaman is someone who chooses to be a shaman who just wants to though the highest form of shaman has no choice in the matter uh normally in late adolescence they start hallucinating they hear voices they they communicate with animals you know however it manifests in the west we call that schizophrenia and schizophrenia tends to hit in late teens early 20s same time period about one percent of people all over the world exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia that break from reality but as duncan says in shamanic societies those people are seen as gifted they're people who can't help but move between worlds so what the society does is they gather around them and support them and help them through the experience of learning to control this power within them so that they're not destroyed by it because the society knows that then if they help this person get through it and learn to ride this horse then the the society the village will benefit from that power for the rest of his or her life that is absolutely fascinating so there's almost like an evolutionary reason for that kind of behavior that that kind of behavior is what becomes this type of shaman in some certain some circumstances yeah and even beyond that something that's an original idea to stanley who as you guys probably know is a big expert in shamanism he's written lots of books on it he's standing around yeah yeah um uh he talked about how in shamanic societies one of the ways a shaman heals is by uh the same way western doctors heal is using the placebo effect right that's why doctors all have a stethoscope and wear the white thing and you know it's all activating the placebo effect and uh which you know we consider unreal in some way but it is real because it works so that's real right but in any case that's the main tool that shamanic societies and cures have so stanley's idea is that then in that world where being capacity for belief is uh something that helps you heal because it activates the placebo effect people would have evolved to be more open in that way mentally they would have evolved to believe they would have evolved to to feel the power of ritual and so on and to to thrive on things like mushrooms and hallucinogens that's so fascinating so it's all it's just really the cultural construct of the society as it stands today that we've accepted as being the norm that that's really the problem for these people is that the the framework for this odd behavior this like shamanic instincts this this ability to live in the forest and merge between this world and the spiritual world on a regular basis especially if they're doing psychedelic drugs they're like in that circumstance could have been a positive thing yes but then to plant it into modern day society you guys got to get on on the bus every day and go to work he's got to do a job he doesn't want to do there's none of the the wild you know the the things that have stimulated whatever gift he has in his odd personality yeah there's no connection to this society he's lucky if he stays out of a mental hospital yeah and then we we drug him you know we we drug him to neutralize and we lobotomize him yeah exactly you know the only here's here's a thing I'm pretty sure of the only Nobel Prize in medicine that ever went to a Portuguese doctor was for the invention of the lobotomy oh my god Jesus Christ it's a little trivia for those of us with psychiatrists Portuguese wise yeah for the invention of the lobotomy I wanted to I wanted oh sorry go ahead no I was just saying I was thinking god I wanted to to talk about what you were talking about belief they have a wider a higher capacity for belief and I that feels like a western thing to say which is that they didn't experience something real but their belief they can believe in things that aren't real well let's see remember I I mean within the context of what I'm talking about with placebo where I'm saying it is real I just read this in other words their capacity for belief could be belief in things that are real and even things that are made real by the presence of belief which is how you could describe a placebo but they're they're there when they when they talk about this stuff they don't say well I was healed by a placebo effect they say the shaman contacted the spirit world and he took whatever darkness or however they term it I don't know exactly so but that's a funny thing that we do I do we do which is you take this thing and everything you understand is not a placebo but what you don't understand is a placebo effect if we don't understand why it works you just say well it's a placebo yeah as though but that so it's just weird how like the in these two different conceptions it's like you have these two paradigms fighting each other and one paradigm is connected to life one paradigm feels like it is completely part of the world and the other paradigm is so distanced from the world that it can't ever say this it can't say anything more than our minds create visions from time to time but they are not real and the reason they say that is they don't have the scopes if all one of these motherfuckers has to have is some hp lovecraft level magical telescope with runes on the side that they can all look through and see interdimensional beings or the spirit world or whatever it is and the thing's real now and then they'll say oh those are the they'll come up with the name of the species this is the materialistic vision of the universe right if I can't if I can't see how it works then it doesn't exist but what's funny about that is that in medicine which you know in the western medical model which is all materialistic and very scientific of course there are many cases of drugs that work way before and are used clinically widespread practice way before anyone can explain how so it's funny there are like aspirin nobody understood how salicylic acid stopped pain until the 70s right and then the american indians were chewing willow bark that had salicylic acid and it's been used for centuries in western practice but nobody understood how but they tolerate it because it works right so they're but they don't talk about it it's a funny it's a really interesting area there's a there's an essay called the the myth of mechanism that talks specifically about that that's cool you know I was just reading rereading about this the this tribe called the pinaha in the upper amazon super fascinating people anyone who wants to read about them there's a great article written by a friend of mine john colapinto that was in the new yorker and I know it's available online it's called the interpreter the interpreter colapinto and it's about this guy daniel everett who went to live in the upper amazon with this completely stone age tribe you know very little contact not uncontacted but very little contact nobody spoke their language it's such a bizarre language but he went there as a missionary a christian missionary with his wife and kids and he but he's also a linguist and he lived with them for 26 years divorced his wife and gave up his christian belief structure for theirs he basically went native uh and they're fascinating people they've got no numbers they are not they their sense of time is like if you're talking about something that you personally didn't experience or wasn't experienced by someone that you know personally they don't listen they don't engage so no history no history and also no future beyond like the immediate future right no numbers and no numbers it's like one some many is the is the only distinctions they make also no directions no no physical directions it's toward the mountains toward the river toward this you know it's all no color words they say it's the color of uh you know this berry so he's basically fucking cavemen well but he's over there banging a caveman check well let's see okay the thing about cavemen is that we assume when you say caveman yeah well the sex sex is an interesting thing actually in this society I'm sure very good they got no numbers there's no colors there's no 69 yeah how do they how do they work out you owe me one yeah but it's funny with one of these women well of course he did I don't know like being on avatar you might be thinking of of another great book called Into the Heart about the guy who goes and lives with the Yanomami I'm not thinking about a book I'm thinking about if I am staying 23 years with any group of people yeah I'm gonna have sex with someone yeah he was definitely having sex I don't think he says it immediately I mean openly but it must have been awesome why would he not say that's the first thing everyone's thinking because he's because he's a linguist at MIT writing scientific papers yes I did yes I did have sex with several of them it was great you know what people know how to fuck that's the first line nobody fucks like a cave person and I say cave person we'll all do respect we'll all do respect I don't I'm not judging nothing I'm just saying basically that's all my ancestors in the fucking caveman days and you're living like that today fairly cave people are from Jersey is that what that was no that's um that's the irony of an idiot mocking a cave person with a beautiful lifestyle yeah I say cave person in the most demeaning way hey I really mean is primitive tribe you know in southern Spain there are thousands of people who live in caves yeah I'm sure beautiful beautiful caves they cut them into the the walls but I I think that's badass I think that there is a kind of dark voodoo in the using the term placebo and and getting into that mechanistic language because I think it can cut you off from a direct experience with uh with with nature and and um and that that connection is what causes healing I think that's a that connection is what causes the thing people call the placebo effect but really it's just somebody reconnecting to what they really are that moment where you like connect you connect and you realize how incredibly beautiful the world is and how alive it is like every piece of the world everything the wood the carpet everyone you meet the wind you're in a living being and when you really experience that god damn it makes you feel good yeah it's hard to experience that with concrete that's one of the real issues with our lives there there's a difference in the way you feel when you walk through it like a Seattle rainforest yes there's a difference in you feel like when we were up there looking for Bigfoot yes dude I swear that I felt those those natural living things around me I swear when you're walking through this incredible rainforest and everything's vibrant green and this fucking moss everywhere and it feels alive you've been to Alaska right yes yeah did you get that feeling up there when I was in Alaska I felt like I felt like the land was vibrating there was a very slight vibration and just by being there I was getting energized it's almost like the weight of cities weighs down the land and stops the vibration see I think I think that well two things this is in Hinduism there's the three modes of material nature have you heard of this the goons the mode of ignorance the mode of passion and the mode of goodness and it's a different parts of the day are assigned to these different modes and different geographies are assigned in the mode so the city is considered to be in the mode of passion nature is in the mode of goodness certain foods are in the mode of passion spicy food food that basically they the way they put it is if it tastes bad and makes you feel bad mode of ignorance so that's like late night Carl's Jr. or something you know but he's not gonna like no offense Carl's Jr. but if like you're eating there after one o'clock and the guy's serving you has like been snorting math for three hours and the fries are it's you eat them you taste it you know it's bad but you eat it because you're drunk and hungry you're gonna feel bad mode of ignorance mode of passion makes you feel good but you're gonna feel like shit later so that's alcohol so that's 20 minutes earlier on your way to Carl's Jr. exactly then mode of goodness it is quite often maybe it doesn't taste so great kale but it's gonna make you feel good later so that's how they that's how they break it down so the city is in the mode of passion and some places in the cities are in the mode of ignorance but I like to believe that if you're skilled enough you can take any external stimulus and transform it so that it gives you not transform it but filter it in a way that you get that same feeling you get in the pacific northwest might be a complete naive rationalization of living in the city but what do you guys think don't you think it's more we can decide how to interpret the reality around us to bring varying degrees of bliss and pleasure well there's a positive aspect to the city and the positive aspect for us is that all our friends are here that's a big one it's a huge one that there's a massive collection of like-minded people you know when we talk about all the guys that we do stand up with everyone I know they all my favorite human beings all live within 30 miles right you know I mean I have friends in the east coast I have friends all over the place but my real you know core group of friends we're all here community yeah there's a massive amount of community here for us but the environment of the the artificial environment is something that you're always going okay I guess all right like when you're driving on the highway I firmly believe that when you're surrounded by buildings to the left and buildings to the right and signs and I think that your brain is interpreting all this stuff is unfortunate but it is what it is and you know you sort of make these distinctions you see all these gross buildings and you're like oh yeah okay what is it you don't get that when you're driving through Mount Rainier when you're driving up Mount Rainier what you get is whoa wow oh my god like we were driving and when Duncan and I were headed up there the sun was just peeking through the clouds so it had been raining for days and it would light up these corridors like there was like hills and valleys and the sun would come down through these clouds and light up these do filled corridors and it was just like god damn like that is art everywhere you look nature's art in that environment you see life yeah you see the moss growing on the rocks you see it's just everywhere is life and in an urban environment everywhere you look is dead yeah you know it's stopped and the road kill so I sympathize with what you're saying we should you know be we should be wise enough or enlightened enough to reframe things in the ways that make sense for us but I do think that it's very difficult to be healthy if you're eating Carl's Jr every day if that's all you're getting I mean there is a difference between good input and poor quality input and and it matters and yes there is a level of of being able to to decide but fuck it's hard man and and I think there are like there are elements to traffic for example traffic to me brings me to an aggressive angry place just because of the nature of it I'm I'm alert I'm worried I'm like I'm vigilant there's danger there's aggression there are people I don't know they're doing things that are unpredictable and weird and aggressive and it's like especially in LA like it's a real aggressive place here the reason I brought up the P Naha which relates to all this is he said they're the happiest people he'd ever seen and and there's some psychologists who came to do testing like cognitive testing and linguistic testing and they agreed that they're like the happiest people ever and the way they measured it was they would just videotape them for a few hours in normal daily routine and count how much of the time they were laughing or smiling or fucking wow yeah and what he said was which relates back to the your complaining friend in the bar is that you know in thinking about this for 20 some years that he lived there like what why are they happy they have nothing you know they're their kids die they they get infections there's no doctor there's nothing they die they you know people disappear in the jungle like they're in the presence of death right definitely no bullshitting no denial and he said but the reason that they are happy is that they feel they can handle whatever life throws at them they laugh when they get something they laugh when they don't get something they laugh when their house falls down in a rainstorm they laugh when they don't catch any fish they laugh when they do catch fish they're just like hey fuck it man we know our world and in our world you never know what's coming at you right and a lot of it's bullshit a lot of it's bureaucracy and phone calls and do I have obama care I don't you but before that right before that abstractions you know it's it's no it's thinking you know what's gonna happen yeah if you want to be miserable and you can handle it know what's gonna happen all you gotta do is think you know what's gonna happen if you think you know what's gonna happen whatever it is whether it's in a book or a movie and it proves to be correct generally you're gonna be disappointed when you watch a movie in two minutes and you're like uh clearly this person's in a dream and they're gonna wake up and then there are them I get the whole thing and then that happens at the end you're like god that's shit that's a shit movie I predicted it we like the turns we like the left hooks that you don't expect that's novelty and that is what the universe really is and that is why there's this danger when the materialists come along acting as though they have figured all of this out to the point where when you do say something like no you know I'm pretty sure that I had direct contact with an external being that is the source that all this stuff came from and radiates life as an effect existence and I'm part of it and I think that all everything is his love they'll just be like no you didn't you want it you're projecting that man don't you have an imagination your imagination concocted all this yeah there's all sorts of mechanisms by the way there's no free will okay well good night there's no free will all right right you I love when they say well our brains aren't wired for this or that yeah you know yeah our brains are not wired at all they're no fucking brains there's no wires in your brain maybe not yours bro I got wires in my brain bro hairs in your brain I got hair wire fucking garbage in there some childhood bone spurs I just think it's dangerous man I think it's a dangerous thing and when I and I think that um that that when people get too much like that they seem all withered and fucked up yeah that's for sure they seem like it's affecting them yeah wears on you man well fucking wears on you I mean think about getting back to shamanic societies what's really interesting to me about shamanic societies is that people as they age get closer to mystery because you're initiated into higher levels of mystery and knowledge as you get older it's the kids who don't know anything right it's the kids who are away from from knowledge and mystery in our society we grow away from mystery when you're kid you have the tooth fairy and santa claus and and fairies and imagination is cool and then as you get older you're supposed to tamp that down and then eventually put out the fire completely and get real yes and it's the exact opposite trajectory and then another you know 180 degree difference between shamanic societies and ours is that in shamanic societies hallucinogens are seen without exception as far as I know as the greatest gift of the gods they're the best they're the best thing there they don't have movies you know they don't have iTunes like if you want to experience something what do you do you trip your balls off that's how you experience things and the purity of the imagination in that circumstance when you're not I mean if you're talking about like these uh pre-western civilizations a long time ago whenever they invented it I mean what they have to do essentially essentially they had an event uh a vat right something a pot an iron pot to boil water or somebody had to get them one yeah from then it was on from then they figured out how to put all that shit together right but you know if you could go back and live amongst live amongst a society like that pre-western intervention and experience that life that's shamanic life of dancing in and out of hallucinations and dealing with the like almost immediate loss of loved ones like it's just constant it's gonna happen I mean there's jaguars around you you're living in the swamp there's toxic spiders and there's a Brazilian wandering spider in the rainforest that kills you by giving you an unstoppable heart on it gives you a heart on that's so devastating that even if you survive which most people don't because it's the most toxic spider your your dick is going to be broken forever how does that happen through evolution chris ryan how does the spider like is it what's the reaction the the chemical reaction to your body is the same thing as nitric acts nitric uh nitric oxide yeah which is uh what's that shit that they put like nos like nitric oxide nitric ox yeah not nitrous no not nitrous which is like what you put your car gives you a nitrous nitrous oxide yeah nitrous oxide is laughing yeah and they put it in cars yeah it's nitrous boost like you hit a button like you want to hit the nitrous and it'll like jump you from 500 horsepower say to like 750 really instantaneously that'd be so cool if there was a nitrous oxide tube connected to your mouth in the car too so both happen you're fucking some blue velvet kind of denis hopper look at things faster oh my god you feel like you're doing you fucking fuck you feel like you're doing warp speed on the enterprise it'd be amazing do you remember the early days of the darwin awards i don't know if they still do that yeah remember that was like big on the internet yeah i remember some of those stories got snoped out though yeah well i don't know if this is one of them but remember the one where the guy who works at like a military place out in the west somewhere in the desert and he steals a rocket engine and bolts it on top of his i think that one got snoped out that's too bad because that was a fine one man snopes man attaches rocket to car right all right here's one that didn't get snipped out uh if you guys hear about this dude this is a while ago now this was a guy in the probably early 90s who always wanted to be a pilot but he had bad eyesight and he couldn't you know whatever so he's living with his mother somewhere in LA you guys might have been here when this happened and he just he gets this idea to get some helium balloons and tie them to a lawn chair oh yeah remember that guy totally and he goes on his ideas just to like he's got a sandwich and a six pack and a little pellet gun and his idea is just he's tied to the truck and he's just gonna go up to the end of the rope and you know hover above the neighborhood for a couple hours yeah and he's hanging on he's eating his sandwich and he's like cool this worked really great so then it's a really calm day there's no wind so he's just gonna float around the neighborhood a little bit and then he could just hit the the balloons with his pellet gun and he'll lose his altitude so anyway he he unties the thing and goes to like 12,000 feet like immediately and all he could do is hold on and the gun falls out no he's still got the gun but he's like holy shit oh my god and it finally levels out at about I don't know nine to 12,000 feet and and he's over LA and they see him on the radar the airport radar but they think it's a herd a herd a flock of you know birds or something and so he starts floating out over the Pacific and the sun's you didn't hear about this what I'd have it's the sun starting to go down and it's fucking cold as shit anyway right and the air the oxygen is low in it and this Korean Airlines jet is coming into land at LAX and the pilot sees the dude and he calls it in like there's a guy out here in a lawn chair waving a gun around oh my god I remember this story so they send a coast guard helicopter out to get the guy yeah but it's like one of those double rotor things and it gets above him but the rotors blow him away and then destabilize everything so then they have to send a second one out and they've got a sniper on the helicopter they get right above him and they lower a rope and a guy goes down and grabs him because once you take the dude off then of course the launcher is going to go straight up into the rotors so they've got a sniper on board as soon as they take the dude off the lawn chair boom boom boom boom shoot all the balloons oh my god this sounds like a great level of the funniest coolest video game ever someone's got to make this into a video game it so does it sounds so fun it so does so he survived so he survived and they brought okay but here check this out there's a story about this in the New Yorker as well I don't remember what it's called but you can google it and find it I'm sure written by George Plimpton actually and it's something about the man who flew or the man who wanted to fly but anyway they bring him back and by the time he gets they arrest him because he was in restricted airspace and you know didn't have a license or whatever and but he was sort of joking about it because there are all these reporters and you know why did you do it and you know I just wanted to fly whatever three years later he committed suicide hmm well once you've been once you've experienced that level of freedom once you've experienced that coming back to the world you shoot yourself why don't you get more balloons do it again yeah this time get a better plan fuckface you know they have actual balloons man you know you just save up and buy a real one buy a real one yes don't just don't kill yourself yeah just how about that just stick around so that we can enjoy your legend as a hero why did you have to like because that is the hero that is a hero that's a hero that is you at your most stoned with access to like all these firearms firearms and helium balloons oh you're not listening to anyone by the way to no calculations everything was fine till he decided to untie the rope and float around the neighborhood you know one day he couldn't just stop he's laying on the lawn chair yeah that one day and he's like wait a minute I had a rope and a bunch of helium balloons I'm flying and then that when he decided to cut the rope that was the hero's journey that's the beginning of the hero's journey where he's like I'm cutting the umbilicus I'm separating myself from mother earth and blam blast off it's essentially a more exciting version of the movie big it is except wasn't that it big with the guy with the guy flew up in the uh the balloons and birds took him there I don't know wasn't it was what the club was it called maybe it was up what was it up up you're thinking of tarmanx yeah yeah yeah oh big that's right yeah yeah carmageddon was false the rocket thing story to the car no false didn't happen it's a complete fabrication crazy internet story wily coyote styling yeah there's uh no evidence ever that someone took a uh a jet engine and tied it to a car and flew into a fucking rocket or flew into a cliff I wonder if that happened the who are the guy the the the magician pen and teller they have that show or no it's not pen and teller it's the other guys who do debunking bullshit oh you know I'm talking about pen and teller do the bullshit show yeah I'm mixing them up it's these other two misbusters they do more like you know could you do this I think they did a rocket engine or a jet engine thing though I remember seeing something like tied to a car yeah maybe they were testing that particular story they um they say that the story first began making the rounds on the internet in 1990 and the car was supposedly and then the incident changed moved to a different spot first it was New Mexico and the car with a Plymouth Roadrunner by 1994 the car had transformed itself to a Chevy Impala and the venue is now California see the the story just mutates with people like I mean think about we have access to this laptop in Google and we'll still bullshit our way through a story I heard you know it's just our nature it's fun to do well yeah it is it does suck when those stories get eliminated but it's good did you see the picture of the light on Mars did you see that that's floating around reddit what is it it's just a well I don't know yet but they took a picture of what appears to be a source of light coming out of the ground on Mars and you know there's like on reddit there's a million theories about it and all of them pretty boring it's a cosmic ray or it's a it's a something's wrong with the film or something like that but it's pretty interesting classic curiosity rover captures mysterious bright light on Mars it's very underwhelming the photo is just like this little white thing on the screen yeah until you think that looks like a fucking flashbulb like there's like you know who knows what that is couldn't that just be some some software glitch you know maybe it's Tom Cruise maybe Tom Cruise is on he's on Mars imagine we got the Mars and Tom Cruise is already there do you guys know that Tom Cruise is a is a licensed stunt pilot I know a woman who flew with him oh my god yeah in one of those uh what are they called biplanes with open cockpit you know so she's in front and he's behind her and she was like he was doing loops and shit and she said and it occurred to me that if I puked I'd be puking in Tom Cruise's face because it would blow back yeah yeah Mary Roach who's a great writer I wish somebody if somebody could get on Mars and just put a statue up that said humans please stop killing each other I bet there'd be work I bet that would create world peace if it was like they wouldn't let us see it you don't think they let us see no they'd censor the transmission you really think they would yeah I think that would be something that would be very difficult to hold back if there was a someone on another planet had a sign for us boy that would be real hard but see that's the thing it wouldn't be a sign can't believe you morons can even read this I can't believe you got here yeah you idiots got here right congratulations clean up your own mess yeah clean up your yard but see I mean it relates back to what we were saying earlier you know maybe maybe distantly but you know I was saying that that in all these semantic societies hallucinogens are considered the greatest gift of the gods yada yada yeah I never finished the thought though which is that in our society you're penalized for a longer time you get caught with 10 hits of acid in most states you get a longer time in prison than for second-degree murder that's right now that what's that say about our society that their can hallucinogens are considered to be so dangerous and worse than murder right and that's really heavy and a lot of its minimum mandatory sentencing what's the fuck I think getting back to what you said those societies are oriented toward truth and our society is oriented toward lies exactly and so something that brings you into congruence with the truth is considered subversive well marijuana laws and psychedelic laws all highlight the fact that our laws are not current with current science and with current thinking they're not we were like prisoners of the ignorant past like we have this this momentum that's been going on since the nixon administration decided to clamp down on all psychedelics and they made everything illegal even things that weren't even psychoactive those are on the schedule one less they just shut down everything and I think the echoes of that still reverberate through our culture there's still a lot of people and I know it because I was one of them at one point in time that thought that all drugs are for losers all drugs of people trying to escape reality yeah I completely bought into that and I think that's real common I think that is as much of an issue as anything and that's the issue that I think is getting cured by the internet I think the internet is changing the perception of so many different aspects of our culture but a really big one is drugs a really big one is what what drugs are what drugs mean and the idea of a drug free society being a complete and total force yeah it doesn't exist it's never gonna exist and Dr. Carl Hart I had him on my podcast he's a addiction specialist and I found out about him from Chris because Chris had him on his show too and Carl he says it is clear as day it's like you wouldn't want to live in a society that doesn't have any drugs like drugs include all sorts of things that help you when you you're sick drugs surgery you don't have surgery without drugs coffee alcohol like anything caffeine like come on you're talking crazy one is Dennis McKenna says you take away the drugs you got no brain yeah exactly the brain is drugs we are drugs we are chemically yeah we were a chemical burning engine essentially you know and the chemicals that run the engine that is the human brain are human neurotransmitters which are also on the schedule one list right you know I mean the fucking things that are inside your own brain are illegal it's banning but I consider it exactly the same impulse that causes people to ban books it's a form of pharmacological book banning because the difference between psychedelics and the drugs that we take for headaches and for all the ailments that humans get is that psychedelics give you a transmission they give you a download and I think the reason that they're illegal or a big part of the reason that they're illegal is the same reason the internet is illegal in North Korea because if you get on the internet too long in North Korea you're going to be like oh god are you kidding this is bullshit this is a bunch of shit are you kidding the same thing happens here man it's like the moment you start taking psychedelics you do have to start digesting a lot of information really fast it's quite insane the first thing you think when you're in a euphoric lsd state looking out at the world looking at people seeing like the hidden parts of themselves they don't want to show anybody recognizing like you could just see so clearly on acid you can really like you see micro gestures you can really yeah the first thing that comes to your head is wait why is this elite this is illegal why would this even be illegal what is it about this experience that is doing anything more than making me feel more alive and connected to the world a little crazy no doubt i'm not saying it's like every time you take acid you're going to go through a down a nice a water slide filled with warm water every once in a while you go through a water slide that takes you deep deep into the bowels of hell but it's still at the other side of that colors are brighter your world seems more alive and you feel like you've been given a secret you guys have that experience where toward the end of a trip like i mean i assume you guys do this as well like when i took acid i would go in nature always right as i'd go in the woods or at least walking around in cemeteries or parks or whatever get toward nature but then at the end you're coming back to your dorm room or your apartment or whatever and you decide you're not tripping that hard anymore and you decide to stop in at a bar and have a drink with some friends and you see drunk people and they look like they're like drugged animals about to topple over and they've got this really like look on their face even the ones who aren't like that drunk you know they just all look so like 50 IQ points shaved right off the top semi-conscious monsters it's hunter s Thompson and fear and loathing in Las Vegas when he goes to the what the hotel as it he goes to everyone turns into a lizard circus not yeah it's not it's not they turn you're right yeah that circus circus he goes there and describe everyone has turned into a lizard he's seeing what they really are yeah but you know yeah it will do that when you see people drunk and you're on a psychedelic it shows you right away how you know what else bad acting try watching a movie yeah bad acting when you're on pot like especially the pot yeah when you've eaten pot bad acting becomes offensive yeah when people like sending it in yeah just phoning it in you're like oh my god like I'll never forget I was high as just as bad as high as you could be and still be out in public from edibles and we went to see the Hulk and it was so bad like Eric Banna like there was this one scene where he was just like so clearly acting in this in this movie that I was like oh my god I can't even watch this I was starting to freak out I was like it's just so obvious the person who was saying those words wasn't thinking about those words and that's something that if I didn't you know I mean it's a goddamn movie about a guy who turns into the Hulk I mean what the fuck am I looking for right what kind of realism am I looking for it's ridiculous but that moment was just so attitude and I've watched it since and I can't pick up what the fuck I saw like I watched it since and I go yeah I mean it looks fairly uninspired but I mean look at the lines he's getting you know hey uh I don't want to have to do this again but I might turn green you know like it's like ridiculous shit but to to me on marijuana it was just glaring yeah yeah I've had the opposite experience as well I remember in college I went to this uh I drop in on these friends and they're like hey we're gonna go see the the Jimi Hendrix experience right and I had always thought Jimi Hendrix sort of sucked I knew I was like 18 you know whatever and I just like Hendrix yeah it's loud it's it's like chaotic and we went I was like all right whatever I'll go with you and we go to the auditorium and they and they had electric daiquiris and I didn't know electric daiquiris had acid in them I just thought that was the name of a cocktail so I'm drinking these electric daiquiris one or two not a lot right um but and then this Jimi Hendrix movie comes on and I start like going whoa I'm I'm tripping you know you get that body thing and like the weird buzzing in your head and I said to somebody like what is their acid they're like yeah they're electric daiquiris dude like oh shit okay you gotta be really specific you fucking assholes well they they had reason to think I knew I probably sold them the acid but anyway not true not true I never sold it we're just making shit up here we're just a couple of guys having or sell it but anyway this Hendrix thing comes on and I was like whoa I get it I fucking get it now I see he's a genius and you know obviously still I still think he is Phil Hartman used to tell me uh that when uh he was a young guy and he was uh living in LA he got a chance at one point in time to hold the speakers up for Jimi Hendrix and Jimi Hendrix was a Philka play guitar so Jimi Hendrix was like this you know the ultimate god to him and he was on stage like literally like Phil was at his feet holding the speaker to make sure the speaker didn't fall over into the crowd and Hendrix is right there like where you are just and he said it was just like the most magical moment of his life like as a young aspiring musician like he you know he'd like to play music and to see Hendrix live in the flesh crazy feet away from you playing guitar he said it was the most insane surreal and then you know the guy was dead just a few years later uh man it's so cool you know it's so beautiful um it's that's the thing we have access to this beautiful universe around us it's so beautiful but sometimes the way that you have to access it or your entry way in or these drugs that are prohibited by the government and that is so it's such a perplexing thing that eventually you just have to stop thinking about it because what are you gonna I mean thinking about it is pointless you either come to the conclusion that bureaucracy is completely tied to tourniquet around one very vibrant powerful bit of connective tissue that connects us to the mind of everything or you have to think Jesus do we actually exist in some kind of satanic empire where they're intentionally trying to keep us from recognizing that we live in heaven you know what I think it is I think quite honestly that it's all the people that are trying to keep us from having these experiences haven't experienced them themselves and having no knowledge no real direct knowledge or understanding of what we're really talking about to them it's just all hogwash nonsense and craziness and all you're doing is somehow or another keeping them from either having control or making profit and in that sense like the last thing they want to do is get everybody to tune in and drop out you know I mean this is like that's not going to happen again we saw what happened there this is not a good deal like stop right there and why is it I mean it's like it's a bad analogy but someone who's not funny at all at all and they come up to you and they dictate what your subject matter is going to be what you get to say on stage why you get to say it and they tell it to you because they're an expert in comedy like what are you even saying are you what are you fucking crazy and an expert on psychedelics it has to be an expert that tells you that they're illegal right I mean isn't it shouldn't be an expert that tells you this is something that we should protect society from but they're not they're not only are they not experts they're wholly ignorant of the effects of most of these things right when you hear people talking negatively like I had a fucking conversation Michio Kaku okay who's this brilliant physicist astrophysicist this guy who just has such inspiring talks about space and his the way he describes things just like the sense of awe and wonder that he has for science and innovation is just directly translatable through his words you know it's really exciting guy to watch talk about science right but I talked to him about about mushrooms and I asked him if he believed that it was possible that mushrooms were the reason why human beings evolved from primates I could you know if you ever heard the theory the stone tape theory and I asked him if he's ever done mushrooms and he's like mushrooms give you brain damage like I'm not interested in doing drugs I'm interested in studying reality and but no they don't give you brain damage and now I have to now I have to think twice about everything you're saying because if you're saying that mushrooms are terrible and there's no way mushrooms give you brain damage why would you speak so clearly about something that we both know you're not an expert in like that's not true right that not only is that not true but that discredits all the things that you said that probably are true all the awesome things that you said about about science and the universe and how do I listen to you when you're talking about things that I know you're full of shit about now I have to like think about everything else that you've said and I have to run it through some other filter is he right about this is he right about that as soon as you like proclaim to be an expert in something that you clearly brain what brain damage like what fucking brain damage a mushroom has given anybody that's not happening not only it's not happening but when you look at the actual studies like the john hopkins study yeah they're showing that people have had a direct positive benefit that lasted their entire lives from profound psychedelic experiences that they had decades ago so you can't you can't do that that's a bad thing to do it's what you just saw there is superstition it's like I imagine like back in Galileo's time there were probably scientists who actually thought well we shouldn't meddle with that because a demon will come into you and they believed it you know maybe that's now that demon is drug addiction that demon is brain damage or that demon is any of these other made up effects of psychedelics see that sorry I was just gonna say that that's one of the few areas where if I'm talking to someone at a party or someone you know and this has happened many times to some doctor who you know starts spouting off about how bad hallucinogens are and that's one of the few areas where I will say you know with all due respect to you you have no idea what you're talking about yeah you have to because I mean if it's some other thing if it's some other scientific thing or politics or religion or whatever I let it go but in that case you're actively participating in spreading disinformation that can hurt people that does hurt people so I'll fucking nail you for it and and you know that's I I mean as far as Michio Kaku goes I would give him a pass in the sense that when he's talking about physics and astro you know whatever his area of expertise is you can probably believe him because he spent his life studying that whereas probably leave him with drugs he just like bought the party line and never really looked into it you guys saw this thing scientific it is but we do it right I mean you can't study everything down you can't question every premise you know it's right so at least in his area of expertise he probably knows what he's talking about but you guys saw what Sanjay Gupta did right I mean yeah I really respect that guy because he was one of those people and then he had the balls to turn around and say I was wrong right I'm sorry yeah and made two amazing specials on the benefits of it the medical benefits yeah some of those stories that they showed of kids that started taking medical marijuana and it completely eliminated their seizures yeah and this heartwarming stuff man yeah what if Sanjay Gupta keeps making these documentaries but with harder and harder he's like heroin but it really was a gateway drug where he's like heroin's grace he'll be like a haggard 90 year old in five years heroin cured seizures in his child what would be great is if he discovered all these people that actually did have issue with with drugs and like what they were like hey here's the real issue that we have with oxycontins here's the real here's a real hardcore documentary on heroin users let's find out how many functional heroin users there are here's a real hardcore documentary on alcoholism let's see rampant alcoholism in the flesh and see if this isn't something that we might want to curb as a society if he started doing that with all drugs like treat them all like the same way that dr. heart would treat them right treat them all based on data rationally right taste on bit I really admire was his wife and kid here with him no no no oh my god he came with another scientist but uh his his like his his ideal you know being that what he's trying to do is just relay the data he's not worried about you know what don't you think this is going to make kids want to do drugs like because that's the trick question right whenever you talk about marijuana or talk about anything oh you're what about the kids think about the kids that listen to you I've had people say that to me hey bro you know stop talking about weed man think about all the kids that are listening what all the kids that are going to smoke pot and figure out this life's a joke oh we don't want that happening you know and I'm not saying the kids should smoke weed but guess what if they do that's not the worst thing in the world worry about them killing each other all right worrying about them hurting each other worried about sexual assaults worry about all the inevitabilities of you know becoming an adolescence and hormones and poor management of those hormones and people who did a shitty job of making them into adults and worry about all that but don't worry about marijuana Jesus fucking christ really right and of all the shit to worry about that's not the thing it's just not and when a guy like sanjay gupta comes out with not one but two documentaries highlighting all these benefits of it and realize it's like this whole thing is a scam like I didn't know it I really bought into it and so did so did before I ever started smoking pot I thought it was for losers and this guy's got the power to make documentaries about it right big ones on cnn yeah that we need more of those people there needs to be more sanjay guptas there needs to be people who are and they are doing it like the maps people are doing it and we don't have to keep going on it feels like this is like chewed gum everyone knows that psychedelics are prohibited for stupid reasons but it it's it's the spirit behind it that I'm more interested I'm I'm interested in the prohibition but I'm more interested in the spirit behind the prohibition I'm interested in the people who say if they see that you have a gun at your house they're like scared they think something's gone wrong with you or the people who if you're not if you don't have kids past a certain age or if you're not married they look at you with pity and sympathy like oh god what have you done to your life are you in that age now yeah I'm definitely in that age man and and I'm I'm I'm generally pretty happy and I'm not going to say I'm not lonely I get lonely sometimes but I love that feeling of loneliness or rather if I had to pick between the feelings of occasional loneliness and sitting in my house alone with my dog and there's incense burning in video games and I can write whenever I want and I'm making tea or getting stoned or doing whatever I want that feeling of loneliness I'll take that anytime over that feeling of dark suffocating claustrophobia that you get in the middle or end of a relationship that's falling apart and is the words that feeling of just that's it's the same feeling that compels a fox to chew its leg off it's rather than being the trap it's that stale feeling of there's no way out I'm I'm in I'm stuck in a fucking cell with the walls a million miles thick I have these little genetic handcuffs attaching me to this woman who now hates me and who are I now dislike that I that that that reminds me of like getting stuck in a black hole isn't those are the worst moments in life the the middle of the breakups oh god it's terrible everyone's everyone's gotten nuts everyone's acting shitty to each other love is fled and by the way I think that people who are who are in that place and are dealing with that sense of claustrophobia you have to recognize that you don't have that you no one's ever truly trapped there are there 99% of the time their way is out and if you can't leave because of responsibility or ethics then I think you could shift your thinking around at least and maybe find some freedom there but I just what does that even mean well I think that you've got to like find expansiveness immediately like instead of thinking I'm going to change the outcome I'm gonna change I'm gonna change it's like we don't we try to stop focusing on outcomes and turn our focus towards causes so instead of getting caught up in the fruit that's already growing off of the tree let's look at what is causing the tree to grow the fruit and that's what you go into so that's what I mean you have to you start so you have to take that person's personality on as a project you well you have to take your own you work on yourself that's the idea you find some expansiveness wherever the like if I feel bummed out like let me like let's see today I took my dog to walk for a walk at the park and if I don't meditate in the morning or if I'm not like discipline then my mind can go crazy and then I can start getting irritable and bummed out and shitty so like I'm at a I'm at a coffee shop and unfairly judging everyone like I like I'm good at it I'm good at it telling when I'm doing it I used to not I used to not even know I was doing it I used to just think that was the status quo but now if I've judged more than two people in like an hour period then I know oh you're the asshole in the room no one's an asshole your asshole aura is so powerful that it has encompassed everyone around you and you're witnessing your own shittiness and every there's a reflection in everybody else so that's what I mean by like shifting if I do that it doesn't make me feel better right I still feel anxious and irritable and shitty but I'm no longer buying into the story that my mind's telling me which is like look at that fucking shit out of the look at that fucking what is why is this bitch spending so much time testing out lotions like why would that even bother me why doesn't bother you because because a cunt lives inside of me because I know that's so funny because there's a and I know it's there and like where'd it come from the cunt in me yes the cunt in me it's 15 years ago on a hunting trip I think that I've said this before on your podcast but I think humans are a hive of personalities that we're not one personality but we're a collective of personalities that lives they all live inside of us and these different personalities come out according to different things you know man I've in my old age what I found is that if I'm not exercising regularly I'll be more of an asshole or and if I'm not drinking enough water I'll be more of an asshole and if I'm not eating right I'll be more of an asshole and underneath that I'm sure there's plenty of psychological reasons why I might have like defense mechanisms that are I might have habitual defense mechanisms if I'm feeling stressed out but if I just start taking care of myself usually a lot of the other stuff goes away yeah because you feel good I mean there's research showing that if you force yourself to smile you'll feel happier yeah the stupidest it sounds again back to placebo effect or whatever we want to call it your body associates the state of smiling with feeling good so if you smile you can induce feeling good you trick your body right yes feeling better because you smile exactly you tune the radio man and the way you tune the radio is by walking a certain way breathing a certain way this is what jack cornfield talks about which is that the moment you hit that place where you're in a challenging situation where you're around someone who's a dick or you're in a you're grumpy because you haven't had your coffee or whatever the fucks happen or you're stressed out because you have shit to do that you that you don't want to do or whatever it is stop in that place and breathe simple just like take a big deep breath in the midst of before you do anything that's all simple stuff like that really works wonders right as far as and also not and you've got to admit that there are parts of yourself that are shitty like what there you don't you have to recognize that there are parts of yourself that are not selfless and that those parts are going to emerge from time to time and you breathe through it you don't this is what jack cornfield says i've been listening to him lately but he says bow to it so when it comes to you the next time you're in line you're pissed off whoever's in the line you know like how sometimes for no reason at all assholes will go through their fucking purses for 25 minutes trying to pick out the exact change to pay for something you know that thing where it's like what the fuck are you doing give them cash put that in the goddamn corn star later you'll witch let's move i'm hungry let's go so do you ever think like when you're walking down the street or whatever do you ever think that there are people who who purposely create obstructions because they get pleasure from being in the way yes no i think that too and i don't know if that's me being a dick or if that's true but i mean people stop for a conversation at the top of an escalator yes what the fuck are you doing yeah they do it to sort of let you know they don't give a fuck it's part of it it's a passive aggressive yes thing yeah and they want you to ask them to move like they see you and then they can get like oh i have a narcissistic trick for dealing with those people i think to myself maybe they're angels pretending to be people slowing me down because they know if i keep on this track too long i'm gonna end up like in a freak accident i think there's an anvil falling from the sky i don't think like they're angels but i do think like there's reasons for like like traffic stops and you know like lane changes that don't make any sense when all the lanes are forced to merge if you got their head the traffic would be going much faster and then this collision would have occurred and that makes you feel a little better i love these mind tricks man i think that i think that like the the idea is get in control of your mind as much as you can so when the mind starts spitting out stupid things like god this fucking bitch and her goddamn change look at her slowing everything down you can't stop that that's gonna that's gonna happen that's just the part of your mind that's habituated you absorb that from some person a long time ago you can't stop it but you can turn it around so that it doesn't give you ulcers or it doesn't make your fists clench that's where you start working or breathing or just trying to be there in the moment with it you won't fix it all at once but it's goddamn better than doing what most people do which is get on their fucking phones and like check their goddamn instagram and rage you know numb it out numb it out everyone numbs it out when you see people working at their phones you it's the same thing as when you see ostriches sticking their hand in the set head in the sand it's the same phenomena isn't this along the lines of what we've been talking about a lot lately though um that you you almost have to have something that sucks so they depreciate something it's awesome you almost have to have these ridiculous examples of just the bizarre nature of humanity in order to appreciate beauty in order to appreciate cool friends in order to appreciate fun actually be in the moment when you're having fun like you to really appreciate cool moments and cool conversations and cool people you almost have to know a slew of cunts just so that you can differentiate between what's amazing what's not it's like it flowers it you can't appreciate hot unless you experience cold like it's the best shower i've ever taken was in montana after no shower for a week we talked about that last time when your podcast greatest shower i've ever taken in my life why is it because i'd had the opposite for so long i appreciated him in an intense way to the to this day i could feel that shower but i took one this morning and i fucking feel that one because that one's normal it's california it's 80 degrees outside already so i took a shower whatever there's a big god damn difference between that montana shower and this shower montana showers they're fine you know getting back to breaking up with people you guys are talking about yeah i i mean i don't i don't want to sound holier than that or whatever but i i haven't had that kind of a breakup might have been worse in a sense because every woman i've broken up with i i still loved her and she still loves me you know wow that's deep i've had that that's a rough one it's rough that's a rough one you think about them sometimes well i'm still friends with them yeah you know with both of the women i'm thinking of it and it's like uh yeah it hurts a lot more but i think we're talking about distractions and i think what a lot of people do at the end of relationships is it's so painful it's so painful because you're looking at someone you've shared potentially years of your life with yeah and you've loved and who's loved you and you're saying okay this is ending right and so the anger is the anesthesia the anger is to deaden the pain in a way because that way you can blame her and she blames you and you're all pissed off and being pissed off enables you to ignore the sadness which hurts more than the anger sometimes superficial sometimes chicks are fucking withdrawing money from your bank account and talking shit about you behind your back all right let's not get crazy sometimes bitches are deflating your tires you go out there five minutes after her in the morning and your fucking tires are flat and her car's gone dude you did make some bad decisions that didn't happen to me i'm just painting a scenario that experience i think it's the the it's like the greatest and most awful thing when you realize that a person has passed beyond this event horizon and that there's no coming there's no real going back sure you could do like what we were talking about earlier which is like from time to time you end up humping somebody that you've broken up with and some drunken moment and there's all i mean i i can remember my ages ago one of my like we were saying uh at the shooting range as men will talk about fucking in between shooting guns we were we were talking about uh how breakup sex can be so incredible yeah and i can remember you know at one point many years ago a girl that i had split up with you're smiling it was it was no this is one of the greatest weirdest sexual moments ever when we got back together temporarily i remember she's giving me a blowjob and crying at this like she's crying while she's giving me head and like i want to cry too because it's like we used to have like really great sex but now we know there's no repairing this like we're just doing this out of our own like desire to feel that thing that was so special but you can't get it back it's way gone way down the river of time so we're just going to this like physical as an attempt to get back to that place we're using this physical reminder of that incredible moment oh it's so hot it's so awesome and so painful and beautiful and and and and wonderful though that's the thing man every this is this is the thing in buddhism they talk about attraction and aversion and these two things are considered hindrances attraction and aversion are both hindrances so when you're when you're when there's something you're afraid of being around or something that you that you can't accept or don't want to be near traffic for example traffic i am traffic averse i hate getting into traffic when i'm in traffic i try to imagine i'm not in traffic my mind goes elsewhere i just want to get the fuck off the interstate and get where i'm going so all those stretches of time that i'm in traffic these are stretches where i'm not really there because i just want to avoid it as much as i can that's aversion the other side of that is if i'm driving because i want to go see this girl that i'm just hooking up with her that i'm really into now that i'm attracted look at you you're getting all i'm going it's intense i'm going over there now i'm bouncy so now i've now i've got this little piece of the universe that i've decided is special and another piece of the universe that i've decided is shit and both of these are considered hindrances because what i've done is i've taken the infinite phenomena that i exist within and i've put a grid around it and there's parts of the grid that are great parts of the grid that are bad and the whole time i'm either running to get to one part of the grid or trying to get off another part of the grid and the the idea is that you can actually love everything the entire grid the traffic the breakup sex the cancer the winning winning the lottery losing everything like what you're saying what these people are doing you can you can actually everything that comes to you is you you can experience it as though you were having this beautiful conversation with the most intelligent entity in the universe which is what we're surrounded by and part of i love that idea i think that's a great way to shift things around you can be fascinated and grateful at all times yes yes yes i believe it can't do it but i like to believe it might be bullshit because god damn i hate traffic and i have enjoyed breakup sex but you know i'm still you know i'm i'm i'm just like the cat following the laser beam myself but um but you're enjoying it and that's a difference you're enjoying this whole experience whatever it is whatever sort of creation dance we're doing we're all interacting with each other changing information talking having experiences together and then creating things on our own individually and together you know there's a there's a book by louis thorough's father his name is paul thorough he's a great writer i saw him on your show yeah a couple months ago his father's like a really big time writer and he uh he wrote a book called my secret history which is about when he was in the peace corps in africa it sort of goes from his childhood in boston through when he wrote his first big bestselling book his first book was a huge bestseller it's called the the great railway bazaar i think it's a he's on the train that goes i think uh the trans uh what's it called that that the famous the orion express you know he takes this train anyway he he was in the peace corps in africa he was living in this village where everybody was like super sexual and relaxed and he was banging his students and you know he's tells this whole story of his life very interesting but i remember at one point he says the great the the great gift that i have is when i look back on my life at the times when i was happy i knew i was happy and most people they look back and they didn't know it at the time that's huge man yeah that's huge and trying to enjoy the moment before you've reached your goals is also very difficult for people yes the moment you sit down to eat pause you're about to eat smell it you know like yeah i really enjoy the experience don't start talking to me about that fucking salmon don't talk to me about britney spears god damn it i don't give a fuck of her and kind of kevin fed her liner back together i don't care i don't either i don't want to hear about it are they back together so i'm gonna have to leave pretty soon i don't want to i don't want to shut this down no it's cool no we should wrap it up culver city at six thirty what time do i have to leave we always um safely you need about 45 minutes all right so so i got another 20 we can okay in real i just wanted to i wanted to say when you were talking about the shower and how awesome that is after a camping trip uh the thing i've been thinking about lately is the moment like of death and how maybe this whole thing is a camping trip for god where it's that exact same feeling times 700 billion where the moment like you're finally it's dying and then exactly that moment you remember oh oh i created this is me i'm actually like i'm actually i'm actually the creator of all things and i got lost in this tiny little bit of my creation for a second and wow now i can do anything again this is amazing alan watts talks about this where god eventually after being able to do everything for an infinite amount of time would once in a while be like i know what it's like when i forget i'm god and then that's what we are you know well you know these peanut hot people i was talking about earlier that's deep interesting things he says is that they believe they don't think dreams aren't real they think that dreaming and being awake are just two different ways of seeing that are both equally relevant and and real what do you think about that if you take alpha brain i believe it take alpha brain and go to sleep you do have weird dreams oh my god any form of acetylcholine take choline and then go to sleep you'll have the most durable vivid dreams really oh man if you're a fan of bizarre dreams you ever do lucid dreaming i have not practiced it like a discipline where i sat out and tried to do it but maybe for a few weeks for a few weeks i did a very very rudimentary thing that i saw in that movie what the bleep do we know where this guy was talking about lucid dreaming and here's a way to induce a lucid state while dreaming you should make a habit of going through every doorway and knocking on the doorway as you walk through and go is this real or am i dreaming and touch it is this real or am i dreaming and make it a thing that you do every time you go through a door if you can make it a thing you do it'll become programmed into your mind and once it becomes programmed into your mind it'll manifest itself in your dreams so in the middle of my dream i go is this real or am i dreaming my hand was going right through the wall and i was going oh shit i'm dreaming you did it wow this is crazy looking at the backs of your hands is another one you've done this you're a lucid dreamer i've done it yeah i don't do it regularly i've done it too man i did it too i read this book uh when i was in high school i got really into journeys out of the body by robert minn row which is this guy who figured out how to do astral projection which is just lucid dreaming i think but man it's it's it is fucking scary man it's scary when you wake up in a dream sometimes you it's almost like if you ever had that fear when you wake up in a dream chris uh no i like waking up in dreams i i but you reminded me when you talked about this you're reminding me of maybe this will like be a distraction but i i was uh another one of these situations where i took acid i was in manhattan i was a college student and my professor and i went to manhattan for the weekend and i had some acid and he was like you know he knew new york and he was like well let's go let's oh let's look at a film oh they're louise boon well films let's take some acid and go to a boon well film right you guys ever seen a boon well film no boon well was a friend of salvador dollies and he was one of the founders of surrealism i didn't know this right so we take some acid and we go up near columbia to the cinema and we we're sitting there watching this movie and it's called the discrete charm of the bourgeoisie and it opens with this couple getting ready for a party in a mansion and they go upstairs and and the minister starts to arrive and some other they're all very upper class people arriving and the the maids are seeing the minister and meanwhile there the couple is almost dressed and then the guy decides he wants to fuck her and she's like oh we can't we can't oh yeah they'll hear us no and so that you see them crawl out the window this is a film from the early 50s i think maybe 40s and then they the next scene is them in the party with all these rich people and the woman's got like grass in her hair because he's been fucking her out and but everybody like ignores that it doesn't talk about it right and they're passing around canapes and all these fancy people and you see the canapes are like a little piece of bread with a bleeding chunk of like meat with hair on it and they're all eating and the blood's running down their mouth wow it's fucking insane crazy and i'm tripping and i think like i'm losing it right it was like i didn't know i didn't know anything about surrealism and there's a scene in it where the where like in the middle of this story it cuts to this dude in bed with a woman and he wakes up and she says what happened he says oh oh my god i was just dreaming and then the movie continues from there and then it happens again so it's like a dream inside a dream inside a dream life yeah it's that and that is the idea and i like i think every time you gain a realization you are kind of born again like when you get uh when you get something added to your understanding of the universe that transforms the whole universe that is a death you know and i and it does make sense that the more those things start happening the more your old self starts to die yeah and and we should we should we should welcome death this is the problem in america one of the problems in american society that we've got this forever young attitude yeah and we don't understand that deaths of former selves are necessary to the birth of greater selves yeah and yes exactly the more you try to stop that it's like you can't the more you're trying to to to not operate from where you're actually at that's the problem is you'll realize all these things and then you'll keep acting according to the way you're acting when you hadn't realized all these things that's where you can get really get miserable the chinese say to know and not change is not to have known wow you're saying if you know then you'll definitely change if you keep acting the way you did before you understood then you don't really understand i think some people understand and keep acting the way that they're they were acting because they're afraid to change because the people they around won't let them change or if they change then they have to get rid of a lot of people in their lives so they have to pretend that they don't understand they have to act dumb it's like sometimes people will have like a older brother that is will like kick the or a dad that'll kick the shit out of them if they act too smart so they have to act dumber than their dad or they have to act dumber than their brother you know what i'm saying like they have to put on a show of being dumb because if they if like they threaten any of these morons around them the morons will start like abusing them well how many women have to do that in their life how many women have to do that around men when you can't black people yeah you know during slavery well i mean right now but with women today like there's there's certain men will get upset if they get corrected on certain information so a woman has to like cater to a guy oh there's some men they have to cater to the guy's ego where you can't tell him he's wrong about something because you know he's fucking he's a man and men are sometimes dangerous just keep me at the level of dumb i am right now darling please don't tell me anything well it's the people that feel like being corrected is at a direct affront to their own intelligence it's not that there's some information that we all get wrong occasionally it doesn't make you better or worse right the way it makes you better or worse is how you react to it right the way you're reacting to is the fucking worst case scenario you're getting angry that someone gave you some knowledge you know you're getting angry because it's coming from a woman who's given you that i told you so look and you know you want to hit her because you're fucking crazy douchebag yeah it's nuts it's nuts how how truth of verse people are some are fucking so attached to their ideas yeah it's it's it's really incredibly sad but again you can't really deal with those people you can only work on yourself that's the point you can only deal with where where how are you like that that's the question find where you are like that and just start dealing with that what what are truths you're not digesting what are you not willing to accept you know a lot of times people don't want to accept they're getting older you know a lot of times people don't want to accept they're aging people don't want to accept that their family is aging people don't want to accept that there's a lot of stuff like that where the moment you just stop resisting and accept it the pain goes away i'm reading a beautiful little book right now called travels with Epicurus and you know Epicurus was the you know Epicureanism is derived from his name right but he was an ancient Greek philosopher who believed that the highest good was pleasure but pleasure that leads to happiness not pleasure that leads to suffering right and and you know he arrived at this with a very philosophical arguments and discussions but anyway this book is is cool it's an American guy who got to be in his early 70s and he was like all right i'm old you know i look around me and my friends are either dead or they're pretending they never will die he talks about one guy who had testosterone patches and seolus and he's like you know doing everything he can to to rejuvenate himself or whatever and this guy says fuck it i'm gonna go to this island this little Greek island that he'd been to many times throughout his life and i'm gonna hang out there because old people seem really happy there and i want to figure out why what what is it about being old on this little island hydra in Greece that makes me happy it's beautiful book it's meditations on what is age you know how how what what does it mean to get old and his thing is like fuck if i pass through you know you we're all gonna get to that stage if we survive of like old old like fucked up old right yes and a lot of people go from hey everything's cool i'm working hard i'm too old old it without passing through this period of freedom and real and happiness of just old where it's like hey i'm old i'm too old to die young i don't need to fucking stress about shit i can hang out i could play with my dog and my grandkids or whatever people you know i've seen some shit he says epicures says that it's not the young who's who's wanderings are full of torment and change that are happy it's the old who have harbored their ships they've brought their ship into the harbor and their happiness is protected and regret regret the regret that you know it's really just the inability to live in the moment yes yeah living in the moment whether you're old or young is essentially the same thing just you are alive right now just maybe your body has some limitations maybe nobody wants to fuck you anymore other than that you're alive right now but i'll tell you this if you're in the moment and you really really connect to the moment and that is the moment i think they would make the moment illegal if they could i think the moment would be something that you could get arrested for being in too long because it's such a revolutionary place to be in the moment yeah all your troubles vanish and the moment blah the troubles go away the moment you'd go to the left or to the right past or future the moment you think about stuff like that that's where you start getting into gestion the moment you're right there in the fucking moment bam it's beautiful and incredible and and if you're there and you're somebody who maybe isn't getting intimacy from other people but you master being in that place i think you're gonna start getting laid i think you're gonna start i think you're gonna start meeting people that are gonna want to have sex with you and they might not even know why but the reason they want to have sex with you is because they recognize that you are walking the razor's edge you're on the path you're there and they want that if they're like so many people are lost in the cemetery of the past just filled with all these thoughts of that are just replicas phantoms of things that are long gone so many people sorry okay so many people i think their sexuality is you know this gets back to desire and the buddhist tradition and all that but their society is about wanting to get something from their their sexualities about wanting to get something from someone else right i want to get into her pants i want to get pleasure from her right yeah and i think one of the mistakes that young men often make is that they they get stuck in that way of thinking because they're so full of testosterone and desire right instead of thinking i i'm just gonna cultivate some shit in me that she's gonna want that they're gonna want let me be the one that they come to with the desire as opposed to me always being the wisdom of a man who's lived a long and fruitful life coming out of your mouth that you're talking to a testosterone jockey who's in his teens who has no business with this fucking dynamic machine that he's been giving that's pump full of jet fuel and a dick that gets okay but some of those do when the fucking breeze cracks through your zipper you're enchanted just riding the school bus different thoughts of mouths and vaginas and tits that you can ejaculate on and hands on your balls while you jerk off under her dress not just nightmarish scenarios flooding through your mind because they're so intense with the hormonal vibrations to say hey you just need to become someone who people want to have sex with well good luck okay but some of those dudes take that energy and they learn to play guitar yes you're so right so they can get pussy or tell jokes but no no question no question all i did was wait to get old but it worked that's hilarious though you don't have to that's the thing you don't have to wait to get old you don't have to wait to get young either you can do it right now because that's the fountain of youth this is the funny you know this is the story of uh this is the alchemical quest trying to turn lead into gold finding the fountain of youth finding paradise getting back into the garden of eden and everyone searching for it and then finally realizing that oh shit it's inside of me it's not outside of me it's that realization that it's it's here right now and that's a crazy thing you don't have to be an old or a middle-aged guy who's like taking a bunch of acid to realize that you can be filled with the vigor and testosterone and all of the vibrancy or the estrogen or the whatever your youth is giving you additionally to the present moment you can actually channel that i mean like how old was how old was buddha when he found realization who knows i mean that's just a story well i'll say for the sake of this he was 17 okay well you know i don't believe in buddha i just made it up i don't believe he's real you don't believe he's real i don't believe he's some magic person that had any answers i think he's uh an ideal you don't think he's a real person i think there was a his there was a historic buddha because they don't say like jesus right they don't there's not like he wasn't like walking in water my my thoughts on almost all historical characters past eczema a thousand years ago is that they're most likely about bullshit you know what that's what the pina ha said this this missionary when he was with them he was trying to tell him about jesus right and they were like did you know jesus and he's like no no he lived a long time ago they said did your father know jesus no no end of conversation 23 years they never they went to and they were like hey dude we like you you're fine but we don't want to hear anymore about jesus there was a genghis con sure and there was only 1200 that's 1200 ad that's actually not that long there were pharaohs sure so like we know that they're like powerful people who existed a long time ago i like no just my thoughts are just that when you start talking about a historical figure in the the events this historical figure participated in and you're going back to like literally a time before writing or around the time when writing was first created like boy you know that story gets quite sketchy you know when you start talking about uh the the different Sumerian gods that they you know discussed in the Sumerian texts and all the different versions of what happened to their heroes and what happened to Gilgamesh you know in the epic of Gilgamesh i've just never heard i i've definitely heard people uh say that there was no jesus and the reason they say that is because he appears to be this combination of all these preceding mythologies hercules i've never heard somebody say that there was no historic buddha it's like i i've always just accepted that there was this person like confucius or lau zhu the person who wrote the dadi ching i've just accepted that there is a a historic version of them and it's easier to do because because with buddha there's not a lot of i mean there's the story of his enlightenment but that is just pretty much universally accepted as a flowery metaphor right right right yeah well that's sort of what i'm saying is that i don't trust what we're talking about siddhartha gautama yeah yeah i think he was a prince what year was he about 2,500 years ago i think and his name is gautama buddha siddhartha gautama spell that s i d h gautama g a u t a m a yes yeah buddha means the awakened one or the enlightened one but if you think about it if the guy really did exist it was a little bit before gingers con it was uh five to sixty three bc to uh 483 b c e yeah i mean there's there's a there's a lot of mythology attached to him but i think that he there was definitely a figure back then it was this kind of super philosopher who boiled everything down to this because it's like in buddhism they don't say listen if you just believe in buddha you will gain realization it's something you you have to read it you have to actually read the stuff that it's talking about but also it's kind of a moot point in the sense that buddha himself supposedly said don't get hung up on me this isn't about me there are many buddhas there are many teachers unfortunately no written records about what tama have ever been found during his lifetime or several centuries thereafter the gandahar in buddhist texts the oldest surviving buddhist manuscripts reported to have found in or around hada near jalalaba well jalalabad in uh eastern afghanistan and preserved in the british library today was written in the karatosh karastho well k-h-a-r-o-s-t-h-i script and the gandahar in language on 27 birch bark scrolls from the first century b-c-e to the third century c-e so that should have been well after he was alive and dead huh well i don't know we've got to wrap it up chris ryan i gotta run that's uh fascinating it's interesting stuff though whether he existed or not you know i don't care if he existed or not i don't care if he was a floating unicorn that could swing through trees but as an ideal it's always been something that people have consistently brought up so it lives on whether it was a real person or not maybe even more so well the the noble truth so buddhism are still there the precepts are still there and that's that's that is definitely primary to whoever the person was that said it whether it's one person or a secretive group of people that made up a person it still came from the human mind and it's still life changing god damn i don't mean to end on some proselytizing awesome no it's an awesome note man we never talked about should we talk about hookers i saw i i got i got an email i saw golden buddhas during one of my t at dmt trips i know infinite fractal of golden buddhas in this very position in the lotus position exactly looking exactly like that floating all around me wow it was one of the trippiest things ever but that that image i think that i really have a firm belief that a lot of the eastern iconic imagery that we associate with religions a lot of that exists in psychedelic dimensions and it's representative much like alex grazework you look at it and you immediately think of tryptamine dimensions i look at that stuff and i immediately remember certain images that i've seen while tripping that i think that's not because i knew those images existed i think maybe those images existed inside of these psychedelics and these geometric patterns that are sort of recreating in these you know sacred states and these sacred images these sacred geometric images that they really are sacred but they really do exist in another dimension you pull them out and recreate them and when you look at the buddha you look at a golden buddha statue you go oh it's like almost like you see that thing in your mind that's in you representative of enlightenment that's what they say man they say it is inside of you i believe that let's do prostitutes on you let's start your post let's start your podcast talking about prostitutes chris ryan tangentially speaking how can people find you uh at chris ryan phd on twitter and my my website is chris ryan phd.com and guys joe rogan at joe rogan on twitter joe rogan.net and i'm sure you guys know how to find him thanks thanks so much you guys have a great day harry christina

Hello, dear friends, it is I, Duncan Trussell, and you have joined the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. To all newcomers, we welcome you with multiple arms stretching out from multiple torsos and a wide array of arms and torsos and ears and noses and eyeballs. At this very moment, you have tuned in to a community of people all over the planet who are listening to my raspy lesbian voice ramble, and I am incredibly grateful that you have made the decision to come swimming in the digital pond of this podcast when there are so many other podcasts out there. My God, a billion trillion podcasts have emerged. We're talking the Cambrian explosion of podcasts has happened. An incredible expulsion of ideas, thoughts, conversations, some of them good, some of them maybe not that great, but they're developing. I got to tell you, one thing I really don't like are the podcast haters, and that's not just because my main job is that of a podcaster, but because what ends up happening is all the people out there who have the inkling of desire to have a podcast don't do it because they saw this person tweet about how there's too many podcasts or they are that person yapp about how the market is oversaturated. There's always someone out there who's going to do something like that, and they're not necessarily evil, nefarious, or dark people. They're not intentionally attempting to put their calloused heel on the garden hose of creativity that has emerged from the sweet internet, but that's what they're doing anyway. Now, it's not their fault, really, if you hear anybody who tells you you shouldn't be an artist or you shouldn't attempt to be an artist, and then you don't attempt to be an artist because someone told you you shouldn't do it, then it's 100% your fault. You can't let anybody get in the way of you and God, the creative process, whatever you want to call it. This is why, though I don't consider myself a Christian, I really love the New Testament because we have this weird, healing, magical, water walking hippie wandering around telling everybody, you know the guys who dress in the funny outfits and say they have a direct connection to God, you don't have to listen to them anymore. You can have a one-on-one, direct conversation with the universe whenever you want to, wherever you happen to be, whatever you happen to be doing. Even if you're in the midst of a six-hour porn binge surrounded by a cluster of semen-encrusted Kleenex's that radiate out from your office chair like some kind of terrible genetic doom flower, even if you have just gone through a six-hour porn binge and heroin needles are hanging out of your arm like an opiated porcupine, even if you have just gotten off the phone with your mom in the midst of a six-hour porn binge after blasting your veins full of heroin and called her a cunt and then came into a Kleenex that you tossed down next to your chair and are now smoking a cigarette and watching more porn, you can still connect with that never-ending outflow of creativity that a lot of people lazily call God. That's my belief and you should test it out. The main thing is, be a little scientist about all this stuff, try it out. The point is, don't let any of these hex-casting curse mongers trick you into thinking that for whatever reason you aren't allowed, you aren't capable, you don't have the ability to produce some kind of art in this world. Is the art going to be great? Is it going to get hung in a museum? Is your podcast going to get a million downloads? Is President Barack Obama going to come over to your house and have a conversation with you because you're so good at interviewing? Who knows? Maybe not, but that's not the point. When you get caught up in the outcomes, when you get caught up in the results, when you get caught up in the fruits of your action, then you don't get to enjoy the initial paycheck that comes from the incredible harmonization that you can experience with everything that is. What that harmonization is, there's a lot of different words. Some people call it inspiration. Some people call it epiphany. Some people call it enlightenment, but whatever it is, it feels fucking great. I don't care if it's just that when you finish a podcast or a painting or a book or you finish writing a story or you finish anything, anything, even if you finish a Snapchat, if you finish a 15-second Instagram video, whatever it is, your synaptic vesicles release some of that sweet, good old-fashioned happy juice that we call dopamine, and for a little while you're going to feel okay. You're going to get high on the amazing chemicals that exist in the celestial pharmacy that exists in your brain. You know me, I love getting high, and there isn't a more pure drug than that which your mind creates. All the other stuff is great as it may be. The sweetest, freshly baked, I don't think you bake LSD, but the sweetest, sweetest LSD, the sweetest, sweetest LSD cannot compare to the incredible, glorious, psychotropic chemicals that your mind creates on its own. Your mind is a really interesting drug dealer because the way it dispenses drugs is by getting you to do healthy things generally. Those drug dealers, when you go over there, they're not going to ask you to do push-ups, run five miles, write an essay on what love is, or a short story, or a painting, or a podcast. They're just going to ask for money. But the drug dealer that exists in your brain, he's a creative fella, and he requests really interesting forms of payment from running five miles to forgiving someone that you haven't forgiven in a while, that paying pills that you've been putting off. These are the fees that are charged by this eccentric pharmacist who lives in your brain cave. Now, back in the old days when the Reagan pigs had clamped down on all forms of drugs and had shoved all forms of drugs from cannabis, to mushrooms, to LSD, to heroin, to crack cocaine into one category, back in the old days, even though it's still happening a little bit, but at least it's not happening in Los Angeles, back in the old days, you would go through things called a marijuana drought. I don't know if you guys are still experiencing that. If you live in California, if you're in Denver, you will never experience that again, but in the old days, back in Hendersonville, North Carolina, if you wanted marijuana, sometimes it would just dry up. People would get busted. There would be big old marijuana busts. You'd hear about them on the news and you'd know that, well, weed's going to dry up for a little while. It's just gone. All your dealers, they just don't have any and if they do have any, they're charging way too much money for it based on the laws of supply and demand. It sucked. You'd go into these terrible marijuana droughts and it was just a mess. It was a real bummer, especially if it happened during the summer when you were just trying to enjoy camping and swimming and the rivers and lakes of North Carolina. If you worked at a summer camp or whatever, it was just a real bummer, right? It sucked. So, in the same way, if you're somebody who's going through some rough times, maybe a depression or just a general sense of bland boringness, that kind of strange calamity that can unexpectedly fall upon a human being on this planet where the flowers don't seem as bright anymore. You don't feel as connected to nature. You feel a little distracted. You're a little blurry. You're on your phone too much. You're scanning bits of information like some scrounging, starving squirrel and some icy tundra looking for a nut and you're just kind of, you're not depressed. You're just bored and maybe you're depressed. Who knows? You know, a lot of times prolonged boredoms can lead to depression, but in my opinion, if you find yourself in that situation where day after day, your love turns gray like the skin on a dying man's back, that's a Pink Floyd quote, then there may be a kind of neurological drought happening in your brain. It may be that the drug dealer in your brain for whatever reason has decided to dry up the supply of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, whatever you believe your neurological God happens to be. And if that's the case, then you might want to take a look at your life and ask yourself if that pharmacist, that alchemist, that biological engineer existing in your brain is demanding some kind of payment that you haven't been offering. Have you been running? Have you been going out in the sun? Have you been creating anything at all? When was the last time you created something? When was the last time you sat on and did a drawing? When was the last time you went to an art supply store and bought a canvas and some paint and just attempted to paint? When was the last time you made some music? Man, we exist in the glory age of creating music. It's so easy and fun now. It's so easy and fun. And let's all simultaneously give the middle finger to those shitty, old, crusty, bitter bastards who are jealous because these days you don't have to go through the severe learning curve that you had to go through if you wanted to learn to play music. Thanks to incredible programs like Logic. Thanks to amazing synthesizers. Thanks to... And all of these things, by the way, you can get demos for free right now. And you could get a MIDI keyboard that will plug into your computer and have a really amazing synthesizer for less than like 90 bucks if you go to Guitar Center or wherever. So my point is we have access to all this technology that in some way overcomes a lot of the learning curves that people used to have to go through if they wanted to create art. And that means that at this very moment there are a million different possible ways that you could create something, that you could create a miniature work of art. And it doesn't have to be something... The project doesn't have to take years. We're not even talking about months. We're talking hours. Just sit down for an hour, get a copy of GarageBand, get a copy of Logic, download a sample of Photoshop or just get a piece of paper and a pen or just get some paint or just get something laying around the house and some tape, make a little collage, anything at all. Just do it and you will experience an amazing high, a really incredible kind of psychedelic trip that comes not just from the completion of a project, but the weird vanishing of time that happens when you experience this strange magnetic suction of the thing that you're creating. You will feel a kind of... You'll feel yourself get pulled into something. You'll feel this thing coming through. You'll start doing stuff and you won't understand why. You'll watch yourself doing it and you won't understand why. You won't even know who you are at that time. You won't even be there more than likely, but what'll happen is you'll look up at the clock and an hour or two or three or six has passed and here is this brand new thing that you've brought into the universe, a completely brand new thing. You, a spinaret, the end result of 13.7 billion years of universal organization has continued its unfolding process in the form of some sketch, a podcast, a collage, a song, whatever it may be, and that is a fucking miracle, man. It's a miracle when you look at the sheer improbability, the sheer statistical improbability of you existing at all and then consider that you, this thing that exists in this infinite universe, is actually creating stuff based on your subjective experience or based on some intuition that you don't even understand. That's a miracle. Many of these sons of bitches that are in your life, father forgive them. They know not what they do, but you've got to start ignoring them. The person who told you you're not an artist, the person who told you you're not a writer, the person who told you you couldn't be a comedian, the person who told you you couldn't be a podcaster, the person who told you you couldn't do this or that you're using their dark voodoo as an excuse to avoid the feeling of placing your psychic tendrils on the infinite electric fence that is the creative flow of the universe. It's scary. You lose control. You know when you grab an electric fence, you just lock down on it for a second. It grabs you and hopefully someone will knock you off the fence, but in the same way, this strange conduit, the source of creativity, the source of great ideas, if you allow yourself to get close to it, you'll clamp down for a second and something will come out of you. It might be something you've been trying to avoid because many of us don't like vomiting. That's something that isn't fun. There's a you lose control and you're puking. When it finally happens, you know, when you finally at 3 a.m. manage to stumble out of the bed after you had six vodka's that night and you actually just lose control, you can't breathe anymore because a geyser of vile vodka puke mixed with the hot dog you had after you left the bar comes flying out of you in an awful rainbow of poison into the toilet. It's not the most exciting thing to experience, but creativity, art, if you want to call it that, the creative process, it's weirdly similar. In this case, the thing that you're vomiting up isn't some regurgitated vileness, but is actually something quite beautiful, something that over time, if you keep doing it, can actually develop into something that can help other people, God forbid, or can just make people feel happy or can inspire people. So there you go, friends, spend this weekend. Go to a craft store, write a letter, make something, create something. If you're experiencing a drought of those sweet, beautiful brain chemicals right now, do a little experiment. See if perhaps that drug dealer in your brain might give you a little bit of a supply in exchange for a nice work of art. What a sweet drug dealer. There aren't many out there like that. Usually they want your money or they want your body or they want something else. But in this case, they want your art. It wants your art. It wants you to create. Give it a shot. I challenge you to do it. Today, my God, this podcast is really cool. It's got everything I love in a podcast. We've got ghosts, we've got talk of comedy, and we've got a cult and a serial killer. It's all in this podcast with the amazing Adam Egett. We're going to jump right into it, but this episode of the Dunkin' Trustle Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the fancy lads and lasses over at Casper.com. If you go to casper.com forward slash family hour and use offer code family hour, you will get $50 towards a brand new mattress. Let me tell you, you need a new mattress. Here's an intro from Bill Bryson's, a brief history of nearly everything. If you have a pillow that's older than six years old, then one tenth of that son of a bitch's body weight is dead skin cells and old dead microscopic beings. So think about your mattress. Really consider the fact that that thing that you're laying on, that ain't a mattress. That's a swarm of bacteria. That's an ocean. That's something that makes a uronymous Bosch painting look like I'm sure of a glass of ice cold lemonade. You are laying on death, friends. You're laying on the tentacles of Cthulhu itself. You're laying, you might as well take a potato sack and fill it with pages from the Necronomicon and try to have a nice sleep on that accursed thing. You want to know why the gargoyle's been coming to you in your dreams and puncturing your rectum with its iron fist. It's because you're laying on a nightmare, your old mattress, but all that can change thanks to the heroic glory of the men and women at Casper.com who have saved us as a civilization from being dragged through a mattress warehouse by a maniac mattress salesman who will pull us through his maze of overpriced mattresses like a dog dragging an old dead cat through a forest of thorns. Sure, I can read the talking points and I will because I have to contractually. An obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price, just the right sink, just the right bounce, two technologies, latex foam and memory foam come together for better nights and brighter days, risk-free trial and return policy, try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days with free delivery and painless returns. The mattresses are made in America, praise Allah, $500 for a twin-size mattress, $950 for a king-size mattress. Comparing that to industry averages, that is an outstanding price point. I could read all that and I just did, but here's the main point. I sleep on a Casper mattress. Every single night, I lay my freshly lotioned body covered in a mixture of rare lotions, whale excretions, a combination of several different burial style chemicals and blue eye-blowing drops. I'm trying to turn my eyes blue, ear stretchers, my hair combed back and freshly greased down. My feet have been massaged by several masseuses, grapes on my nipples and crucifix necklace draped around my neck. When I lay down, I am laying on a Casper king-sized mattress. I sleep on one of these things. I went from a queen to a king. That's been the only change because my bed has transformed into a kind of Noah's Ark covered with cats and dogs and a girlfriend, and so I needed a bigger bed. But I sleep on a Casper mattress, so I can't think of any better way to help you understand that these are great mattresses.

You know recently I went to the Glendale Galleria because I wanted to buy a new shirt and it really was just brutal. It was brutal in every level. It was just sick, something about it's sick. I don't want to go to Tivana. I went into the Apple store for no reason and just like a creep drew on the iPad in there and then I kind of shuffled in to Bloomingdale's and bought a $70 shirt and just left feeling confused and sad and that's what happens when you go to a place that's collecting the consumeristic farts of thousands of people all day long. Your brain doesn't understand it. It knows that not far from wherever you may be is some radiant glowing bit of nature whether it's a community garden or a forest and it just can't understand why you would spend any amount of time in the artificially lit environment of a mall or a chain store.

famous comedy store in Los Angeles so I used to be the talent coordinator of the comedy store and this is a job that is a pretty high pressure crazy job and you're basically in charge of what comedians get to perform every single night and when I was the talent coordinator I was basically Mitzi Shore the owner of the comedy store's assistant so I didn't have any real power thank God which meant that if comedians weren't getting spots they couldn't get angry at me about it because it was all because of Mitzi but Adam he's the one actually doing these lineups and it's an insane job it's a combination of counselor, tyrant, benevolent dictator, euthanizer, mystic, shaman it's the job requires so many weird skills and Adam is just doing an incredible job of it if you haven't been to the comedy store lately definitely stop by something is reactivated in that place and it's sold out almost every night the energy there is just incredible dark powerful vibrant and I think a lot of it is because of the energy that Adam has been pouring into that club also Adam has had a very interesting past including getting sucked into a cult and so we talk about that in this podcast we talk about ghosts we talk about the comedy store and I got to tell you I really this is one of my favorite episodes that I've ever done so now everybody please open your hearts send out as much love happiness joy any kind of sweetness that you can send the direction of today's guest who is truly doing the Lord's work at the comedy store in West Hollywood everybody please welcome to the Duncan trustle family our Adam Eget Adam Jack awesome hey man welcome to the podcast thanks for having me thanks for coming up here you know I guess the best way to start is to talk about this job that you have right that I used to have yes you did you are the talent coordinator of the comedy store right and can you describe for the people who maybe aren't aware of what the comedy store is can you describe it to people like how would you describe it well I mean it was always described to me as an artist comedy and I think that's a pretty accurate depiction I think that it's probably evolved a little bit I think it's become more it's changed it's evolved certainly but I think at its core I think it's still just this artist colony where comics come and feel safe to hang out and perform and work out new material it's like a gym I think it's like a gym right yeah it's a combination any other comedy club gym mental asylum energy vortex it's it is an energy vortex yeah it's there's a dark I don't want to scare it there really is like I'm not I was always incredibly skeptical but since work I you know I've been there for only I've only been there for about five years now but I feel it and over time like you it's not something that I felt an instantly but over time it just sort of like it's clear it's pretty clear to me there's something there I think when people think about a comedy club when they think about most comedy clubs their idea is a kind of sanitized place you know in general unless like you live in Denver and have been to the comedy works or there's a few that have real character but mostly you just think of a kind of sanitized place you go in sit down have a dinner yep some people will do stand up and then and then that's it and you leave if you're an audience member but the comedy store is this haven for comedians many of them who have been there for decades now for decades are just celebrated 40th anniversary last night 40th anniversary so this is a life for people there and and I can remember so when I was working for Mitzi as a talent coordinator somebody called in there at Vales and I guess I didn't write them down or something and I wasn't thinking it was that big a deal and she's like this is their life honey it's so true because yeah when they stop getting spots or they get less yeah it's it's almost it's I've never seen anything like it how many spots are there per week that you have at the comedy store I mean I've added a few shows I'd say what so you got 15 spots a night yeah in the OR so that and that's and that's six nights a week so we got 90 spots 90 plus then you got the two main room shows yeah that's another 20 because you only have about 10 on those okay and then I added so what is that that's 110 plus maybe I added an early Saturday show which gave me another 10 okay so we have about 120 spots give or take a few spots yeah for the week to give to comedians yes and how many comedians want spots oh pages so I got scores I mean you've seen the name anybody that's been to the comedy store sees those names on the wall and I'd say you know I don't have ace trucking company calling in for spots but a good percentage of those names that are on the wall still call in every week right even if they don't get spots because I tell people I want you know I just I tell people that uh to keep calling in because you never know if there's a bunch of people that are gonna be out of town one week and I may need someone but it doesn't happen because no matter what you're gonna have this hierarchy of talent calling in right so you're gonna have people like bill burr you're gonna have people like rogan you're gonna have these like lex louisey k yeah legendary legendary legendary comedians calling in so you've got some percentage of those spots has to go to those people at any spot they're calling for you're running a business so the people when the audience comes if you were to like do a vote for like who would you like to see perform bill burr yeah or this guy who's like working on material on his new hour that you've probably never seen before right they're gonna say bill burr 100% of the time but the challenge of the job is that you can't you don't want it to just be a showcase club for famous comedians because the heart and soul of the thing is that people come through there figure this craft or art out and then go on to you're growing it's like a what do you call it's like a greenhouse so yeah you're growing comedians too exactly and I think that I try and maintain I remember Argus used to tell me that Argus Hamilton we were just talking about been there for 40 years and he said the mitzi looked at it like a canvas and I don't want to sound pretentious I just got thrown into the job but I try to keep that in mind when I do the lineups and so from yeah from 945 to about 1030 I try and put those comics in that that we just that you just discussed yes eloquently is the people that the audience mostly wants to see yeah and the big draws and then I put the people that are up and come that are like right on the cusp that are about to I think are the best I have that aren't household names yet yeah but will soon be probably household names then I put the dark like the the people that deserve their shot at a chance to develop much like the the comics who came before them had a chance to develop who only been passing the last year or two yeah and then that kills everyone like so all those people that were getting spots before I brought Rogan you know Rogan was was awesome enough to come back to the store it's so great to have him and Diaz back and then I brought in you know all these other comics like Anthony Cheslenick and then yeah Louis when he's in town and Rock when he's in town and then Bill Burr and uh um brought in Greg Fitzsimmons and uh and Nikki Glazer and all these people so that killed a lot of spots man right and it's uh you know what it was like I mean I think that we we had different we obviously have incredibly different experiences in the same position but I think that you have you more than anyone I know you've been invaluable to talk to about this we're talking about a dog with 120 nipples basically right a dog with 120 nipples and we're talking about these beings who depend on the sustenance from those nipples for a lot of different things for to develop their material for just a sense of gratification just a feeling like okay I must be doing all right I'm getting spots to just a feeling of like accomplishment and so it's it's and comedians are everyone knows that when you talk when you just when you describe a comedian it's very rare that you hear oh yes it's a very level-headed emotionally stable person like comedians are like comedians have the reason they're so funny is because many of them have very difficult childhoods many of them have a lot of stuff going on and they're using comedy as a way to survive basically it's keeping them it's it's all that they've got and it's all that they want it's the only thing they could do so I'm I'm building it up maybe a little more dramatically than I know I think that's pretty close yes so you so this creates as the talent coordinator you find yourself unfortunately for me when I was the talent coordinator it was mitzi was the one doing the spots right but you find yourself this is not a normal job no you find yourself as a kind of either benevolent or tyrannical dictator running a tiny tiny little island and this island is filled with some of the most intelligent manipulative chaotic people on planet earth so it is a fascinating job and I don't think a lot of people understand the amount of psychic abuse and torture and mind-numbing just mind-numbing guilt that can come in this job because people are people will come to you and they're you have legitimately even though you didn't intend to intend to do it you have legitimately fucked up their lives and it's not your fault no I know right I don't yeah I don't sleep much anymore I really don't um I used it's funny because I used to have different reasons for not uh for having restless nights and now it's it's become all about the store and these and these lives that you just discussed um it's difficult I hate it kills me a little inside every time I have to tell someone I don't have spots for them yeah and uh I I know how important it is to these people and um it's just I have to just I have to do what I feels right like and I and it's nothing personal but um it always feels that way at least on their end and I understand that are you grinding your teeth yet oh yeah yeah that's the you yeah so you start like grinding your teeth you start like having these just like you you you get embroiled and I don't know if people understand the dramas that well these storm systems will erupt in this place like I could tell you there's sagas that happen there I'm I'm I'm already a part of them I it's um it's like a soap opera mixed with the overlook hotel I look at it like my overlook hotel it really is like the overlook hotel and I feel like Jack Torrance I really do like I'm losing my mind there and I feel like we've all we've always been there like you look at these pictures on the wall of all the ghosts and all the people from the past and and it just it just really does and there's a dark energy it's like there's it really does the main room reminds me of the gold ballroom it's it's just uh the but the that the dress the green room in the main room come on they're just all the history there it's the heart of the building right there I know it's it's the what is it called the lodge and Twin Peaks there oh my god I've been I just finished uh I just rewatched it I watched the last episode this morning at 3am that's so weird it is it's the black lodge it's the black lodge and and so much has gone on there you know people have died you know this is a famous story that there's a I think they actually that's what the new showtime series is based on the book I'm dying up here which is about a comedy store comedian who jumped from the roof of the high next door to the comedy store with a sign around his neck saying I am Denise I am Steve Lubeckin I used to work at the comic store I used to be a comic I used to be a paid regular something like that something like that but so that's how serious this place is and this is the that's how serious this bizarre little ecosystem is and the difficulty I think in your position as a talent coordinator as opposed to when I had the job is you have no shield exactly and I think okay so with Mitzi's era so it's his era it was an era it was an era um you had Johnny like it literally would make and make someone's career a spot because you had the the Carson bookers who would be in the crowd yeah and would just watch there they'd watch religiously every night and it was just a different when Johnny Carson's show came moved from New York to LA and that created this this boom where which inevitably created the improv in the comedy store because all these stand-up comedians started going up at the store in the improv and and then someone from the Carson show would see them and put them up the next day and it would virtually make a career that's Freddie Prince and all these people and then it it's something changed you know over time that I think now we're in a place where it just doesn't it doesn't work that way anymore obviously where where the Carson show it just doesn't exist that format that now it's gone yeah it's gone but but still there's so many comics right now it's so popular I I can't even fathom it just seems like there's there's so many and there's so few spots available yeah and yeah it's true that um I don't have Mitzi as a shield but I don't know I think there's pros and cons to to to both where where you had you could deflect it to Mitzi um but I'm not like there's other stuff involved like I I'm just it's not my club so right I have I have bosses to answer to but unfortunately I don't I don't I have to I have to fulfill all of these obligations and these and these wishes and in other requests from from my employers and and we have to make sure that we're making money and the and the and the club is full and then I don't know it's it's hard to explain but I but unfortunately I have to I have to put it all on myself I can't I can't say oh so and so told me I have to put this person up you know what I mean but since your reign started yeah you followed the reign of Tommy and since your reign started the place is flourished like the club is booming it's never when I was there it certainly wasn't like that when I was there this was like you know this is the um there's really interesting and guys I know this price if you haven't been at the comedy store but just trust me when I tell you everything we're saying we're barely inflating it really is like that but an Arthurian legend if you've ever watched uh X caliber sure they they say when the king is sick the land is sick right exactly so the the spirit of the ruler is reflected in the land and like when I was there you know Mitzi was going was it was a rough spot for her man and like uh she had a lot of concerns I think most of her life it's spent the main concern is just developing comedians everything was about the comedy store she treated that place with the exact same level of discipline and energy that whenever you hear about like the great great people like Einstein or whenever you hear about the greatest of the greats it's always amazing how they're inexhaustible they're the moment they wake up to the moment they go to bed they a hundred percent are focused on this one thing and that's what Mitzi was like and but then Mitzi you know she's you know we all have a human body and the human body gets old and so she started having these other concerns and so the place it kind of started like getting wonky like it was wobbly and out of like and it certainly wasn't profitable at that time and then um and I think her lineups reflected the the state of mind that she was in or you know did well she wasn't yeah I I mean you were there I wasn't there at that time well it was it was all these comics that weren't really relevant anymore and weren't the doors was pretty sealed were sealed pretty tight right so so what was happening is there wasn't an influx of a lot of like what you're seeing right now which is like you know there's there just was it's it felt like it was kind of like a skipping record a little bit right it just felt a little like it just wasn't moving forward it was a wax museum or yeah like a tomb almost yeah yeah that's right that's right it just didn't feel it just didn't have the like because I remember when I first came to the comedy store as a phone guy there's a comedian named Russell who um uh was telling me what it was like in the 80s you know because he'd been there and he's like you don't understand man there were lines out the door the the it was packed it was always packed the energy was incredible you just don't know man it was just the most amazing place everywhere you looked there was another famous comedian it was just insane right and I remember him describing that to me and just thinking well it ain't that now man it's definitely not that now it evolved into Wonka where it's like no one ever goes in no one ever goes out that's what that's exactly it that's it and she was Willy Wonka yeah man and yeah that's it that's totally the gates were shut so then um I left Tommy took my place and then Tommy got a little more responsibility I guess and and you know we all there's no point going to that story right but then um and then you came and all of a sudden just everything just blew up in the place and like now when I go there it's like holy shit this is what Russell was talking about like I'm this is like this thing is flowering now that had not flowered in years and it's really an intense thing to witness man it's it's a palpable like it's tangible like you can feel it last night Seinfeld came in and performed he hasn't been on stage in that room since 1979 holy that was the last time he was there he told a great story about how Mitzi never liked him never passed him yeah that's right actually he told this great story about how after he he found all his success like he was he just got the show was a huge hit and he kept calling in for spots and Mitzi goes yeah I know you're you know you're really sexy I just don't like you yeah she really just told her she said that basically um he's gonna need someone to keep him grounded and that's and that's who she and that was what she was well that was part of her I think that was part of her technique man like his because she was an icon icon and she really was developing comedians yeah and when you hear that and you think oh well what am I gonna do with him what are you doing no yeah that's probably what you like what am I gonna do with him he's already now he's already developed or whatever like when these I think she is still was trying to develop I think that she so when we think about like comedy comedy is uh stand up is is a craft that you learn from failure right you learn from rejection absolutely learn from bombing yeah you learn from what doesn't work and you learn whether or not you know if it doesn't work is it because use that joke sucks or is it because it's not the right room for right so there's only things you learn but it's a art it's an art of pain right yes so if someone was great art comes from great pain that's right absolutely and if mitzi is the patron of that art form then she must therefore induce pain as part of her process in teaching people yeah yeah the George Martin got rest in peace of uh of stand-up comedy that's it yeah that's it in flit to putting that so when like someone and and that was what was you know that was the what was great about her process and also her Kelly's heel is that she of all the people in the world she of course would be the one who tells fucking Seinfeld now honey you're gonna have to respect that so much I do too I love it I love her for it yeah and I think about that and I just and I love what you said about the the pain and not and and how the importance of bombing and failure all the the the importance of failure makes me think of the uh I stayed at Ari's place in New York went to Irish a fear and he had this great um this huge like calendar it wasn't it was just a chart I guess where it had it had a 100 you've seen that 100 dates and an x through each day yeah and on the top I think it was Bobby Lee I don't know he must have heard from Bobby I think and he said uh you're you're never gonna be you have to bomb 100 times to be a great comic so there's 100 squares on this son of a bitch for every time that fucking guy bombed he wrote a date in what a brilliant son of a bitch who loves him so much man I'm so happy for him that is so cool yeah and and so so this so this place the way she she did it and it wasn't just pain the the other thing about Mitzi that was so incredible and that kind of elevated her to like a a cult like status uh is that not only was she a master at dispensing pain in the sense of in the form of true rejection like because I had to I listen what you're it's like putting animals to sleep like she would make the decision that this comic or that comic couldn't come to the store anymore these were the bands she called it banning comedians but so so I would have to get on the phone and tell a comedian I'm really sorry she says she wants you to work out at other clubs for a little while and and it was the most those are the most brutal phone calls to make it's like fire it's yeah it sucks it's worse than firing way worse because it's like yeah you're taking away a canvas from someone who like is depending on that canvas but again it's there you have to understand the comedy club isn't the only club to work at and if you've gotten it in your head that the comedy store isn't the only club so but uh outside of that aspect ever the other aspect ever I have never seen anybody who loves comedians more than that woman so when she wasn't like of inflicting you by putting you on stage for four weeks straight following someone you just broke up with because she didn't like comedians to date so like if if like the the moment like comedians broke up you could be certain one would follow the other on the lineup because she thought it was so fucking funny her so many stories like a so funny big fight and then one's bringing up the other that's right you can bet on that you can bet on it for sure because she thought was funny and also was she's teaching these incredible lessons right she's teaching that like your art has to transcend your social life you have to be able to like handle any situation so she's so there was this other thing that this thing inside of her that's just like the most amazing love and I we don't have to keep going on about the comedy store because some other stuff I want to talk about this but the um I have I I remember like one of my favorite stories about her is uh we're sitting down by the bar because that's where she'd do business and um one thing she'd do I'll tell two quick stories about her man one thing that she'd do is uh pretend to be feeble if she was in a business meeting right so I remember like someone would come with some idea something they wanted to do everyone had these things they wanted to do there and I and like I'd be sitting with her and right before the person came she's like just sharp and focused and completely there and completely there at the level of like some like like you're with a president or something you know like just a mogul or something just completely there okay what's going on today all right well okay who is this son of a bitch all right well then they come in and you watch her just kind of shrink down suddenly she's not this like dragon being she's just this kind of old lady who's like maybe not all there and then oh my god and then from that the person would start treating her differently you know so the way that they would because she seems so vulnerable so they'd start revealing what they're like I swear I saw that's amazing then they'd leave and she'd be like right back she's like fuck that guy brilliant man brilliant brilliant brilliant but the other thing because we always had these meetings at that bar man the other thing um that she I'll never forget this kid comes in just coming to town from Florida wanted to be a comedian you know walks right up right up to us sitting there right up to us sitting there in that look man she's had the the the side eye man she had the sat the most amazing like she looks up at him and he's like I'm I came from Florida I want to be a comedian I just want to work out here and you know you're like oh shit what's going to happen right you know the this could go either way and and like you just see her like light up all of this love comes pouring out of her and she's like oh great honey oh that's good you will start working you out on Sundays on the open mic and it was the sweetest thing wow that first time oh but then after that torture torture torture torture you know but the first there's this welcoming sweetness followed by the screws being put in and it creates some great comics that technique you know I don't want to go back to Ari but really quick Ari said he had to showcase for her 30 30 something times before she passed yeah that's right it's wild yeah she was so good at that yeah the the pain and I think she in her mind I think it's like if if I I'm gonna make it so that unless you're a comedian you're not going to keep doing this right I'm gonna save you from going down a path that maybe isn't your path by putting these ridiculous Shaolin monastery kung fu level challenges in front of you right and when and if you really want to be a comedian you're gonna you're gonna get through it yeah and if you don't want to be a comedian you're not and you can blame it on me you could say it's the comedy stories fault you could blame it on whatever you want but a real comedian is very similar to that fucking daisy you see growing up out of a sidewalk it's gonna grow no matter what no matter what gets in its way it's gonna grow absolutely so even in even in the the comedy store environment and I think that if there's any balm that you can have when you start feeling that guilt of telling people that that they don't have spots for them right now it's that if they're a comedian they're gonna keep doing comedy and if they're a comedian they're gonna find places to go up and if they're a comedian they're gonna keep developing and if they're a comedian they're gonna figure out a way to get those spots again at the comedy store and it's up to them it's not you it's not on you it's not your fault and I think that's one of the most important lessons in all art don't be a fucking victim don't be dependent on this place or that place or any place a thousand percent and I and I got to witness at first hand all of these comics who were so bitter and and held it held it against Tommy their misfortunes or their you know the success that they never achieved they always held most of them I don't want to say all of them but yeah many of them held that against Tommy and they and they held it so tightly and I never I never understood that and then I think once I took over I think a lot of them realized this had nothing to do with Tommy this is I I'm the only one um held it should be held accountable for for any success I achieve and it's it's my you know yeah it's up to me it's up to you yeah it's up to you it's up to everyone you're not a victim you can't be and if you're if you eat especially when it comes to art art victims come on really like this is your like you're an art victim that's ridiculous nonsense it's nonsense and and and it's a and putting yourself into that position as an art victim is is really to I think uh negate the thing that's going to make you a really funny comic which is coming to terms with your failure looking into your heart and witnessing yes where yeah it's accountability yeah and it's yeah if you want to make a change it's it's got to come from with you it's not with the regime change no you know certainly not no it doesn't mean I still feel an incredible guilt you still are gonna hurt from it but but as long as I just anybody not just in like when it comes to comedy store but anytime most like I know from personal experience when I'm blaming someone else for my own failure there I can always look into my heart and see every single time that I didn't do the thing I was supposed to do all the little steps I took that led to the failure and from that analysis I usually am able to find the way out because if you can find the way you got in you can always find the way out yeah absolutely yeah but if you don't if you think you are sort of like hoodwinked or tricked or the world against you yeah then how do you get out of that mess now you're just in an endless prison of victimhood why hold on so tightly it's gonna you're gonna be you're gonna remain stagnant you're not gonna move forward you're just holding on tightly like golem clutching this ring yeah bitterness that's it and anger and it's all misguided it's all misguided there's one little one quick little anecdote that I always loved about mitzi that I heard recently again mitzi and tommy the old talent coordinator were sitting in the main room one day and she turns to tommy and she said tommy I swear I think their comics are living in here and she goes no and he goes no mitzi I think I don't I don't think that's true that's not true and then the exact moment this comic who didn't get many spots comes waltzing out of the main room green room in a literally in a towel drying his hair off with another towel hey mitzi she just like she just gave that side look that you were describing to tommy I love that story the funniest shit would happen around her man like stuff that would happen around her that was so perfectly timed and insanely funny and her reaction to it was like man it sounds so weird but she was so connected to that building man that her reaction to it was like sometimes she felt like she was the building like turned into a person it's really weird being a lot of metaphysical stuff goes on there I'm not ashamed to sit to to believe in it I know it's there I've seen it it's incredible I was a skeptic for a long time and then when I started closing up every night and during the witching hour at three o'clock I never saw anything but man I I certainly felt did I tell you my ghost experience there no man I had a couple one of them I I guess I mean one of them was just like crazy which was mitzi was pissed at me this was before Carlos Mincia's like fall from from grace so he's like a big deal and he uh wanted to come perform at the store he was coming and uh man I just forgot to put his name on the sign man and he's a big fuck up though you know because that's gonna bring some people in and and but for mitzi like a thing like that now you you know it's like all right whatever man just like get it together put his name on the sign put it up now yeah but for mitzi oh man that's no you forgot to put the headline this big headliner's name on the sign of the building we're not getting like big numbers right now what are you doing man that's a real fuck up so like I remember she's just like she comes in she walks up to me and she's just like basic I can't remember what she said exactly she's like fuck you donkey and your heart shrivels in your chest you could feel your heart withering you could feel just those petals of your heart folding inward you want to you want to go you just want to vanish into a black hole to escape the wrath of mitzi there's nothing like it I've ever experienced so she's like go up to your fucking office you want me to get get me she wanted me to get something on the office so like I go running up to the office I'm just like well I'm definitely getting fired there's no question about it I'm done here and I got up to I got up to the office and you know to get up to the talent office or I don't know where do you where do you work now I think it's in the same one it's not all the way at the top where Polly's office that used to be the talent coordinator that used to be it so Polly's office used to be the talent coordinator's office that's where at the time this is before Polly moved in there so I go through you unlock like you have to unlock two doors to get there right it's where the root so you were inside where the roof access was or were you on the other side where the bigger spaces that bigger space that was it okay so a lot of like doors you have to unlock to get there and a lot of lights you have to turn on sure still so I run into my office and I'm grabbing whatever the thing is you want it I don't even know what it was but from the other there's an office right next to that something just starts pounding on the fucking wall man like the what what time was this during the this is during the show this is during the show is night but no one could I unlock I was the one who unlocked the doors unless someone was like secretly hiding after the doors have been locked which is equally creepy but something someone's like the wall is you could see the wall shaking I don't know what the fuck that was but I was so terrified of Mitzi that it was less frightening than what was happening to me I'm just like oh great this is when the ghost happens rent I didn't look in the office to see what it was I just ran downstairs so I don't know what that was probably a comic tricking me who knows but the other one the other one man hallway of the belly room so for you okay go on that's where I always hear stories about that's where it's at that hallway for you guys who haven't been to the comedy store there's an upstairs room called the belly room it's like a 90 cedar wonderful wonderful cool room but there's a hallway that leads to from the green room to the to the belly room so do you want to give a backstory on that room itself you give the backstory well I don't I can't verify I've I've always been enamored by that story but I've never been able to verify if it's true the abortion yeah yeah so supposedly back room abortions were giving given up which is botched abortions yeah that's the ironic belly yeah belly room that's why they're being called the belly room even though I don't think that was I think it was I think it was about belly last but I wouldn't put it past Mitzi to to have some sort of double well we just who knows who knows who knows what it what and one thing about Mitzi is she was always big on she didn't want to change a thing about that building you always you know I hear all these stories from different parts of the building because when Mitzi bought the property they would say oh you know this is from Ciro's and it was there was a lot of mob connection to it oh yes Mickey Cohen and I was told that she didn't want to change a lot so there's I don't know so that would make sense there's bodies in the wall yeah but she um so I mean she would like paint there's a fire hydrant in front of the club and she would always have uh does Juan Carlos still work yeah absolutely so she would have Juan Carlos paint it silver in front of the club so he'd go and paint the the he would paint the fire hydrant silver and then there was this endless war between her and the fire department who would come out and paint it yellow again how is she not did she get fine how is that like nothing she's above the law she's above the law I think they probably thought was funny I guess but nothing ever happened but that was a thing okay the hydrant Juan Carlos so so uh she so um she uh yeah so the other ghost experience was hallway hallway bedroom I'm sitting in the green room waiting to go up because that's when I first started working out there she started giving me spots in the belly room on on Fridays and that's where I I got to learn to that's where I got to have a regular place to try out stand up for years so she um she uh so I'm sitting I'm sitting there looking down the hallway and these two people are in a fight right and they're like I don't know what they're in a fight over but they're just stipulating and you know it's a really passionate fight in this standing in the hallway so they stop fighting and walk away and I'm just sitting there and then I look up two completely different people are standing in the exact spot in the same fucking fight man the same kind of hand gestures the same motion and that to me was the ghost which is like there was something there like some kind of energy like an imprint an imprint something that just that's what I I love that theory about when people explain ghosts is is just well it's if there is if it does exist it does it has to be just energy yeah um but yeah that's fascinating I've heard yeah I've heard stories about that hallway about an orb where they see in an orb like a this just like a like a fog like an almost like this they call it the the white lady the the white lady or something I don't know what the something's in there but that's terrifying yeah it's it's crazy and and like when you're working there at night my god locking up no thanks I hated that no thanks you've been there for five years yeah five what were you doing before I used to manage the improv in Arizona in Tempe okay and I was there for about seven years wow yeah and then I moved out I'm from LA so I'm from I'm from the San Fernando Valley and I was born in San Monica race in the valley moved out to Arizona stayed out I was supposed to just be out there for a couple years but ended up staying for about 10 and then moved back home and then started working at the comedy store almost immediately I heard they were looking for a manager I didn't even apply someone just said hey someone's looking for a manager um and I went in and interviewed and I got hired as an assistant manager and you've been in comedy then for basically your whole working life we haven't had a job outside of comedy yeah I used to be I used to be an assistant to Amy Heckerling the director I was her PA for oh that was only for like a year then I worked at the entertainment television I was always in the industry for the most part then I moved to Arizona I just started bartending did you ever entertain the idea of like doing stand up I did stand up for like five months okay just to see what it was like just to like kind of face some fears it's not I've I have pretty bad stage fright I would have to drink pretty heavily before I got on stage right there's a great no conducive it's not sustainable it's certainly not sustainable I tried to sustain it without comedy it's not sustainable either way for me but I just uh I gave it a shot it was fun highest highs lowest lows I know what it's like yeah to try it um but now not into it not for me no no no no performance desire no like really you know I've done it you know I used to do this podcast with Norm MacDonald who like he's still one of my favorite stand-up comics of all time I think he's the funniest guy I've ever met and we had I had so much fun doing that I was a sidekick on there and we would write these opening sketches together it was really fun um and then I um I don't but no I don't really have any desire to act or perform um David Spade just made he uh he made Joe dirt too recently yeah and he always gives me shit because my voice I do I sound like Buffalo Bill oh yeah so uh he had a part for this young Buffalo Bill so I flew he flew me out there and I did this part in Buffalo in our Joe dirt too and that was it was so fun it was a fun experience it was amazing yeah it was so fun but no but that was yeah it's just a fun experience it was really cool but I have no no it's not for me now you so you grew up in LA yeah and we've talked about this a little bit but apparently you are a bit of a miscreant huh yeah well I had you know is that the right word miscreant is that even a word you are all better than I wanted to say cretin but miscreant came out I don't even think that's a word let me look at that miscreant oh yeah that's a word a person who behaves badly yeah so you are so that was me me yeah so you were a little cretin a cretin yeah there we go so what when when did so when did that start like I guess I started when my parents separated so I was I was right after my bar mitzvah I was probably about 14 or 14 when I started acting out a little bit I would get in fights at school and then I started I was always kind of self-destructive I mean I'm a huge smiths fan so I was always I was a cutter oh so I I would cut on myself a lot and then my parents sent me to a like a psych ward I would get sent away there and then when was the first time you started cutting I think I was about I think it was 13 almost 14 do you remember why you did it I think it was for attention for sure it had to be for attention it wasn't because of some you know some people some people who cut they just are numb apparently and I felt numb but I think maybe it started out that way but then I realized all the attention I got from it and I wasn't really getting much okay I gained a lot of weight I was very depressed I was being made fun of its school and it was like it was a part an outlet for my you know pain and aggression whatever but then it turned into I think it had to be mostly for attention so you were kind of like a goth right like I didn't dress off maybe on the inside yeah yeah it was a goth on the inside you have brothers or sisters I have once a younger sister and then a half brother and a half sister okay so your parents your mom divorced yeah and my dad married someone else and had a couple kids later and you stayed with your mom or your dad I stayed with my mom mostly when was the divorce I was probably 14 14 that's a rough one yeah so yeah that's a tough yeah it's a tough age right yeah and then I started cutting on my face like on my cheeks and stuff with the and so eventually they told me you know if I if I had if I did it again and then I yeah I punch holes and walls I was I was an angry kid I didn't have any yeah um because the divorce is like it's not just like the divorce happens when you're 14 that's not like just like your parents are getting along and then there's this oh well we're gonna divorce yeah exactly there's a lot of lead up a lot of build up yeah there's a lot of build up and that build up is not pleasant that's a turbulent thing because your parents it's not working and so here are these two people who are in this insanely stressful situation of having kids yeah and they're not getting along anymore and there's a lot of reasons I don't know why with your parents oh yeah well my dad you know I remember going to Betty Ford Center so he had a lot of drug and alcohol problems and then he got sober and then as soon as he got sober he left my mom wow yeah um but then um but then yeah I just kept fucking up I just kept fucking up and then uh they sent me away to this this boarding school they they threatened it but I didn't think it would ever happen and it was just this boarding school now what's it called it's called C2 how did they hear about it they heard about it through some counselors at the psych at the Northridge psych war whatever the I don't even know what the how long how long were you in the psych ward for uh shit I was there three three times the first time was probably for about a week the second time was maybe two weeks and then the third time was like a day or two before they uh took me out of there and sent me to uh to this boarding school did you like the psych ward no it was horrible I was roommates with this kid who claimed he was a gang member I remember one day I woke up and we we got into some altercation it was like a one-sided I didn't even realize we were just like like sort of we weren't we were just sort of making fun of each other but it started off playfully and then I remember waking up and he had a belt around my fucking neck and he was just choking me it was insane you're in a yeah I know right I was totally forgot I was in psych work uh but yeah it was just fucking I didn't belong there I was just like why Jewish kid from the suburbs and then I'm like rooming my room is this this guy gang member he said he killed people and shit he had tats all over he's 13 year old with tats all over him it's crazy uh but then yes so then they were like hey you fuck up again we're you know we're not taking you to there we're taking you to this uh boarding school you're gonna be there for for a couple years and what does C.D. stand for uh it's it's so bizarre because it's not even it's not it's see yourself as you want to be and then do something about it okay but it's not spelled C it's not spelled the way it should be it's spelled C-E-D-U see who you are see how you want to be and then do something about it so sounds sounds kind of like tough love oh yeah so this is so you're sent to you you've been cutting your face yeah you've been getting in fights right you're you're you're you're sent to a boarding school where is the boarding school it's in the San Bernardino mountains so you're sent to a boarding school in the San Bernardino mountains and what is so what is that like who drove you there my parents drove me there how was that drive they told me I was just going to tour it I said we're just gonna go check it out um and uh did they have you pack your bags or anything no they packed it I didn't realize you didn't know the bag was in the trunk yeah so they tricked you yeah for sure but I heard I heard much later uh that they did this to a lot and that's how they they did this to most of the students this is so when your parents called C.D.U. yeah and said listen we've got to do something our kid's cutting his face he's getting in fights they're like here's what you do pack his bags put it in the trunk tell him it's for a tour and then we're gonna kidnap him exactly yeah I mean a lot of people there they you know sometimes they they hire these guys these basically these goons that would come in the middle of the night and grab the kid and and just that's C.D.U. I heard about that they'd grab them and they and they'd like cuff I don't know if they cuff them or they they do something to restrain them in the car and drive them up the fucking mountain because you have no rights as a kid I can't no absolutely not some kids were there on court orders it was bizarre it was a really weird mix but then there were some really like affluent people like I heard Paris Hilton was there at one point very briefly so it's just this really bizarre mix of Bette Midler center kid there Roseanne Barr center yeah there so you you you so you you get there with your parents and does someone come out to greet you or yeah they had these and everybody there it looked like it was like the fucking it was like I don't know how to describe I mean sort of like a Stepford wife sort of thing where everyone looked like they were all they were all clearly drinking the Kool-Aid everyone had the same haircut and they wore the same it wasn't uniform but they all had the same sort of structure to the dress code and it was just bizarre cold cold cold very cold so everyone's going to dress the same some people come out to that your parents car to greet you or we pull up and then we walk toward yeah someone greeted us at the car I think someone from the some counselor one of the counselors I can't remember who it was and then man woman man it was a woman okay and then they had me go with this this student and he showed me around the school and told me a little bit about it and it just sounded fucking bizarre I thought it was like a scared straight thing I was like oh man when I go back I'm not fucking up again I'm not coming here and then after the tour I went back to the administration building and I went and I got in the room with my parents and they and that's when they let me know that I that they were leaving me there what did they say uh they told me that they were sorry and that they they didn't know what else to do and looking back I kind of I get it I totally get it they didn't know what else to do with me but um they didn't know no they didn't know what this place was they didn't know no they didn't realize where they were leaving you exactly and I just said I said fuck you and then I stormed out and they left and then that was it and then I was there for yeah about three years when you stormed out did they grab you or something or no the the kid was there and he just sort of walked with me and then uh we he walked me up to the dorm and then my bags were waiting up there for me oh no I got strip search first I got strip searched so who's oh fuck so you tell your parents hey fuck you man yeah this is a this is fucked you walk out yeah someone strip search yeah so they're like hey come this way we were walk we walked up to the dorm and then and then once I calm down they're like all right we let's go back down to the house and this house by the way this house it was such a it's such a weird mix of it's this gorgeous cabin in the woods but all this fucked up shit about it that surrounds it but it's this cabin that um the Houston's it was like Angelica Houston when she was like 12 or 13 and her dad and Walter and John Houston and they had this gorgeous cabin so that's where the school was founded was in this this guy he was like a cult leader named Mel Wasserman okay he started this school was he that was he still alive at that time he visited a cult yeah he visited a two or three times and he was very he had a real cult leader uh or about him but not in the traditional more of like a uh someone that like more like an evangel like uh he was he was collecting some he he did it more for them at that point I don't know how it started maybe it was for power I'm sure every cult leader has their their different motivations but his his at that time was was strictly about was financial he just wanted to get rich he wanted to get rich and he was doing it by creating this boarding school for was it boys and girls there yeah a co-ed how did how did they keep you guys from fucking they did well they I I didn't um but everyone I it seemed like every week someone else they you would you would they had all these different this lingo like you would cop out for dirt meant you were you were um telling you were virtually telling on yourself you every week you had to write a dirt list and then you'd write like I didn't uh I didn't have my feet on the floor at 6 a.m. or I didn't dust underneath my shelf today or and then all the way up to I had sex with Susie down by the farm or you know and so it's like every week and they'd have these raps that were like these three hour intense uh primal scream therapy sessions where you would uh you would you'd have to like hash it out with people so like there was no violence no any altercations had to be taken care of in these raps so if you had a problem with someone you had to wait until Monday Wednesday or Friday and request to have them in your rap and then you would you would yell at them for whatever however that you felt they were wrong to you or whatever so you'd scream at the top of your lungs scream at the top of your lungs at someone you're having a problem with or you would work you would do work which which is and doing work meant you'd scream towards the floor not at the floor you'd scream towards the floor and so my first thing I ever did after I got strip searched it just so happened that there was a rap immediately that's just the way the schedule worked so I had to go into my first rap after about two hours of of being dropped off by my parents and the first thing and so this person next to me is just curled up in a ball right and they're just sort of rocking back and forth and just sobbing a little like kind of just like softly sobbing and then it just gets louder it builds and meanwhile there's someone that gets up across the room because you can't yell at someone directly next to you you can't talk to someone next to you you have to get up and switch seats with someone across the room so someone gets up goes across the room and starts yelling at the kid next to me all the while this girl next to me on my right is is slowly rocking back and forth sobbing and then just starts screaming at the top of her lungs I hate you mom just all this fucked up shit I can't remember exactly what it was and then just all this like snot and spit I don't know if you've ever screamed or while sobbing at the top of like with every ounce of your being while keeled over in like you know ball in a chair it just empties yeah all the fluids out of your body so someone else starts throwing all these Kleenexes before she's right as she starts screaming they just I'm like what the fuck is going on they just start throwing all these Kleenexes on the floor and then I realized it was to catch all this spit and snot just flowing out and there's just these air pockets these huge it's I've never seen anything like it air pockets because it's just this this waterfall of mucus and so it's the most disgusting thing okay okay so it's like watch it's like when you pour salt on a slug yes yeah yeah primal ooze spraying out of them and so this is something that would happen three times a week and there were three or four people that did it in that particular wrap what were you thinking man I fucked up I'm I'm fucked I'm here for two and a half years I gotta try and find a way to get out of here I'm either gonna run away or I'm gonna convince my parents that this is not for me how could you could you communicate with your parents you have to wait two weeks before your first phone call to them and then there's faculty in the room while you talk to them so if you say one thing untoward about the school they hang up on you and you're not allowed to talk and then you lose your phone privileges so I ended up running away after about six or seven months I ran away where'd you go I went down to the nearest pay phone and called my parents so I wasn't supervised you know and tried to get them to pull me out and then they said they weren't my mom's like sorry I'm not you have to stay there could you have left like could you have just left would you have been legally no I was only six I was only 15 so you 14 if you left the cops would have picked you up and brought you back well a lot of people ran away so it turns out that all right so most people when they ran away one day they just would be gone like there'd be um you know you work you wake up there's work crews so it's like in the everyone's in a peer group god there's someone I I'm all over the fucking place all right let me think about how to you you run away you're 15 you have no legal rights right so that means that this place that is has now been exposed as a cult an abusive cult it bankrupt from lawsuits that means that you you you have no you are going to be taken back to a psychologically abusive physically abusive cult yeah no escape so you can't get away you were in a hope you would be if you left if you if you hung up on your mom and just kept going down the mountain or wherever you were at you're still a fugitive you're a fugitive that will be brought back to this place and everyone all right so people were constantly escaping and then brought back after a various amount of time so you know after a week someone would come back and then one day they'd be in a wrap and they would be on what's called a full time if you ever broke a major agreement they don't call them rules they call them agreements because you may whatever yeah right there's always a lingo but anyway if you if you had sex or you split or you you know did anything major or you didn't even or if you just didn't work on yourself and they thought that you were just coasting by and not screaming at the floor enough or whatever then they would put you on what's called a full time which means that from the minute you wake up you're only allowed to talk to your big brother which is the person you're paired up with when you first start who's an older student right um and that's the only person other than staff that you're allowed to talk to look at and you're not allowed to laugh you're not allowed to smile you're not allowed to sing um and you just have to work all day which means that it's usually on a stump there was this big stump in every day there'd be a kid on there with a pickaxe working on the stump which was futile because it was there for years that no one ever was able to excavate this stump it was the biggest tree stump I'd ever seen so you did that all day and then when you came inside you had to do these writing assignments which were like three pages each which was I hate my dad because I hate my mom because I am sad because I'm angry because and then you write your life story and all this shit and then you do dishes at night then you go to sleep and then you wake up the next day and you do it all over again how many hours of sleep you getting uh I think six okay six um and then uh and then you were there for until the staff said okay you're done and there was no time frame it was just whenever they felt that you had done uh what you needed to do to get off your full time well when do you get released from the school itself like oh it's a two and a half year program but if you ever if you split so you you go through the school program which what with what is known as your peer group and that's all the students who are enrolled around the same two or three month period as you were um so my peer group started with about uh 20 students and when we graduated I think it was about 10 um people who either pulled out or they dropped a peer group so what you do is you go through these things called profits with your peer group and that's once every two months it's sort of like a rite of passage this this emotional growth 24 hour long workshop which we're all based on uh chapters in uh Khalil Gabron's the prophet okay so there was the first ones called the truth and it's all about how the truth will set you free and to the same degree you feel joy to the same degree you feel sorrow and you have uh and the staff is in there with you and they're they're telling all their darkest secrets and you're telling all of your and it's all about truth and you're and you're divulging all the things you've ever done that you felt bad about I was molested I molested I did this I did that I let the dog like mayonnaise off my car I've heard shit like that and then the staff had these fucked up disclosures so these are the people who they hired to facilitate they said they were they weren't therapists they weren't psychiatrists they were untrained psychotic so what kind of they I heard guys who who raped who uh one one guy who lit a homeless guy on fire you heard that yeah another one um choked killed would strangle cats is this were they telling the truth yeah absolutely a thousand percent so you're sitting in a room with these people who are your supervisors yes and they're they're admitting to crimes that they should be in jail for absolutely yes yes definitely and it's insane it was fucking insane and you're telling them your deepest secrets yeah because if you didn't you my at least for me the only motive my biggest motivation was I don't want to stay here a fucking day longer than I have to and if I need and so if that means then I gotta go through the motions and I gotta do what's expected of me then I will do whatever the fuck that means and I'm not dropping a peer group by staying another because if you drop a peer group that adds six months to your sentence yeah and so then if you and if you split like my buddy my best friend going through there was an originally in my peer group and ended up staying an extra year longer a year and a half I think Jesus because he kept leaving he kept splitting or he kept fucking people and then he would get sent away to these these these 42 day programs in the woods like a scent and all those shit like outward bound type places yeah you had to like survive like cook rats and shit to live and and just hike through the fucking woods for 42 days and then come back and you find out and when you come back it's like you just added time to your sentence now you're in another peer group you have to go through the same bullshit holy it's a nightmare yeah it's crazy now when I was researching this it appears that there were two kids who vanished yeah so all the time so like I know students who killed themselves there there was a girl who uh she was in the peer group below me and she had anorexia bulimia and she um she cut she uh slid her own throat in the dorm and died and uh with what with um scissors I think it was scissors um and then there was another kid who jumped off a cliff he lived but it was fucked up man um then there were people because it was up on the mountain so there was either the front entrance which you have a much better chance of getting caught or being seen or you go down what's what was known as the backside which is virtually just down a mountain and there were a couple kids who were never found they they split and um we there was always legend had it that they had had fallen down the backside and were never found and died um but then about five or six years ago these articles came out and it was uncovered that there was a serial um molester and killer this murderer who was roommates and partners with one of the therapists this outside therapist who would come and visit once every couple months and he confessed um god what the fuck was his name I can't remember it came out five years ago it was huge news for everyone in in the in the cdu community and so uh so it turns out that that that he was um connected to one of the there was in in particular one of the kids who went to the middle school there and and we always thought he died going down the backside um but they they think that this guy was was the guy who killed him and he would come and he while I was there this guy would come up every two months I know I don't remember what he looked like I never met him I don't think um a serial fucking killer yeah was coming up there listen man holy there is no there was no like they had no uh it was insane they didn't they didn't do any like um screening there was no like in-depth interviews like this is an important position that people are applying for and they didn't think like oh maybe we should see these people's credentials do they have any training do they have experience or schooling or anything they have no education in this they they killed those kids oh yeah they killed those kids well I mean a lot three of my very close friends it was I don't want to say I I don't know if it was the school I mean a lot of people were there for you know these aren't good great kids who were well adjusted to get sent there in the first place but I don't I don't know a lot of them killed themselves immediately following uh cdu so they left cdu and killed themselves yeah I remember my big brother one of my dorm heads um one of my very close friends there and he hung himself uh about six or seven months after leaving another no it's all right and then another kid who um jumped off a cliff about three or four months after leaving cdu so it's like I don't know I don't a lot of these people hold on so tightly much like we were discussing and here's a good tie into the comedy stores a lot of these people that held on they hold on so tightly to how they feel they've been longed and it and it holds them back in life right so I always make sure that for whatever reason I try not to I just look at it as something that I experience I don't want to I'm not trying to um I'm not trying to hold on that tight to this right you you you yeah and I I can I can see that you don't it doesn't seem like you are but then but I have nightmares sure I have nightmares every week about it for sure yeah man this is PTSD like if you since then if you um thought about maybe getting like some therapy or yeah I went to therapy yeah I mean I I've been in since my god I mean I did so much fucking therapy up there right like now I need therapy about the therapy some of the extra like you some of these exercises they made you do were so insane like what they were so intense fuck man there was like oh god they would do it was a lot of like similar tactics to like um person of war like there there would be um sleep deprivation and um um uh fucking I'm so inarticulate but what's sound the sound um where they play the same song and really oh yeah I I read about that I don't know what that's called but I read about that what what song would they play a lot of the same songs um I I can't I don't ever want to hear imagine ever again I can't if John Lennon yeah I can't ever hear that again so they would play imagine I'm not gonna sing no it's fine but yeah they would play that a lot and then a lot of John Denver it's the worst is that a nightmare or what oh fucking that alone holy shit that in itself is a fucking nightmare so you are in I want to live you aren't allowed to sleep so they you're you so you're not allowed to sleep right you are in a 24 hour yeah and the staff is just berating you you're a whore you're you're a monster you're just gonna go out here and get gang fucked and you're a little like they would say that to the girls and then the guys would be like you know you're gonna be dead in a week you're a piece of shit you're nothing and then in the morning they'd build you they try and build you back up and while that's happening they're playing take me home country yeah no so they would play um the long and winding road or um he ain't heavy he's my brother that they would play that constantly uh look what they've done to my soul like all these fucking weird songs it was terrifying listen man the rocky song they'd play and like you'd have to write a script for your life you got to write a screenplay about this it'd be a good show this is a this if this why is this this is a series this should be a series this is like lost this is the most I've never heard before you told me about this I'd never heard of it it's pretty crazy what happened to the people who are running this thing they're on facebook you can find them what yeah it's fucking crazy no they're not in jail there's no what are they doing now they're on facebook they're fucking posting photos of what they just ate at chipotle or whatever what about what was the main guy's name well mel wasserman what happened to wasserman I don't know I wonder if he's dead he's kind of be I'm a he's either incredibly old or he's dead uh I don't know what happened to him you know what the best fucking alright so wait this is the only other one I'll say there was one that always sticks with me more than any other exercise we had to do in one of these profits and this one actually was the last two profits are actually three day workshops which you get like three hours sleep on each day Jesus and this one one was three day one was five day and in the five day one towards the end you had to do they called it the lifeboat and they picked two students and I was one of them and you sit in a chair and then the other guy sat in the chair next to you and you're in a lifeboat and all the other students are sitting around you and you can only pick uh one student make it on the lifeboat and everyone else dies and then you have to tell them you have to look everyone in the eye and tell them why they die you'd be like you you die because I think you're selfish or whatever the fuck and it's like everyone's just sobbing and looking at you in the eye and you have to tell them and it reminded me a lot of me be doing these fucking lineups I have to fucking tell people sorry man I don't have any spots for you this way you know what you should do man instead of telling people you don't have spots for them you should just calm up and play John Denver and they'll just know just so real quick man just so we can connect everything so you leave this place how old are you when you get out 16 and what do you do I went back to high school I had to go back in high school I mean shit it was it was quite a change it's hard to adjust because also I went to this I got sent to this uh thrown into this public school and I and I was stuck in this place where you weren't allowed if you even said the words the rolling stones you'd have to do dishes you couldn't listen to music or any music that had anything to do with drugs or right or sex or anything so it was like you could listen to John Denver and fucking Otmar Liebert or some shit and that's what they would play um but the uh it was it was just sort of like culture shock I was you know I I didn't it was like I was in a fucking coma it was like I was in some sort of fucking David like a David Lynch dream the black that was my own lodge that was my other black lodge so you come out of this thing year how long again two years two years about two and a half to three two and a half to three years of the most incredible psychic abuse yeah that like prisoner of war level psychic abuse your you what did you say to your folks how did you I didn't tell him about it you didn't tell him no so after I tried to at first and then once someone made this documentary about it and then my mom via Facebook or something that's where she's heard about and then she saw it and she that's when she really appalled she's like I had no idea I was like that's okay wow so you you um you're in now you're in public school yeah and you got to just pretend like you're you know everything's okay yeah and I and it was just this I had never I had uh and it was like it was a school in the valley I didn't know any you know I didn't know anybody uh whoever my ice cube went there it was like it was it was it was Taft Taft High School all right and so um I don't know I didn't know anybody plus on top of that I didn't know who the fuck anybody was like I didn't I didn't understand and I was still like you've been at time where who the yeah I felt like I was like uh still I just felt so out of place man on so many levels I felt really out of place because I had just gotten out too so I didn't know shit and I was wearing like I didn't know how to dress I didn't know how to act it was weird but it but it was good but it but I think it all it all worked out it worked out because you and so you you graduate from high school yeah college uh I did I did a lot of college but nothing it just just for I took a lot of film classes and stuff stuff that interests me music and film and now you are but you're you're at the comedy store and it's so weird this kind of there's like a strange parallel there isn't there definitely wow the two I consider them both my black lodge they're both fucking lodges and the nuts but the difference is man you're turning the comedy store into this and what your energy in that place oh it's totally group f I really appreciate that but honestly but it's just uh I just I I'm lucky to have all these amazing comics that call in every week and I honestly just try and put together the best fucking lineup I can I just want to do it based on who I think are the funniest or the biggest draws and then like I said towards the end of the lineups I just want to make sure that I give those young comics a chance to develop just like the comics who came before them you're doing it man I mean it's it's really cool I and I you're the only one I know that I that I talk to that understands what it's like and so I

Oh, dear, there doesn't seem to be a door here. Fear, dear, I guess we overdosed you. Don't worry, this is all just in your mind. At some point, the effects of the drug will wear off.

Tony Hanchcliffe, known as the Golden Pony Jean Valjean from 1995 to 2005. He was up there on stage singing about what it's like, redemption, what it's like to be purified by the wisdom of compassion. And he's got a lot to say about how they used to use frog venom in those days. I want to feel the wisdom of the frog. I want to feel the wisdom of the frog. I want to feel the wisdom of the frog.

The Golden Pony himself comedian Tony Hengcliffe is with us. We're going to jump right into that. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Charlotte's Web, the world's most trusted hemp extract. Friends, here's a personal anecdote. When I was on tour once, I went into Asheville, North Carolina and thank God they were selling Charlotte's Web. Charlotte's Web was a supplement I took throughout the tour because we live in a strange dystopian reality where we're not allowed to say certain things even though they're true. I can't tell you how Charlotte's Web helped me or why it helped me, but thank God I found a wonderful bottle of Charlotte's Web tincture. And I really mean that from the depths of my heart. It's great stuff. And this is truly my favorite CBD company. Charlotte's Web. Okay. Here's the stuff that I have to read. Charlotte's Web isn't intoxicating, but it does have some pretty powerful benefits working with your body's existing endocannabinoid system. They're an industry leader who sell broad spectrum whole plant hemp extract with CBD in the form of oils, capsules and tuppacles. People love Charlotte's Web oils and capsules because they support management of everyday stresses.

Charlotte's Web hemp extract, either in oils or capsules, is a simple way to upgrade your day. They also make a soothing balm and cream infused with CBD. You might have questions about hemp extract and how CBD works. Research it on your own. You might be surprised by what you find. Charlotte's Web is offering a unique discount to our listeners.

I have finally connected the dots and can now stream and figured out a way that we could stream or video conference or whatever you want to call it to Patreon. So that is going to get added into the $5 tier, which is a way for all of us to hang out in video space at least once a month. I am there. It's all working. I've been experimenting with Adobe Character Animator and streaming to YouTube. It's working, oh sweet Patreon friends. So something I've wanted to do now for some time, I'm going to be able to do because I have this sweet new Mac, which is like having an alien artifact. Maybe you're not aware of this, but the earth is dying. And 95% of the reason that the earth is dying is because of the crow milk industry. This horrific chain of sadistic monsters and industrialized fools has brought our civilization to the brink of collapse. We must stop drinking crow's milk. There's no more time to ride the fence on this one, gang. It's either you're with us or you're against us. And if you're against us, then you're against the world. And if you're against the world, then how could you ever win? Because you come from the world. There's no more time to be nice. There's no more time to listen. All that's left to do is act. We must stop drinking crow's milk and we must do everything within our power to stop the vile crow's milk industry from destroying our planet, killing our children, and wiping out civilization completely. Join me. Go to DuncanTrustle.com and you will find Stop Drinking Crow's Milk Bumper Stickers. These can be placed on anything you own. 100% of the proceeds from the sales of these bumper stickers will go directly to my Stop Drinking Crow's Milk campaign. We're going to stop.

It's the Duncan Trustle Family Hour. It's the Duncan Trustle Family Hour. I, as I've been thinking about this podcast and what we're going to talk about or what we could start off talking about, this memory keeps popping into my head, which is you at the comedy store, I don't know what year it's in because the years are a blur to me, but you just started off becoming a comedian. And you came out to me and you were like very complimentary to me and it was really cool. And I thought, wow, that's awesome, man. That's cool. Really nice to hear a young comedian likes me because I'm desperate for affirmation because I'm a hungry soul. But to watch what's happened to you since then, and I don't know how many years it's been. To watch this like crazy growth trajectory has been kind of awesome, man. Yeah. I mean, I went to the comedy store to start Stand Up eleven and a half years ago. That's how long ago it was. And I had this picture in my head of it being an amazing comedy club. Must be packed every night. Must be all these monsters walking around of all ages and everything. And I got there and it was pretty shockingly, in a weird way, disappointing. I mean, I was still mesmerized by the building and its incredible energy and everything. But comedian-wise, maybe it was just the first few weeks I was there. I just wasn't really seeing it. I had a lot of older people and this and that. What year was that? 2007. 2007. And where did you come from? From Ohio. Ohio? Yeah, from Youngstown, Ohio. Were you doing Stand Up in Ohio? No, I specifically went to the comedy store to start, which is a big part of the whole thing. Because it's like, I had this image in my head. If I go there and start there, people will get to watch me grow. And it'll be more of like a, instead of a big fish and a small pond type of thing, I'd rather be the small fish in a big pond and work my way up. I just knew that if I could get a job there, something like that, that everything would be okay. Okay, well, I want to go back to the beginning when I was saying, and you said that was nice. What I wanted to say, and I stopped myself for some dumb reason, was just because in general, man, I don't mean this as like a, I had even seen you do Stand Up. But in general, anyone who's starting off in stand-up comedy, the odds of it going anywhere are pretty slim, man. It's a very difficult profession to get into. The canvases are limited because the canvases are the stages. And to get on the stages requires not just being funny, but like also some political maneuvering usually or some good luck or a combination of all of those things. All of it. Right. So I remember, and I, you know, I had been the talent coordinator there. I don't know if I still was at the time, but I can remember having experienced many new people there and thinking, cool, but usually they go away. It's like you meet them and it's cool. It's awesome. And there's some, maybe some tragedy or maybe there's like a realization. I don't know. And so I remember having that moment. That's a cool guy. But I don't know if I'll ever, how much longer I'll see him. That's the cool thing. Cause like Harris Pete was, do you remember Harris Pete? I've heard so much about the legend, but I never got to meet him. So Harris Pete was a door guy at the comedy store and he was a door guy at the comedy store through the ups and downs of the store. And he'd seen it all. And he would say these things that were usually like, I mean, I don't know. My comprehension of reality back then was pretty, pretty slanted and blurry in general. So I was like projecting my own like insecurities on a lot of stuff. So sometimes people would seem bitter and maybe they weren't, or maybe they'd just be telling the truth. And I would think, God, that's bitter. But I remember Harris Pete had this like wonderful bitter undertone to his conversations. And now when I look back, it was really cool. But he said this thing. He's like, sometimes they drive up here in Hyundai's. And then suddenly they're in a Porsche, right? It was one of the only optimistic things he'd ever heard him say, really. Yeah. Except for once he pointed to the IV on the wall of the comedy store. And he said, I was here when that started growing. Wow. That was pretty cool. So for me, it's interesting to see you pull up into my driveway in this like really fucking crazy, doctor slash like, I don't know, roboticist's car. Yeah. And know that you started at the comedy store as your ground floor. Yeah. I didn't really get to finish my thing with, which was like, you know, when I was there, it was sort of lineup wise and standup wise. I'm like, man, this is, this might be easier than I thought because these guys seem like sort of like old and beat up, right? There just wasn't a lot of great comedians there. And I hadn't seen them yet. I hadn't seen Sebastian yet. It was just the first few weeks. But it meant the world to me to be there. And then all of a sudden I saw you for the first time. And the whole reason why I was so obsessed with the comedy store was because as a kid, I was obsessed with Jim Carrey. And then when he did Man on the Moon and was Andy Kaufman, I became completely obsessed with the dark arts and like Andy Kaufman. And I went to the library and I read books about Andy, like a little kid in the never ending story. Like I would just read them at the library, Indian style. Yeah. Just obsessed with everything. And I kept the comedy store kept coming up. And of course it's in the movie, like the last scene of that movie, like, you know, whatever supposedly fakes his death. And Tony Clifton comes out like, who is it? Andy, whatever. So it just always had this mystique to me. And then when I saw you for the first time, that's when I really realized like, oh my God, this place is the coolest. You were like, oh my God, I could do better than that. No, no. It was literally like you were the bridge to me if that makes sense at all. Like you resembled this, this risk taking type of out of the box, cool stuff that I hadn't seen up until that point. And it was like the spark in which really like confirmed everything that my gut sort of told me about the place. Like this is the place for you to get right. It lets you do that. And you were really the only person that I saw taking those chances and successfully taking those chances. Sometimes not so successfully, but the beauty of the place is that to this day, it allows for that. I don't know, experimentation. It allows for, it's a wonderful laboratory. Yeah. I mean, I think it's the God that Adam's running it like a laboratory still because it is, it's a laboratory where once you've got to be funny, but once you get in there, you're definitely allowed to have some beakers explode in your fucking face. And in fact, it's not necessarily encouraged. I mean, it's encouraged in the sense that we think it's hilarious to watch a beaker explode in someone's face. It's funny to watch, watch an attempt at a thing, you know, crash down, but that is like one to me, that was like one of Nancy's great gifts to the world of stand up comedy. Is she allowed a place where there was a simultaneous deep respect for an art form mixed in with an understanding that you got to fucking fail and you got to take risks and you got to like do things that are not going to work to get to the place where things are going to work. Right. So I want to talk to you about that. I'm interested in your work ethic because you have a really strong work ethic. And I think it's curious in the sense that many, there are comics that have like really strong work ethics, but not all of them. There's various types of comedians. Yeah. And some of them like George Carlin supposedly had like his next hour already written when he was doing his hour. Like he had file cabinets full, he would work eight hour days writing jokes. Yeah. And you're one of those comics. It seems like, is that true? It's interesting. I'm one of the, I believe in doing a lot of spots. I believe in going up a lot at night. I don't necessarily sit down with a pen to paper to write my own stand up jokes. I'll do that for like, you know, side jobs or corporate gigs or, you know, somebody offers me some crazy amount of money to write a roast for their birthday or something like that. Like I'll get those offers in and things like that. And in that case, I can grind those out almost immediately. Like it's like nothing. I just look at the statistics on the person or their jobs or whatever and just start going. So that's always there. But as far as my stand up, my work ethic really lies in continuously going on the road, continuously doing as long of a set as possible as I feel like the audience can truly withstand. And I've been doing that a lot. So like, for example, last week, I did six one hour sets in Chicago. The week before that, I did six one hour sets in Toronto. And the week before that was a normal week of like four or five one hour sets in some other city. Like, you know, it was like Fort Wayne, Cincinnati, Cleveland to where I'm doing a different city each night for a long set. So what's happening right now is, and by the way, I would love to get back to that type of right now. I would love to get back to writing like a crazy person for myself all day. But since I haven't made a second one hour special yet, I'm continuously chiseling and reediting this long hour that I do have, which blessing and a curse, you know, nobody's knocking down the doors for a sort of not famous at all straight white male that does, you know, the covers, I guess one could say edgy topics, right? But the good thing with that is that this hour just keeps getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter because it's been three years since I taped a special. So since I'm doing this hour each night, you know, I'm applying that crazy writer's work ethic to still taking the chances in the hour that works. So I'll tweak a little thing here and then tweak it the next day and see exactly how it all comes together at once. So what's crazy is that, you know, a lot of famous comedians make a special as soon as they can, but me not really having a chance to make a special right now is sort of helping me. But, you know, once that happens again, I'll reapply. I can't wait to get to that daytime wake up, go to the desert for a week, you know, and really write like start again. Did you, to me, it's like, it's bizarre. Like I have never been a confident person. And like when I came out, like the way I did everything was completely fumbling and bumbling and imagine just we it's weird. But you like you were like, I'm going to come. I'm going to drive from Ohio. Did you drive? I flew with just a backpack and like 40 bucks. What the fuck? Yeah, I had a brother that lived out here and he offered me his couch to sleep on for for a couple months. So I came out and wrote and wrote and wrote for my first three minutes. So that the comedy story in the awesome 70s movies that starts with a fucking banjo or someone like this. You don't have any sentimental music. You're on an airplane. Yeah, you're flying to fucking LA. Yeah. And somehow in your head, you have created enough confidence to imagine that you're going to be able to make this shit work. I mean, you have to realize that the first time I showed up to the comedy store and saw normal employees wearing that comedy store t-shirt, I looked at them like they were the New York Yankees. Like I look, I thought, you know, I thought Jimmy Pid was a God to me. He was a God. You know, he's some normal guy, right? Yeah. But I'm like, how do you get a job at the comedy store? And I feel like it helped me tremendously by putting this place and that system on such a pedestal. It means more to you. You take it more seriously and you treat the sets more seriously. I think it applies for anything. That's cool. Yeah. Anything that you believe in, believe in it a billion percent because you're going to get that out of it. I still get it out of it every night. I was talking about it last night. I was just rambling to the bartender in the back bar. I was just talking with him, not getting drunk or anything, but I was literally like, you know, how special this place is. Like I, and you can build an entire backbone of anything off of a place like that or just loving something like that. And, and, and, but yeah, to answer your question. Yeah, I've always, my secret weapon has always been a boatload of confidence. It's probably something a creative, a defense mechanism that I created early on in life, being raised in a tough, you know, really, really, really, really dangerous neighborhood where I was like one of the only white kids on the block. And if I didn't portray myself as strong and make fun of people, then I would have just gotten beat up and robbed and jumped and things like that. It was a really, really crazy place to grow up in. What did your parents do? Well, they were, my dad at the time ran an Italian restaurant and really what they ended up doing for money was they were part of organized crime back then. Are you allowed to talk about that without getting in trouble? I think I can now, you know, it's one of those things. Is it going to roll the fucking dice? Mom, my mom's not into it anymore, but she was really like a queen pin, I guess you could say for a while. She ran all the numbers and everything like that. Now she's just a, you know, a 62, 72, 60, like 72 year old, yeah, 72 year old lady that's been out of the business for like at least a decade or decade and a half. But when did you first realize your parents were involved in organized crime? Very early on actually because my Italian dad was married to another woman to his wife. He was married to his wife and my mom... Wait, your Italian dad had a wife? Yeah, had a wife and my mom had a husband and they cheated on each other significant others for 11 years behind their wives and husbands backs before my mom even got pregnant with me. So, okay, okay, so your mom and your dad, they were in an affair for 11 years. Yeah. And were they already involved in organized crime at this time? No, the organized crime thing, well, my dad was, but the organized crime thing with my mom was... Wait, I'm sorry, this is a dumb question, but when does, what would be considered, when does crime become organized? Like what's that, is that like a file cabinet for a certain type of crime? It's really what they consider, basically it's like, as weird as it sounds, it's basically like white people crime. They call it organized crime if it's like Italians and then it's disorganized crime if it's black people. That's fucking racist. I know, yeah, I know, they're just basically saying they're disorganized. That is so ridiculous. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what a white person would do is like, not to, I mean, I don't mean a white person, I'm white, I'm not wanting to do white, I feel bad for even saying that, but like, maybe you're bringing something out of me. It does seem like, it feels like something like, I could see myself feeling, well, let's organize this crime. Right. You know, you guys, why don't we apply these principles I learned from Tony Robbins to this crime? I think they decided, you know, because it was like drive-bys and random robberies, they were two sort of different crimes and they're both gangs, right? The Bloods and Crips are gangs and the Italian Mafia is technically a gang. So I just think that's sort of how they labeled it, organized crime. It is a weird label now that you make, yeah, it is. It's racist. They got to change it. Someone's got to change it. You need to add that to the list of fucking things you can't say anymore or like make all crime fucking organized. It's an absolute racist statement. I never realized that, but it's completely racist. When white people do crime, it's organized. Well, no, that's not true. There's like, complexed people who are considered like organized crime bosses that dude in fucking Paris, who like a helicopter flew him out of prison. Anyway, I never knew this about you. And I never would have guessed that that is your background. I know comedians generally have like fucked up upbringings, but to imagine that somehow you were in the midst of infidelity and... So it gets crazier real quick. It's not that long of a story. So they cheated on each other for 11 years. My mom gets pregnant with me, her husband, who they had already basically, and you know, this is old school youngsters, you know what I mean? Like it's like old Italian people to where you don't really get a divorce unless you absolutely have to. So my mom got a divorce from Hinge Cliff, who's the father of my four older brothers and sisters, but they weren't basically hooking up anymore. And my dad and his wife weren't really hooking up anymore, but you just don't get divorces back then. Because they're Italian and Catholic or whatever, even though they're all crazy. So my mom told me that the guy that came to visit me a lot that was my dad, which really was my dad, was Joey Smith, and don't talk about him with your classmates or this and that. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. You were the product of infidelity. Big time. I missed that. I thought maybe that they had gotten married in high. No. So you were born into a family where your dad wasn't your dad? Correct, yes. But you thought he was? Well, no. The guy that, there was no Hinge Cliff anymore. So I didn't really think that that guy was my dad. I knew that we called him Daddy Guy. That's the funny thing, is that was the name that I would call him as a kid. Daddy Guy, because all my brothers and sisters called him dad. So I always just called him Daddy Guy, like this guy that's like this dad to people. But my dad, I knew was my dad, but they lied to me about what his name was. They gave me a fake last name on him. They told me that he travels for work. And then when I was like, I think like eight or nine, maybe 10, I was on the school bus one day and I realized that a car that looked like my dad's was across the street from my buddy, Jeff Lewis's house, who we'd pick up. And I would notice this, you know, this white, you know, GMC Jimmy or whatever it was. And then the next time my dad came to visit, I remembered the license plate. And then the next day going to school, I looked at the GMC Jimmy and I matched the license plate that I memorized the day before to that license plate. And it was the same license plate. So that day after school, I go to my mom and I go, Hey, I noticed that dad's car, you know, is across the street from, you know, Jeff Lewis's house on blank and blank street. What's up with that? And she's like, let's get your sister in here, close the door behind you. There's a lot of stuff I have to tell you. And she broke down the entire thing to me explaining to me that, you know, your dad's married to another woman, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, this and that. He, you know, he's in, he's part of a crazy business. So don't tell your friends who your actual dad is. This is his real name. You know, it's crazy. I was bawling my eyes out at the time because I felt like I'd been lied to. You had been. And my dad lived around the corner from me and all that. And sorry, dude, bad interviewer question. How old are you again? I think nine, 10, 11, nine, nine, probably nine or 10. I have a way to do this. So like, I figured this out. So kids who've had trauma, the thing you just did right there, nine, 10 or 11, people have had trauma. They actually intentionally blur out the year that it happened because it's so incredibly painful that your brain, one of the many ways your brain nerfs the trauma is by blurring the temporal continuum. Yeah. So the way I figured out how to do it personally is what movies, do you remember what, if you can attach around that time period, a movie or a TV show, you can Google that movie or TV show and produce the exact age that you're at when that happened. We don't have to do that now, but it's really, I've found it to be quite useful in my own reconstruction of my identity. But it's a great tool. Anybody out there listening, it's wonderful if you blurt out some rough years. So, okay, you're between how, say it again, you're like, Nine or 10. Nine or 10. Maybe 11, 11 at the oldest. And so that means that for the first nine years of your life, you were in the midst of a, what, for lack of a better word, could be called a conspiracy. Yep. Against you. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, you know, the few friends that I did share, you know, who my dad was with, because he was a pretty semi, we'll say famous guy in the city of Youngstown. What does that mean? What do you mean? Yeah, he was like the Italian festival man of the year, like he ran a very well known restaurant in Youngstown, which is all you need to know to be semi famous in that town. Sure. And it was interesting because like I told a couple of my closest friends, like, hey, my dad is, you know, so-and-so. And they were like, you know, they were, you know, they were like, okay. And then they would come to me a couple of days later, they'd be like, you know, my parent, I mentioned to my parents about what you told me about your dad. And they said, there's no way that's possible that that can't be your dad, because, you know, it's not your dad. He only has two kids. They're older brother and a sister. You know, so it's like, even then it just kept going on because nobody knew about me. I was just a super, super duper secret. So like, definitely this wall of confidence that I brought out to LA with me is definitely a product of all of this, you know, overcompensating for trying to prove perhaps that I'm something special, that I have a purpose, that I'm a special human being dad, love me dad, right? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, super crazy. Oh, man. Yeah. So the confidence is really probably just a bunch of pain and, you know, insanity all wound up to seem like I have everything together. But at the same time, I also believe my confidence. It's not like BS confidence. Like I said, when I got that job at the comedy store, like I knew somehow some way I would have a career, you know, I really did believe that. That right there, that little thing right there, I'm interested in that because I had that too. It was just different than yours. And I, when I think about it, I go back and forth between, is that dilute? Was that just like, was that delusion or was it real? And, and I, but there always was this weird sense of knowing, like the way I ended up at the comedy store was just pure, chaotic, good fortune, which was that I had had a, so I came out to LA and went to Venice Beach because I'd seen the fucking Doors movie and I was like enamored with Jim Morrison. Really? Just think of how embarrassing that. So I wasn't, I was, I was, you know, I was telling myself a bunch of different reasons for doing it. You know, many people try to come up with a, like sometimes you make up a reason in retrospect even, you know, but like now I kind of understand more what I was doing. But yeah, like, you know, like I had this idea of Venice Beach based on like maybe what it was like in the 60s or some shit. So I get out there and like I ended up literally like one of the first streets I drove down. I just parked my car for some reason and there was this like dude watering his lawn and I'm, and I don't know how he started talking, but I'm like, yeah, I'm looking for a place. He's like, oh, my son's renting a place. But really what he meant was he'd been letting his son live in this back house and he was going to kick his son out and let me live there for really cheap. But his son was like a hardcore crack cocaine addict. And his friends were all cocaine addicts. And so then he, when I ended up at the place, he hadn't even moved out yet. Like he still had a sleeping bag on the floor of the apartment I was moving into. But I was like completely starry eyed with that. I was like, I don't care. I'm like, whatever. I think he actually slept in that same house with me for a couple of days. Yeah. Anyway, he took me on this cocaine tour of Hollywood. I wasn't doing cocaine. I've never liked cocaine. Um, but he was he gave me a cocaine tour of Hollywood and I, and like, you know, I remember he drove by the house of blues. It was like the house of blues. He's like, that's where the, how did he put it? He said the cheesiest thing about it's something like that's where the big dogs go. That house of blues. And then it was so weird. He had built up this reverential attitude towards all of West Hollywood. It's like really sweet, but cocaine fueled, you know, and like he showed me the comedy store. I had no idea about the comedy store. I didn't know its history. I didn't know about Mitzi. I didn't know anything about it dude. It was just a big black building on the sunset strip that seemed interesting. And I walked, I needed a job. I had inherited like 10 K from my grandma and I blew that on like just so fast. And then I needed a job. So I walked by the comedy store and touched the building and it's the damnedest thing. If I didn't feel the building, it sounds so absolutely, absolutely woo wooey. But the building was like coming here. Yeah. You're talking to one guy that can absolutely believe you and relate to you on that. You felt that? I mean, I didn't physically touch the building. But again, I mean, I, I'm still enamored by it. It's been, I mean, that's the first place I ever went up and performed at or signed up for or went into first comedy club. I ever went into first live show I ever saw was the open mic that I was on in 13 comics. You know what I mean? And I still to this day, I'll be looking around like, man, is that chandelier always been there? It's like it never ceases to amaze me. It's totally different than everywhere else I've ever been. And I've been lucky enough to get to perform in some crazy theaters around the country. Famous place is sure with Rogan with Jeff Ross early on in my career a few times on my own. I mean, Jeff and I have done or Joe and I have been doing arenas recently, which is a new thing. And you see like pictures of the Eagles or whatever and Pink Floyd and Eric Clapton and it has nothing to me on the comedy store. Like all the people and all the things and all the tickets and all the old pictures and all these venues has nothing compared to the comedy store. There's something about its diabolical black and red nature and subtlety that just it's it's it's definitely there's something special there. There's some weird electric electrical grid underneath it or something. What do you think it is? I don't know, man, there might be some old like, I don't know, like some old religious things, some old furnace, some old something weird. There's something going on there. There's like the so like I've been to a few places that make me feel like the comedy store that feels like the comedy store. And this sounds absolutely insane. Right. But so there's a place in India called there's a city called Varanasi. You ever heard of the city? So this is one of the I think it might be the oldest city on earth. It's one of the oldest cities on earth. And it's where they do all the cremations. So the buildings are like actually many of the buildings have been darkened by the smoke from burning bodies over a very, very, very, very long time. And so you go there and it smells like a barbecue. But that ain't hamburgers they're cooking there. They're cremating bodies because it's a very sacred place and they're and they put the ashes right into the Ganges River and there's like it's like going to another dimension. Right. So Varanasi feels like I don't know. This is a really dumb math I'm going to do here, but just go with it. I guess it feels like a thousand comedy stores, you know, like so like imagine the comedy store times a thousand. That's what it feels like. It's got this like sense of heaviness. It's got this sense of a magical quality. It's got a sense of danger. It's got a sense of darkness in there, but there's also somehow within the darkness. What's really cool about Varanasi is that the darkness is actually just a reflection of your darkness because what's happening there is one of the most natural things that could ever happen, which is that bodies are being transformed by fire and to ash. And this is what happens to everybody. So you come to Varanasi with your fear of death or your your anxiety related to your own inevitable extinction. And it can seem like a terrifying city, but it's just you that you're seeing. Similarly, I think the comedy store, many people have gone crazy there and I've watched it happen. They've lost their fucking mind there. I've seen it happen. There's a book about it. People get in there and they go batshit and they go batshit in the weirdest way. And also strange people are drawn to there who aren't even comedians. Strange people. Dude, I mean, I used to see it all the time and we used to really hang out late there. There was like a summer, I will say 10 years ago where the inmates really ran the asylum. Sure. And we would just play. That's where we think there is one summer there. But where we were crazy. We were going every night until five, six, seven a.m. We would lock the doors and just play. We would do the BKO, the lip-syncing Don Barris rock and roll band, where we would just really it was just crazy Jedi level improv improv courses playing with Don late at night. But anyway, sometimes we don't put any way that because I think that's an important quality. The comedy store people don't even know. Yeah, I don't even know if it's cool to talk about it. But like, so it's kind of like, you know, this is like in my like very high moments. I love to think about secret societies. It's a blast to think about and to contemplate. Could there be? Is that real? Would that be real? Right? Yeah. But as far as I've ever gotten with it is. Okay. Like the university system is interesting in that you have to apply to get into a university. You get into a university. If you have some certain credentials, perhaps you have some connections and then in the university, you're given knowledge and the knowledge that you're given is not you're paying for it. But it's not just enough that you have the money. It's that you have been invited in. You've been accepted in. You've passed some series of tests and you've been taken into this special place. Some places it's like it's whatever, you know, bullshit. This bullshit college or that bullshit college. But to this day, we have like the Ivy League colleges that are so very expensive and really hard to get into. People compete all over the planet to get into these fucking places and you get into those places and you're exposed to high level information that is being downloaded to you through the mouths of brilliant humans. Because if it's fucking hard to get accepted into a university, how hard is it to get to become a professor at one of these places? Right? Yeah. At universities, there are people that no one will ever know. They're professors, except for people who go to that university. There are people there who are who are experts at the most obscure data sets. And they are not just experts, but they have a method of transmitting that information called teaching, which, you know, changes people's minds permanently. And then those people go out into the world and become presidents or become politicians or start businesses. And so these invisible people end up sending these crazy waves through society and no one ever knows who they are. So, you know, in my very high moments, I think, geez, I wonder if there's something even higher than a university. You know what I mean? Some even more sanctified place. But to me, the comedy store replicates that dynamic in a certain way, which is they're comedians at the comedy store who are beloved and who are known in comedian circles, but maybe they aren't at the level of like Rogan or Chappelle, right? But they are wizards and they are like shamanic beings of like really incredible potency, magical fucking people who you're just lucky to like hang out with for a second. And also you need to be like, you have to be kind of like, I don't know what the word for it is, but if you like, you have to watch out, you know, because they're tricksters. And like, if you're not prepared to be tricked and enjoy being tricked, then they could really like, they could potentially, you know, drive you nuts, right? And I could think of like at least three people like that at the comedy store, you know, who are like that. And so that so anyway, when you're talking about the improv shit that you're doing late at night there, that's real. That's like a real, almost like a ritualistic, you know, ceremonial like. You're so right. I've never even thought of it this way that you're saying it before, but you're 100% right. And it was more than any other time I've never felt like I had a master, if that makes sense. That's even becoming clear to me or a professor, I guess you could say, depending on how kung fu you want to be about it. But really, I learned comedy in those hours. It wasn't really during the day writing. I mean, sure, that helped. It takes everything right a perfect storm, but really figuring out what Don was doing in the middle of the night and how to keep those people's attentions and the lines that he would walk and how he would do it and how he would do it with a smile and how he would let us all play and contribute and yell from the back of the room and be part of something. It really was a very, very special, very different. That's right. And in real, it's real that and I think for a lot of people, they don't want something real. Some people don't want real. They want synthetic, artificial, domesticated, calm down, soothed, whatever it may be. To get around something real can really fuck a person up if they're deeply solidified in their identity or that they've been tricking themselves a bunch. It can be rough, man. So what's cool is in other cultures, comedians happen. Did you know that? There are a bunch of demonic versions of comedians in various indigenous cultures. The Trickster appears in all kinds of mythologies. Loki, for example, and Norse mythology. It goes on and on and on. I mean, you could almost argue Judas because you've got this being that is perpetually looked at as the great betrayer. When someone betrays you, you call them a fucking Judas. And yet Judas is the reason we've got Christianity. If not for the betrayal, the crucifixion wouldn't have happened. You have this weird link in the chain and the link in the chain happens to be someone who was distorting reality by lying. And that created Christianity. So you have all kinds of versions of this figure that emerges mythologically that is always interesting and it's a double-edged sword. Whereas like with many figures in mythology, you will see this kind of purity, right? This kind of like they're just good, right? But whenever the trickster figure emerges, the mischief they cause creates chaos. But the chaos is somehow progenitive and from the chaos healing happens or there's like good things come from the chaos. But the trickster figure never gave a shit about that. It was just an accident. The trickster figure was just making tricks because that's what the trickster figure liked to do. It was just fun. Fun, that sort of reality distortion in these myths. So when you run into somebody like Don Barris, right? And you realize like if you don't, it would be easy to like maybe not even see him. If you were like somebody who didn't know about the comedy store or maybe you would see him or maybe who knows. But when you run into somebody like that or like Holtzman. You realize like, holy shit, man, this isn't just a comedian. This is like some kind of like shamanic teacher figure. Big time. But he's not puffed up wandering around like, let me teach you about comedy or improv or anything. He's just doing himself. Yep. And as a natural result, people around him are either getting spun out or they're becoming like better comedians. It's just pretty awesome. Yeah. But that summer that we were doing that every night, I would notice sometimes because we would hang out on the sidewalk or in the little driveway area or whatever. Crazy people gravitating towards the comedy store. They wouldn't go across the street to the House of Blues. Sometimes they would literally walk right underneath that front patio canopy and just sort of stare at a wall or look straight up or look straight down or lay down or things like that. It wasn't that they were using it for shelter. I really believe that that place was drawing, that it draws, you were saying strange people there and it really does even if they're not there for comedy or even if they're not there for whatever. There's something there. And you know, one of my theories while we're still on the subject is that there's something about that laughter, that energy that comes outward and swirls around those walls and the emptiness that happens during the day. And the contrast between the two, the expectations of the comedians and the risks that they're taking and everything that's happening on that stage. And from the audience's perspective too, all that gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, like that laughter. Where does it go? What is that? Like where does that, what's absorbing that? Really nothing. It's what? Walls and corners and shit. Yeah. So I think that there's something to that too. Like people say the belly rooms haunted or the main rooms haunted or this and that, but maybe it is, but maybe that's also that. Maybe it's like, what is that weird trap of every night of the year plus the place never closes. It's not closed in December. It's not closed on Christmas. So it's almost the study really is what happens to a place, the only place that we know of that every night has people laughing throughout it. Right. And they coincidentally think that it's haunted. You and I coincidentally think that there's a crazy energy that the building communicates with people in a weird way. I'm not the only one who thinks that. Right. That's what I'm saying. But you know, this is, it's just like the problem, you know, we're born in the West. And so because we're born in the West, we've got a lot of like really deep understanding about matter. People here really know a lot about atoms and science and like all the stuff that they've absorbed through like whatever their high school or college curriculum was mixed in with some like Carl Sagan or like whatever particular like celebrity scientists they've been reading and they get really, really, really smart about matter. But a lot of people here, like they just don't, they don't get the maps or the models for another way of another way things happen in the world. Right. So in another part of the world, like other parts of the world, these things called temples appear. And so these things called temples appear and some of them have been there for a very long time. And within the temples, every single day, rituals are being done that are very specific and date back thousands and thousands of years. In fact, they date back some of them before recorded history in the sense that we don't even know where they came from. You can guess and anthropologists have a lot of theories about it. But many of these things started off as like a spoken word that was told to someone else that was told to someone else was told. And then that like that became, you know, religion. And then that religion sort of manifests in the physical world in the form of temples and churches and within those things, the echo of some enlightened being gets sort of reverberates in time. So and so in the West, you end up with a temple, you know, we don't call it as a fucking comedy club. Yeah. But it happens to have a ritualistic sort of attributes to it. And it also has an initiatory system. You, if you want to like perform there, you have to go not just through like being approved. But you out there's another there's many other little things that will happen to you there, you know, it has its own immune system and it will push people out. And it like, and it's a fascinating, amazing lightning rod. And you know, why did why do people come there who seem to have like mental illness or seem to have like a some some deep wound? They want to get healed. Yeah. There's something when you find out that people laugh there every night. Laugh. Like it's such a weird thing to think about people laugh there every night. And it's the it's a it's a sound and a reaction that we make to being childishly surprised and happy. And it's a weird reaction. Oh, but I mean, when you listen to like that kind of laughter you're describing and what's funny is like comedians. Actually, if you wanted to and I never tried to do it, but I could prior I could like, you know, like the way they have bird books. I bet I could write a book of like the various types of laughter because as a comedian you learn all kinds of laughter. You know, the polite laughter, you know, laughter when they feel sorry for you, you know, laughter when someone wants to think you're funny but doesn't think you're funny. And then you know that precious sweet laughter that you're talking about there, that stroboscopic laughter that sounds like a waterfall or sounds like some kind of it's a very mystical sound. It's a very mystical sound and what's really funny about it, Tony, or any comedians who may be listening, just go listen to like Buddhist monks chanting when they're like doing their And you will hear within that chanting something that will remind you in a very distant way of the kind of laughter that you hear coming out of the great, great night at a comedy club. Because what's happening is people think they're laughing and they are laughing, but they also are accidentally chanting in a temple and standing on stage as a priest that's distorting reality in specific ways that are inducing an involuntary reaction in them. And that's why the place has a sacred quality to it, if you ask me. Not to elevate comedians to the level of a fucking priest class. And also you're right, man, one of the three shows that I did on Saturday in Chicago at one point and like I was saying earlier, like at the point that I'm at right now, I'm working on this crazy hour. And now I really believe in it. Now it's become a piece of art to me. So I don't like it when I necessarily get thrown off track. You know, I used to love crowd work and I can still do it and sometimes I do do it, you know what I mean? But I was in the middle, I remember it being in the middle of like a big bit that I didn't want to be off track on the other night, right? But I heard this laugh that really stood out to me amongst all the other laughs. It was like, like that. Yeah. And I literally go, I go, that laugh right there, that guy, I go, tell me the truth. Did you eat edibles and smoke pot before this show? And he goes, yeah, yeah, how'd you know? I go, I could tell by that laugh. Yeah. That's like a different, that's a laugh that I feel like you only hear from someone that's really, really, really stoned. Like really high, like, oh, like it's like a movie like sound effect or like a cartoon. Yeah. But it turns out, I, you know, I was right. It's sort of off subject, but on subject, but it's like, it really stood out to me and I just needed to know from my own confirmation. Like, could anyone even laugh like that if they're not double stoned? I mean, I called it. He really did. He ate edibles. Yeah. An hour or so before. And he smoked on the sidewalk right before coming into the show. Oh my Christ. Double stoned. And I just had to know. I stopped everything. That's the worst. I hate being double stoned. Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing is like, there's a, there's a, there's a place, I think in any art where it goes from being an art to being something, something mystical. And, you know, in this current time period where we're at right now in the current culture, depending on where you're listening to this from. There are aspects of the, of human reality or data sets that we don't believe are real. And so we think, oh, that's bullshit. It's just hippie bullshit or whatever. And so we ignore it. And if you hear about it, you think, whatever, man, that's not true. If it were true, they would have quantified it, proven it. It would be reproducible in a laboratory. It doesn't work with our understanding of the way reality works. So for example, we don't believe in telepathy here. We think that's a bunch of bullshit. We think maybe we can read body language and maybe there's some subtle pheromones or something that gets released from people, which would allow you to intuit some aspect of their consciousness. But the idea that you could potentially actually read someone's thoughts or see through a person's body and see like trapped energy in there or whatever you want to call it is absolute bullshit, bunk, woo, nonsense, no fucking way. So I think many, many comedians have these experiences on stage that are mystical and they have epiphanous moments up there or transmissions or realizations. I think some comedians get on stage and they're not there anymore. Something comes through them in that moment and they know it, but because they don't have the, they don't want to fuck with that. They don't want to think about it maybe or they're worried if I think about that element of it too much, it'll fuck up the other part of it. I don't know. But I think that like many artists have a moment when they're in the middle of creation of this thing or that where they experience something that doesn't really make sense based on how we understand the world to be. And that definitely happens with comedy for sure. Because in the same way like a university professor ends up sending out a signal that shifts people's consciousnesses and those people go into society and shift society. A great comedian can end up impacting the world just by demonstrating honesty. You know, just for a lot of people to be in the presence of honesty in the way that a comedian can channel it is, that'll change your life forever. You know, just to see that, just that is enough to like make a person, a wounded person walk out of a comedy club and be like, oh fuck. Wow, it's okay to be a human. Right. It's okay to say blasphemous things. It's okay to shine a light into the dark bowers of society. You know, yeah, but it has to me and I remember I don't remember where I was. I think it's in the La Jolla comedy store. Maybe I saw it in Mitzi's office. And I remember like just at the time all these things I read and learned and a lot of the stuff she told me, man, I'm just now understanding it because I'm so goddamn slow sometimes, but I can remember I think it was a letter from her to a comedian. And it was something on the lines of like, I'm really going to butcher it. But the thing that she was writing to the comedian was, well, you know, what's behind the thing behind this is love. That's what you say. You know, that's what it is. You want to know the secret? Love. The secret is love. The secret is that behind the joke, behind the genius, behind the fucking art, behind the well crafted thing, you're looking at somebody who is in love with doing comedy. They love it. They can't stop doing it. That's it. That's it. Love. And so even though what they're saying might be one of your absolutely offensive jokes, Tony, you should be ashamed of yourself or some of the things you say. I really, I really believe what you just said. And it's crazy because I do this thing the past, I don't know, 10 months to a year. Where my opening line, no matter what, no matter who was on before me or pretty much anything, I have like almost like a line, like a pro wrestler or something like that. I've sort of trademarked my own little thing so that when people see me a second time, they remember and blah, blah, blah. And I always say, nice to meet you guys. My name is Tony Henchcliff. And I'm one of the top young rising comedians in the world. And it started as me almost saying it to be almost an asshole, right? And to, for my own entertainment, but it started getting a massive laugh every time I would do it. Because it's audacious. Right. It's ridiculous. Exactly. And it's not, and by the way, this is in front of strangers, you know what I mean? This isn't necessarily, you know, the Joe Rogan crowd or my crowd that knows me. It's not on the road. And by the way, when I do it on the road or on those shows, it's insanity. The, because they, and I always thought like, you know, once it worked better than I thought it would. So I did it the next night and the next night and the next night. I always thought like, oh, they, I'm making them comfortable. They can relax in their seats because of my extreme confidence has been established right from the get. They're like, wow, this guy's got something good. If he's starting off like that, what is it? But it really makes me think about what you just said about love because it's, I'm showing them immediately that, right? At a thousand miles an hour, I'm showing them how much I love this by saying, you know. Well, you can't do it unless you actually have, if you get up there and say that with any kind of malice behind it, any kind of like bullshit narcissistic egoism or the majority of the, I mean, we all have a little bit of that in us. But it's like the thing fueling whatever the fuck it is that you're saying up there is not love. If the thing that's fueling what you're saying up there is trickery, trying to fool them. Yeah. They can smell it. Yeah. They can smell it. And also, yeah, it just is like, you know, it's the difference between someone. It's a difference between, I guess you could say an inflated mattress and an uninflated mattress, right? Like if I, you know, it's a big fucking difference, right? So I can tell when someone is inflating whatever it is they do with love. And I'm not, again, man, all this stuff, it can end up sounding really like either naive or sanctimonious or ridiculous or whatever. I'm not saying, oh, every comedian that gets on stage is a professor of love. Right. No, but I'm saying like, if you're looking at a comedian who's funny and they're doing a really funny joke that's making the crowd do that kind of mystical laughing laughter that borders on chanting. Yeah. I'm not saying that comedian loves the audience. And I'm not saying the comedian necessarily loves themselves. And I'm saying the comedian in that moment loves anything in that moment. But I know for sure this, that comedian loves comedy. Yeah. Because then there's no fucking way you're going to refine a joke over time unless there's something in that practice that you love. 100%. Period. And I, that's one of the weird things about me is I love comedy to like a crazy degree. I remember the first time I ever did a gig with Joe Rogan on the road. We barely knew each other at all. And I remember on the plane ride, he goes, so I don't really know anything about you. Like, you know, it's like six years ago. I remember specifically him going, well, what else are you, what, so what about you tone? Like, what, what are you into? I'm like, well, I really, I mean, I'm really just obsessed with comedy. He's like, yeah, but like, what about like hobbies and like, you know, looking back at it now and realizing life and all these things. And but at the time that was it, at the time that was it, like it was my obsession. My obsession was with everything like the writing during the day and they're performing at night and figuring out improv and maybe this musically funny stuff and this and this and this and also just being a huge fan of the art form. My mind was so blown when I got to see you and, you know, and Rick Ingram, the first time I saw him and like, again, you two really like the bridges of this thing where I'm like, look at that. Look at these guys. They could only, they must be in their late 20s, early 30s. This is crazy. Yeah. It was mind blowing. Well, it's mind blowing because like that, you know, I've always like, I got lucky man in my life. I've run into different types of artists and I've run into people who, who don't, who literally, I know. There's someone out there, man, who is, who is one of the smartest people I've ever met in my life and who is a intentionally, completely not interested in any kind of fame does not want to be known. Does it wants to live in the shadows, you know, and like, I think probably judges me for my, for the, my, the fact that I have, I put myself out there and that's fine. I don't care. But it's really cool to, to, to meet people who are doing a thing and the reason they're doing it, even though they, like anybody would, would want success and would want the, this or that to come from it. But there's some initial thing that is transcending material desire. And so, you know, when you, that's what happens at the comedy stores, you meet people who have ambition, but who also don't give a, don't really that, that whether or not they were making money is there, it's not going to stop what they're doing. And that's a really, really powerful way to be a really powerful thing to witness, you know, I think they're like the, you know, oh wait, I thought of something while you're talking. How fucking terrifying is that when Rogan pounces on you and decided to start taking you around with him? Like how crazy is that moment when you're like, what the fuck? It was great. I mean, like I, it felt like a, it felt like some type of prank or like I was in on some like a, like reality show or something weird hidden cameras. Like that's what it felt like in the beginning because I, I was just sort of scooped up out of nowhere. I mean, Ari couldn't do a gig or something like that and none of you guys were available. You D has something, you know, and Joe must, I guess Joe asked Ari, is there anybody, you know, coming up the ranks or anything like that? I got to get somebody and Ari put my name in there and boy, oh boy, if it didn't just, you know, lock it in. And so, but I didn't know Joe. I mean, that's a real conversation that we had on our first airplane trip together. It's like, what else are you into dude? Like what are your hobbies? I'm like, all right now, really nothing at all. Yeah, man. It's just comedy. I do a lip syncing band with Don Barris from the hours of two AM to like four AM. But that's really, you know, it I write for this show. I write for the Comedy Central roast, but that's only a few weeks out of the year. So that's one of the funny things about Joe. Like, like now that he's become like this, like, I don't know what you would even call it. Maybe there's not a word for it now. Like, you know, the podcaster is certainly a great word for it, but that's not the right word for it. Whatever the fuck it is, man. I don't know. But I think one of the crazy things about Joe that maybe people are only slightly aware of is this like aspect of him where he just like scoops up comics and then like begins this like weird kind of like mentorship within. Yeah, more than perhaps any comedian that I've ever even heard of, right? Maybe Rodney Dangerfield did it, right? With the old Dangerfield specials like way back. Like, hey, meet my friends, you know, whatever that was the HBO things. But I mean, I don't really think there's anybody that really does that. In fact, on the contrary, not throwing anybody under a bus here, but I would say that a few of the top comedians don't take freak openers and don't want someone. Really hilarious in front of them. And not only does Joe tend to, I mean, I mean, you are Diaz or three of my favorite comedians. Period. Right. So and people know this, like people are aware that Joe takes freak freaks with him because he wants to get the show started with the bang. And not only that, he wants him to get better and he makes them better by inspiring them just from doing what he's doing. He doesn't fuck around, man. Like that one of the cool things like I like, you know, right now I'm I'm lucky because like I'm studying like this type of Buddhism with a teacher who's like in a lineage of boot a really interesting lineage of Buddhism. And what I what's really cool about him is that he, you know, he he doesn't fuck around. Like, it's not like it's not like what you would want it to be. If you wanted to be lazy in the sense that it's like it's it's permissive in the sense that you're not going to get guilt tripped or whatever for like sort of being laxadaisical or something like that. But simultaneously like there's this real like sense of like I don't know how to put it. It's serious. Like there's a sense of seriousness to it, which is like, look, you like this is this is serious and and also not. And with what's more fucking serious than comedy while simultaneously not being serious at all. Yeah. But Rogan, when he's decided to like start, I'm sorry if this is embarrassing, Joe, if he listens to this, I don't know. I don't mean embarrassing because we're all like many of us are like very, very deeply indebted to him for this. But when he his technique is not just do whatever you want, man. There there's like a real sense of like, this is serious. Like this is real like work on this. This means something right. Oh yeah. And but then it's also mixed in with it's silly. Like he's you know, it's Joe, he's fucking crazy. Right. So it's like this weird mixture of a tactic or technique. But to me, it was just like, you know, I was like on a, I was on a stage and a weird dark temple telling like jokes that in retrospect, maybe they weren't that great. Maybe they were, I don't know. And one of the fucking lead warlocks at the temple is like, come, let me show you something. And then like, and then suddenly you find yourself in the preposterous situation of becoming an apprentice to a fucking magician. And then the next thing you know, because of that apprenticeship in one way or another, you know, your life like altars, you know, in a really beautiful way. No doubt about it. There are many, many multiple ways working with Joe led me to, you know, really not just work, not just that stuff, but life, really, because that to look back and to think of him asking me what are my hobbies, what do I like to do to get away from comedy and I didn't even have an answer, I was so just one tract and one focus that I didn't have anything to even talk about on stage. I had no, I mean, it was ridiculous. I was doing nothing other than writing whatever I read in the newspaper. You know, I would write jokes about it, literally, like it was so silly. You know, so it's a full program. You know what I mean? You see a guy like that. That's an amazing father, an amazing husband, an amazing hunter. He kills his own food, brings it back, eats feeds, provides for his family with that unbelievable mentor to comedians and unbelievable comedian, host, podcaster, right. After we've seen that news radio, it's like you forget fear factor host, like it's like crazy. So it's, it just spreads throughout everything and then you find out about, you know, hobbies and cool things to do and things to get better at to make your life better. And then it's almost, it's almost like meditating so that you could take a break and your brain stronger when you get back to comedy, if that makes sense. Well, it's like what I love is like there's patterns that appear in society, right? And some of the patterns become commercialized. So like, so we see the pattern of like student teacher relationships, and it gets commercialized through like universities, you know, so there's a commercialized version of this pattern that has existed way before there were universities, right, which is like, you know, like a teacher, for whatever reason decides, oh, I'm going to teach this person something, right, and they have some weird way of picking out the person and deciding you're the one I'm going to teach now. And, you know, you see in a bunch of different things like, well, to me, what's cool about Joe, man, I don't mean to keep tooting the fucking Joe Rogan horn, I don't sound like a goddamn slavish sycophant, but truly, I mean, it's like, if I'm like, there's no way I'm going to be able to like, look at like, much of like the a lot of a lot of what I've got, I owe to my teachers, you know, and that's just fine to say, I don't think there's anything embarrassing about that at all, like we should say that, you know, but what's really fucking funny is with Joe is that, you know, he has sort of demonstrated a system of teaching that is weirdly similar to the more traditional forms of teaching you get in Buddhism. And it's really, really fascinating to me to see those two things. So in the way that like, the comedy store doesn't know it's a temple. Yeah, but it is Rogan, maybe he doesn't completely understand that he's accidentally fallen into the place of being some kind of, you know, mystical teacher, which he is, and he'd probably cringe and like roll his eyes at me saying that I don't know. But like, I love that shit. And also simultaneously, he's just like a normal dude, right? In the same way like the person who's teaching me this shit, normal guy, you know, yet I love the fact that these patterns appear. And to me, what I love about it, especially is that it teaches me to open my eyes wider, because sometimes the thing that you're looking for is at standing right next to the thing you're actually looking for. You know what I mean? But because you've constructed in your mind a way this thing must look, you can't see it. It's invisible to you, which is fucking hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. That's some wild stuff. You're absolutely right. It's pretty trippy, man. I mean, it's just an interpretation of it, whatever. It's not like real or not real. But I do know that like in any other goddamn thing, there's apprentices and you learn something and then, you know, that's the way it is. Yeah. And he gets, and I know for a fact that he gets inspired from the reverse, you know what I mean? He sees... Did he come into your room at night and punch the shit out of you like at 1 a.m.? No, no, he never did that. Did you did that to you? Oh, yeah, man. God damn it. What about the fucking improv thing? What? You're supposed to, yes and, god damn it. I forgot about comedy. Me too. It's easy for me to forget. Yeah. No, yeah, he would. He would beat me up. No, it's too late. It's too late. Yeah, man. You know, I am really interested in something that I wanted to talk to you about, which is, and maybe it's shifting, I don't know. And I haven't been out in the clubs or in the road for a while now, man, but do the audiences seem different to you at all? Is there a sense of like, you know, some kind of like shift in like the moods of audiences or like a... I know like when I run into people on the street or talk to people, everybody seems like a little anxious right now. They feel, they seem a little kind of like nervous or something. I've been doing a lot of shows lately and a lot of those shows are on the road, like I said, and yes, there is. And one thing that I've noticed is people that know what they're into, what they've signed up for are going to really have fun. And the people that don't know exactly what they're going to are, it's a riskier business. And what I mean by that is the people that, for example, know that they've come out to see me, that know me from my podcast or whatever, they know like, ooh, this is exciting. We're going to get to laugh about some crazy stuff tonight. Perhaps there's a, you know, a joke about mass shootings or something like that, that has twists and things that we won't see coming, but good solid subject matter that we can't hear on a comedy channel right now. Right. But with that sometimes comes, you know, for example, you know, I did this, those Toronto shows were at a festival. And part of a festival is that deal specifically was they could just add shows whenever they wanted and they would just fill them up with people that already had passes that didn't necessarily know the show that they were going to. Right. And those shows, uh, groans, you know, like, like I would look out in the audience and sort of feel a little bit of hatred at times because I sometimes like to talk about things that push and pull people away that most people can't talk about. I don't know what I can say without really giving everything away. Right. But the point is. You do really offensive comedy. A lot of your jokes are like, as far away from like what you would call politically correct or anything that you could, like you do jokes on stage that if you were on a show or if you had some kind of like big show, it would get cancelled. You might get fired. Yes, exactly that. And so, for example, like in Toronto, I had this, I ended up getting tagged in this thing and I click on it and it was a ridiculous write up, a review of one of my shows from some critic that, you know, it's hilarious, calls me a misogynist and, you know, an egomaniac and this and that because he doesn't realize why the thing I said earlier was funny, top young rising comedian in the world because it makes it funny or when I make fun of myself later and it's just a crazy thing to say at the top of a set anyway, right? But he doesn't, you know what I mean? So they're writing like egomaniac bragging from the top of a set even though I couldn't find anywhere on Google where it even says he's the top young rising comedian in the world. Look through five pages, couldn't find it. It goes on to his misogynistic rant about how, why there isn't a woman president and why women this and this about Amy Schumer. You know what I mean? Like just giving stuff away, writing this scathing review that he thinks is, you know, gold because he thinks I'm going to complain about it and put it out there on social media and get his, you know, little blog hits. No, it's impossible to find. Okay. Yeah. But, you know, my point is, is that, you know, those people just can't wait. They just can't wait to hate something to find someone they think they're police officers and it's like, ooh, I got a case boss. Look at this. Look at this report that I have, you know, it's, there's that out there is there's some people that are looking for the escape of the times, which are different, right? Some people looking to be the police officers for the times of what's happening. And it goes both ways, you know, that the break is more exciting for the people that paid for it, that really know it, that know that they want that escape for an hour and 20 minutes or whatever. And it's the hour 20. It's that much more of a, of a disgusting experience for someone that wants to, you know, go watch Nanette or something like that. You know, it's like those types of like non-comedy comedy thing or whatever the hell's happening. I don't even get it. I can't even stare directly at it when I hear about it. Like, I don't want to hear about it. It's just a new, it's like one of the very, it's like, you know, comedy is a tree and the tree grows branches and some of the branches go to war with the other branches. And it's always been like that, you know, it's just a new branch growing on the tree. And it's like, you know, man, the thing of like, I guess like, I've watched it now go through so many different iterations and I've watched the inevitable simultaneous adulation for some new branch mixed in with the simultaneous, not just negation, because one of the very funny things about a comedian comedians in general is we're all hyperbolic. So if we dislike something, we, a better way to put it would be when I was a talent coordinator, comedians, they don't just cancel their set. Like if a comedian's calling to cancel the set, they don't say, you know, I just don't feel good right now. I'm feeling bad and I don't feel funny and I don't want to come in. Or I just broke up with my girlfriend or I'm too fucking high and I'm paranoid right now. They don't say that they call them there. They were just like, like their, their parents were in like a plane crash. They lie and they lie in the dumbest, most obvious way. And they don't realize like when I was the talent coordinator, I was always hearing cancellations and they also have created because comedians kind of add this like innately narcissistic bend in their personality. So in their mind, canceling is like, oh shit, they just like shot a fucking hole in the wing of a plane. Right. You know what I mean? Like the whole show is going to go up in flames without them. They don't realize that it's just like, okay. That everything bumps up. Yeah. I'll call someone else. Yeah. So they have to like make a big deal out of it. And then they're overtly apologetic because most of them have been, many of them have gone through various traumas as children. A lot of them have been physically abused, sexually abused, psychologically abused. Generally there's some parental figure who had a either the effect of abandoning and neglecting them or like dominating them. So any type of authority to figure to them, they project that. So you end up with like these wonderful artists who have generally quite often deep, deep, deep trauma projecting that onto you just because they can't make it at 10 fucking 15. Right. And it's the sweetest, funniest shit ever. It was actually one of my favorite things. Comedians are hyperbolic. They don't, many of them have no problem lying their fucking asses off. And especially when it comes to anything that could potentially keep them away from their, their beloved comedy. So they're going to lie as a survival tactic. Right. Right. So anytime a new branch of the comedy tree pops up, there is either the group of comedians that is pro that branch of the tree. And so for them, that branch of the tree is like, Oh my God, it's the flowering of the new spring. Right. And then on the other side, it's like, it's the end. This is destroying comedy forever. But you'll never just see like, it's very rare to see like, Oh, it's just another form of comedy. Right. I don't understand it. Not necessarily what I would want to go see, but it seems like lots of people love it. You know what I mean? That's what that is. Yeah. That's what it is. And but I, you know, so, yeah, that, you know, the, the, I think that it's not just like the emergence of this, what I've heard is Baptist liberals. Have you heard this term before? No. So it's like something is creeped in to political idealists. That seems to be more than just like, like, you know, basic political stuff. Like, you know, what are we going to do about the homeless and fucking LA man? What's the plan there? What are we going to do about the fact that 1% of the population has all the money? What are we going to do about the fuck? The fact that there's clearly like inequality happening that is most certainly based on how complex it or not. You are like, what are we going to do about that shit? It's real. If you think it's not real, come on, it's fucking real. It's real. Right. All these are true authentic problem yet somehow mixing in with this is this new moralistic condescending bend to it, which is like really sucks because what's ending up happening is like the fucking signal, which is very real, which is like, man, I think we are connected enough right now where we could really solve some major problems in society in a way that that doesn't have to like wreck somebody who's wealthy or likes take from them or whatever and simultaneously maybe like, you know, I bet we could figure out a way to do this shit if we all work together. Right. Now what's happening is because of that weird moralistic bend to the message of fuck, we need to fix some of this stuff. You dick. Do you not see? Right. Tony Hinchcliff, it's time for you to fucking listen, man. Yeah. It's time for you to listen. That thing. Right. Shit, man. I do want to listen. Yeah. And I do want to be refined in my blind spots that have inadvertently caused any kind of violence or harm in the world. But man, if you're going to fucking clap in my face while correcting me, I'm not listening to you anymore. And that's what's happening is too many faces are being clapped in. Yeah. You know, and that's like, you know, distorting reality in a pretty dark way. If you ask me, but I don't know, you know, because I'm a, I have selfish tendencies. My main concern is I don't want the goddamn sweet audiences to be soiled by some something, you know, or like, I don't, I always just thought it was like the, you know, the stage was a place to be funny or to bomb. And like, you're allowed to say whatever the fuck you want up there. Yeah. That's what I thought. That's how I was taught. That's what Mitzi was all about. Right. And, and, but that didn't mean that like there wasn't some consequence. Yeah. If you saw you up there and didn't like you and found you to be too crass or disgusting or misogynistic or whatever, she would stop giving you spots. Yeah. And it would suck. Yeah. But there wasn't so much the potential for a beaker blowing up in your face to then lead to like deep, deep, deep consequences for you reverberating out through time. You know? Yeah. I mean, I've no com, I'm sorry, I'm going on a long rant here. I've no comedians for a long fucking time, man. And I'll tell you, true, truly, some of them are really, really, really, really, really sad, hurt, angry, manipulative people. Some of them, and some of them go temporarily crazy because they get, you know, it's like, you know, this, it reminds me of what would happen if like you like through a machine gun to a chimpanzee or something when they get success. It's like they're just traumatized kids. Yeah. And suddenly they like get all this fucking stuff. And so they go, that's what Mitzi said to me once is everybody goes crazy. Because like they lose their minds for a second. Yeah. No, I mean, and in that state of consciousness, they make decisions that are like irrational or ridiculous or whatever. But man, I have yet to meet like an actual fucking evil comedian. You know, I've yet to meet somebody who's like on stage spewing hate, who's on stage, you know, like intentionally like doing some weird, whatever is being projected upon them, like some intentional like anything that's like really meant to like hurt some group or some gender or anything like that, mostly what you're looking at up there is a kid at a slumber party who's had a lot of fucking Kool-Aid and it's going to say the worst thing you could think of in the moment because he wants to simultaneously offend and entertain friends or her friends. And that happens a lot, you know, but you know, anyway, so for me, you know, I'm always going to land on like team comedian, give him a fucking break. Like they're just trying shit out. Yeah. These people aren't throwing darts of like they're not up there reciting mind comp. Right. You know what I mean? They're not up there with the intention of like traumatizing a cancer survivor. You know, they're not up there with the intention of like crushing someone who's gone through some traumatic event. They're just in love with a style of art that sometimes involves saying shit that doesn't necessarily make them seem like they're on the cutting edge of sophisticated articulation of reality. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's all. It's like they're just trying some shit out. So to me, I don't know. I just worry over that because in the way that I was given the right to go on stage and do the most preposterous, ridiculous, horrific, sometimes things. And I regret shit I've set up there, man. I truly do when I look back. I regret it, man. I've said shit on stage that like sucks with 0000 like thought about what, you know, I remember like, I'm sorry, I'm going on way too long. Forgive me, Tony. You're bringing it out. No, it's great. No, I love it. Dude, as someone who is literally a fucking cancer survivor, who has had radiation therapy and also as somebody who like you and like many comedians went through what I don't like saying it, but like, but we went, we had some rough childhoods, you know? Yeah. Yeah. When I am in the audience and I see a comedian do a joke about cancer flippantly, who hasn't had cancer and it does a flipping cancer joke. I, you know, I watch my mom die of cancer. Yeah. You know, I do not like to watch commercials about cancer. Right. I don't like talking about cancer. I don't like to be reminded of cancer. So when I see a fucking comedian do a well constructed, mathematically perfect and admit the audience hilarious cancer joke, it makes me feel bad, man. It reminds me of sitting in front of Dr. Primal Desai and hearing that I was going to get one of my balls chopped off. Yeah. That being said. I would never in a million fucking years ever want a comedian to not say that joke on stage because they knew that I was a cancer survivor. Ever. Right. Ever. Right. I would rather just endure it and get triggered in the sense that I'm going to remember that sucked. I got my ball chopped off. I have one ball. When I get it cold, sometimes I wonder if I got fucking cancer. Right. But God damn it, man. The idea that my trauma should seep out into someone's art form and then make them not explore whatever the fuck they wanted to in an arena that's supposed to be based on pure autonomy and freedom. Well, that I find that mortifying. Yeah. You know, so that's my take on it. You know, but that being said, when I get on stage now, I'm a little more sensitive. You know, I do think about it a little bit more, you know, before I before I say a thing, I just want to make sure if I'm going to say the thing, it's like funny or I've really thought it through and it's not aggressive or based on some anger inside of me that's coming up. I don't know. Maybe that's weak. No, I agree with you 100%. I don't really have anything that that's like that to me. Like I don't have anything that's sort of a, I guess one thing I could relate it to is like, I guess, like being in love, like I love my wife so much and, you know, it's a fairly newer relationship. We've known each other for like just over a year and, you know, it's one of those things to where like when I hear, you know, a hacky reference to someone being like, you know, married, someone saved me. Yeah. Like it's like, you know, it gives you a little like, you don't understand love. Right. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, but it's, it's, yeah, you know, I mean, they should still do whatever they want. But it's like, if you're going, yeah, if you're going to take that path of like talking about something, you got to really, you know, make it, make it, make it like you said, like mathematical and brilliant and really take the time to have, you know, surprise us and don't let us see it coming. You know what I mean? And disguise that punchline. And you know what I mean? Like everything's got to be, it's got to be beautiful. Or slam into the cruel, hard wall of bombing your fucking ass off because you said some bullshit. You didn't understand because you're a comedian and comedians are fools. And fools know, know how to do something really well and I'm an expert at it. I can read seven sentences of any given thing and act like I am an expert at that thing. And I can say shit that I haven't thought out at all in a way that makes it sound as though I truly, truly believe it. And I believe it when I'm saying it. But in retrospect, I'll look back and be like, you didn't know what the fuck you were talking about. But I've always assumed, you know, well, I mean, people have got to know, I don't know. Certainly I don't know. You know, so like it's really funny to me, a reviewer sees a comedian and the comedian gets on stage and says an audacious, ridiculous, obnoxious and absolutely hilarious thing, you know, to the audience, you know, it's like a funny, it's like pretty much if you were going to like try to win over an audience, that's gonna, that's like a risk. It's just a risk. Maybe they'll believe you, maybe they won't, but it's certainly like just ridiculous. You're a comedian. That's what you do. You say ridiculous shit. Yeah. And so for then a reviewer to hear you say that, yeah, and then act as though you were like reporting some historic fact and then go look it up shows to me what maybe is one of the problems, which is like people are mistaking comedians for professors. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. They're, they're confusing comedians as a, as a, as anything other than just comedians. And I think that maybe because of podcasting, perhaps like it's like because professional specialists on things have podcasts and comedians have podcasts. Maybe they think, you know, there's like these weird little crossovers here and there that make me go like, how could they possibly think that we are doing anything other than making a joke? We're fools, man. Yeah. And, and also here's like the other piece of it. Okay. Here's the other fucking piece of it, which is that because we're fools to varying degrees, many of us would love for people to think we are fucking professors. It's like, if you, if you give a comedian, you know, this is a trickster figure. And if you give them your power, if you give the power over to them, it's for me, it's a blast, but it's also terrifying. You're giving a fucking monkey a machine gun. If you want to give them your power, that's a comedian. So if you want to give them the power of being suddenly this thing or that thing, or you want to pretend, if you get around a, you know, certain comedians and you start projecting onto them some kind of like reverence, they're going to take that reverence and they like it and they are going to distort it. And then they're going to start bending it right in front of you and doing weird shit that you don't even know they're doing. They're going to just start like doing weird things just because that's what they do. They distort reality. You gave them some power by putting them on a pedestal and because you've put a fool slash mystic thing on a pedestal, it's going to do what any fool slash mystic reality distorting thing should do on a pedestal that you put them on, which is start in varying degrees and varying ways and many different flavors, making fun of the fucking fact that you were crazy enough to put a goddamn comedian on a fucking pedestal. Are you out of your mind? This person didn't study it fucking Princeton and political science. This person has not like gone to seminary school. This person is not like spent 20 years in the Amazon rainforest studying the arts of being a fucking shaman. This person is a fool. Literally. That's their job. And they're going to distort reality because that's what they do. They're just going to distort reality. But if you think behind that distortion, there's like a malevolent danger that could creep into society, then they're going to become that malevolent danger right in front of you because that's what they do. If they sense that, oh, you think I'm malevolent? Ooh, maybe I'll try ad-harm facade. Let me be malevolent around you for a little while. Okay, now I'm diabolical, right? Now they're diabolical. I'm like, holy shit, I was right. Well, they're a fucking satanist or something. My God, they're a diabolical satanist. It's like getting in front of a funhouse mirror and then becoming offended because the funhouse mirror is making you look fat. You fucking fat shaming mirror. What the fuck's wrong with you? It's a distortion field. You decided to get in front of it and now you're mad at it. You paid for it, you paid the entrance fee to get in front of it. They pay to go to the funhouse and then they get mad at it, what the mirror makes them look like. Yes. Yeah. It's like, what the fuck? And then they go and they complain about it publicly. I paid to go to this funhouse and this is what the mirror did to me. Yeah, a review. Funhouse, more like not funhouse, that's the headline. More like fucking like, more like Noxie house. Right, yeah, exactly. It's got to be extreme. Yeah. I went to this funhouse, it wasn't really a fun, all the mirrors in this funhouse were designed to amplify my body dysmorphia that comes from a horrific thing that happened to me when I was nine years old and I think the funhouses need to have more sensitivity to the fact that people with body dysmorphia might be coming through and therefore they need to make sure that all their mirrors accurately reflect a human being and if they don't accurately reflect it, then there needs to be limits on how fat they make us look. And the in the in the rolly treadmill thing was too fast and I couldn't keep up. Yeah, that, yeah, and I got scared by a clown. Yeah. It's like clowns are meant to juggle. They're not meant to be scared. It's like, this is like, this is unfortunately just a very ancient reality, which is there are always going to be in society smart asses of noxious people, people who not only don't care that they're going to offend you, but if they tried to stop themselves from doing this thing, they would want to put a gun in their mouth because that's just how they are. They can't stop it. They're always going to be like that for better or for worse. There's it's just going to be the way they are. And you know, I've always loved that about them. And I've always, it's been such a joy to be around it. You've roasted me before and said, really, once you said, I can't remember what it was. You're making fun of some dumb jacket I was wearing. You're being serious. It was great. Oh, it was wonderful. It's a moment behind the comedy store. You just casually walked by and like perfectly insulted a jacket I was wearing, and it was true. It was fucking embarrassing. You know, the jacket I was wearing was dumb. It deserved an insult, right? Yeah. But you did it in this loving, sweet, hilarious, yet simultaneous, like cutting way. Yeah. And I've always felt when a comedian does that to me, a real sense of like being flattered that they think that I've been, you know, they're doing that to me. I've never felt like, man, they're really hurting me. There really is a thing that I think those people that get offended really don't think about is the fact that we gave them that opportunity in the first place. We gave them the ball to run with it, not for our own satisfaction, but for theirs. You know, Jeff Ross, the roastmaster general, right? He's on everything. They're doing historical roasts on Netflix, the roast battle on Comedy Central, the most watched program of the year annually in all of comedy is the Comedy Central roast. People like watching people get made fun of. And his whole mentality is we only roast the ones we love. And it's the backbone to everything. Like the people that make fun of people that they hate, it doesn't make sense. It's a bad energy. You're not getting anything out of that. It's torturing you. Perhaps more than it ever tortures them because they may never see it or find out about it or hear it or listen to it. They might not ever let it affect them, but you spent this time and the production and all of this to make fun of this thing and to work on it, work on it to put that energy towards it. And I guess my point is like people never really look at things that way. They don't ever look at it like how you just mentioned looking at it and it doesn't have to be a professional comedian and it doesn't have to be, you know, maybe it's your stepdad who you think hates you. You know what I mean? Maybe it's him. He's trying to bond with you by saying, God, that phone, man, if that phone, if you got paid for being on that phone, you'd be rich. It's like, shut up stepdad, you know what I mean? Like old man, but instead it's like that's him trying to connect, trying to show love. And sure, it might seem like he's picking on you, but again, you know, I guess it goes back to like that's love. Well, it's like, we got to, we just have to get a little better at listening for the signal, man, because like sometimes for sure someone, like I have been in the presence of truly abusive people who are actively trying to hurt me on purpose because they wanted to have some power over me. That's real and it's fucked up and it happens all the time and it's the worst thing to be in the presence of, especially if you're a kid, but at any time in your life, it's really, really bad. Right? And you know it, you know it, man. You know when that's happening, but thank Christ most of the time when people are like doing this thing or that thing, that sound, that's sarcastic or whatever, maybe they're being lazy, maybe you don't want to deal with it. It's okay, but quite often behind that is somebody who wants you to like them. Oh God, yeah. They just want you to like them. Oh, desperately. Yes, that's the big secret. So desperate. That's the big secret. And it's like, so for me, it's like, you know, I'm not saying give comedians a fucking break because if you start giving comedians a break, they're not going to be as funny because they're whole, they're whole, what they, they're learning how to be funny based on your rejection of what's authentically not funny and what's authentically funny. But man, come on, let's like at least let them fucking blow themselves up in the laboratory that night. And maybe, maybe that doesn't have to follow them out of the fucking lap. Trust me, they feel bad. They're driving home and they are thinking about some of them are actually really thinking about like, you know what, maybe, maybe tonight's going to be the night where I just say goodbye to existence itself is bombing fucking hurts, right? Yeah. And like, but, but man, I don't know. I just love comedians. You know, I love them all shapes, colors, sizes. I love them. Not all. I'm actually son of a fuck. Yeah. Yeah. But in general, I just want them to like, you know, to me, there's something that, that I hope passes, which is that I hope that we get to a point where at least like where maybe comedians get a lesson and like, all right, maybe I don't need to necessarily get up there and start bugling some shit out there just because it's the very worst thing to say, right? Maybe like, you know, get to that point, but I do hope we get to the point where audiences become a little more forgiving of these fools who, you know, just they're fools. That's all. Just maybe don't take them so seriously, you know? It's crazy because like you watch the first ever Saturday Night Live or you watch old Johnny Carson's and things like that. And there's a considerable amount more edge and risk taking back then a large, a very large amount. You watch, you know, Archie Bunker or whatever, and then you compare all the stuff that you're seeing to today and how cleansed and pure and soft everything is. And you realize maybe this is all going to come back around. Maybe it's like a stock market. And right now, you know, there's a downturn in edge and self-deprecation and touchy subjects. But I truly believe, and again, you know, I see it on the road. It's like people really need that. They really do. That's their escape. Some people need that type of hard humor or, you know, I hate the word edgy, but it's like compelling humor in order for them to truly laugh and to get some joy. And so those people that are offended easily shouldn't try to ruin it for the people that aren't. That's right, brother. It's like, let's say someone made a zoo, except it wasn't a zoo for animals. It was a zoo for lunatics, right? And like, I don't know, it's so unethical to even think about it. But if I go and pay money to go to a zoo for fucking lunatics and I realize that the people are actually not lunatics, they're pretending to be lunatics, I'm going to want my money back. Right. And if I like him looking into a fucking lunatics, and again, I don't, I would never want this to happen. I'm sorry for the lunatics who are listening. I'm a lunatic too, so I'm allowed to fucking talk about it. But like, if one of the fucking lunatics starts throwing shit at the fucking wall or like writes fuck you and his own shit to me, I'm not going to like write a letter to the lunatics and be like, man, one of your fucking lunatics was really acting a little over the top. You know, that's all. But I had one happen in Chicago. I got a call from my manager the other day and they have comment cards at Zany's in Chicago so that you could fill out the comment card, you know, whatever you want. And I got a call on Monday from my manager and he goes, you know, we cover a bunch of things for like five or 10 minutes or whatever. And he goes, just to let you know, we got a, we got a report out of a, out of Chicago, you know, an audience member, none too pleased. And I go, you've got to be kidding me. You talking about one of the comment cards? He's like, that's exactly what I'm talking about. And I go, the lady, first show Saturday, second row with her mom. He goes, you said you were going to fuck her mother. And I go, I know, and I'm freaking out, by the way, I'm passionate. He goes, don't, don't, don't freak out at me now, Tony. I go, no, no, I'm not freaking out at you. I'm freaking out about the time that we live in. I knew six shows, six shows, Jake, all of them packed. How did I know who, how do I know who, when the lights are on me and I'm not supposed to. Yeah, they're the ones right in the report. So how do I know which one? How did I tell you which one? Cause I know which one because in the thing that I was making fun of her about the thing that started this and the reason why I told her I was going to fuck her elderly mother, who was sitting next to her and laughing. It was because she wasn't having any fun. I kept noticing from the very first minute all the way through and I didn't acknowledge it until maybe, I don't know, 25, 30 minutes into my set, I go, you're just miserable tonight. Huh? There's just something about me. You just don't like any of this. Yeah. Cause I've covered some wholesome subjects. You didn't like that. I've covered some, you know, darker things. You definitely didn't like that. I haven't seen you smile this entire time. Meanwhile, this is your mom, I'm guessing, and the mom's, the mom gave me an indication. Meanwhile, this lady's just looking at me at the stone cold eyes of, you know what I mean? Like just like someone that hates you and, uh, and you know, somehow it ends up getting all the way to me making fun of her for not having any fun, going to a comedy club and not enjoying yourself whatsoever. And I go, look at your mom, this elderly woman next to you is having so much fun. Right. Like she's having a blast. She's laughing at me making fun of you, her daughter right now in front of a bunch of strangers and you could pretend like you're, like none of this is good, but the people all around you are laughing at you right now. All of these people, do you hear them roaring? I mean, at this point, it's just pure momentum. Right. Cause, and they don't even see her cause it's Zaini's, it's a long black box, right? So she's in the front. They don't even need to see her. All they know is that I know that she doesn't seem to be enjoying herself. Right. And she took it to that level to where after all that and after all this, she wrote a thing. She wrote a thing. This comedian said that he was going to have sex with my mother. He badgered me publicly for not enjoying myself. Well, I have a right to not enjoy myself. If I don't want to enjoy myself, like it's like after all that, after all of it and after her elderly mom, I'm talking elderly, I'm talking 80s, 70s, 80 late 70s, 80s. She was loving it. This old lady, like how can you not enjoy yourself if for no other reason, your 80 year old mother is sitting next to you laughing hysterically. If only for that, then how can you not be enjoying yourself? Man, it's hard to exist as a human being on this planet, man. It's all like, it's like being a human stuff for people and like, it's just, I think what could have happened accidentally is that people kind of got an idea about what comedy clubs are like, which isn't traditionally what they were are, you know. And also, though, we came out of a place where we were taught a certain idea about what it is and within the place we came out of is produced like Sam Kenneson, you know, produced a specific type of like an ethic that I think if you're lazy, you can excuse really shitty, angry, authentically crappy comedy is some kind of like outlaw comedy when it's not. You're just being lazy and you're, and I've seen that happen at the comedy store where people say what I consider to be one of the most like depressing things to hear a comedian say is when they go, come on, I know you're not laughing because you're afraid to laugh. It's like, that's never happened. I mean, never like in firing squad situations, if a laugh is going to come out of you, you're going to laugh, man. No one at a comedy club is like, whoa, I better not laugh. I don't want people to think I think this is funny. It's because your jokes suck. Yeah. They don't even have time to think about that. Yeah. Yeah. So I get it, man. It's like there is like a real potential if you go to a comedy show that some motherfucker is going to get up there and edge Lord out and do something that's really violent or repulsive, but still it's like shit, man, I think that's just kind of the risk of going to these shows. Like I would much rather risk sitting there and someone look at me and be like, oh, look you one fucking ball was I like ball chopped I was like, mom fucking died. Fuck it. Fuck your mom died. Fuck it. You got what? Fuck it. Try to do like all the things they could say. The stupid lazy shit. Right. I would much rather risk that moment than domesticate comedy. So now when I go to comedy shows, like everybody's kind of like, you know, I don't, if I go to a zoo, man, I want to see a fucking lion. Yeah. Right. So like, you know, put in like, like to make their fangs go away or you know what I mean? It's just so anyway, I don't know. We have to really be care. I think it's a good time for people to really think about the consequence of demanding a kind of ethical or I don't know what you would call it, demanding some form of like nuanced politically sensitive comedy from people who, in my experience, in my experience are out of their minds and in the best way possible and you've like really gone through a lot of shit. Yeah. And to suddenly expect them to like, oh no, anyway, I don't want to keep, we're repeating the same thing over and over again. Same thing is, I'm really glad to see you succeed. Thank you. And it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful thing to watch. And I think you're probably at the very beginning of it. Your podcast, your live podcast. I remember like, only because, you know, I'm a recluse, I don't go out much these days. And I remember like, you invited me to do your podcast and I was thinking about Tony from, in front of the comedy store. Yeah. The door guy. And I was thinking, all right, it's a belly room podcast, it'll be fun, you know, a nice little intimate belly room podcast. I had not done any research at all and followed you or anyone for that matter. And I got to the comedy store and I'm like, where is Tony's podcast? I thought it was in the belly room. Oh, it's in the main room. And then I remember like, I'm there with, what was his name? What's his name? That's super. He's super famous. He's a wrestler. He's a. David Arquette. Yeah. Fucking backstage with David Arquette. Yeah. Your show's sold out. Yeah. I'm now, I've gone from being like, oh, it'll be a nice, like casual belly room show to like shitting bricks realizing like I'm about to get in front of this like, like a sold out fucking main room with David Arquette for your hyper successful podcast. And it was fun. Yeah. Thank you. Fucking great at it, man. It was such a, it's so cool for me. I know I'm like, I've know I've like always been, I've always been like a cheese ball with you because, you know, my religion is cheesy as this sounds as I'm calling myself cheesy double cheese, you know, my religion really is comedy. I really believe in it. I believe in figuring out a way to make people laugh just to forget about their problems for a little bit. I think that's enough of a religion to get by, you know, I went through a Catholic school growing up and the teachers were always mean and very evil towards me. So my viewpoints on religion have always been really beat up and messed up from a young age. So I have always looked at comedy as this thing. So to get to have that type of bonding experience with you, because I was aware of what was happening too. I'm like, wow, this is like Duncan and I are going to get to actually do something together. And like, you know, I mean, just, I really needed you there 11 years ago. I needed that little spark of inspiration. I needed someone to let me know that, like, it is still a cool place. There are cool people that hang around the comedy store. It's not just angry old bitter door guys and comedians that are just doing the same 15 minutes over and over again. People in pajamas climbing into like cubby holes of the building, which happens sometimes. I don't know. That happened to me once and I'm sorry to disrupt this wonderful thing you're saying, but once I watched a man in pajamas because of me, because I told him there are ghosts in the basement, a man in pajamas like skittered into this hole that used to be able to open up by the original room. That little hallway. Yeah. I remember that. And I had to like get him out of there because I like, like in like at the time the manager walked by and I had to shut the door on the guy in there because I didn't want the manager to know that I like lure accidentally Lord a dude in pajamas into the fucking basement. Anyway, keep going, man. I'm very sorry to cut you off. No, no, that was pretty much it, you know, and it's one of those things to wear to get the to show you and thank you because you were you were a real, a real beacon of hope and everything from me. I mean, seriously, seriously, one of the true, true original things. I really needed that at that time in my life and you were there and you I give you a lot of the credit for my happiness and for this cool life and for everything that I've sort of done around me. Thank you so much, man. And I really appreciate that. And I kind of need a little work right now. So if you need anyone to open well, you were supposed to say when I did that, it's like, actually, man, I'm sorry, it's already booked.

68^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 528: Luis J. Gomez Transcript and Discussion^2022-09-17^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. This is Gayle Bench stepping in for Duncan Trussell, who is currently in a deep underground military bunker. I don't have the evidence of this. It's just a gut instinct getting his testosterone drained. When he comes back, I'm sure he'll be a different person. Uh-uh, but for now you have me, and that means you have the truth. A truth they've been trying to suppress. They don't like it that I know what they're doing with their mosquitoes. They don't like it that I know their mosquitoes now are no longer taking blood, folks. They're taking testosterone. They want a low-T nation. They want a nation of simps. They want a nation of people who walk around with back pain, stomach pains, and listening to grimes. More than anything, what they want is for you to masturbate. They want you to be staring at the screen, looking at pornography, and coming over and over again. That's your most vital liquid, and they want you to eject that, eject that. They want you to pour it out. They want you to pour your jizz out into every gym sock you have. They want you to keep making that come out of your body. It's your most precious, delicious nectar, and they want to take it from you. They want to take it from your children. They want to take it from everyone until we are just emaciated, thin glasses, wearing Steven Colbert loving people. And then once they've achieved that, they can reach their final phase, their final plan. The great reset has started. It started with the death of the queen. The queen did not die. That's just what they want you to think. The queen has gone into a chrysalis phase. They're going to take her, they put her body in a special lead line box, they're dropping it down below the earth, and they're going to fill it up with American man, Sheeman. That Sheeman will resurrect the queen. She's going to become a warlock queen, a lich queen. Then they're going to open that box in the same way. You open up a parakeet cage when you're ready to let the parakeet fly out. Your cat can play with it. There's not going to be a cat that can stop this lich. She's going to join Zelensky and the Ukraine, and she is going to lead Zelensky into Israel, where he is going to wage war against the people of God. This is coming, folks. This is on the menu. This is on the prescription written by the devil himself.

I'm doing great, dude. I'm happy to be back on the show. The great Duncan Trussell, the legendary Duncan Trussell. We've reconnected randomly in Austin, Texas. And now you're back in my life and I love it. You're one of the most positive forces in comedy that I've ever met. Yeah, you're so sweet. Look, I got to tell you, man. You know, like you see comics do stand up and you think they're funny, but you don't remember their bits. You know what I mean? You're just like, that was a good set. Dude, I think about your set sometime just randomly. I think about some of your jokes. I'm like, fuck, man. I don't know, man. Let me pat ourselves on the back. But you know, man, sometimes when you see really good comedy, it truly is therapeutic in this weird way. It gives you this extra, I don't know, glow for a long time, man. I really loved watching you perform. Well, I really appreciate that. It's a, you know, it's a long process. I have a weird with stand up. I have just this weird sense of humility and like I have like no ego with it. I just came from like the New York comedy scene. You have to say you suck. Yes. Right. You spend, you spend a decade like, dude, I suck. I'm terrible. I'm not Patrice. I'm not David Tal. And then like I've like, so when people compliment my stand up, I'm going like, dude, I'm a fucking fraud. What are you talking about? Dude, I'm no, because I really just look at like those guys, the Louis and the Bill Burris and it's like, you know, we're all sort of striving to be that good. And I think it's what makes us good is because we're probably never going to get there. So we're constantly running that race and constantly trying to expand and grow and be better. But it's, I really do appreciate it. And then, you know, when I have people that I have a ton of respect for like you that compliment my comedy, it really does mean the world to me. It truly does. Well, dude, I mean, it's like, you know, it's, I've, when I was in New York, I saw your stand up. It's super fucking funny, but like you're, you've clearly like you're, you're evolving. Like you didn't, you have not plateaued. I mean, that happens sometimes. It's like some comics, they hit a ceiling. If you ever talk to like a tell or any of those comics about this imposter syndrome thing, like you ever heard their take on it? What do they say? Like did they probably get it too? Right? They're probably like, I don't, I'm just doing jokes. Well, it tells like, it tells like comes off stage and he's like, oh, I suck. I'm a hack. I'm terrible. And you're like, Dave, you're the greatest living comedian. What the fuck are you talking about? So that's just sort of a New York attitude, I think. I think a lot of guys, there's a humility here and we all sort of think we stink until we don't. And then at that point we die. I think, yeah. Well, I mean, I think it's just like maybe it's necessary or something like, or maybe just because comedy is like any other art form, like the deeper you get into it, the more you realize you don't understand it. Like, you know what I mean? Like a young, like when I was a younger comic, I went through a fucking horrible phase where I was like, oh, I got this. You know what I mean? That's when you're really fucked. When you're like, God, no, no, no, no, I know what that is. And if I meet comics who seem to have that, not like, you know, some comics have a great work ethic and all that. And I, you know, shop talk about that I get. But if you run into someone who like seems to think that they've got it all figured out with standup, I, I hope it's true, but I'm usually pretty suspicious of that because it's how do you figure it out? Well, I don't think you ever really, it's like, dude, it's like jiu-jitsu, right? And, you know, you hear guys say that it's like they don't really start learning jiu-jitsu until they get their black belt. Right. And I think you, when you first go in, you're like, oh, I got my blue belt. I got, you know, I get some classes and kick some guys' asses. And then you start to get more and more into it. And you realize exactly how little you know and how much room there is to grow. You, you roll with a black belt and you're like, what the, there's a world of difference between me and that guy. And I think standup is sort of the, the same thing. And the beginning, you know, you first learned how to kill, you know, the first, the first couple of years, like I learned how to kill pretty quickly. Um, but then you realize exactly how much you actually stink. At one point you look back and go, oh, shit, all those jokes suck. I'm not doing them anymore. They were terrible. If you watch old videos from when you first started, it's so fucking cringy. Um, so yeah, but I think it's, um, you know, dude, it's, this is like, I think the comics that are good, they sort of hate themselves a little bit. They're not, you know, you see the guys that love themselves. You see the guys that have nice clothes and nice cars and like, it's just, they like themselves a little bit too much. And I think it shows in their comedy. The guys that hate themselves a little bit, they're fucking a little darker. They're a little more fucked up. They're coming at it from a little bit of a different angle. And by the way, you should love yourself. It's not good for anybody else out there. It's not a good thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I, you know, yeah, but it's, it's like, I imagine if we're talking about like a human predicament out there, probably more people hate themselves than love themselves sadly. Right. And if you're going to be relatable on stage, one way to not be relatable would be someone who loves themselves and from a comedy audience. You're like, great. What are you? Don't be the Dalai Lama or something. What the fuck? Well, that's the difference between standup comedy and like, you know, you know, what do they call it? Like, you know, like self-help gurus that go out and they do public speaking. It's like, you know, I think that's the biggest difference is like comics. Like, yeah, dude, I hate myself. I stink. Look at how much I stink and laugh at that. Whereas some other, you know, otherwise you're literally just up there and you're doing a fucking, you know, Gary V thing where you're trying to like motivate people to go be, you know, become a motivational speaker. So, you know, I am a better place. I love myself more today than I did the last time I did this show and more than I did a decade ago and more than I did 20 years ago. You know, that's that's a part of the process of growing into yourself and life as well as sort of stepping back and, you know, just smelling the roses and saying, fuck it, dude, life isn't as bad as it seemed. Lewis, when I started going to these spiritual retreats where motivational like spiritual teachers speak as a comic, it was really interesting because you realize they have fucking jokes, but it's not jokes like we have jokes. Their punchlines are like, you know, like moments where the audience is like, oh, you know, it's not laughter, but they, you realize, holy fuck, it's the same rhythm almost. It's the same like setup. It's usually some kind of anecdote, some personal story. The punchline is like a thing that makes you go, oh my God, I get it. That like aha moment. Yeah, yeah. And I'm sure it's just as choreographed and just as rehearsed as stand up as well. I'm sure if you go and watch one of these motivational speakers, one set when he does that set in fucking Tucson, it's probably a very similar set as in Houston, right? And the setups and the punchlines are probably all similar and also serve sort of a similar purpose. You're making people feel good. So I'm not knocking motivational speakers. I'm just saying comedians are just a little bit darker. Yeah. I agree. You know, it is the same purpose. Yeah. They will fuck. Yeah, they are. Definitely. And you know, all of it is just a form of entertainment, no matter what you want to call it. Like everyone's got punchlines. Even the fucking president when he's doing speeches, there's punchlines in there. They're not funny punchlines, but there's like moments where he's delivering something. They should. I was just in Italy with my son a few weeks ago and I went to the Vatican, which was one of the coolest fucking experiences in my life. I grew up Catholic and, you know, I really like I'm not religious at all anymore. I'm not spiritual really at all. But the way that they put those stories together, like our tour guide was just fucking so dope and the way I'm just like talking about how the Sistine Chapel was painted with Michelangelo and just the story of Jesus and his 12 disciples. And it's all how it all fitted in. I was like, dude, if they would have made this entertaining as a kid, like I would have really been into this. They could have gotten me. And for some reason, religion, when they when they try to tell these stories and they try to recreate these stories, it's never fucking interesting, dude. But they just need they really, they need a comedian or a motivational speaker to come in and lead these churches because you can get people really engaged because the stories are pretty incredible and really fun if they're done the right way. Right. Yeah. It's so weird. The fact that you do have like all these stories that definitely are transformative, but they're articulated in the most dry, fucked up way. You know what else is fucked up? And I think that the problem I would have at the Vatican is, you know, you're the whole the whole kid, the fact that they fuck, you know, the kid fucking stuff, you know what I mean? You're at this beautiful place. It's incredible. You probably are filled with awe inspired. But then also, I mean, didn't you think about that, especially since you were there with your kid? Wasn't there like in your mind like, God, they, they move pedophiles around. They protect pedophiles and this is the base where they do it from like this is like the Paw Patrol base, but for pedophiles, I mean, it didn't really like, no, it didn't really come into my head too much. I don't, I don't really know how much. I like honestly, it's sort of like a mystery. Like there's a, there's a darker side to that whole world that I'm not super familiar with. Um, so yeah, I, you hear about that, but I mean, how much did the, does the Vatican actually protect and move pedophile? I have no idea. Do they really do that? Yeah. I mean, Google search it just to make sure, sorry, my Catholic, I mean, I think Catholicism is quite beautiful. It's just that, that one little thing. Let me look, let me look it up, uh, Vatican, I mean, I, you hear that all the time and you know, I've heard about priests and I've heard about the coverups and sort of them. So I'm sure it is. I just, that wasn't the thing that was sort of like standing out to me as I'm walking through this fucking crazy sort of historical, you know, buildings with crazy art. It's like the biggest art museum in the world. Um, so yeah, I mean, the reality is, you know, sure, it was built on the, the butts and bones of molested children, the pope ignored them, alleged abuse of deaf children on two continents. That fucking children points to Vatican failings. This is the Washington Post, uh, when investigators swept in and raided the religious Antonio Provolo Institute for the death, they uncovered one of the worst cases yet among the global abuse scandals plaguing the Catholic church, a place of silent torment where prosecutors say pedophiles preyed on the most isolated and submissive children. And yeah, they were deaf. They weren't mute. Jesus fucking Christ. Man, uh, you know, what do you like in comedy? You have all these genres of comedy and, you know, and that's another quality. When you've done stand up long enough, you might not like certain styles of comedy, but you can recognize in it like that's good. It's not making me, it's not my thing. That's people like us. We like a certain style of comedy, which, you know, current, like people call it, it's edgy is what they say. And I think about that a lot, like the edge, um, you know, which is changes all the time, like the edge in the fifties or the edge in the sixties versus the edge. Now that's a completely different edge. The edge used to be, you couldn't say fuck on stage or you could get arrested. Lenny Bruce gets arrested just for like cursing on stage. Now we have this new edge. So, but sometimes I think, is that really the edge? You know, you know what I mean? Like sometimes I feel like comics think that they have like found the edge, but it's really they, it's like a false edge that's being presented to us in the news by creating like, you know, narratives, uh, uh, about like whatever the current thing, maybe trans people or, um, uh, I don't know, politics or whatever. But do you ever wonder about that? Like maybe there's an undiscovered edge, which I think when comics find that place, it's the most powerful thing ever because they start talking about something that's so off the charts, so off the radar, and yet somehow familiar to people that it creates like true drama, true shifts in culture. You know, I'm talking about, do you ever wonder about that? Like right now, what's the edge that people have yet to even approach in comedy?

Do you ever wonder about that, like, right now, what's the edge that people have yet to even approach in comedy? Yeah, you know, I don't know what it is, but I think about it all the time. You know, we, you know, lead you to Skanks and what we've done with Gas Digital and Skankfest. You know, we, you know, I think we pride ourselves in creating edgy comedy. Now, it's not really edgy. You're right about that, because I don't think people are really offended by anything that we do. I don't think that there's real offense. I think that there's a, you know, being offended has become a currency. It's become a talk. Mr. Gomez, check the comments section of this podcast after you're fucking pedophile joke. I don't, but, but I don't think they'll be really offended. They'll be outraged and they'll be, they're addicted to the attention that they get from, from fake outrage. Right. And you get to have an, it's a part of people's identity to be offended. You're saying there's a part of people's identity. There's a difference between outrage and offense. They're like, it's almost like fake outrage. I don't know how many people hear a joke about a dead baby or a pedophile or a trans person that go, I'm, I'm appalled. I'm genuinely offended. I don't know how many people feel that way. I don't think that people are empathetic enough. I think people are too narcissistic to really be offended for something so trivial, especially when they know it's a joke. I think the human mind, we know, and we go, all right, that is a joke. I think people aren't that dumb. You know, I'm not saying that nothing can be offensive. I think you can genuinely offend people. Like, you know, I just feel like the, the, what has become sort of like edgy is not necessarily doing jokes like that, but sort of like being kind of unique at this point and standing out in another way. Like if you, when I watch David Tal pull out a recorder and do a, and do a song on the recorder, like, you know, the flute that you did in the fourth grade. Yeah. And it's so fucking funny. And it's like a legitimate risk. And you go, like, dude, this could fucking crash and burn and be the dumbest thing anybody's ever seen. But I think that's like almost edgy in its own way. Right. Sure. I love that. I think, yeah, sort of why. It's so, it's so, it's so nice when you see somebody who's like legitimately unique and doing something different and trying something that could crash and burn. I think that's really it. What's edgy is being risky, right? Right. And when you can, when you can fail, I mean, typically it should be just bombing, right? But that's sort of like walking that, that, that risky tightrope. That's why we do the jokes that we do on Legion of Skanks. It's not so much like, oh my God, that's just so much funnier. It's almost like we're walking on like an edgy tightrope. Right. If we fuck up and slip, we could fucking get in real trouble for it. It feels like the, the stakes are a lot higher when you do jokes like that. So that riskiness, it's almost like watching like, you know, watching an MMA fighter, watching somebody, you know, do a sort of stunt. You're like, oh shit, they could die. They could really get hurt here. And that's where I think Legion of Skanks stands out and why people really like it. Cause they go, oh shit, these guys are fucking putting themselves up on a tightrope and they could fall and hit the ground pretty hard. And I kind of want to watch it if it happens. Right. That's brilliant. That's brilliant. Yeah. It's like literally, if we're talking about edges, it's like you need, if it's truly an edge, there's danger standing as close as you can get to it. Because just like what you're saying, fuck, fuck, man. I mean, when you look at like mini comics who've gotten into trouble for jokes, you realize it's not just that they said this thing that caused outrage. It's that it wasn't funny enough. You see, you know what I mean? A lot of the times you'll see in the composition of the joke itself that it was an okay joke. And if you're going to do shit like that, it needs to be super funny. And even if there's still outrage and even if you're still in trouble, it needs to be so undeniably funny that people are forced to be like, okay, it was, it was fucking funny. They did their job. Stand up. That's easy, right? Because with stand up, you know, you go into the clubs, put your cell phones in a, you know, a little lock away bag. Let us figure out what's funny. Let's figure out what's not going to be funny. Right. With podcasting is different because very often you're improvising with three or four people on microphones and you guys are just trying to one up each other. Right. And if you're doing edgier stuff, you're not going to know it's not funny until you say it and nobody laughs. Right. Right. And that's really it. You, you put it out there, but we're on a recording. We're on a podcast. We're on video. We could be taken out of context. And you watched that happen with Shane. I thought what Shane said was funny, right? When he, when he said that he got him canceled from SNL. You know, I forget exactly what the riff was, but he, you know, he used, he used the word chink. But in a, he was doing like, um, he was almost like doing like a character being like, you know, like a racist character, right? It was sort of riffing it from the perspective of a racist character. He wasn't just, if you listen to it, he was being funny. And it's very obvious. I haven't seen the joke, but I heard it was taken out of context. Just what you're saying. He was trying to embody something bad. Like he was trying to, he was trying to embody some, he wasn't the bad. He was trying to show like, and even all of those no-no words, like the reality is, like the reason they have an impact is because we all know that you're not supposed to say them, right? That's sort of what's funny. It's not, nobody's saying like, nobody listens to fucking a Hitler speech and goes, this is some hilarious shit. You know, that's crazy. Like all of those, you use those words, you know, in a funny way, um, to try to, you know, create a moment of shock. It's, it's misdirection because most people wouldn't use those words. You're not expecting it. It's, there's a skill set involved there, but with podcasting in particular, you don't know until you know, you don't know until you try it out. And we, you know, in order to find real funny, I think you have to constantly, it's trial and error. And you know, this is a standup. And you know, this is a podcaster and as an entertainer, you have to constantly throw shit against the wall and see what works, see what doesn't work. And you, the good, you rise to the top and it works. And the bad, you throw away, right? Right. But if you are constantly thinking, overthinking, like, oh shit, I don't want to get in trouble. You're not really shooting from the gut, right? And the funniest I've ever been in my entire life is not when I'm on stage or not when I'm doing a podcast. It was when I was in the eighth grade and I was in the lunch room and nobody was listening except my five best friends. And we were just fucking being, just being fun, like truly funny, you know, just letting go. And I think pod, the reason podcasts have gotten a little bit stale and a lot of standup is really, really stale is because they're unwilling to even take the risk and to, to try these things out. And I think you have to figure out what's going to work and figure out what's not going to work. Like if you're painting pictures, dude, you have to go on and, you know, go through thousands of canvases before you master your craft. Yes. And you have to fail. There's a bunch of shit that's just sitting in a dumpster somewhere because it's not really ready for consumption. It's true for sex. Like, you know, like the worst sex you're going to have is scared sex. Like if you're fucking and you're not willing to like go for like what you want to do or what you're into or you're like concealing all that, it's going to be so lame. Like, you know what I mean? It's like we're talking about like it applies to literally everything. It's, you know, and, you know, in audio, it's latency. We're talking about latency. Like even in, like if we had a millisecond latency right now, which we don't, thank God, in a podcast, that little extra electronic whatever in between talking fucks a conversation. It destroys. And if you're, you know, trying to be in the moment on stage, but you've added even an extra millisecond filter between you shooting from the gut, as you say, and your articulation of that. It's getting filtered just by a millisecond. That is going to really show. Like people might not know why it's weird, but it's why we all fell in love with comedy in the nineties because nobody really gave a shit. Everyone was like, we're just in the clubs. Nobody's got a cell phone. Nobody's getting in trouble for making any jokes. And people were just firing off the funniest shit in the world. When I became a comic, I would go to a club. Dude, the club comics in New York, doggy, they were so fucking fun. They were all murderers. Everybody at the club murdered. You go to a club now, couple murderers, a few young bucks that are just getting chuckles, a few people that are getting some claps and applause and they're sort of woke and whatever else it is. But it's not like, do you go to the, just the, even the shittiest comedy club in 1999, you go to danger fields or you go to a comic ship live or the New York comedy club. The lineup was just stacked with seven or eight absolute fucking murderers. They were not household names. They were not people that people would even know about today. I can start naming names. You're not even going to know who they are, but they were all killers. And I think it was just the, the structure was built for everyone was trying whatever they could do to get the, the, the most laughter as possible. That was the most important thing in the world was how fucking funny you were. And I don't think that's the same thing today. I don't think how funny you are is the number one concern of any comedians that are coming out now. Man, you know, obviously like we're thinking about New York comics, you, you have to talk about Patrice and like, you know, anytime I revisit any of his jokes, like I find it to be weirdly intimidating. Like I, you, you watch it and you're just like, what the fuck, what the fuck? You know, and this is, I'm probably, this is going to be a tortured connection here. Probably so forgive me, but like, you know, in Buddhism, like the idea is that you are no longer clinging to the material to the shit. You're not clinging to anything anymore. You are no longer like reactive. You're not grabbed by all the little things, whatever they, the big things, the little things, all those things that ruin a person's day or ruin a person's life. You're no longer clinging to it. Now, when I, this produces the effect of like, I don't know how to put it. This is a weird fucking analogy, but like, I don't know. A shark fin coming up out of the water or something. It's like you, instead of being like pushed and pulled and swirled around or something by, by all the little things that all of us are pushed around by, you have this like, I don't know how to put it. You're not being blown around by the same winds. And when I see like someone like Patrice talking about edgy, that's what you're looking at. You're looking at like a person who is like taking on a form that is just truth. Like that shit that he would, his jokes were so fucking funny, but they're also like weirdly like, they are spiritual teachings, a lot of them. You know what I mean? They are like potentially liberating for people in the audience, hearing him say out loud these things that have maybe imprisoned some of the people. You know what I'm talking about? Like he's saying shit. He's pointing out forms that appear in culture that many of us are just locked into. You know what I mean? Like the joke I just watched of his, I'll fuck it up. Is the joke about how like when a girl asks you, do you love me? And you have to say, yes, he's, I think he called it like that's female rape. That's like, do you remember that joke? Like you're raping my time. I think it is. It's just like, what the fuck? That's so now is it actually, obviously it's not. But Jesus, you know, like pointing out that thing that can appear where like when someone's like, do you love me? And in the moment you might not feel it, you want to be like, ah, not this second. I mean, I don't love myself most of the time. So probably not going to love you, but you got to say it and you feel a little deceitful or something, but you don't want to go through the rigamarole of anyway, things like that. They present, you're right about that. And Patrice, like, you know, I look at Patrice related to a fighter analogy. Again, it's like Patrice, dude, he's just like, when you see, you see an MMA fighter, like a, like a Diego Sanchez type of guy, right? Who just would bite down on his mouthpiece and go to war. He didn't give a fuck. What was not protecting himself, not a George St. Pierre, not a safe fighter, like a guy, there's certain guys who just go in, they're like, I am fucking fearless. I'm going to knock this motherfucker out. And Patrice came at it with that, that fearlessness. He was not afraid to lose things. You know, you hear stories about Patrice going on to like, you know, television sets and he just fucking had this attitude. Like it didn't, he knew he was the funniest guy there. And that's truly all that mattered. Patrice was true comic, dude, true comic through and through. It was like, and I said it before, it's like all that mattered back then was who's the funniest and he was truly the funniest. And he knew it, dude, you know, it's a great moment in like podcasting history. And I call it podcasting, even though it's radio, but you can look this up, go listen to Patrice O'Neill's first appearance on Opie and Anthony. It's incredible. What happened? It's incredible. Rich Vols brings him in, right? And you know, I've lost, I love Rich Vols, I love him to death. And within, I mean, two minutes, he's on Opie and Anthony, which is the biggest, it's like, besides starting the biggest radio show in like the history of the world, right? This was such a massive show and it set its peak. And within a minute, Patrice takes over the room to the point where he is the alpha dog in the room within one minute. And then they ask him, they ask him if he's funnier than Rich. And he just goes, he was like, ask Rich if I'm funnier than Rich. It was so fucking funny, dude. And it's just such a fucking great moment of sort of like how to own that space, own that moment, just have some confidence, creating a moment. It's very inspirational as like a comedian and a podcaster because I listen to that. I'm like, you don't want to come in timid and fearful. He was himself from that first moment right up until the very, very end. So yeah, tons of respect. The reason comedians in New York love Patrice so much, it's because it's that fearlessness. And when we're talking about shooting from the hip and that flow state and like you know, he had that and he personified that I think more than any other comic in the world. I don't think anybody gave a fuck less about what the industry thought than Patrice O'Neill. And yeah, I mean, I was lucky enough to know him casually. Like I've been to his house a few times and obviously, you know, I'm very close with Bobby Kelly and Big J and those guys were, you know, really, really close with Patrice. So I got to sort of watch him from a distance. I was just such a, I was such a young scared comedian when Patrice was like around taking center court that I would be like three rows back from people and being like, please just do not sort of trashing me. You just got to put your head down, look at your feet. But all right, Patrice is here. I can't say shit. I love our next partner because I'm too disorganized to do the thing that the vitamin people do. You know what I'm talking about? The people who every week arrange their vitamins and weird little vitamin dispensers or bags and then they end up taking too many before they eat and then they vomit all over the Uber.

That was such a young, scared comedian when Patrice was like, around taking center court that I would be like three rows back from people and be like, please just do not start trashing me. You just got to put your head down, look at your feet. But Patrice is here. I can't say shit. That's smart. I think that's smart. That's another thing I love that shows up in comedy is even though it is obviously an anarchic art form, these really natural forms emerge in it where there is hierarchy, whether you like it or not. If you're smart, then you recognize that. It's not like it's bad necessarily. But yeah, you certainly wouldn't want to be the young comic trying to be the funny guy when that's happening because you're probably setting yourself up for just a thrashing of sorts that will haunt you for the rest of your life. Well, I think that it's built into it naturally. That's an old-school way of thinking as well. I respect my elders. I've been in comedy for 16, 17 years. Maybe even more. I don't even know how long at this point. At least 16 years, maybe 17 years. There are guys that started, when I started, that they were already doing it for a while. Like I said before, you wouldn't even know who these people are. But I will always look at them as being above me. I sort of bend the knee and go, these guys are veterans. They were around guys that they don't have any followings. Maybe they don't even do comedy anymore. In a weird way, I just kind of bend the knee and I show respect to my elders. It's such a humbling thing. Stand-up comedy, maybe more so than other arts just because you practice and you're in it. You go through so much shit in the beginning of just sort of sucking and not having anything and not making any money. You invest so much of yourself just for the sake of being funny and getting on stage that it's kind of like, yeah, I don't know. Like I always just sort of had respect for the guys that were there before me. I go, yeah, do you know exactly what it's like and I can learn from you? Even if they're a person that isn't doing a ton of crazy things, you can still learn from those people. Yeah, absolutely. And the shit they've seen too, like the crazy, their experiences that they've had on the road, all the stories they've got, yeah, there is that element to it. I mean, maybe it is old school, but I hope that never goes away because I'm getting fucking old. Hey, when was the last time you got offended? Offended. Do you remember? When was the last time you got offended? Offended by a piece of content that wasn't meant to offend me particularly. Doesn't have to be comedy. Doesn't have to be just, can you recall the last time in your life where you experienced offense where you were like, you might not have been outraged, but a moment where you were like, oh. It's a little, so you're not saying like we're a friend kisses you off because I've been offended by friends, right? Because they say something that annoys me or that I don't like, you know. I think that counts. The last time I was offended, the last time Ian Finance was on the Legion of Skanks podcast. Okay. Because he just kept on just like almost like heckling me in real time, right? And then big J, Ian wasn't even saying funny things. He was just being a dick. But then big J started cheerleading the crowd to be against me. So then every time Ian would say something stupid, the crowd would explode and big J would start to cheer at it. And I was just like, I'm fucking annoyed and offended. And I was offended because I invited Ian. This is what offended me because nobody else wanted Ian Finance on the podcast. Nobody else was like, you got to call Ian today. I was the one was like, let me fucking help out Ian. He's a fucking killer. He's a young buck. Love the kid. We do hilarious. And he comes in and throws it right in my fucking face. Well, big J was supposed to be my friend cheerleaders and entire crap. So I remember feeling genuine like, fuck you, Ian. I'm not going to fucking. And of course it passed within five minutes and we started making fun of each other again. But that was the last time I was like that, like legitimately I felt offended that that my friends would gang up against me. God, that's a good. Okay. I get it. That's, that's amazing. That's amazing. Very, very funny and also horrible. God, I hate that, especially publicly because now you're offended and you know how sensitive audiences are. So they know you're offended and then you know your own. Oh, they love it. And they're eating it up and fucking then they make a clip. My, my producers make a clip out of it. But Ian Finance destroying Louis J Gomez on his own part. I'm like, all right, guys, fuck's going on here. Yeah. But I don't get offended by like, like a movie or something like that. Like, you know, and I don't want to shit on the comics because I do, I don't think this is really the comics fault, right? But something else like it didn't offend me, but it was too much. Right. I watched it on my podcast. It's kind of a viral thing going on right now. It was Tiffany Haddish and Erie Spears. They, they see this. Oh, I did. Yeah. And I saw. So, you know, they were like, they're accused of being grooming. Well, just stupid. Okay. But they, they did a video and I guess they had these kids in this video and it was, I only saw the one, but the video was, you know, they had a little kid and the idea, the bit was leaving your kid with like his pedophile uncle, right? Yeah. And Erie Spears played this pedophile uncle. Now, I'm not offended at all by the concept and I'm not offended at all. Honestly, at the attempt of the joke, who gives a shit? The reason I had to turn the video off was because the way it was produced, they did have a real little kid in the video. It was a real like five year old kid and they had a shirt off and they were doing like close ups of his butt and his crotch and like, and I remember just feeling really uncomfortable. Yeah. Because I had a boner. No, I felt really uncomfortable. I felt uncomfortable to the point where I had to turn it off and I was like, I don't want to look at this kid's body. Like it was just kind of weirded me out. Yeah. That that they were using this kid as a prop. Now, here's the thing. I don't know Erie's while I've met him before. I've met Tiffany. They're not grooming fucking kids. They're not pedophiles. It seems like they got caught up in a production that was just, it was ill conceived. It wasn't executed right. They could have had an adult play the kid and executed it in a funny way. Right. Yeah. It just seems like it was a fucking just ill conceived bit that sort of got out of hand. But watching it, I remember seeing this like kid and them doing close ups of the kid's body. And I was like, yeah, I don't really want to. It seemed to me like you were, you know, a little kid was being used as a sexual prop. And the point of it was to be funny, but it still sort of doesn't matter. I was still kind of like, hey, you know what? That's a little bit too much for me. Yeah. So I turned it. I literally couldn't finish watching the bit. But I also don't want to pile on Erie Spears or Tiffany Haddish because that's not what the fuck's going on there. For people to say that it's, you know, you know, it's just a little bit irresponsible because that's a very big fucking charge. You call somebody a groomer or a pedophile. That's crazy. That's a really, really fucked up credit. It's one of the lowest things you could be in the entire world. So it's not exactly that. But I do understand why people were like, yeah, that shouldn't be on video. If I'm that parent, I'm like, yeah, that's not going out into the world. Dude, I mean, well, and also like, I think that they like, you could call it exploitation. Like it's, you know, grooming is implies the intent to like rape a kid. And yeah, you're right. There's no fucking way that's what they're doing. But was it exploitation? Yeah, they took a kid and they like the child probably, I think the parents weren't aware of what they were doing. And the kid obviously has no idea that they're like, dude, how they're going to edit it or whatever. So, you know, if you want to call it what it is, that's probably a better word for it than grooming. Also, think of like, do you remember Cape Fear? Did you ever see Cape Fear? Yeah. Remember the controversy around De Niro and Juliette Lewis? Juliette Lewis, yeah. Because they had this fucking hot scene. She was too young at the time. Like it's like Robert De Niro fucking ripped stalker Robert De Niro. He's smoking a joint with her in like the school theater. I think he like, I think they might have improv a little of it, you know what I mean? And like, it was like, you know, two good actors really committing to this fucking role where he how old was she in the movie? I think she was like, she was supposed to be like 15, like in the movie, the character, but how old was she actually when it was spelled? Let me look at it. I think she was like that was the controversy as she was underage. But let me look it up. I just remember when like it caused all kinds of controversy. Juliette Lewis, Cape Fear. Let's look it up here. How old? First thing that comes up. Oh, she was 18. She's saying I was 18 when I did Cape Fear playing a 14-year-old. And so many people thought that Scorsese had just found me and that I really was that girl. But I wasn't said Lewis. Addition for it. The character is based on a young girl I met in a park who was holding a kitten. Oh, OK. Well, shit, she was fucking 18. And it caused controversy. Which is so funny, like 18. Now that I'm 40, 18 is still so fucking young. If you speak to an 18-year-old, they seem like children now. Yeah. But look, though, you know, though as an age, she's an adult, she's on a set. There should really be much of a controversy there. Do you remember there was that movie that just came on a Netflix, that French movie about like the preteen dancers? Cuties. Oh, fuck. That was super controversial. And if you watched it, that was another time. Offended is a weird word, because it's not a I'm not offended. You know, that was probably the last time I was offended. Cuties. Cuties. Yeah. Did you watch it? I don't watch the whole movie. We watched the scene on skanks to see it. And I was like, OK, this is fucking like. Because they are children. I've watched it nine times. I've watched it nine times. So it's screen safe, right? I just just understand why I was offended. I just kept watching and watching and watching. It's very offensive. You take a little kid and they don't realize what these kids want to be in a movie, right? And they're I mean, for all intents and purposes, good dancers. I'm assuming that they I don't know the whole history of the movie, but I'm assuming they got kids that were part of real dance teams. But you're taking fucking shots. This is a child's ass and you're putting a camera right up against it and she's thrusting it. That's kind of crazy. I don't give a fuck what stories really being told. Same. At that point you are, you know, you're using this kid for to tell a very provocative story. You're doing it with a real kid. Maybe, you know, so that that's sort of like I understand the controversy. And I always defend sort of the attempt at creating art and I defend the attempt to. But this whole child thing starts to be especially now that my kids older. He's nine years old. I once you have a kid, it just changes the perspective and people get very, very passionate about either the kids or their dogs. You can't fuck with kids and you can't fuck with dogs these days. That's right. But you can definitely you're going to get in less trouble for fucking a dog. Rightfully so. And dude, here's the thing. As a parent, it's like this is like opened up something for me where it's like I don't even want to. I can't watch date lines that have children getting killed in them or date lines where their parents have been killed. Like it kills me. I don't know if that's a fence necessarily, but maybe that's what it is. I mean, I think it's comics. I don't know about you, but I go numb and like part I could just be numb and not sometimes not feel anything. And when I was really in phases of my life where I thought I was trying to be edgy, it was just some articulation of numbness more than anything. But when dude, yeah, man, anything that's like fucking with a kid, including this new like, you know, where they're like people are putting their children on Instagram or TikTok like channels for you're watching like videos, infinite videos, kidding breakfast, kid drinking a smoothie, kid at the playground. And you realize like this kid's life is the fucking Truman show. Like they are just the child. Maybe I'm just reading into it because I always look for the worst of things, but there's always like a weird like innuendo or implication in a lot of these videos. It's like, you know, little girl spills milk all over her face or fucking dude, right. That it's an entire cucumber. Like what's going on right now? Right. Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck is happening? Like you do you and it's like that's the that's where it gets real dark. I mean, do you remember this happened on YouTube sometime ago? They fixed it somehow. I think they fixed it. But I think I don't remember what they said. It created new Elcigate. Elcigate we can get into because it's one of my favorite. That's what I thought you were talking about. It's Elcigate adjacent. But what was happening is like pedophiles were leaving in the comments time code. So two minutes, 22 seconds, you go to that and it's like for a second, you can see like a flash of the kids underwear. And so they were like sharing with other pedophiles like shit that so they don't have to watch the whole fucking video of the kid at the playground. They just cut. I was like, now they put in they put in like time stamps to skip our podcast reads. Yeah, I did a goal. Yes. Exactly this. Exactly. And so like the parents, they must be aware that the viewership of people watching their children on fucking playgrounds is probably 3 percent. People are like, boy, nothing I love more than watching kids at playgrounds. And 97 percent fucking dude to the fat kid. There's a lot of this because my niece is seven and my son's nine, right? And they watch YouTube on my television regularly, right? So there's a sect of a big portion of who's watching these kids like dudes just do shit or other kids, little kids like to watch little kids. That's your presence. And so I think a lot of them are just little kids. But then I think another large percentage of them are fucking weird ass adults. Yeah, I remember we discovered this on real ass podcast a while ago. But there was like a mommy blogger. And it was just like, you know, her at the park with her kids and then her at the supermarket with the kids, her going to Disney with her kids. And the one video she had was bath time. It was called bath time with Susie or whatever the fuck it was, right? And it was her just taking her four year old daughter in the bath and washing her hair, right? Now, all of her videos had like 5,000 to 10,000 views. Bath time video had like 2 million views. This is also the only video that had the comments turned off. But she kept it up and she kept monetizing it. And at one point you go like, well, I mean, the parent more than anything else is the fucking problem there. And my sister, you know, my niece is obsessed with YouTube and she's like, oh, she won't start a YouTube channel. And I'm like, Jenny, trust me, put your fucking daughter on YouTube. There's going to be creepy old men that are jerking off watching her fucking put her shoes on. If you're OK with that and just knowing that that's happening in the fucking world, yeah, then go ahead. But I have I have a lot. I pretend I put my son on my Instagram stories here and there. I really try to minimize even just keeping pictures up just because it's sort of a crazy world out there, right? And I don't know who the fuck like we have fan bases that are a little bit fucking crazy. People get obsessed with shit. So I really do try to I try to minimize it, you know, and I also don't want him to be obsessed with like that lifestyle. That's like the new I want to be a rock star or baseball players. I want to be a Twitch streamer or an Instagram celebrity or a TikToker. And I just think that kids, you know, I want my kid to want to be a lawyer or a doctor or want to, you know, just something fucking normal. He doesn't need to want attention or need attention. I do this because I didn't get enough attention as a kid. He's got plenty of fucking attention. Right. But I bet he's funny. Is your kid funny? He's super funny, very smart. Crazy when you say he wants to be a comedian. He said he wants to be a comedian. He wants he likes to act. He plays piano and drums and he's in musical theater and he's very really into performing. And by the way, I would never tell him that he couldn't, but I'm not going to try to put him to work. And that's what it is when you have a monetized YouTube channel, right? Well, my son, my son's doing, you know, he just was in a little mermaid and he was in a production of Susie with the Musical and he's auditioning for the new Shrek Musical in like the local town production, like a pretty big production now. But I would not, if he wanted to go audition for Broadway and actually become a working Broadway kid actor, I wouldn't allow him to do that. Yeah. I think that that's a decent thing. I mean, I, you know, I think that is part of like being in entertainment is like you understand how, how fucked up that can get. All the like the elite like creepy shit that people talk about aside, just the like you're, you're, you're pulling your child out of default reality and plopping them into this bizarre world, man. And it's like, yeah, I want my kids to have like a normal childhood when they're old enough. And if they want to go do that, fantastic. But when they're kids, I want them to be kids. I don't want them to be kids. They shouldn't be image obsessed. They shouldn't be worrying about how, you know, you know, people in the masses are viewing them. They shouldn't know what a fucking algorithm is. My nine-year-old should not understand what an algorithm is. That's crazy, right? Right. And I don't think that, and you'll hear on the other side of it, like you'll hear parents be like, oh, well, you know, they're, they're going into a very technologically driven world. Like my son doesn't have an iPad. I got him a phone for a trip to Europe because I wanted him to take his own photos. And God forbid if I lost him, I wanted to be able to call him, but he doesn't have it. It's in my room now. Right. He has it if we go to the mall or, you know, we're doing something special. But I think that, you know, it's really lost. How old are your kids now, Duncan? I've got a one and a half year old and a three and a half year old. Yeah. I mean, you know, I keep my kid away from all of that bullshit because I want them to be able to have a conversation with people. I want them to make eye contact. You see little kids when they sit down at dinner and they're on a pad. The whole family's at a restaurant and then you have a six-year-old on a pad the whole time. Well, everyone else is engaging in conversation. Yeah. And this kid is just, it's not going to happen. I'm telling you right now, like we're going to have a bunch of fucking weird, you know, no eye contact making fucking people that have no social skills. And I want to make sure my kid has that advantage over everybody else because the technology is becoming intuitive. Having interpersonal skills is not intuitive. It actually goes against your instinct, right? Like my son, he started a new school and like he's just so good, dude. Like if I go, we're online at the new school the other day and I'm like, James, you know that kid's name? He's like, no, he's in my class. I don't know his name. I was like, go ask him his name. And without a beat, he just goes, hey, what's going on? I'm James. What's your name? Michael Cole. And they start talking and now they're in the middle of a conversation. Same thing when we were in Italy. Like it was just me and him. It was a father-son trip. So I was like, yeah, go introduce yourself to some other kids. You'll get a pen pal from fucking Germany or Italy or France or wherever. These are kids from all over the world. And he was just introducing himself to all these people. And even me, and I'm a pretty, you know, outgoing dude, when I was a kid, if I had to go introduce myself to a brand new person, I would feel this anxiety. Same. I'm kind of shut down and go like, oh, fuck dude. You know, I'd have to really force myself to do it. And I think he's exercising a muscle that will be a massive advantage over 99% of the other people that are going for job, school, whatever else it is. Well, dude, I don't know if you've probably haven't, you're not experiencing this, but because your kids are a little older. So right now, all the COVID shutdown kids are like going to preschool. And the teachers have been telling us that they've never seen anything like it. Like these kids, like the way they're behaving, the way they're interacting is totally fucking different from the way that they're used to, because they've been shut down so much. Add to that what you're talking about. Technology, the, you know, and I get it, man. Any parent that is doing the iPad hypnosis thing. This is like, it's so alluring in the sense that you want to go out to dinner and you don't want to have to deal with your squirmy yelling kid, like climbing up on the table, going under the table, you know, doing all this stuff. And what's the best thing? Give them a fucking hypno rectangle and lights out. They're just going to stare into that thing the whole time. And you get to have a normal dinner. Like I understand why parents do it. I'm on the same page with you, man. I'm not like, we're not doing that. We're going to, we suffer through it. We work with it, try to like, you know, get them to focus and all that stuff. But fuck, man. Do you ever just think about like, what are we looking at? What are these generations going to look like? Who are they going to be? Kids who know what an algorithm is. Kids who, whenever anything cool is happening, they're not seeing their parents face. They're seeing a phone in front of their parents face as they get filmed to make money to afford the house that they're living in. What is it going to look like? We're going to have the weirdest generation of kids that the world has ever seen. And I, it's such a unique time, right? Like this specific time, this technology that came out. Like, you know, we, we were also unique in that like, technology is completely ingrained in our lives, our careers. Like we use it in a pretty high, high level way, right? Like I'm using social media and I'm using these platforms. Right now we're on this, you know, platform so we can have a conversation like this across the country from each other, right? So we use it, but we also remember a time when there was none of this. And like, through our entire lives, like we saw sort of before it, we saw exactly how, you know, dependent everybody became on it. And I think we're going to watch, you know, people roll back a little bit, the dependency, because I think it's dangerous. And I do think when you have people that are, it's creating a very reactionary society, right? Reactionary. I used that word wrong recently. I think that's a right word. Reactive. Yeah. Well, I guess reactionary and I was like politicized, right? So, but, but very, like, you know, overreactive, we are, you know, we, we pile onto things that sort of like built within our, within the culture, right? When they say cancel culture, it's, it's everything we're talking about. And I, the cancel culture debate is so much bigger and so much more intricate than simply like, he said a bad word and now he can't work on that TV show. It's, you're talking about changing the way people think and changing the reaction and what, what happens when they feel offended or when they feel a mild bit of offense, right? Right. Or when we're talking about in comedy or art, like you're talking about not, you know, sort of killing the flow state and making people not really be in the moment, right? You know, that's, that in my opinion is the biggest drawback of cancel culture is you've probably completely killed that real time creative process because people are overthinking every single little thing. And they're, you know, so yeah, I think that, you know, our kids, I'm hoping, I legitimately hope that we fucking have more restrictions on what we can do with technology and how much, you know, you shouldn't be able to reach that many people that quickly and share ideas that quickly. We should have some time to think about the ideas. Every time I've ever just reacted, anytime I'm arguing with a girlfriend or a friend and I just react, I always come off shittier. I always come off less intelligent. I always come off like I haven't put any thought into it because I really haven't, right? But anytime I maybe have something with somebody and then I say, let me step away from this for a minute and let me, you know, how many times you sent a text message or an email like, God damn it, I shouldn't have sent that. I'm a fucking idiot. One out of four. Yeah. Yes. And that, that side of it, I think is like, as a society, we're very like, let's react. Let's get it out there as quickly as possible, as opposed to sitting down, thinking about it, meditating. When's the last time? I mean, you probably meditate because you're a lunatic. I did. But, but most people don't. Most people were forced to meditate. Most people would drive to work, right? A lot of people didn't even have a radio in their car. In the 80s, like you were just forced to be alone with your thoughts, right? You were staring at the road. You almost hypnotize yourself and you're in a flow state of thinking where your mind goes clear and you realize that, oh shit, I just worked out a bunch of problems in my head on my way to work. I used to do this when I, when I work out, I sort of meditate when I'm in a steam room. Yeah. I love the steam room, dude, because the steam room I'm forced to sit there with my thoughts. Yeah. And that's it. You can't, I can't have technology. It'll melt my fucking phone, right? Right. You know, I don't leave headphones on. I just sit there and I'm alone with my thoughts and I'll come up with solutions. Even if I'm running and I'm listening to music, I just start thinking about things, right? I get emotional sometimes when I run because I'll start thinking about my problems, dude. Yes. And I'll fucking get really like, I'll be like, I'm like, why am I fucking, why do I want to cry right now? And it's because I'm just alone with my thoughts and I'm not being distracted by my phone or my son or my job or my podcast or any of these other things. So I think, you know, we're, we're less and less often people are doing that even when they work in, they're watching Peloton, they need a screen and they need somebody to tell them in the exact moment. Or, you know, I don't know how often people are just sitting on a toilet bowl without their phone. I used to be a meditative, they used to take a shit and be like, all right, I'm going to think about my problems for the day. You know, this is like, no one wants to address this reality, man, which is like, if I had to guess, like when I shit now, if I don't have my phone, it's a real weird moment. You know what I mean? It's like, it's like weird. You want your phone when I'm like mixed in to the human shit ritual. I don't know if ritual is the right word for it is this advanced technology. Before you go use the bathroom, where's my fucking phone? Oh, fuck, I don't have my phone. What am I going to do? I'm going to have to face this moment fully without anything to distract myself from the reality. Yeah, you're just shitting. You have to be reminded no matter who you think you are, you got to do this. Everyone has to do this. No way to like, look at, I don't, I've been watching like self help videos while shitting, you know, like self improvement while the point you're right, man, like those, those moments, those very human moments, we're being, we're intentionally distracting ourselves from them. And it's like, it's going to create some new form of humanity. And maybe it's better. Maybe we're not supposed to focus on shitting. Maybe it is a normal thing, but you know, meditation is, meditate, you are like, when you say I don't, like you do meditate, you meditate. If you're in the steam room and you're being with yourself, you're meditating. If your meditation is, it's one of the spiritual things that gets so hyped up. And because of that, people don't even realize they're doing it or even try to do it because they think they need candles, weird statues. That's really not what it is. It's like, just what you're saying, which is being with yourself, go home, go home in Tibetan Buddhism as the name for, one of the names for meditation, which means familiarity with oneself. That's it. Most people don't even know how they feel because they are trying to avoid those feelings that make you cry because, you know, it makes sense. It hurts. We don't, we're paying adverse creatures. And so generally the way to deal with things that hurt is to get away from them. That's smart. Don't touch the grill. Don't touch the fire. Don't, don't fuck that person. Don't, you know, because that's going to hurt. But the pain we all carry around with us, the way to deal with that is not avoidance. It's, at least according to Buddhism, as I understand it, it's just being with it and not even being with it to fix it, not even being with it to like understand it, to like re label it or to judge it or shift it around. But just, if you just sit with it, that's it. Something in that just by itself has the quality of bringing more peace. And yeah, man, that definitely is something that technology helps you not do. Yeah. No, and I think you're right. And I think that, yeah, when I say don't meditate, you're right. I do meditate. I think, you know, when you're writing jokes, you're sort of meditating. You're right. You're thinking about these, you know, these darker, for me anyway, I think about these darker things and trying to turn them on its head and come up with something funny or, you know, something positive on the other side. There's so much time spent thinking about yourself and so much time spent thinking about like, you know, it's almost like looking at yourself through a different lens. And you're just trying to turn something maybe dark or something normal into something really funny. I think it's a very, you know, a powerful moment you could have. I do you ever do yoga? God damn it, dude. I don't and I need to my body. I think you'd love it, dude. You do yoga. So I do I have done a bunch of yoga, right? And I really like hot yoga. I really like as we're just sort of talking about sort of being with yourself, what I think I like about yoga specifically, more than other, you know, working out and any other sort of exercise is that your super focused sort of on the movement, your super focus on like it's a mind body thing, right? Where you go like, you have to really be hyper focused on what your body's doing in that moment and it sort of makes you clear your mind, right? And I find myself when I'm doing yoga, I'm like just at the end of it, I feel really just emotionally better. I feel like legitimately just sort of like and I think it's just because you you're so like you're focused on form, right? You're focused on like maybe I have to get into this pose and get deeper into this post stretch a little bit and you're looking at your yogi or your yoga instructor and they're doing it. You're like, I have to like sort of like push myself a little bit further and you're hyper focused and you realize like I haven't thought about any problems for this hour. I haven't thought about anything except for like my mind connecting with what my body is doing in that moment. And that clarity is it's just I think really refreshing. It feels like a fucking shower at the end of it. I walk out of it and I go like fuck dude. I just feel like, you know, emotionally cleaner as the best way to describe it. Yeah, dude. Well, I mean, one of the many things I like about you, I love earlier, I know I'm not spiritual. You're actually one of the more spiritual people I know. Oh, you I know. But look, whether you think it or not, spiritual even the word, what the fuck does that even mean? Is there a more confusing, stupid word floating around right now than spiritual? What does that even fucking mean? Like a lot of people who call themselves spiritual, they haven't even like looked at that word. Like, what do you when you're saying you're spiritual, what do you mean? Like, think about the word itself. It's almost meaningless. It's almost like a word that has no more meaning because it's been used in so many ways that at this point, you might as well be like, I'm filming that. It's not it's a non word. So, you know, the way I've been taught is what you were saying about the edge, what you were saying about, you know, if you want to be edgy, really, it's like being as unique on as you are the thing you are as it is. That's fucking edgy. And that if you ask me, that's spiritual. It's like, it's not you're wearing beads. It's not that you know mantras. It's not that you spend all this fucking time meditating or whatever. Some of those people, if you ask me, and this is my own personal feeling, some of those people are the least spiritual people that you'll run into. It's actually it's called spiritual materialism is the name given to it, which is like all that's happened is you've like found a new costume to wear and you've become very proud of the costume and you will like tell people, oh man, I've done ayahuasca 500 times or I went to this retreat for four months in the mountains of wherever and there's no difference between the way they're describing themselves and somebody who's like, I've got a Ferrari. I, you know, look at this new watch I got. Check out like how good my skin looks. It's like you're the same thing. The symbols you're filling in are just like spiritual symbols, but right. So, you know, I think a lot of people use seem like one of them. Maybe it's better that you don't think you're spiritual or that you don't meditate or whatever because none of that shit really matters. I mean, truly none of it matter. It's not the point. It's not the thing. It's just something else to cling to, you know, which is why meditation is so frustrating. And if you get a good meditation teacher, it's like my meditation teacher, the reason I started working with him is because when we formally sat down to talk about it, he goes, this, I'm going to tell you what my teacher told me any minute. This is hopeless. I was like, dude, I love you. That's the coolest thing I ever heard. He's like, this is hopeless. You're not really going to get anything out of this. It's just hopeless, hopeless. And that is a really good place to be if you ask me, you know, hopeless, because hope is just another desire. You know, it's when you want things to be different than they are. Hopelessness is actually in this sense great. I don't mean hopeless, like you're like depressed. No, I understand completely what you mean. Like, you know, I find myself there. It's like hopeless in terms of like letting go of worry and letting go of like the bullshit once in a while, like, you know, wait, let me add let me let me let me add a plug something in there. Letting go of the idea that you're at some point not going to be worried, letting go of the idea that as you are right now, at some point is going to be better, different change, letting go of any hope, any hope, any sense that as you are, Lewis Gomez, as you are somewhere down the road, there's going to be a thing that happens. And oh, now you'll be the real Gomez right now. You're a fucking project. You're like a project that you've been working on your whole life. Keep doing the seminars, keep doing the mantra. Lewis, I'm telling you, it's coming, baby, it's coming. Let go of that. Let go of that. And just be. Yeah, you didn't just be and people like people who are really into their egos and want to want metals, points, money, score, all that they this is where they stop. This is where they're like, fuck that. Wait, you're going to tell me the way I'm in. I am right now is perfect. Fuck you. No, it's not if I'm fine right now with all of it. But then that means there's nothing else to do. That means then what am I going to do? What's left? That's where you end up in the place where you want to look at your phone. That's where you want to go. Well, you know, you can also like sort of because like it goes against my instincts, right? Because it's, you know, we talk about with comedy, like, I'll never feel as if I'm good enough. I'll never feel as if I have enough with, you know, success in life with love, relationships with anything, you know, but if you can stop and just be, you can move the focus off of yourself and what you want. And you can focus more on what the actual steps are in order to achieve those things without emotion, without being upset, without, without having your ego bruised or being offended. You can step back. It's like watching two people play chess. Like I can watch two people play chess and be like, oh, I see what they're doing right there. When I'm playing chess, I'm an idiot. For some reason, I get distracted by the pieces and it's such a, you know, like whatever it is, but just having that bird's eye view of yourself, I think that's sort of what, and that's when I find myself in those meditative states, whether I'm exercising or I'm, you know, I'm in a, you know, a steam room or a sauna and sort of like with my thoughts, I sort of, there's a moment where I go like, I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not worried about this thing happening. I'm just sort of like really looking at things from like, almost like a bird's eye view. And the reality is you have all the answers right now, currently it's turning very self-help, but it's, I really believe this stuff, right? Like if, if, like you, when I say you, Duncan or anybody listening to this, if you were to really sit down and list out all your problems in your life, financially, love wise, health wise, you know, your, your problems with work, your interpersonal problems, everything that's going on, right? And you were just to look at every sort of department and go, you'd be able to give yourself a genuine solution for everything. Sure. We know, we know the answers. We don't apply them. You know what I'm saying? But right now, health wise, I know exactly what I have to do in order to be as healthy as possible. Right. I know exactly what I have to do in order to have great relationships with my friends. I know the answers. I don't always do it. I don't always follow it, you know, but the reality is if you can get yourself to the place where you start to look at things objectively a little bit, you probably know the answers and it becomes a little easier to apply those, those things. Right. Yeah. You know, just like the idea is you like, it's been, you know, I just ordered this fucking tonal thing that they put on your wall. It's some kind of like magnetic, like it's amazing. It like it's Peloton, but for weights, I can't wait for it. But I'm only prefacing to say like, I mean, I know you're looking at me, lots of people look at me and I'm like, Jesus Christ, man, do you work out every day? Like how do you do that? What are you eating meat all the time? Like how is this happening to you? I don't know. It's genetic, but I haven't worked out in a while, but I love working out. And when I was working out, the difference between a workout where you're thinking, fuck, I need to like do this program for the next year. If I'm going to see any change in myself and the workout where you're just working out, that's a whole different thing. You know, like if you go in there thinking about like, I'm doing this because in six months, I want to be in this place. I'm not saying you shouldn't have goals. It's going to dilute that incredible like basic experience of just lifting heavy shit and be like being in your body and feeling it. And so I guess if you want to create some connection with like the idea of meditation, it's like, it's like that. Like in fact, one of the sayings that I've been taught when it comes to meditation is abandon all hopes of fruition, meaning don't sit down with any thought that this is going to make you enlightened, more peaceful, that you're going to experience any change at all, zero expectations at all of anything. Get rid of all that bullshit. And then just be just the way you are, just that thing. It's talk about walking a fucking tightrope, man. That's a tightrope. As it relates to, you know, exercising, like the, it's almost like a peripheral benefit should be getting abs, right? That shouldn't be the goal, right? The goal, if you say you want your goal to be, I want to be able to increase my vertical leap by six inches. The peripheral benefit of that is going to be, you're going to have abs. You're going to lose a ton of fat. You're going to, you're going to strengthen your glutes and the muscles in your body, you know what I'm saying? So it's sort of like looking at a different goal, right? And this is why I think, you know, you see athletes are in some of the best shape in the world because the goal isn't to look good. The goal is to be functionally good at this sport. And then a side benefit of that happens to be that they look fucking great and feel great, right? Right. So yeah, I think that sort of, you know, psychologically, it's very similar. If your goal is to increase your personal wealth or to feel, you know, enlightened, you're probably not going to get there. But if your goal is to simply be and understand who you are and find, find your own happiness through simply being happy with yourself, although I think those benefits are going to really start to come out and you see people look happier people typically are a little bit more successful. I don't think it's because they're successful. I think it's because they're happy. That's the reality. Well, and yeah, it's like, you know, what you're saying about the gym, you know, hopefully you find yourself in a, like if you, as I'm sure you have, I certainly have, you might find yourself in a life where the side benefits are your fat, your liver hurts, your friends, you're disconnected from your friends, your family, you know, this is like you want the side benefit of whatever it is you're doing to be. You've got good friends. You know what I mean? You feel good. Your body feels good. You're like, you know, that's important to look at. Like what are the side benefits of the series of decisions you're making every day? Fuck, dude, we got to go on tour. Lewis and Trussell's motivational tour. Dude, we don't have to write jokes anymore. Do you realize how awesome that would be? You don't have to write jokes. You don't have to come up with jokes. We'll just get up there, man and fucking like pump everybody up. Dude, think of it. Yoga retreat. We'll do a fucking, oh dude. Legion of Skanks self-help tour. Fuck. I bet you do, man, because like you're so deep in this thing, but you, you know, and I mean it, and when I say cult, I don't mean it in the negative. I'm not talking Jonestown or whatever, but come on, man, let's face it. You and the Skanks, you're kind of cult leaders. You kind of have a cult. It's a culture. Yeah. That's what every cult leader says. That's a culture. Every cult leader across the board. This is the first thing they'll say to address the obvious. They're like, look, it's like the Freemasons. You know what they say? We're not a secret society. We're a society with secrets. In cults, they go, whoa, come on. It's culture. We're talking about, and I don't mean it in the negative. And you know, like I've actually said, I've tried to make cult jokes to some of my friends who like do retreats and stuff, and they're like, come on Duncan, there's no mind control, a cult, an authentic cult. You know, you're like, you're making people do shit. You're taking over their minds. You're making people do shit. But holy shit, dude. I, some of my favorite comedy memories are like Legion of Skanks show. When I came and did your show, I didn't know it. I'd heard of Legion of Skanks, but I'd never seen it. And I love Burning Man. I love like counterculture shit. It was, I was astounded. My jaw dropped when I realized like, what the fuck? It's like some kind of- More than other comedy audiences. Our audience feels a real connection with the brand. I think podcasting sort of does that in itself. But you know, once again, like, I think it's the risk. I think people see the risk that we take and the type of comedy that we do. And they go, you know what, these guys, you know, you said something to me when I saw you in Austin. And the sort of, it really did stick with me, right? Cause it was a joke that I'm doing that'll never be on an album, right? It's just not going to go on a special. And you said that to me. You're like, dude, that is like the purest type of comedy. Like there's no monetary upside to it. Like you're just being funny to be funny, which is so rare these days. We're constantly creating content that we're trying to monetize in whatever way, right? Whether it's a stand-up special or on a YouTube video or a podcast advertiser or whatever. And I think that that, I think Legion of Skanks, that sort of person, we personify that idea where it's like, there's not, and don't, we make money, right? We do make money on the show. We do have sponsors in spite of it though. And I think that people look at that risk and they go, Oh shit, like they're doing this for the right reason, which is to be funny first. And luckily we get to make a career and, you know, tour and get to make a little bit of cash while doing it. But I think people have a genuine appreciation for it. Cause they go, you know what, these guys are risking something. It is edgier. It is like an MMA fighter risking his life every time he goes into the cage. It is like a, you know, evil can evil jumping across, you know, 20 buses on a dirt, on a dirt bike. It's like, what are we going to fucking watch right here? And there's like an appreciation for that danger. And I think that's why our audience, they get obsessed with it. They defend us like it's a fucking, like they're going to war for us. Um, you know, I get that. I get that part because it's like, you know, if people are pissed off at you guys, they're pissed off because they haven't been to your shows. They're pissed off because they haven't seen what it actually is. I mean, this is like, to me, one of the, you know, what's funny about Burning Man is like, you'll hear people talk shit about it justifiably. You've never been there because they've seen the Instagram pics of like, I don't know, hot girls and fucking face masks or whatever with glow sticks and like, that looks like the cheesiest shit I've ever seen in my life or it looks douchey or it looks like too like cheesy psychedelic spiritual. That looks, but when you go there and experience what it actually is, you realize that shit acted as a kind of force field keeping out judgmental assholes. And you know what I mean? I think Legion of Skanks, it has its own force field, which is the name, like your, your rep, your reputation. If people haven't seen your comedy, they're like, I'm not going to that. Oh, that's Legion of Skanks. It's going to be like bikers. They're going to beat me up. I'm going to get my ass kicked there. They're going to be mean. There's going to be violence or it's the sweetest. You guys have the sweetest fan base, man. They're like the sweetest fan base. They're the biggest comedy fans in the world. They're like, you know, we do a lot of music at Skankfest now as well. You know, the girls talk about, yeah, it's so funny because I just heard on the, I was listening to, I want to say Serious XM yesterday. I was in the car and there was somebody telling a story about the opening band for Rage Against the Machine. There was a band, I guess that opened up and the lead singer had a moment where he stopped the audience and he was like, you know, look around you. There's, you know, it was like huge, like 60,000 people, 70,000 people, big festival. And he was like, you know, there's a lot of girls out here who've never been able to crowd surf because they're afraid that the guys are going to touch him inappropriately. And he was like, you know, right now we're going to have a moment where every girl here can crowd surf. And it was like, nobody's going to fucking touch anybody because if you do, I'll personally jump down there and beat your fucking ass, right? And then they played the song, the song dropped and you know, 20,000 girls are crowd surfing, right? And you know, I'm sure they were all getting fingered by the way, but it was a trap. But the point of it, it made me think, I was like at Skankfest, people crowd surfed during the music. And one of the things that all the girls say is like, dude, like Kim Kong, he was saying this, she was like, she was like, you could feel the hands on everywhere, but her butt everywhere. But like, the fans are so respectful. And they're, they, they, especially considering the reputation, like we're chauvinist or sexist or whatever else it is, they're so respectful and it's such a safe space for like chicks that every year we've done Skankfest, it's been more and more and more girls there. It's like, it's a time we've never had a fight, we've never had an argument, nobody's ever been kicked out. You know, maybe a couple people got a little too drunk, but it's never been, it's literally just couldn't be any more of a sweet audience who genuinely just wants to have a good time, genuinely just wants to laugh and support really good comedy. And when people are exposed to it, they go, holy fucking shit, that is so different than I thought it was going to be. And honestly, that's a powerful thing. Honestly, it's a good thing because sometimes people expect it to be one way and then they're surprised. And you know, maybe the power of that sort of like contradictory thing like actually helps us out a little bit. And maybe it's why we haven't really gotten in any trouble. We talk about it like we're like getting canceled. We're not getting canceled. We're like, we keep on trying. Nobody fucking cares. I grew up on like Marilyn Manson, like being like banned from stadiums and entire cities. Like, and it's like, we lost like, we lost better help as a sponsor at one point, because we made fun of some TikTok, bitch, you know, better help should have never been our small tour to begin with. Let's get real. That's hilarious. I didn't, I think, yeah, that's so funny. I gotta go back and listen to your better help ad reads. That's so cool, man. Well, I like better. I use better help currently. I'm in therapy and I use better help. I think it's a great product. But the reality is like, yeah, I mean, they didn't really know who they were representing. And as soon as better help got out, we had three other sponsors that were literally competing to be the sponsor for that slot because we're sold out on ads. So it's, you know, we like to complain. We act like we're, you know, things are, they're not really that tough. When I say cancel culture, it's more like everything that we discussed on today's show. It's not so much that things are being taken away from me. Yeah, more or less, you know, it's just the, you know, we're changing the culture of how we create. And I think that that isn't for the better. And I, yeah, I think that's a great way to talk about what it is, like what it actually is versus like the shit you read on Twitter. And that's a perfect articulation of it. Man, I'm so bummed. I can't join you all in Vegas. I was like excited. What are you doing? Look, man, I'll explain it to you after the show. You're going to be disappointed with me. I'll explain it to you. I think you'll understand though. Not even Thursday for the kickoff party. I can't. I'm going to explain the whole thing to you, man. But when is that? When are you all going to be out there? October 14th through 16th. The biggest lineup we've ever done. More people than we've ever done before. It's going to be in a little early live in Vegas sold out in two minutes before we announced a single comic. Yeah, we sell out every year at this point in advance. Hopefully the next Skankfest at this Skankfest in the new location. So yeah, it's going to be great. But yeah, people can, if you want to get tickets still, if you go to the Legion or the Skankfest Networking Group on Facebook, there's just a handful of people that are always just trying to sell an extra ticket. So you can get it. If you get out there, we do not allow scalpers. They can't increase the price at all. If you want to buy it from somebody, they have to transfer the ticket directly through the festival. So you're not going to be charged more money than they paid for it. Awesome. Well, probably most of you can't go to Skankfest. I just fucking built it up. I should have asked if it was sold out first. That was pointless. But if you can get tickets, if you're out there in Vegas, and you can make it, even if you can't get tickets, maybe you can find a place to hang out with some after party or something. You should definitely participate. Well, every night, what's crazy, it's on Fremont Street. And if you know downtown Vegas, it's a party, dude. So the shows will be out around one o'clock in the morning, but everyone's going to go out into Fremont Street, and it's just pure chaos. Like there's so much going on after midnight. So please come out and hang out in Vegas, take some pictures, shoot the shit with us. Keep on listening to Legion of Skank's real-ass podcast. Follow me on Twitch.

Welcome to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast, Mark DuPlace. Mark, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming out here. Thank you, sir. Only because, you know, how often you get to sit with one of the great filmmakers. No, stop. It's true. Stop it. I gotta dive right in. All right. What do you think authenticity is? Oh, man, that's a really great question. I was watching the Avid Brothers documentary last night. And I was, have you seen it? No. It's pretty interesting. And I had this feeling while I was watching them where I was like, I like to think and posit that I am a truthful and authentic person. But as I was watching them do it, I was like, oh, they just are it. And they don't even know that they're doing it. And who are the Avid Brothers? They're musicians and they're from a small town in North Carolina and just turn on the documentary. It's on HBO and just watch it and you'll see how it sort of just cascades out of them effortlessly. Right. My attempt to like achieve authenticity as a person or as an artist in my art is very, it doesn't come naturally to me. I have to like reach for it and get myself in the zone and like strive for it. But that's what makes it special to me, I think. So, but isn't that sort of reaching and striving for it its own authenticity? Maybe. I would like to think so. That sounds good. Yeah, it has to be. I'll sleep better with that. It has to be, right? This is the concept that if you ever heard this idea, the result is the way. Yes. Right. And that's kind of, so it's kind of like even that stumbling, fumbling fuck. I want to be authentic, but I'm not. Yeah. It came from like this thing that happens in documentaries, which is like my favorite thing. I think maybe in any art form, which is we've been trained to as storytellers to lead our audiences toward a climax and deliver it to them in this very satisfying way. What happens in documentaries is the climax of most documentaries can't be planned. So it usually happens either out of focus with a cameraman swinging it around trying to find it poorly lit in the corner of a terrible wide shot. Right. Or it happens in a black and white title card because they weren't filming at the time it happened. Oh, wow. That sort of accidental discovery of what your climax moment is, is I just love it. I just, it feels so genuine and real and how my life works. Like my most seminal conversations don't happen at happy hour or magic hour on a cliffside. They happen by a dumpster behind Taco Bell. Yes. Normally that's how it occurs. Right. So that thing is what I'm always looking for. That's like the pinnacle of authenticity for me is that sort of cast off accidental climax thing. When I was watching the puffy chair, I kept thinking to myself how a lot of people maybe are going to see that and it will fly right by them. They won't understand what you were grabbing there. But I kept wondering how are you creating this thing that is so real that it becomes a kind of form of psychedelic. You're watching this thing that seems so intimate that you feel like you're tripping. And then I got the same feeling from watching that that I got the first time I listened to Daniel Johnston, which is like, my God, there's something so almost dark in it. You know, just thick and dark like a saw blade or something. How did you, how did you grab that? Well, I wasn't thinking about it in that regard. It was a different time. You know, I was 27 and my brother was 30 and we were trying desperately to reach something true as an artist. Honestly, something that was just, that didn't suck was what we were going for. And so what that led us to was to go inside. And so that was a very deeply personal story we were telling at the time. And then I think there was something about the process of making that movie with only five people that made it feel very much, I don't know, very close to real life, I guess. And the way we shot it, which was just with one camera and all natural lighting and Jay never knew what was going to happen because we didn't block the scenes and we would improvise them. So he as the cameraman is kind of like the audience just discovering it for the first time. Yeah, he's late to a lot of things. And I think that I realized that I think that had an effect on how you watch it as an audience. It shows more like how documentaries are shot. In narrative films, you're always early and you're ready for the moment. Right. And in documentaries, you're always a step behind. And the Puffy chair, the camera is always a step behind because he just didn't know what was going to happen. Wow. And I think that's kind of the language of something that's real. And so I think subliminally you start to think, is this the documentary? Does that feel like that? Because that's the language of it, basically. Got it. Okay, cool. Great. Is it a tragedy? It kind of turned out to be one, I think. We didn't know exactly how it was going to end. And there were times we thought it might end differently. And the way that it ended was a spontaneous moment that one of our actors just took right into their hands and said, I'm going to do this. That was exciting. But some people don't take it that way, too. So I don't really have an ethos or like, this is what the Puffy chair is about. Get it. Yeah. It was just kind of us presenting something that we felt like we could make at the time. We felt very limited as to the kinds of stories we thought we could tell with any impact or credibility. That one felt like, we know this world. We know what it's like to be in a relationship and feel like, I either need to break this off or like commit to it because I'm not getting any younger. Right. And that was like an epidemic amongst our friends at the times. So that felt of the moment in us. So I felt like we know how to tell this story. But as to how that movie is received, it's so wildly disparate. Even at Sundance, when it premiered at night in a packed screening, it played like dumb and dumber. We're just laughing all over the place. It's funny. And then it played at 8 a.m. the next morning and it played like fucking Sophie's choice. Like everybody was just like, this is not funny at all. And they were crying and all upset. Well, they're wrong. It's fucking hilarious. That is a really, really, I mean, I don't see how you could not see it as a comedic film. Without giving the ending away, it just ends to me. And the most, it was so sad. It was, this is sad. The ending is just, and then the way you guys cut to the credits right there, it's unexpected and it's over. And that's it. And that was the chance. And it's, holy shit, man. Just really knocked my socks off. Thanks, man. So, hey, I want to say congratulations on your big Netflix deal. Thanks, man. Four picture deal with Netflix. So we're going to get to see four new... At least. At least. We make a minimum of four, but we usually end up making more. When I saw it, but in the beginning of a Puffy chair, it's produced by Netflix? So we made that movie on our own for like, I think it was like $10,000 by the time it was done. And then we sold it to Netflix, which was called, at the time, Red Envelope. And they had, we were like one of the first movies they ever bought as an original. And they were like, we're going to start streaming movies on our, on our website. And we're like, nobody's going to have the internet to get that, but whatever, fine. And they were like, but you know, we'll, we'll see. And we'll pay you like a dollar every time somebody rents it. Wow. And we were like, sure, but that'll never turn into anything. Wow. And we were like, whoa, everybody's watching it. Yeah. And they advertise this on side of the little envelope inside of the Netflix envelope. Wow. Remember from the DVD Mailer program. And I mean, they were seminal in creating awareness for the Puffy chair. Like that was huge when it went out. And they were like, for better or for worse. They're like, if you liked Garden State last year, check this movie out. And all those people came to see it and they liked it. Wow. And they kind of, I mean, there's like two seminal entities in our filmmaking career. Sundance picked our first $3 short film in 2003. And Netflix bought the Puffy chair in 2005. And those, we are nothing, nowhere ever at all without those people. Yeah. It's badass. They're badass, man. And you got in so early with them. We did. Do you guys know what, do you have any idea what you're going to make for them? Did you have to pitch this to them or did they come to you? So two years ago, we signed our first four year four picture deal with them. And that was just for the streaming rights. And we partnered with another company called the orchard who does like the theatricals and stuff. And, um, and that's where we did movies like creep and blue J. Um, and now this is our second one, which are all just Netflix originals and they'll just premiere on the site and they'll live there. And you know, the way it kind of works is I've known Ted Sarandos for like 13 years who runs that company. And he is very specifically like chasing something that I don't understand a global empire of, of massive movies that entertain tons and tons of people. And, and he also needs lots of other small movies for his channel that are well reviewed and good. Right. And for lack of a better word, maybe like cooler than some of like the other movies that they make. Right. And so he just kind of looks at us and it's just like, can you make me four movies that are good? And that kind of feel like you, you do and, and we say yes, and we say, here's the, here's the, the price you might pay for it at Sundance if it doesn't blow up. And here's the price you might pay for it if it really blew up. So just pay us the average in the middle. So we don't have to go through the bidding war and all that bullshit and let's just get married and, and you go chase your big movies, which you have to do and you trust me and I'll curate this little like mini label basically stuff. And we do the same thing at HBO with our TV shows. We have a deal with them to do TV and, and they need to go find the next Game of Thrones, which is great. I totally get it. And they're not, they don't have enough people to like curate room 104. So I just say like, just give me a little bit of money and let me go do that. What time do you wake up in the morning? I have kids. Yeah. So I'm usually up at like 615, 630 with them. What time do you go to bed? I get in bed, I mean, this sounds shocking to say it out loud, but I'm in bed probably around 830. Right. And like we put the kids down and sometimes I fall asleep with them and then I read with my oldest daughter and she goes to bed and then Katie and I get in bed and then I'm either reading a book or occasionally like doing a little extra work like emails or watching a cut of room 104 to get back to the editors. And then by 10 o'clock, shut that shit down because I'm like an eight hours or more. Do you sleep okay? Oh, I sleep great. But that's like a DNA thing, I think like there's a divide in my family is my mother and my brother whose stomachs generally bother them who if they take medication, it knocks them out. Okay. Can't really sleep that well at night. And then there's me and my dad who like can eat a rotten carcass, can take 25 Advil and even if we've had seven cups of coffee, 15 seconds after hitting a pillow, we're done. But that doesn't mean I'm not an anxious and depressed person. I have all of those feelings. Okay. I just have the sleeping gene. I don't know what it is. God, what a blessing. It is seminal to who I am. I would not be able to do what I do without it. Just imagine having a four picture deal with Netflix, producing shows for HBO, having kids. And then on top of that, I don't know if you experienced this, but the pressure of like, you got to make good stuff, man. Like you have to make really good stuff because you've set the bar. I don't feel that pressure. You don't feel that. I don't know why I don't feel a pressure. And I intellectually identify with what you're saying. But I feel like I have, I don't know how to describe this. I have a creative process system that's been building since I was like 15 years old, which is predicated on the theory that I don't know best. I'm an inspired person who comes up with a lot of ideas and I can get them out and I can get them going and I can get them to anywhere from 60 to 80% of their potential. And then I run them completely out of steam and then I hand the baton off to someone that I know and trust. And that is at times Jay. Now we have a company of like eight people and a lot of those people can do it. Sometimes it's as simple as me taking a rough cut of that project and putting it in our office screening room for 30 people that are smart to come in and watch and tell me what's wrong with it. I mean the Puffy Chair was a great example. We shot that movie. We screened it for people and then everybody loved it but the first act was totally flawed so we scrapped the first 15 minutes of the movie, rewrote it, re-shot it, put it back in all with our friends' guidance and help and that made the movie and we never would have seen that on our own. So this whole like auteur, dude you got to do this, pressures on you to make it great. I don't ride that way. I'm a rocket ship full of raw ideas and I don't have precision in me. So I go to other people and I'm just like, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming and then just when I'm dying I hand off the baton and then they walk it in with me. How lucky you've got a team like that around you. It's great but I would say you probably do too. If you sat down for 20 minutes and you were like, who are the smartest people I know who can come in and I trust to be straight with me and have good taste, you know, that's what you need. That's my formula. It's just like be your own fireworks and then have like 20 firemen around you to come in and figure out how to do it. Wow. Love it. That's a fantastic advice. I want to talk about, I want to jump back to pre-puffy chair. You were in the puffy chair. What's the protagonist's name for you? Josh. Josh has made this like really sad move from musician to bookie. I've seen it happen so many times and I thought about making that move too. Okay. Yeah. You've been playing music at that time. I was in a band when I made the puffy chair. This is a volcano. I'm still excited. I was still in that band. Yeah. Great music. Really great music, man. Thanks, man. You were currently making music for that band. Did you have money at the time? Were you doing okay financially? I had this weird thing going where Jay and I were one of the first guys to have our own editing system in our early 20s when it was expensive. I could always make money as a freelance editor. Avid? Avid, exactly. I could go out and I could make 25 bucks an hour, 30 bucks an hour doing that. How'd you get it? When we bought our first Avid, I was 19 and Jay was 23 and we sold our cars and bought cheaper cars and used that money to buy the Avid and started an editing business in Austin. How old were you? 19. This is abnormal. Yeah. We were... It's hard to explain the level of desperation and drive that Jay and I have and have had our entire lives. I cannot tell you where it comes from because our parents are pretty incredible, like supportive. The message in our house was, you're amazing. You can do anything. Don't get a job during high school. Your job is to get good grades. We'll pay for it. We went to the University of Texas, which was like a public institution. We got in-state tuition. Our parents paid for the rest of it. We never had debt or any of that stuff. Their whole message to us was, if you want to go be filmmakers and artists, that's fine, but it's okay if you don't make it. You can go to graduate school and we'll pay for that too. What the fuck? I can't look to anyone and be like, man, I had the worst fucking dad, and so I needed to become a success. It was just, I mean, it makes me feel like reincarnation and old souls and all of that stuff have to exist because I just came out punching. You know? Holy shit. I mean, then I guess I just have to get the Bhagavad Gita and read the verse I was just reading today. It's open on my table. I'll be right back. Okay. I really love this verse in the Bhagavad Gita because it's like the question that Arjun is asking Krishna here is, what happens if you start practicing some spiritual discipline and then just get distracted? You're like, fuck that. I'm not into it anymore. Whatever. And so, oh mighty armed Krishna does not such a man who's bewildered from the path of transcendence fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a ribbon cloud with no position in any sphere. And the answer is the unsuccessful yogi after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entity in it. The next incarnation will begin to make incredible mumblecore films. It's in the Bhagavad Gita files right there. Can you believe that? Man, this, it blows my mind. I was thinking like, whoa, I should read this to you. No, it says the unsuccessful yogi after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities is born into a family of righteous people or into a family of rich aristocracy. Or he takes birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Certainly such a birth is rare in this world. Am I the chosen one? Yes. Is that what's happening? I mean, it seems like it. It's like, and I've heard, you know, I, when I was in India once and I was talking to this anthropologist who was studying reincarnated, like reincarnated llamas, you know, the, not the animal, the being, the person, and he was saying he'd hung out with like a 15 year old who was like hanging out with a 40 year old. So that idea popping into your head, it's that feel, it feels that way to me based upon nothing. And I'm not a particularly religious or spiritual person, quite honestly, you know, um, but it, that's the, that's the answer that comes into my head is just like, Oh, I, something happened to me that just put me in this body and just put it on drive and stuck it there. It did. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. It's your, your 15th, you were, you're born in Louisiana, somehow no accent. Yeah. Why? That's, where's the accident? I don't know. You're born, you're born with, you didn't pick up that beautiful, it is a beautiful accent. I love it, but I don't have it. Yeah. You don't have it. And then you're going to Catholic school and probably maybe, I don't know what that was like, but I've never, never heard that's a very pleasant experience. It was fine. I mean, it wasn't anything that like the, the good part about the Catholic school for me was it provided this nice little thing for me to gently fight against to become myself. You know, you got to keep your hair cut short. Oh, I want to grow my hair long and get wild. Yeah. You got to, oh, we got to have a calculus AP test tomorrow. Yeah. But while that, well, I should be studying for that, I want to go write this song. Right. And that was really nice actually to have that, a little gentle enemy. How, wait, you started making music in Catholic school? I started making music. I mean, Jay and I started pretty young. I think we got the drum kit when I was 10 and Jay was like 13 or 14. And we had to beg our parents to give us that and they did and, and just fell in love with that. And then I started playing guitar and put together some cover bands when I was like 13. And, and music was my primary passion for a really, really long time. And I still do miss some elements of, of what it was. But I think by the time I got into my mid twenties with volcano, I'm still excited and, and we were traveling around a lot. Sometimes, you know, I think one year on the road, like 150 days or something and, and I, I'm kind of a, a little bit of a homebody actually. Like I really like being home with my kids and, and being home with my wife and, and I missed Jay. I was out on the road. He wasn't in the band with us. And, and right around that time was when we made the puffy chair. And I, I kind of realized like my lifestyle was going to be a little more suited towards making movies. Right. And then I discovered something that I totally lucked into that I did not diagnose, which is how much easier it is to be creatively sustainable as a filmmaker, as opposed to a musician in a band. Right. Because every project you do, signed, sealed, closed as a movie, put it away and then go and recreate something new, different based on who you are in that moment. When you make a volcano, I'm still excited record. You have to show up a year later, make another record with those same people with basically those same instruments, because they kind of want to hear the same sound. Plus, you have to passionately sing all the songs you wrote when you were a different person two years ago and try to be that for the audience. And you're just not that person anymore. Yeah. I mean, the idea that I might have to take the puffy chair out and perform it now as who I am now, I can't do it. It's not truthful. And I, I don't know how people do that. I do not know how you can sustain singing the same songs 30, 40 years. Gotcha. Because is Blue Jay the most recent film for you? Blue Jay was pretty recent, but honestly, my connection to Blue Jay, that's probably the movie or the piece of art recently that I'm most deeply connected to. Is Blue Jay? Is Blue Jay. Yeah. And that is much like the puffy chair. It's going, it's, it grabs your heart and it's a heart wrenching. It's a real serious thing and it sneaks up on you. It sneaks up on you in the most specific, brilliant way. Oh, thanks, man. So you're just annihilated by it. I was watching it with my girlfriend and she's like, it's going to kill you. That's so funny. She loves you. Oh. Yeah. Where is she? Where is she? She's, ah, she, she's hiding. That's the next part of the podcast. It's going to be great. We're trying to draw you in to a very deep conspiracy where we seduce you. I'm really, I mean, I'm genuinely moved and happy that you love Blue Jay because I want more people to see that movie and a lot of people have and it's a, it's a funny piece of art for me because I look at it and I'm like, oh, I don't know if I can beat this. And there are a lot of pieces of art that I've made that I think are not as connective or good that people like a lot more. Right. It's one of those funny moments you have as an artist where you're just like, this one's actually my favorite. I thought this was going to be the one, you know? Oh, God. Talking about, I was thinking like, man, usually I don't do, like, I, sometimes I just, I'm podcast, I just ramble and ramble, but I just, and I, but I was the, I was one of the challenges. I was like, man, I can only like say it's amazing and heart wrenching, but to talk about the details is to ruin it for people haven't seen it yet. Um, I mean, I can talk about kind of what was behind the movie for me, which was, um, I don't know if you felt like this ever as an artist or, or what it is. I think the form here, probably you don't encounter this, but maybe I'm just projecting. When you struggle as an artist for so long, like I felt I did as a filmmaker and even as a musician, and then you make something that's good subconsciously or consciously, you just stay close to that thing because you're like, yeah, puffy chair works. That's what they want. Fine. All the other shit I did failed. So let me just stay in that lane. Yeah. And I felt like I needed to stay in the lane of the like truthful, dramedy, um, that's personal and, and make sure it has like enough humor in it. So everybody can let and giggle and, and I, and I, and I kind of started branding ourselves that way on accident, you know? And then something started bubbling up inside of me with blue jay that was like, what if I just let the world see that I'm kind of a like schmaltzy uber romantic person. Yeah. Um, and, and I don't go for some of that rye comedy that undercuts it and makes it more palatable and chewable. If I like serve it up just hairy and raw, you know, and that's, that was terrifying to me because I was like, well, no, don't do that because you struggled for a long time. You finally find what people like, just, just give them what they want. You know? And, but I could not stop blue jay from coming. I was like, this is happening. It happened. I think it was right around when I was about to turn 40 and I was feeling a lot of just a nostalgic, sure, schmaltzy person in general. And I was like, I think I just want to rip myself open and just spill it all out into a movie and I hope it goes okay. How long at the time at the time we're filming blue jay, how long had you been married? Um, let's say I shot blue jay, I think in 16. So I've been married for 10 years. 10 years. Yeah. And, um, and Katie and I, we've been together for like, we've been together for like 14 or 15, you know, at that point and have two kids and a solid relationship and, and there's nothing really, um, I mean, I don't know how to talk about this movie without giving away things. Um, it's not an extremely autobiographical movie from a plot perspective, but what was at the core of it was this feeling of, and I don't know why, because I'm so, I'm such a generally joyful, quote unquote happy person and I say quote unquote, because I don't have a lot of peace and calm in my life. I get tons of excitement, tons of joy. I'll come here and meet you. We'll talk. We'll connect. Yes. It'll be awesome. We'll see each other at a party in a month and we'll remember this. Yes. And I'll spike with joy. But do I cruise around the streets with a sense of all as well in the universe and I am at calm? No. No. Um, and, and, and blue jay was about looking back to my childhood and times of my life when I felt some of that, you know, um, and feel like I've lost some of that and I don't know why or where it's gone. Um, and, and, you know, Sarah Paulson is a friend of mine and once we started talking about that, I found that she had quite a bit of that and every time we talked to anybody about it, it was, there was this feeling of, of this, this loss of something. What, what, what, if you can, uh, if you're, how would you describe that something? If you had to, how do you describe that thing that's lost as a moment in blue jay when Sarah Paulson pulls an old diary out of the closet of my characters and she reads an entry from it and it says the winds of change are fucking blowing tonight and there is a self seriousness in that and a, a drama and a, and a, a lighting out with the joy and mania of life that kind of only a 15 year old can have in their diary and I want that back. Yeah. And I'm on the rails and I'm great. I'm great. My life is great. Yeah. But I'm on the rails. Yeah. I got kids, I'm married, I got a career, I got a company, got all these people, you know, and that dude who would like stay up to one in the morning, like fascinating at his own feelings, gripping the pencil and writing about them to himself. I mean, yeah, I don't. Who is that guy? And I miss him. He's coming. I, we're bringing him back. Yeah. We're bringing him back. Cause here's the thing, man. You know. Is this when your girlfriend jumps out? Is this when it happens? Aaron! The queue was bringing him back. She fell asleep. She missed it. Get out! Get out of the closet! Oh, no. I want to, here's the thing though. This is, I want to, when we, we walked into my studio here and Mark saw my modular synthesizers and I, he's like, you said, I can't do that now. I can't do that. See. I can't spend three hours chasing sounds and you said quite smartly, of course you can. You just do it with your kids and they'll explore it with you. And I, my brain went, he's kind of right, but no. And I didn't, I didn't, I almost didn't want to go there and process it. Yeah. You know? Like almost liked having that, that block or something. Sure. Sure. I mean, this is safety. I guess it's like, it's kind of, you know, the thing you're talking about up against the rails and, and the concept that you're not up against the rails. I think that one of the things I love about Buddhism is that it's sort of always pointing towards this truth, which is the phone calls coming, man. You don't know when or what time, but it's coming, that phone calls coming. The doctor visits coming, the things coming, but we pretend it's not. And within that, we think we've, we think we've found some kind of peace when the reality is you haven't found peace at all. You've, you've essentially like the way Chogyam Trumpa puts it is, it's like you're standing on a floor of razor blades and you create an imaginary beam in the ceiling with your delusions and then you climb into the delusion to try to escape this incredible, never ending, terrifying reality, which is that we are being destroyed by time at this very moment. Yeah. We're up against the rails, man. Like it's happening. There's, and, and you, you see these apocalypses happen, you know, on the TV and they're apocalypses. Syria fucking just, you look at those, you look at the, I look at those kids in Syria. I think it when I was a kid in college station. Yeah. And the, but add bombs to that, you know, and, and that's what's really going down. And so it's like getting that, contacting that place again, I don't know, I mean, it's like to become like a terror worshiper, but I mean, really understanding the, the proximity. Allowing that in. Yeah. Yeah. That we let death sort of like, I've heard it said, you let death ride on your shoulder and, and tell, you know, and talk to death as much as you can. And in fact, I've heard the Ram Dassas foundation, the love server member foundation, the remember part is remember God, but it also could be interpreted as remember you're going to die. Yeah. Cause when you start forgetting that, well, I mean, fuck. Yeah. How old are you now? 43. 43. Okay. I'm 41. Yeah. How much of this stuff has been later onset stuff for you for thinking of you always felt and thought this way. I got cancer. I got testicular cancer and had to get one of my balls chopped off. When was that? That was in 2013. Okay. Oh, I'll go. Okay. Yeah. And that was a shift for you. Big shift because you get the like, when that happened, it's really one of the greatest things that happened to me and you'll cancer survivors, you'll hear them say that because what I was living in this bubble of like, I really thought the way I put it is like, you know, people always come down on trust fund kids, but it's like, there's a lot of temporal trust fund kids who people are living as though they have like all these years of their bank account. Yeah. And so they're behaving like trust fund kids with time and so they're sloppy and like just generally disconnected. And so when you, when something like that happens, you, you can't be anymore. You can't be because you, you, you realize like, Oh fuck, I can die. Yeah. Yeah. All a pound puppy syndrome. Like they just like, you have this feeling sometimes of like meeting someone and I sense their energy and you have it or it's just like, Oh, you are extremely excited to be lifting a plain LaCroix to your lips right now. That's right. Thank you for noticing. How is that possible that you have this interest and excitement in that and very good. Let us not underestimate the first sip of a LaCroix. Okay. Good. You know, the metaphor is not sound metaphor is not sound that first sip of a LaCroix. It's like, I imagine that like if we could have met Christ, you may not believe in Christ. I don't know, but let's imagine that we could have met Christ and you got to, to kiss Jesus. That first kiss would be like the first sip of Pamplemousse LaCroix is what we're talking. I think that's, let's get real. But you went to Catholic school and you, but you don't, you're, you don't, you don't feel connected to God. You feel connected to, to Catholicism in particular. Um, I've, I have one thing on my brain now as it pertains to spirituality and the afterlife, which is this irrational, but intense desire to know that I could have some consciousness of who I am to be able to find my children again after I pass. And it only returned, it only happened when I had kids, I don't actually need it for my parents. Sure. I don't need it for my wife, who I love dearly. I don't need it for my brother. Yes. I'm going to, I got to take a ride with those guys for 80 years and it's going to be fucking awesome and I'm good. My children, I have this desperate need to feel that when I go away, I will be able to get back around them somehow. Yeah. And it's not enough for me to feel like, yes, I will be part of the sands and I will I will be a molecular fusion into things. And so you'll still be around them as a leaf as I'm like, no, no, I kind of want to know that I once was Mark and there's Molly and aura and I get to go be with them. Yes. Yeah. And I'm kind of attached to that, which is like, it's an odd thing for me because my whole life has been about letting go of all that bullshit. My success as an artist has been, as we talked about before, let go of being an auteur who knows how to do it all. Fuck all that. Yes. Go with what works for you. Put it out there. That one element is it has become extremely tenacious for me as I've become a father. That's a, I mean, it's a, it's a really, I think it's a, what could be a better thing to explore in your life than that, that question? And just because it's a question that has been infinitely explored in so many strange ways, it's still personally, subjectively, I think it's one of the great questions to like, it's just as a co-on to let zing around in your head that question, to really wonder that what kind of universe is it if it isn't the case though? What kind of universe is it if that's just not going to happen? I think I'm okay with it, honestly. I'm a pragmatist in a lot of ways and, you know, I look at like, again, I keep using this metaphor with my career, but like, I had so many ideas about what I thought my career was going to be. I was going to make the puffy chair at Sundance, then I was going to go become like a career, like Fox Searchlight and focus features filmmaker and make like $10 million movies that would go win Oscars, you know? And then I did one of those movies or two of them and I was like, oh, I don't like this. So now what do I do? I got to recalibrate the mountain I thought I was going to climb. So, and so I go, well, shit, I guess I'll go make my own stuff and I'll do that. And I can bounce around pragmatically and find myself to a place that I, that I, that I want to be. So, if in the spiritual metaphor of that, it is, sorry, dude, you're worm dirt and it's all over. I can, I can get down with that if I have to. I just would love it so much if I could spend eternity with my children. Yeah. Well, if let's, let's just imagine my girlfriend jumps out of the closet and she has, she has like some kind of device, a crystal, a portal and behold, when you die, you will eternally be with these beings and you've eternally been with these beings. Yeah. How would it change the way that you were living on a day to day basis? Oh, that's a good question. Um, well, I'm in a really interesting phase right now of life where I'm in right now what I'm calling semi sabbatical mode. Okay. I know it sounds crazy. She looks at the workload and they're like, Oh my God, you have this Netflix deal and this HBO deal. Yeah. And you're acting these things. It looks like I'm the guy who actually works 16 hours a day and only sleeps four hours a night. I am not that person. I've got a staff of people. I'm very efficient with what I do and I've got a lot of support. So the truth of the matter is like today I got up at 630. I was with my kids for two and a half hours before I kind of dropped them to school. Then I went to work and I had three meetings. I watched a cut of a room 104 episode to advise on and I had a couple of phone calls and and then it's 115 and I leave work and to come do this podcast with you because I had a feeling about it. Nick. Nick Kroll was like, you're going to like this guy. Do this. And I trust Nick implicitly. And I want to make room for that in my life. I want to make room for an exploratory conversation with a new person. Cool. And I wanted to prioritize that. And then I'm going to go home and I'm going to slowly work out to improve my body and I'm going to, I splurged and bought a sauna for my house and I'm going to get in the sauna. Oh yeah. And then I'm going to jump in my cold pool to get the heat and the cold. And then at 430, my nanny is going to have picked up the kids from school, bring them home. She's going to cook dinner for me and the kids while Katie's at work. Yes. And then I'm going to get in the sauna as red as she leaves. And then I will have from 5pm to 8pm with my kids to play foosball, watch the Olympics, play card games, eat, do dessert. And this is everything I have ever wanted. Yeah. This is, this has been my dream that I'm looking for. So if I knew that I could have them in the afterlife or sorry, couldn't have them in the afterlife. Yeah. What I'm living now is a reaction to the fear that I can't have them. Is the, is the, they're 10 years old and five years old right now. They love me. They want to hang out with me. This time is limited. So I have to get it while it's getting good. Is the mode I'm in right now. I might relinquish a little bit of my hold on that if I knew I could have them forever. Maybe that's not a good thing. I don't know. I don't know. I just, I don't know. I don't want the shadow of fear, you know, hanging over this sweet love and, and, and sometimes I mean, I don't, what you, by the way, what you just described as heaven. It's heaven right now. Yeah. I'm, I'm like one of these persons who you normally walk into a room and like, I can keep the, the joy and the fun and the pump up. But like when you look into my eyes, you will see that there is like a desperation and a sadness. Something in there that is missing, that has driven me to do what I do. And it's starting to go away with my kids and my relationship with them in this life that I have now. Wow, man. Yeah. But this shadow, I want to talk about what you were just saying, the thing in your eyes. Have you ever heard the term fundamental dissatisfaction? No, but it deeply resonates with me without even having you explain it. Yeah. In Buddhism, it's called dukkha and it, and it means fundamental dissatisfaction. And so in Buddhism, you have the noble truths of Buddhism and the first noble truth is life is suffering. So that thing that you're talking about, some would say, Oh, that thing is not a broken gear inside of you. That is contact with reality. That is what it is to contact reality is to feel that fundamental dissatisfaction. Life is suffering. And then it goes on to say the cause of suffering is attachment. So we're trying to, and so many of your movies, you know, it's like it has that in it, you know, and, and, and, and the tenacity and the, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that is, um, yeah, that's, so I guess it's just, it's sort of nice to just sink into that, that, oh, yeah, this is what it, this is actually what it is, is it is, and it is, you are there. We're going to lose everything and everyone, and we are there. They're all being aerosolized by time and they're going away and we're watching them go away and we're in a kaleidoscope. You know, when you're looking through the kaleidoscope and it's beginning to shift, that's what we're in, man. Yes, that's the reality. And yet here is love and it feels like it's bigger than the kaleidoscope. And that's what produces for me at least this sense of like, oh no, this keeps going, man. Yeah. And you feel that and you believe that. I mean, you know, I love psychedelics. Have you ever taken, do you ever take psychedelics? Yes, Jay and I took a lot of mushrooms when I was in high school and he was in college and it did some acid. And now, I don't do, I haven't done it in a long time and part of that is getting my life on the rails a little bit. You know, my later 20s, I hit, it's not like a secret or anything, but I hit a lot of depression and anxiety. Yeah. And since then, you know, I take medication, I take like an SSRI to keep myself in this stable place and for better or for worse, I have a little bit of a fear of outward unbridled expansion of my spirit and my mind because I kind of like, I don't know how to explain it, but I feel like left to unbridled expansion, I will probably end up in a bad place and I've made some really good decisions and put some things in my life to get me into this really good place, which is playing above the, I feel like I'm playing above the rim based upon what my DNA is and the spirit that I was left to ride upon. I got you. You know what I mean? Yeah. Oh sure. So I'm kind of like, there's a little bit of don't fix it if it ain't broken because I'm already playing it longer than 20%. That being said, every time my friends are like, I'm going out to the desert, do ayahuasca, there's this little tiny voice deep inside of me that's like, maybe you should do that and maybe if you did all that stuff, you wouldn't have to take these little pink pills that you take. Well, yeah. I mean, this is. But I'm terrified of that. You know, I, so I get depressed. I, I've struggled with depression. I've been on anti-depressants before and so one of my friends is someone I know is a psychiatrist who has a clinic where they do, um, uh, ketamine treatment. And so, um, I was, I, I tried that for my depression and, um, inter muscular ketamine. So they inject ketamine. It's a disassociative and it's an incredibly powerful psychedelic. They inject that into your arm and did you do this at this clinic? Yes. Okay. And, and, uh, and, and I was depressed. I mean, I was depressed. I was like, it was the end of a relationship. I was just like fucking depressed. I know, man, I know, I know what, what it is. And you know, just, just numb, just fucking numb, man. You know, you go completely numb. You, it's so heavy. So, uh, yeah. So what happened was within moments, I had my eyes closed. I was photographically reliving the doctor telling me I had cancer. Photographically, like I was sitting in front of the doctor. He's like telling me, I was like there again. And then it was like now cancer was just spreading through my body. It was in my throat. I was like, I'm dying. I'm having a death trip. And there, it feels like there's a wall that's coming towards me. That's death. And, and I'm trying to have this like conversation with death. Like I'm literally like, Hey, man, why don't we just, I know we're going to do this death thing, but can we talk for a second? I'm trying to be like, Oh, let me drink first. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then, uh, and so, and so then it annihilated. It annihilates you. Your, your identity is annihilated. And in that place, there's still this sense of self-ness. It's just not your ego. But the essence of the thing was I'm saying to death or I'm thinking to myself, I love life. I love life. I don't want to die. I love life. I love life. I love life. And this voice or this resounding truth was saying, you don't love life. Life is love. You're confusing the things you think, you know, Oh, I love life as though it's a thing that can go away. And that's why you're fucked up. And that's why you're so depressed. And that's why you're so freaked out is because you're living in this, this universe where you're going to, uh, you know, you're terrified and you're, you're in a tragedy. You're in the war. And so it was like this anyway, it's beautiful because it does seem to, at least in that state and what, whatever it may be, who knows. And when you rolled out of that, do you forget that and get distance from that? Like, like all things where you're like, Oh, I'm really clear now on Tuesday after I had this on Monday, but a month and then does it swear or were you able to maintain ketamine therapy? It is incredibly effective in treating depression. And you can look it up. The, the studies coming back are unprecedented. They're calling it one of the great breakthrough psychiatric discoveries of, um, I think, I don't know. It's one of the big ones and there's a lot of theories on why it treats depression and what it, what it does. I, my theory is pure Ram Dass hippie, dippy. The reason it treats depression is because we get depressed because we feel stuck in a very, very, very small cubby hole that we call our lives. And we completely forget the eternal nature of the soul. And because of that, we get real bummed out. And it's just a little spiritual dynamite to blow you out. Basically, it's kind of what it is. Yeah, it's like you take the VR goggles off that you've been projecting your life into you for the, your entire life for a second and you look around and remember, Oh fuck, right? This place and then you put them back on and then, and then you get to, you get to walk around and that with, with that little extra, like it's okay, man, or another way to put it would be, dude, do you remember, did your parents ever tell you ghost stories? Not really. No. Were you ever told a ghost story when you were a kid and had fear paralysis sink in? No. Oh my God. Jesus, man. How did you make? I'm lucky. Yeah. I guess the way to put it is it's like somebody's telling you a really, really scary fucking thing, right? Someone's telling you a really, really, really scary thing. And then they stop for a second and they're like, dude, I'm just fucking with you. And then you're like, Oh, you got me. And then they start telling you the scary thing again. But now you can enjoy it a little bit because you're, yeah, that's it. Yeah, you should, you know, if you're, if you are, you should look into it because it's a really powerful treatment. And what's wonderful about it is with the SSRIs, you have to dial it in. It takes about, you know, it could take upwards of a month or two months because you're, you know, you're trying to build up a certain amount of, I guess, serotonin and with ketamine, it's within, boom, within hours. But you have to go back to get the treatment. Like I can't remember. There's like a every month schedule. There's a schedule. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds pretty interesting. I don't think I'm going to do it, but I'm interested. It's pretty, you know what? It's if you're depressed, it's just worth looking into and be like, fuck this. Because it's like what's beautiful. It's not like some like dude, it's not me giving the treatment. It's doctors. Yeah, man. Wonderful surprise. Yeah. Well, DTP. Yeah, I wanted to, but I wanted to talk to you and we kind of covered it, but very quickly. Did you get scared when you started getting hyper successful? Like when you, when you and your brother started like, when it started happening, did you want to put the brakes on at any point? So we didn't have an exponential increase in success or popularity. So I never had that moment where it felt like this is happening so quickly that I don't know how to handle it. It was fairly slow for us. So I think that helped me generally be comfortable in it. But when I was 28, I started having panic attacks. And that was right after we made and sold the Puffy chair, moved to LA and was signing studio deals. And so there's a link there, I mean, for sure. And I think I felt pressure. Yeah. And then I think that I'm very close with my dad and he, his diagnosis, which I'm not totally sure is, you know, he's like, he's like, look, I see you going into these meetings with like these big studios. And and you're still wearing like your your dickies and your T-shirts with holes in them and you're like trying to hold on and maintain that like you're just like this little scrappy indie kid. Yeah. You know, and I think I still do that. I still tenaciously hold on to some weird old image of myself. Yeah. And I think that there's a resistance to that. It took me forever to staff up at our company. Like if you if you looked two years ago at the amount of things that Jay and I were personally doing, like, you know, at the level of success we were at, it was just ridiculous. So there's a lot of pointers that would say I was very resistant to it. And the worst part about it for me, and I've hinted at this before, was reaching the apex of everything I possibly thought I could have achieved when I was 28, which was I'm just some scrappy kid from like the suburbs of New Orleans. I'll if I'm lucky, I'll get a movie and a Sundance one day. And then I'll I won't really make a living at it. I'll become like a professor. But like that was the furthest I thought I could get. Wow. And then when I got to the top of that mountain, I just freaked the fuck out. Wow. Because what do you do when you're on top of your mountain when you're 28? You know, what do you do? Well, Jay and I went to this whole process of talking about recalibrating the mountains and that's something I've had to learn how to do, which is like once you get to one, figure out how to create a climb for yourself. That's not just not an idiotic climb where you're thinking, oh, as soon as I climb this mountain, I'll be happy. But like we need things to struggle against and push towards, you know? So I spent a lot of time doing that kind of stuff now, you know? And and I'm like, that's when you when we when I first got in here, before we started talking, you were like, what's this thing where you're going on these like conservative podcasts and talking to people like that a lot for me was like trying to recalibrate a new mountain. Like maybe this will be something I'll do and this will be interesting. You know, you know, the Zenkoan, Donovan turned it into a song. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It's the way. Yeah, that's that that wave. And you know, I just wasn't very aware in my 20s, too. Like us having this conversation right now, if I'm listening to this my 20s, I'm just like these fucking old dudes trying to create meaning in their lives by theorizing and talking about all this shit. Like you guys, I don't really want to hang out with you like that's where that's me at 25. I'm just like, put your head down and get to work by the fuckers. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like because just the yapping, it's like, what are you doing? Like hit the fucking bag, man. Get it, you know, truth is to hit the bag. It's not to fucking theorize and philosophize. What is that? My like college roommate, we had this amazing experience where like he we were close then and then, you know, as life happens, you get not close. But he like came down to visit LA and he stayed with me like maybe like five years ago and we like it was fun. We like drank a lot of whiskey and we're like just talking about old times. And then he got like really serious for a moment. He's like, hey, I just want to apologize for like I didn't understand what you were doing when like every time I asked you to come and drink beer with me and my friends, you would say no and you would stay in your room and write songs. And I think I kind of like was lightly like criticizing you and being derisive, you know, because I just didn't get it. But like I get it now and congratulations on what you've built. You know, and I think that I just I just I just grew up with this mentality of just like, man, if you're going to try to become an artist from nowhere, you have to be willing to give up all frivolities, give up all meals out, give up everything and just put your head down and fucking go. You know, and that's what I I mean, that's what I did literally up until probably last year and I almost destroyed myself in the process. I mean, I don't talk about this a lot, but like in my 20s, before I started going to therapy and before I started really having panic attacks, like I was so tenacious as a musician, as a like person who's like writing his computer constantly. Like I crippled myself, my arms all the way up into my shoulders where I lost like 30 pounds, I could barely open door. My friends would open doors for me because I and the doctors were like, we think this is carpal tunnel or repetitive stress, but I've never seen this level of inflammation and we don't know how to treat this. And I just lived in intense physical pain for years. And I don't know what I don't know if it was like hell bent on just destroying myself or this feeling of like, you know, man, you you gave up this potential career and, you know, I went to a Jesuit school, all my all my friends when I was 22 were making six figures, you know? And so I was like, you just have to go, go, go, go, go, you know? And I don't know where that came from or why, but it's just how I was built. I mean, it's beautiful is what it is. It's just incredible. I think that they thank God we have people like you out there because otherwise what would there be? You know, there'd just be a bunch of fucking old dudes having a conversation about what would we be talking about now? We'd be talking about no, we wouldn't even have your movies to talk about. I mean, we need people like you to crucify themselves for us so that we can enjoy the beauty that comes out of that, that torment, you know? And I think what's happening now is that one of my greatest fears as an artist was like watching people that I loved as artists through their 20s and their 30s. And then watching them get married and and get happy and start to make terrible, terrible art, right? And I was like, I hope that never happens to me. And for the first time, I'm like looking around and I'm like, I'm going to keep trying to make great art. I am I'm going to do everything I can to do it. But you know what? I know why those people got happy and and stopped making good art because it feels better. Oh, I can see it for the first time. And it feels weird. Whoa, what a choice. It's a weird thing. What a choice you've created for yourself there. I must choose between happiness and being a conduit to beauty in the world. And it's not that black and white. I'm trying to like dial in systems now. Room 104 is a perfect example of what I do where I'm trying to do what I do best, which is like I can I am a I'm good at writing scripts really quickly and getting story ideas out. But I'm actually not willing to sit on set for 15 hours chasing art all day long, struggling to try and make the best thing as a director when I could be home with my kids right now. Yeah. So now I'm like collaborating with younger 28 year old filmmakers who have that desperation that I had and giving them an opportunity to take a shot at that. You know, and I'm seeing if if the cross section of those two can still make relevant interesting art and still allow me to like slow a little bit and have a life. Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen. But that's this is the phase I'm in right now is like trying to find that line. Well, I mean, I just I'm going to I would want to challenge it because it's like what you've when the mind basically it says the wrong the way the Ram Dass people put is like this is the mind. Yeah. So the mind is has created for you. This like I know you were saying it's just this isn't as black and white as that, but still it's there. Yeah. And it's this and so it's basically what it's the predicament is. What do we choose? Yeah. Happiness or fire, love or fire. Yeah. You know, and and and and I just don't believe that's a real choice. And it's something, you know, when many of my friends are comedians and we'll talk about Ram Dass and love and getting into your heart. And they'll be like, I just don't want to do that. Yeah. Because if I do that, how am I going to make how I'm going to make anything funny ever again? Yeah. How will that work? And it's I just think it's it's I actually agree with you on that front. Mine is a little different. Mine is almost more about time and output. Right. You know, literally like the lifestyle of acting and directing television shows and movies is like you work a minimum of a 13 hour day. That has just occurred to me to be like, well, that's kind of inhumane, you know? And and I also had this is kind of obnoxious, but whatever, I'll share it. I had this realization with my dad, who is my business manager because I'm from New Orleans and we're like the mafia. Wow. We did like an accounting of all my finances at the end of this year. And we looked at everything and we looked at each other and and we were basically like, OK, so if I live modestly and I stay inside of a nice three bedroom house, I never have to work again. That's great. Interesting, terrifying, wonderful. But it puts a point on on the decisions you're making, you know? So if I'm I'm not getting joy out of it, if it's not building towards something, well, then just don't do it. Drop it. Drop that shit. Drop it, dude. I, you know, I mean, don't drop it. I love your films. Fucking keep making them. The selfish part of me wants you to be on fire and miserable and like blowing my mind through these films. But also, you know, sometimes you one of the very strange things to me is when you realize, oh, this is a person who could easily just just vanish into the into the darkness. I think about it. I think about it. Oh, my God, man. And that going away, you know, that's that part of the cycle to have the trust and the faith that maybe you could even do that, drift back and become invisible for a little while and then resurrect again and come out of it. Yeah, all this new data and knowledge. Well, this is the whole other thing happened to me right now, too, which I don't know if you get any of this, but like I look at these massive movie stars who can make 10, 15, 20 million dollars a movie for like eight to 12 weeks of work. Yeah. And I'm like, how are you not doing that and donating all of that money to people who really, really need you at this point? Yeah. And you do that. You're filling. I do. I do a lot of that and 20% of your income. You give away 20% about 20%. That's that's 20% on top of paying your manager and your agent and all your people. And that's intense. That's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. And and for me, it's like, I don't know. I have this efficiency thing in me where I'm just like, that is it's crazy that I can be the voice of the Apple iPad Pro and go in and do like 12 hours worth of work total and make what they pay me. Can't even imagine these fucking people who work their asses off to raise their families and then a fucking GM plant closes on them and then they got to go take a $12 an hour job. And I'm like, this is wrong that I can make that money and they have to make that money and then I start getting all heated up again. And then I'm like, OK, nope, not time for semi-retirement. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to go out and you're going to make everything you can possibly make reaping the benefits of this position in society and give all that shit away. And lift the whole thing up. Yeah, yeah, that's it. And this is one of the, you know, I always go back to Ram. That's forgive me. But like one of the things Neem Karoli bought, they say, you know, Maharaja, when he's teaching them, he never said, we do this meditation or we do this for ourselves. He always said, this is what it's going to do for the people around you. It was always about other people. It's really good for other people. Yeah. And when and when you apply that to whatever it is that you do, whether it's making badass films, yeah, or or whether it's this is for them. Yeah, this is hopefully going to help somehow. Yeah, yeah, then it transforms the thing into something really beautiful. I've noticed like it's a dirt, you know, sometimes I'll just sit in front of those modular synthesizers and I'll think, I want to make a sound to express my gratitude for existing in the universe. Yeah. And the moment you start trying to dial that kind of sound in, it becomes instantly more beautiful. Could be the point. I don't mean if someone, my neighbors are probably like, Jesus, fucking Christ, man, is this TV malfunction? Are his dogs on the modular synthesizer again? Yeah. But yeah, it's that that that feeling of like, you know, outflowing instead of inflowing. It's just such a sweet feeling, you know. But do you are you are there any particular charities that you're working with right now that we can help you out with? Yeah, I really, really like Path, which is, you know, people assisting the homeless. It's a California charity that's really they're all based around like getting homeless people a place to live first, then giving them the social work so that they can go find the job from there. You kind of can't do it while they're homeless, you know? But what's happened? Find them section 8 housing and hook them up and get them going. What's happening in LA? It seems like there's a like there's every everywhere. There's a huge homeless explosion and I don't know why and I can't even pretend to know why, but they're just they do the we do these great things with our company. We do these path move-ins where they will find families that are homeless and they get them this section 8 housing where it's like, you know, subsidized rent for them is like 70% off of what the market rent would be or more and then they move in and they're like exciting. And they have zero furniture or belongings. So what we do is like Duplass Brothers will sponsor the purchase of all the furnishings for their apartment and then everybody from our company will come out and we'll spend a day with them assembling their furniture, kind of hearing their stories and moving them in. And it's just so enriching for everybody and for literally, you know, like $4,000 a family, we can give them all those Ikea target basics to get them up and running. You got to let me give you that. I have this very nice credenza in my garage. You do? Yes. I want to donate it. Let me donate it to you guys. Just send somebody with a truck. They can have it. I'm not kidding you. We on Sunday, we moved in two families and then one, one of the guys we moved in. We tried to get him this piece of furniture and it was too small and he needs something else. Wait, do you see this thing? This is nice. It's nice. Do you have a credenza to everybody who comes here? He has every guest of mine. Do you find some way? Is it have we just been like if you've been asking questions to find some organic way to gift me a credenza? I've been trying. I've been thinking like every question was designed to like get to like depression. Credenza. No, I couldn't get there, man. Oh, you can play games with your kids on the credenza. I thought he already has a credenza. No, the idea was the modular sense. I was going to be like, you got to put him on something. You need a credenza. Beautiful. I want to give that to pass. We got it. We got it. You are an inspiring human. I'm so grateful to you for this time. Thank you so much. Hey, man, this is awesome. Hare Krishna. That was Mark Duplass.

Good day to you my perfectly harmonized tapestry of breathing cells. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. What a special day it is today. Not only is it 420, but it is also my birthday. And I'm not ashamed to announce it though I do consider the concept of birthdays to ultimately be a ridiculous kind of bookmark that we place on the circuit of time that we're currently being sucked through and mostly things that either invoke a sense of grief or terror. Some combination of all of those are a shame. Some people are ashamed of whatever particular bookmark they've happened to reach in this particular incarnation for whatever reason. I certainly get age shame sometimes like my god I'm so very old. It's a stupid cult you know it's just the feeling of shame that comes from being addicted to your age has got to be the punishment for worshiping a false god which is the concept of time or the importance of years. You're going to figure it out. Either you've already figured it out if you're over a certain age or you're going to figure it out if you're under a certain age or maybe you've already figured it out just because you're super smart. But one thing you're going to realize is that time is an illusion and that though you might gain some skill when it comes to manipulating the material universe around you that exceeds the skill of other people just because of the number of repetitions that you have practiced while playing whatever particular game it is that you happen to be playing underneath it all there seems to exist an unchanging spark of youth that always is going to feel young and not just young but is always going to feel outside of time. This is the thing in the Bhagavad Gita that Krishna talks about it cannot be burnt by fire weathered by the wind. It was never born, will never die, it never came into being nor will it cease to be. They call it the atman, the soul, there's a lot of different names for it but the older you get the more you begin to hopefully identify with that aspect of yourself and the less you begin to identify with the wrinkly meat that is currently acting as the habitat within which that infinite wind can frolic. So anyway I'm pretty excited today because I just recorded this really cool podcast with someone, it's the first time that he's ever been on the podcast, his name's Ian Lawton and he's working on a movie right now called the Dharma Bum whose main character Dharma Loko was basically the first white guy to become a Buddhist monk. So it's a really cool story, he's going to talk about it, I don't want to give away too much of it but it really is a fascinating story and we had a cool conversation that wasn't just about this movie but got into some interesting and inspiring places. I hope that you will forgive me for going against what I just said in the beginning of this podcast by saying that I considered paying attention to your birthday, a form of idolatry and allow me to be the most absolute hypocrite on planet earth by getting really nostalgic and sentimental for a moment with you guys and saying to all of you how much you mean to me and how incredibly grateful I am to all of you that you listened to this podcast and have allowed me to make a job out of having conversations with so many wise, fascinating, interesting and beautiful people. I really do think this is the best birthday I've ever had in my life and that's a lot of that is because of the connection that I have with all of you guys and the fact that I get to do this regularly and that it actually sustains me here in this dimension. That is mind blowing and so I hope you all really understand just how grateful I am to you and how much I love you even if I haven't met you and how much happiness you bring to me and in this incarnation. Thank you so much. So sappy when you're worshiping time. Oh my god the prayers to time inevitably sound just like that nostalgic and sappy and sentimental but you know what sometimes that's okay you don't always have to be cool you don't always have to be strong you know I don't always have to have that steely prison expression as you wince away the deep feels that come from existing in a dimension where everyone around you is going to die from time to time you gotta let your heart squirt out some of that sweet sappy stuff or what are you doing you're not running your engine on all cylinders man you can't always be in locked up raw sometimes you gotta be in freed freed out and cooked or whatever the opposite of locked up or God I'm sorry I said that but I'm not going to delete it because I'm getting ready for my tour and I don't have a lot of time to spend doing any kind of opening rant and really doesn't matter because I just had such a wonderful chat with Ian and I'm excited for you guys to hear it okay well we're going to dive right into it but first you know what's happening some very quick business this episode of the Duncan Tressel family our podcast is brought to you by Harry's dot com Harry's they're purveyors of some of the finest most high-tech razor blades that exist in this node of the multiverse now listen you might ask how does some bearded hippie know anything about razor blades I'll tell you friend how do I know about razor blades I know about razor blades because for whatever reason my genetics enjoy creating plumes of greasy oily black pubic hair from every quadrant of my body including this area right above my beard which I shaved down because if I don't the hair will grow right up to my eyes planet of the ape style I have to get razor blades when I get razor blades when you're in a pinch for razor blades it sucks you've got to drive down to the local meat market retail store and wait behind a thick plexiglass locked case that is placed there theoretically because shoplifting razor blades is very popular these days so they feel like they've got to guard these things like it's the arc of the fucking covenant so you stand there waiting for some angry manager to come and flip through his keys if you're like me you probably have to pee and in your holding in your piss is this manager shakingly un slowly unlocks this thick plexiglass case and withdraws from it some random over packaged crap thing that you're picking out not because you have any idea why but just because it's more colorful than the other crap things in the case then you go shuffling up to the front of the store you end up paying what you know is the most exorbitant price possible for what can't be that big a deal but it's packaged as though you're buying a piece of what fell out of the Roswell spaceship you feel like you're getting they make it seem as though you're buying a cube of alien technology that is not only going to get the hair off of your face but is going to improve your life and relationships and allow you to truly become a man if you've seen any of these goddamn razor blade commercials where these these rough hewn cowboy style gentlemen use these high tech glistening silver blades to groom themselves and that is subconsciously are transmitting to you the idea that if you use this razor blade you're going to have some kind of facial symmetry then you know what I'm talking about the whole thing is a big stupid scam that we've all gotten sucked into and it tank cool friends tank cool which is why you got to go to Harry's dot com use offer code family hour to get $5 off the amazing razor blades that they are creating over there these are high quality high performing German blades crafting by crafted by shaving experts it's a better shave that respects your face and your wallet I'm reading off the thing now no more poor quality blades efficient business model allows for factory direct pricing at a fraction of drugstore costs plus no past past pesky plexiglass cabinets they do suck these guys really have identified something that sucks so if you get a starter set you're going to get for 15 bucks you get a razor moisturizing shave cream and three razor blades why pay 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades when it's half the price at Harry's so here's the thing friends I've used these blades they sent me these blades and these blades satisfy a few needs for me number one and this is embarrassing but I like getting weird packages in the mail it's pretty cool to get a fancy ass old school box of razors and cool blade and old school shaving cream that's really cool number two I will they're really good and I've used them and they definitely are better than the razor blades that I've bought at stores there is a forgive me for parroting what I'm sure you consider to be a bunch of crap but there is a variance in shaving experiences offered you in this dimension and when I was in college I remember I went to India and actually got a shave using a straight razor in like like a weird like bowl of like handmade shaving cream in India is really cool and scary it was scary I'll admit it there's something scary about some guy in Darm Sala with a fucking straight razor smacking at your face and slicing the hair off because who knows who this guy is I don't know what could happen anything could happen it's scary no matter what when you're around any man with a straight razor it's kind of fucking spooky if you're at a barber shop and you're getting the old school hipster straight razor shave you don't know shaving you you don't know the guy who's shaving you in downtown Eagle Rock you don't know what's in that guy's basement you don't know what's that where that fucking razor has been friend that straight razor when you're down at the old school hipster barber shop and the guys that got all the dice tattoos on his hand self in that guy that you know I'm talking about the the new breed of barber and I got nothing against barbers in fact I'm dear friends with my sweet sweet barber he works at the new California barber shop on Sunset Boulevard free plug inside a plug but I don't get him to shave my face with a straight razor though I would and I only trust him because I've been there many times the point is it's scary for another man to shave your face which is why these razor blades that Harry's offer are so freaking cool because they give you the exact same kind of experience it's that same kind of shave when you leave after getting shaved down by a pro shaver using a high-tech razor blade there is a big difference in the way your face feels allow yourself the experience go to harrys.com support them because they support this podcast use coupon code family hour you will get five dollars off these blades it's also a cool gift for friends in your life who shave all the time and I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't use it so give it a shot go to harrys.com use offer code family hour and you will get five dollars off these sweet beautiful blades I don't know if they're sweet definitely don't taste them but you know what I mean all right great there's our ad dear friends as many of you know and for those of you who live in different parts of the world and country I'm sorry for repeating these commercials about the tour but I got to do it we're going on tour there's only two shows with tickets left praise a la we've sold out all the other ones Arlington and Philadelphia so on the 22nd of April I'm going to be in Arlington at the Arlington Draft House with Abby Martin and I'm going to be at the Trocadero Theater in Philadelphia on the 24th with Johnny Pemberton I really hope you guys will make it out if you're in either of these spots and are thinking about coming get tickets now the shows do sell out and it sucks when people can't get in I hope to see you there and we have added Michael Daener to the as a guest on the show in Philadelphia he is a meditation teacher who was a drug dealer in Afghanistan during the 60s I had a long chat with him was introduced to him through Ragu Marcus he's super cool so the combination of Johnny Michael and I is going to be pretty badass I really hope you guys will come to the show were you aware of the fact that are you aware of the fact the questions are you aware that's the first question if you are aware are you aware that in a great many indigenous traditions there's the concept of poisonous darts they can get thrown through the multiverse and embed themselves into your astral body causing you endless suffering sorrow and discontent it's true they call it the evil eye and in Europe there are so many various bits of jewelry that you could wear to shield yourself from the dark glare of the playaheda who shoots his or her poisonous dart into your soul every time they look at you with a sense of contempt or jealousy or anger or whatever it is whatever bit of poo they happen to be slinging at your soul this is why I have created with the help of the local local God who cares if an artist is local they're just wonderful no matter what and this artist is wonderful Ron Regi the amazing artist created for me a sigil which has within it so many varying symbols that are designed to shield you from the shower of crap that can come spraying into your soul from all the sleeping sad and angry people that sail through this life like living cacti shooting their dark thorns into the hearts of all those that they pass these shirts not only will they shield you from the poisonous darts of the contemptuous playaheda but they will also draw to you so many incredible extra dimensional beings that if you are clairvoyant and psychic you may see them flying out of the wood paneling of your school or home or rising up from the floor of whatever your job happens to be and landing on your shoulder and whispering sweet mantras into your ear like you are perfect you deserve love you are love eat more chocolate enjoy orgasms more they'll say a lot of different things and if you don't like what they're saying you can always tell them to go away but these shirts are truly magnets for good energy and shields against the dark and if they're if you don't believe in all that nonsense then they just have a really badass design on them uh that contains within it a lot of powerful symbols that Ron Regi put together after we had a conversation so I hope that you will go to dunkintrustle.com and visit the store and pick up some of these t-shirts for you and your loved ones so that you can identify yourself as a listener of the DTFH and shield yourself from witches and when I say witches I don't mean the stereotypical version of witches but the Hollywood bad witches there's good witches too let me rephrase I know I want to be politically correct when it comes to witches because some of my dearest friends are actual witches dark witches will no longer be able to penetrate your soul and the light witches will be drawn to you and the light will be drawn to you and there will be a rainbow in your heart most of the time can't guarantee it though that's a real fizzled advertisement isn't it oh well I don't have time to

man and I don't know if you know this place do you have you ever heard of mead no I never have I've never been Ireland oh you've never been okay well you should come I'll show you around I'd love to I'd love to and isn't it crazy to think that you are in Ireland and I am in the United States and we are communicating via Skype instantaneously that is nuts if you think about that it is it blows it but modern technology is is certainly blows me away in and in what we're capable of doing I mean even me putting together this sort of campaign that I'm running now and that this kind of technology has allowed me to talk to the likes of yourself and and talk to people all over the world it's it's incredible and this this is your crowdfunding campaign for for the movie you're trying to make the the Dharma bum the Dharma bum that's right now this is um you I was connected to you I know you know this but for everyone listening I was connected to Ian via Ragu because he's working on a movie about a kind of I guess you'd say an unknown saint an unknown Buddhist saint is that fair to say well sainthood isn't really applicable to Buddhism though is there but aren't we allowed to make whoever we want to say it I mean isn't it you know well to me he's he's an absolute hero and there we go the fact that the fact that he's he's he's influenced my life greatly a hundred years after his death that and I want to tell the world his story his I guess says a lot for his his legacy really now what's his name well he was he had a few names he was born he was born Lawrence Carroll in the year 1856 in a small town in the south of Dublin called Booters Town and um yeah well I just well I just go ahead and start telling you about him well yeah I mean why don't you describe what it was like in Ireland in 1856 1856 Ireland was it wouldn't have been for an Irish native it wouldn't have been the most pleasant place to live it was in in the midst of the British colonial rule the first their first colony so and being born in 1856 it would have been a country that was sort of under the thumb of both the British and the Catholic Church so um yeah so you're a very kind of a repressed people um a very stifled kind of existence you were just living living to work really and um yeah so that the the church really had a stranglehold on people and and the British had a stranglehold on on the government and how the country was run what kind of stranglehold did they have what what do you mean the church had a stranglehold what were they they weren't burning witches or anything were they um um let's see um to go back into the Irish history they were very domineering um well to put it to put it to you this way that a lot of things are coming to light nowadays all these years later from the the activities that the the Catholic Church in Ireland got up to from child abuse I mean they're recently um over in in the west there was corpses of I think something like 500 babies were found in a septic tank in the grounds of an old church you know so that they would cover up lots and lots of stuff there was I don't know if you know of the Magdaline laundries where um like women who were who became pregnant out of wedlock were treated like absolutes gone by the church and like their babies were ripped out of them taken away and sometimes ended up in a septic tank you know wow you know it was just woeful woeful the treatment of and it's it's only in the last few years with the Ryan report and things like that where the the abuse that the the Catholic Church had on the people of this country back then and everyone kept it very quiet and kept it secret I mean the secret was kept really safe so they so people were keeping quiet that the Catholic Church had invaded Ireland and had started a kind of organized campaign of child sat that involved child sacrifice well that's probably going a bit too extreme it was just uh you know if a woman was um pregnant out of wedlock she was she was you know it was a sin and sin was was a real like the worst thing you could commit like getting pregnant like the most natural thing to happen to to a woman who who who lays with a man is is considered to be the most disgusting thing to occur um all right I could you know we could go on but wait but wait I just want to the uh the septic tank filled with babies yeah the idea is the Catholic Church killed those babies well they were yeah well they were removed removed from from the women who were who were pregnant so these were like late-term abortions they were keeping them secret you know they were like this was this was all kept kind of behind closed doors um because you know and and they were called illegitimate children as well and um because this is a thing you know it's just interesting to me that and I know the term child sacrifice is sounds like I'm being majorly sensationalist here but I have noticed that people who tend to sacrifice children never call it child sacrifice they always have different names for it but it basically is the same thing from sending soldiers to parts of the world to get exploded to getting like young people to like give themselves brain damage through playing football or all the various ways that power structures tend to uh destroy youth for their own energies never are they called child sacrifice there's always different it's always they always have hilarious names for the child sacrifice in this case what was it they were saying that was called illegitimate children they had a different name illegitimate children yeah they were just if they're not born within wedlock yeah they're considered illegitimate yeah that's right which means they cannot be buried and in consecrated ground and all that kind of stuff oh got you so they're just disposed of as if they were trash oh I got you yeah yeah I got you and then you know God only knows what other stuff was going on you know and I don't mean to do any Catholic bashing I actually saw a statistic of how in the various denominations of Christianity and world religions there is a disturbing amount of pedophilia that goes on but we that's a huge huge component to this as well yeah we can't even imagine you know back then when there was no internet no way to get this information out and when the church had such great power that even if you dared to mention that a priest had been fucking a kid that was it for you man you'd probably end up in jail or worse so we can't even imagine the other terrible things that's precisely the the stranglehold that we were talking about earlier is that is that they had on the populace you know well there we go man I think that's a pretty good setting of the scene imagine imagine if where you live right now whoever you are that's listening imagine if where you live right now had a Christian version of the Taliban that was being supported by a super power and had taken over your country and driven you into a life of shame and misery and sadness is that that that's it yeah I kind of want to preface this as well that even though the this story has a lot of a sort of anti-christian anti-catholic kind of sentiments I don't kind of personally I don't I don't have a problem with people who who find solace in in the teachings of Christ and things like that you know if that's if that's your thing and that works for you then more parity it's just when you use it to sort of to demean and abuse other people like when it comes to equal rights like the right to for gay marriage etc when you use it to for for bigotry and hide behind your you know that the book that you they hold sacred for you know that is what I have a problem with yeah yeah I just thought you know Christ was it was a righteous dude he was he was a cool guy you know if you if you strip away all the kind of supernatural elements I think he had a lot of he had a lot of beautiful things to say even with the supernatural even with the supernatural elements he was a cool guy I don't know if you've heard that song Jesus could have turned what does it say Jesus could have turned Jesus turned water into wine he could have turned uh something I'm gonna misquote he could have turned uh grass into marijuana if you wanted to he was a great guy and I love the miracles and I love all of it and I think these the people who are listening to podcast know how I feel about that but I'm and I'm also equal I'm also fascinated by the way that this amazing drama of Satan and God gets played out you know and it sort of lends credence to the notion of some supernatural demonic force when you see that uh wearing the that this this energy in the universe it is the energy of dissipation corruption debilitation this energy likes to wear the mask of its opposite and parade around as its opposite doing the most atrocious and vile things throughout the world in the name of its enemy it really is an incredible uh formation that happens in the symbol structures that we call organized religion uh and it happens in such a perfect and incredible way that to me it's it's awe inspiring and it's so spooky that here you have this religion of love peace empathy uh healing uh and and it gets reflected into the universe through people who are dead asleep and transformed into its opposite and that is just amazing and people get sucked into that tornado generations of people get sucked into an uh the cyclone which is the reversal of the very thing they think that they are worshiping it's like it's like generations of people who think that the the the the the the shit at the salad bar is ice cream and they've been they've taught each other to just take big scoops of shit and smile while they're eating it oh isn't this shit good oh you better say it's good or you're gonna go to hell don't you love it mmm it's delicious that's what it is when right there at that very salad bar on the other side if you go to the root of what most of these religions are it's just the sweetest most delightful delicious sustaining thing ever but you never get to that side of the salad bar because it's being guarded by men and women dressed like penguins yeah i i mean i personally had my had had my fill of those uh during my childhood i was i was raised um raised roman catholic so i had um i was taught by nuns and again by christian brothers and uh yeah i i i never ended up any in in any kind of uh sexual kind of abuse which a lot of people did but i was certainly physically and mentally abused by by these people yeah it was it was tough now we're talking about like late 70s early 80s so it's an in sort of recent history so yeah so uh so yeah so imagine even now i mean i'm sure there's people you know ever i know so many people who've been you know psychologically abused via catholicism uh that it's it's still i'm nearly 44 years of age and i still suffer from catholic guilt yeah they get you man just beaten into me as a child they get you it's a piece you know they get you're right there too and by they get you right when your neurons are forming you know they get you right when you're you know i i can't remember the name of this wonderful chemical that i really want to find but apparently there's this new drug that you can take that puts your brain into the state that kids are at when they're learning because you're you know you're more wide open then and you're the way that you're it's a yeah fascinating drug and you know people say that when you're on it you have to be very very careful to have your phone turned off and to be in a place where you're not going to get disturbed because whatever is happening is going to imprint uh on into your brain with more intensity than otherwise so i think that's the state that kids constantly live in their brains are wide open and they're getting so deeply imprinted neurologically by whatever they happen to be around that when they're around this you know generational form of uh of conditioning that has as one of its primary methods the use of fear and shame and guilt that you end up with some circuits in in your motherboard that uh just are are only going to produce in you for your entire life varying shades of what you're talking about until you figure out a way to uh dissolve those circuits and rewire them uh so and so many people i've met so this is to me it's just it's fun to talk about this stuff in in relation to your story so that people fully understand um what what our hero was born into because no doubt he must also have been laboring under this strange combination of resentment and respect and shame and fear that uh catholicism seems to uh stamp onto so many people's souls well here here's the thing he actually he was born right next door to the local catholic church so he was right in there on the front lines and i think that kind of prompted him to uh because he became an alcoholic very quickly right i think early early teens he really hit the bottle so obviously there's some kind of abuse or some kind of whatever in in his background um before he's before he left the country and he left the country very early they think about 17 or 18 years of age he made his way because buddhist town is very near dunleary and dunleary is a port town so that got him over to liverpool in uh in england and he was working on the docks over there and um and because back in dublin he was um he was the son of the local greengrocer so that kind of experience uh got him a boat sorry he got him a job on the ship's pantry in the on the liverpool docks which in turn took him to new york and new york around that time um was like gangs in new york you know this scorsese movie yes so it was that kind of uh that we're talking about that that kind of time um and so he was traveling in a time with no passport so he was changing his name left right and center um and he kind of bummed his way across the usa then once he got to new york um sort of living hand to mouth being a real bum um hobo jumping trains you know being uh being a beatnik way before beatniks were invented right um and again his his shipping skills got him onto the the fruit ships of um the sacramento rivers so he was working his way up and down there till he got to san francisco and in san francisco then he started working the ships again which brought him uh to japan the shipping route to japan the commerce route there wow and the the story goes that uh on sort of the third trip returning from japan to san francisco he was him and his mate were kicked off the boat for drunken disorderly conduct and just you know he woke up hung over on the beach watching his ships sail away back to back to new york leaving him there alone god you're so fucked like can you imagine how fucked you are like you are so fucked because this isn't there's no air you're not going to catch a plane back like you are screwed man you like you are deeply deeply fucked if you find yourself in the hundreds of years ago on a beach in japan with no an alcoholic just just shipwrecked on in another country he definitely didn't speak japanese right there's no way no not at all this was like his only a third time in japan oh wow i say he was only probably there for an like an afternoon maybe stayed overnight before heading back so on this time he just uh the the crew had enough of him and kicked him off the boat and left him there wow um apparently how much of an asshole do you have to be to get kicked off a boat in japan like you must like it's really i mean you gotta be like really doing some awful stuff for a people on a boat to be like look man we're we're gonna have to shipwreck you in a completely different country because you're that much of an asshole i know it's crazy to think that yeah i just to think where he ends up as well later on in his life i would look but the weird thing is is that he ended up um he made his way to berma somehow going all the way down through southeast asia um fueling his alcohol you know living hand to mouth continuing his his his booming about and working along the coastline of southeast asia till he got to berma where he was working as a tally clerk apparently um i'm not exactly a hundred percent sure what a tally clerk does but it's something to do with taking tickets or whatever weird but he was he came across a flyer uh that explained buddhism attract that explained buddhism um obviously berma was uh was a huge buddhist country at the time yeah not at the time but obviously is um so he he made his way to a local monastery after reading a little flyer um about buddhism and um the local buddhist took him in and he dried out they had such a profound effect on him that he quit the bottle and he dried out wow and after he decided to become an apprentice monk and after five years as an apprentice he uh in in i think it was june of 1900s he was the first ever white man to be ordained to buddhist monk now that's that's documented that's for sure like in the in the world this is the first Caucasian to become a buddhist first guy that's nuts that's incredible that we even know that that's an amazing thing that we even know who that is but that is wild i mean that is an epic moment in the history of of that's an epic moment in history to think that yeah i mean it's like the the missing link really to the western buddhism wow crazy and it's all thanks it's all thanks to these fantastic professors there's these three professors who have managed to piece this guy's life together like i said earlier he was living in a time without passports so he was constantly changing his name and had aliases so for them to be able to piece together his life from these fragments of information and figuring out that they were talking about the right person it's just astonishing that is amazing to think that the first white buddhist became a buddhist because he was too much of an asshole to stay on a boat that's one way of putting it i guess crazy i mean he certainly had a a whirlwind of a life leading up to that point but to be honest with you that like him becoming a monk is just the beginning of this story is really what what he did as a monk then that makes him a legend in my eyes pardon me i've got some gas i've just eaten my food dinner pardon me i'm belching no problem man you don't have to say yourself this is a podcast you could burp for the next 15 minutes and nobody's gonna care that much but um um getting back to this guy he was um like like i said him becoming a monk is really just the beginning of the story because um at the at the time when he became a monk in 1900 Burma was in the process of being colonized by the british and him coming from a british colony he really took onbridge with this he he fell in love with buddhism so much that he really profoundly affected his life so much so much so that he i mean he quit the bottle the transformation from from a drunken bomb to a dharma bomb is is you know extraordinary and um for him to see uh the british come in and try to destroy this thing that he discovered that's so sacred to him he really took offence and onbridge to this and how the british were doing this how they sort of softened the blow of their of their colonization was to send in missionaries first and foremost right to convert the buddhas to christianity in order for them to sort of ease make the make the job of taking over their country easier right um so that's that's essentially who who damaloka sorry his name became damaloka after he was uh after he was ordained his ordained name was udamaloka what does that mean does that mean anything um i i've in certain things i've read people have said it's the irish pongi but i think that might have may have been just a nickname that he had because he because of him uh he went on preaching tours all up and down southeast asia so he and because he was a white man with a shaved head and in saffron robes he became he was an odyssey he was a became a real celebrity yes it's a great hook it's a great hook like you're definitely gonna sell tickets if you're the first white mug anyone's ever seen that's definitely it later on he's he'd steal so much thunder as well like lord quersan that that famous british emperor like showing up at one point um showing up in this town where he's supposed to visit and nobody was there to greet him because damaloka was up the road and had stolen the entire audience you know amazing but um so so what he did was uh like about a month or so after his ordination he placed an ad in the the local burmese newspaper which essentially stated uh he he he said he proclaimed himself to be the bishop of rangoon and forbade any christian tracts or bibles to be handed out in in berma and and said you're not allowed to do this by order of you damaloka the bishop of rangoon i mean he wasn't the bishop of rangoon he just made that up just to give himself some sort of gravitas wow but he you know he that was sort of the beginning of him sort of making his announcement publicly that you're not allowed to do this and you know if you fuck with me you're going down i mean this is one man standing up to the mind of the british empire yeah and the way he had to do it was by combating christianity and i think a lot of people hear that and they think what the fuck this is the this is the all embracing this is buddhism it's not supposed to be differentiating uh one one religion from the other but if if you understand that it's not so much the christianity that he was combating it was the people who were wanting to use it as manacles to uh psychologically enslave people that were about to be invaded and that's what he was fighting against not the the religion itself it seems like exactly yeah and obviously he'd he'd witnessed the stranglehold um back in his old country you know and and i think he saw a solidarity with these people who he had you know he who he left and led it into his heart and said you know this i don't want i'm not going to let this happen i've seen what happens when they come where they fucked up my country i'm not going to let them fuck up yours kind of thing yeah and uh which is the most admirable thing you you know i can i can think of and a dangerous very dangerous thing to do and very dangerous yeah absolutely i mean he he his first arrest i mean he started because he was he was an anarchist really um a total activist and um his first arrest was when he approached an off-duty police officer uh British police officer obviously on the on the swedagon pagoda and the swedagon pagoda is a sacred ground in in rangoon and um no shoes are allowed essentially um when you walk in this in this area you remove your shoes that's just a given yes um unless you're unless you're a police officer on duty yes and um um he was he was there um and approached an off-duty police officer uh who was wearing shoes and uh he confronted them and demanded that he remove his shoes that you're disrespecting everyone here and remove your shoes and the the police officer is refusing and damaloka came out with the line um you've trampled all over their country now you're going to tram now you want to trample all over their religion and they threw through in jail for that he was arrested and dragged off to jail because obviously people started to gather and you know they were very afraid of sedition and that was one of the charges that he he ended up getting he was charged with sedition later on i mean it was from from 1900 to roughly 1911 he was um he was that was sort of his reign of terror if you like right so it's just just oh just a little over a decade where he was um i mean he ended up being uh under police surveillance no matter where he went when he went on his preaching tours all through Sri Lanka and places like that um i mean he was he was so ahead of his time he was in china he opened up one of the first multicultural schools for english i mean he um he did so much stuff he a lot of stuff sort of fell fell apart he was very good at um sort of setting up things like the buddhist track society which was a publication where you'd hand out free tracks tracks are like um you know newsletters that kind of thing because here's the thing men people don't understand sorry to cut you off like for us modern modern humans whatever that means the the notion of buddhism or the idea of buddhism is not it's like yeah we see buddhist monks at the airport there's buddhist textbooks or buddhist books everywhere there's so much buddhism is just immersed itself in all the cultures of the world but at this time i don't think people were so aware of it they didn't know what it was at all so people hadn't been introduced to these ideas which if if you've ever studied buddhism uh you quickly realize how different a religion this is compared to most other religions because it seems to be more of a a process than a religion it's more of a series of exercises philosophy really isn't it philosophy and it's a and and it's a uh it's a kind of um you know they say that uh we take you take up the dharma you and the dharma you take up these ideas in other words it's not like i just believe this is real and i don't understand it it's like you not rules to follow it's just a path to to live really yeah and you have to digest it and the the more that you digest it the more your former self begins to transform not because you have taken a leap of faith so much is because you've begun to assimilate these very very powerful truths into your life that quite often run counter to the way most of society thinks you know so much of society is based on the individual so much of society is based on power trips and the ego and and and so much of society is based on differentiation when buddhism uh it seems at least the my encounters with it it produces a kind of dissolution uh of the boundaries between me and everything else and it does in a very systematic almost surgical way so it's kind of cool that people nobody really knew about this and um that's that's that's what's so amazing about this story to me is that here you have like uh this is like um this guy was infected basically with this information and then he started transferring it uh all over the world and the his ability to transfer it was um maybe a little more potent than other people because back in the day I think people listened to it was just so unique he saw them but you got a buddhist honky here man so he's like this is a powerful thing like it's people are gonna listen even though what he's saying is probably no different than the message that's been transmitted from the universe for thousands of years just because of his special identity uh during in relation to this time period he was an excellent excellent amplifier of this information yeah which is pretty cool and that you know the thing that here's another thing that I'd love to talk with you about is um just how like I think as individuals it's really hard for us to imagine like oh little old me I I'm just a drunk you know like whatever your particular miasma that you found yourself stuck in whoever you are listening right now and everyone's got their own little tar pit they're stuck in you look at the tar around your feet whether it's the shitty relationship the depression the addiction the um the disease the whatever it is you know the thing that you think you're stuck in and then while being stuck in this stuff you no doubt experience from time to time these moments of feeling like you've got a really important thing to do in this world that doesn't involve making money like you get that you know what I'm saying that sense of like shit man I want to I feel like I can help people and around me and it's a weird feeling if you're a drunk it's a weird feeling if you're an addict it's a weird feeling if you just finish throwing a vase across the room because you were in a fight with your husband or your wife it's a weird feeling when you you know you perceive yourself as being covered in the tar of this of maya uh when when and suddenly coming into you is this sense of like there is a greater path for me than this but look at me I'm a fucking asshole I'm not you know I think I am not gondi and so that's another beautiful thing about this story is here you have someone who was so wretched so fucking wretched a drunk so wretched but he came into contact with this information and uh not only transformed his own life but began but became an an actual threat is it safe to say he was a threat to one of the largest empires on the planet I think it was considering they erased him from history deliberately would suggest that they were felt threatened by his words and his actions erased from history by the fucking empire think about that that is so wild like because not by the way nothing better can happen to you than for some power structure to erase you from history that is like way better than sending flowers to your funeral that's like you are so potent and so dangerous to the paradigm we were trying to transmit into the world that we are going to try to wash you off of the chalkboard of time if we can that's pretty badass absolutely and that's precisely the reason why I want to make this movie that I want his legacy to be known by as many people as possible yeah well I don't want sorry go ahead no I just I was I was my my you know I was um no I was just gonna say that um my apologies Duncan I've lost my train oh no problem man I do it all the time I constantly smoke marijuana so that's like just par for the course usually when that happens to me I just go and you know and then and then try to think of something remotely but really here's the thing man you I really are you familiar if you ever uh when I was in college I read this book The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky have you ever read that book no I've read other Dostoevsky I haven't read Brothers Karamazov it's great man and there's a one of my favorite um essays in there is about uh Saul of Tarsus who was uh you know I guess you could say he was one of the first Christian missionaries so he interestingly enough in a lot of ways there's a parallel between our hero here and uh the first Christian missionary uh Paul his name was Saul uh and he was someone who like back in the day it was very popular and fun to throw rocks at early Christians because why I don't know I guess they were obnoxious back then or people were just like shut the fuck up about Jesus and they would like throw rocks at them and so one of one of uh one of these persecutors of the Christians was um this uh person named Saul and the story goes he's walking down the road to Damascus has a vision of Jesus Christ who says to him Saul Saul why do you persecute me and in this moment of contact with the Christ consciousness he has a personal transformation his he goes blind becomes Paul he's sent into Damascus runs into some Christians and he's the person who founded the early Christian church which is really interesting and a lot of people say what we see in the post gospels in the epistles is actually not Christianity it's called Paulian theology which is a translation of Christianity but it's really an interesting story and the parallel is here you have a scumbag who likes to throw rocks at very sweet people meets this incredible potent consciousness and transforms to become one of the great missionaries of the particular religion that he was associated with it's a it's an archetype I guess but Dostoevsky in this essay he uh he ponders what happened in that moment of transformation uh did Jesus or whatever spirit he encountered that came down from the sky touch him in such a way that it created a kind of atomic shift or a metaphysical shift inside of him that he couldn't have done anything about there was no way to resist it there was no way to stop it you just get touched on the heart by our sweet Lord Jesus and bang you're a better person if so then this is a very dire uh appraisal of Christianity and we're in a lot of trouble because it means Jesus is just some kind of alien that can shoot a spiritual healing beam at the dark part of your heart and whether you like it or not you're going to turn into a good person thus all free will has been completely eradicated the other the and since Dostoevsky was an existentialist a Christian existentialist he said no what happened was Saul had this experience maybe he didn't have enough water to drink or maybe uh you know he just something happened neurologically or maybe he ate the wrong wheat that had some fungus on it Dostoevsky doesn't say that but who knows what happens Saul trips out has this vision and because he's finally had a vision he uses it as the excuse to become his optimum self and uh I love that I love that idea because it's like yeah sure Buddhism great the picking up the the dharma great Christianity great uh uh Islam great the visions great all of them great great great great great but really all they do is give you a perfect excuse to become a better person that's it and that becoming a better person you're the one who does it you're the one who does it you're the one who pulls yourself out of the tar and whatever symbol structure you want to use to do it uh you get to pick it's right there for you you know what I'm saying it's that goddamn imminent transformation that is floating in front of all human beings at any given moment that blows my mind that at any second in this dimension if you want to you can achieve what unfortunately is an overused and misunderstood word enlightenment attainment you can realize that we are inside the most divine incredible beautiful sweet smelling temple of of time any whenever you want and it really doesn't matter which way you do it it's just that you can do it and stories like this which is it sounds to me that this is a redemption story or so inspiring because man it's real I just think people just need to keep going back to the fact that this was a drunk who got thrown off a boat you know this is a drunk who got thrown off a boat like the bottom of the rung that's pretty much the bottom of the rung there man you are a homeless man homeless alcoholic on a beach in japan who transforms into one of the great modern buddhist teachers of our time threatens one of the great world powers and gets erased from history until thank god someone like you comes along and is like we're gonna we're gonna get this information out there and this is where it gets even more spectacular to me is that the way that you're getting this information out there is using a brand new technology which is broadcasting this story at this very moment around the entire planet how wild is that man it's like this little seed that you've discovered now you've managed to use a technology that has only existed in the last maybe decade or so 15 years uh you to amp to to reproduce it and amplify it and send it into the brains of so many people all around the planet that's an incredible thing to think about to me that's really fucking cool wow thank you thank you thanks for getting this stuff out here man i just i think it's so cool to hear these stories especially ones that no one's heard of no one i never in my life have ever contemplated who was the first who was the first year a white white person who got in touch with buddhism it's something no one even thinks about no one even considers that so it's really cool man and so i was i was completely floored when i when i first first read the information and um i was just thinking like why don't why isn't this common knowledge why why isn't he in our in our history books why isn't he in our textbooks why then why didn't i learn about this guy at school you know you got the likes of you know oscar wilder michael collins or other sort of big names in irish history but udam aloka has just has never existed in in in this sort of consciousness you know and um he's sort of he's known bits and pieces in academia people who go out of their way to study history of religion etc and and they're the only people who are who are aware of them at this point and that's i think he's too important a person his story and his legacy and and his is you know his lust for life really is he's up there with you know lennie bruce or marthin luther king people who who just stood up for what they believed in despite any of the odds and just went for it with tenacity and righteous indignation and just ah righteous indignation power just with you know powerful with the correct you know what i'm trying to say yes i do know what you're trying to say i i i become very inarticulate when i get when i get personally uh sort of emotional about about this man you know well it's fascinating in a way that you are like him you are you you feel the same way you feel driven in the same way to get this story out there you're you are you're you're transmitting you can you have actually it seems like absorbed a lot of his energy and are feels like yeah yeah it feels like that i mean i i there's this so saying and i don't know if it's a song lyric or whatever it is uh whoever coined this phrase but it's uh religion is for is for people who are afraid to go to hell whereas spirituality is for people who've already been there ah yes yeah right and i don't know who coined that but i i i live by that right now oh i love that and i can see the damaloka he went through his his hell and then came out the other side as you know reborn i mean that's that's your rebirth right there isn't that yeah i look at you know what i look at it transformational arc from from from from a nobody to to somebody so important and then to be and then back to a nobody for a little after nothing you know that the candle was blown out until 2009 you know hundred hundred years later you know that thing you're saying about spirituality versus religion uh you know what it reminds me of is the right when um and you know ron dos of course talks about he's so good at articulating the idea of all these various channels that we can tune into at any given moment and uh but it does remind me like i still i'm old enough now as you are to remember when there was only 13 channels on the tv you're three main ones and you are i can remember like two you'd be lucky if you there was one like i remember in north caroline we had this little tv and if you got the antenna just right you could tune in to put uh to to god a station that had doctor who but it would come through really fuzzy and foggy and it was like still like oh my god we got it we got it for a second it was amazing uh and and then and then cable happened and then suddenly you get these crystal clear channels and it was just like oh my god look at all these other things we could watch and to me that's kind of what uh spirituality is it's that it's suddenly it's those crazy moments in the midst of whatever your particular hell happens to be uh whatever it is and it doesn't have to be something as dramatic as alcoholism it can just be the general sense of anxiety and emptiness that fills the hearts of anyone who's taken the smallest amount of time to consider the fact that they are going to die uh it can just be that that kind of aching thing of like knowing like you know i love all these people around me but they're all going to die and so am i i actually just saw the uh i actually just saw the somebody on reddit asked like since like 10 000 bc how many people have died and you know obviously it's in the it's in the billions it's everybody it's everybody uh so you know that that um that at first can create a real aching sadness and then and in the midst of that spirituality is this tuning mechanism that suddenly says yeah okay right exactly oh you're right terrible terrible terrible death death death you're gonna die everyone's gonna die no one will everyone will be erased from the chalk board of time regardless of what they do because the entire planet is gonna eventually be incinerated by a supernova or a comet or a meteor or some unknown source there is no way to escape the singularity we're all plunging into you're exactly right and it's incredibly terrifying and also you're right your relationships suck your marriage is shit your financially bankrupt you're spiraling down into alcoholism you're addicted to heroin you're deeply chronically supremely depressed yes you're right you're right you've got cancer yes you're right you've got a hepatitis whatever herpes yes you do it's true you do and it's scary and terrible but here let me show you this other channel click and you turn to that channel it's like oh my god this entire universe is the incense rising off of the altar of the divine everything is so beautiful and even my own expiration even my own dissolution even my own fear even the pain itself is incredible isn't it amazing it's amazing sorry about that uh but that's what it teaches you that's the channel that you get that's the thing that you can tune into man and that to me is just one of the most incredible beautiful gifts uh that people like Dharma Loka give us sorry Duncan I missed some of that there because you went I went on hold for a second I don't know if you don't worry it was just it was a it was a ridiculous rant but it was good it was good I just missed about 15 or 20 seconds there and I didn't know what you were saying I was saying that we can tune into any frequency that you know there's a lot of other frequencies that we could tune into and that um uh this um uh the teachers they allow us to um tune into frequencies other than the miasmic oily ones that a lot of us are stuck in yes I guess that's it I don't know and um can I ask you a question sure what is God to you because I'm an atheist and I don't believe in God um and I'm just I'm I like to know more about um what your opinion of what God is and what he's got to you because I know it's a personal thing really isn't it well I mean you know yeah I like I actually got some sometimes I'll like I think I negatively talk about atheists and I never mean to you I uh but but uh well I'm I'm an atheist because like technically I am to be honest I don't identify with anything to be I I see myself as a human on planet earth and we're all one and I practice Buddhism I'm certainly uh I'm certainly a student of the teachings of the Buddha for sure but uh and but I don't believe in God and I don't believe in a deity well yeah I mean I'm just because I I I know when I respect you and I just like to know what what is God to you well you know I there's a um so you you so the idea from the God that I know or understand or pray to or think about or feel connected to um there's a lot of different names for for that that that what that is and and some of them you know if you take any of them literally obviously you're going to be like this is a complete horseshit because uh we're talking about I mean you know you just have to look at where we at what's going on here right what what is going on here and and what's going on here is that based on every on everything that we understand uh using the most advanced technology that we currently have it appears that there was some outburst of energy billions and billions and billions of years ago that ended up cooling down and in the cooling down process expanded infinitely and also formed all these uh accumulations of matter that we call planets and stars and comets and somehow the spinning of these things and the input from random chaotic chance whether it was meteor impacts or we don't know what really the the combination of the spinning centrifugal force and being close enough to a burning ball of light uh and having sort of a hot core the combination of all these things created this life-bearing somal curam is that how you say it somal curam that that that that you know organic life it came from and then organic life uh but complexified and eventually it became us and uh we feel love and the so for me the leap of faith when it comes to god or or why i believe in god and how i believe in god is i can't understand i don't i cannot accept the idea that life is only formed on this planet it's impossible for me to accept that idea and based on the data coming in from um uh the kepler satellite that the telescope that's studying potentially habitable earth-like planets in the goldilocks region of stars not too hot not too cold there it appears to be that there are zillions of them out there just in the tiny little quadrant of the universe that we can uh see and so if we are truly in an ever-expanding infinite universe which i don't see how it couldn't be infinite because what's the wall made of you know what's the wherever it stops what's the boundary there man it's that's something too then it's an infinite boundary but whatever it is we must exist in the infinite universe and if the infinite universe has as one of its qualities the production of sentient beings that are capable of unconditional love for each other in their highest moments on this planet which is a and we're brand new on this thing man we just popped out of the womb of the earth and we've already gotten to the point where many of us at this very moment are taking bullets for our brothers and sisters uh just because we love them uh people are dying for their children people are dying for their friends people are swimming and saving people in the ocean even though they know they might drown we know in this universe that that level of love is possible and is happening and if we exist in an infinite universe then i think there must be an infinite spectrum of that kind of phenomena and i think the sum total of all phenomena in in that place where love reaches its maximum infinite ever accelerating exponentially increasing place is the point that i would call god and that's what i pray to gotcha gotcha do you do do you read carl sagan i've seen cosmos i i don't read a lot of carl say i know he's incredible i mean i know i know to me that to me the man was enlightened i to me he he was a buddha i mean if you listen to um the audio book extract of pale blue dot about how you know when he sent um voyager one up on its mission and as it passed i think it was as it was leaving the rings of saturn he he decided to point to point the the the vessel back towards earth and take a photograph of it yes which was just that pale blue dot image and what that you know the profound poetry that came out of him after seeing that image i mean it just it astounds me that you know in in every hotel room drawer is a copy of the holy bible yet pale blue dot is out of print yeah right well you know man yeah i know i mean he said something as well is that we we are the universes what i don't want to misquote the man there but he says we are the universe's way of knowing itself that's right that's right and that's happening right now and every single person listening and and and it's and i don't think it's just limited to uh and not that it matters that it's ever even if it were just here to me it's still divine it's still uh so so sumptuous and sweet and something to uh some something so comforting uh but and i think there's lots of ways to get to get to that point and if you want to be if you want to use matter or you want to focus solely on matter then that is the you know that is the flesh of of um this divinity and the more and what's in the in written in the very uh inorganic matter of the planet that we are currently existing on is the story of billions and billions of years and if you zoom in even deeper to that then you see written within the very inorganic matter the stones of this earth if you zoom in deeper to the atomic or subatomic levels then you start witnessing uh the miracle which is that we are in a a a very slow moving cloud of atomic phenomena that uh is capable of producing sense organs and life and that you know the scripture is everywhere so and it's just right there for everyone to tune into but on it but i think for a lot of people it's overwhelming like a lot for a lot of people it's like you want to be the kid at the uh slumber party when the parents have driven away for a second and you get to uh have that feeling of of you know uh not being watched over it's kind of overwhelming you know you don't want to you want to we need the rebellious phase we need that feeling of like i'm a separate differentiated individual in the face of this thing and that's a blast and i think but i think that that ultimately is a it can feel so so so empty and cold uh in relation to this other way of connecting which is where suddenly you kind of do that thing they call surrender and uh allow yourself just for a second to be embraced by everything and to blend in with it and to become you know part of those sort of warp and weave of this uh exhalation uh that is happening this miraculous exhalation we are inside one of the most in the first outbreath of god that's us you know and you don't have to call it god if you're a catholic man i wouldn't call it god i'd come up with my own name for it because that word unfortunately you know that word is uh very simple word is tainted it makes me for someone like me who grew up with under the thumb of christian brothers and stuff like that the the g word really does does doesn't do the right thing no way brother it's like i could give me a baby give me any baby and i if you give me three this sounds so fucked up but if you give me three years with a baby give me three babies give me three babies for three years and i can make all three of them hate any word that you give me whatever it is you want me to i can get them to hate the word butter i can get them to hate the word night i can get them to hate the word pillow i could do like just take the word pillow if you give me uh kids and and just any kind of like just basic skinnery like a skinner box and every time the word pillow is uttered there's a nice electric shock that runs through their body when they become older and somebody's like hey do you have uh you you need an extra can i have a pillow they're gonna like ah fuck no god i don't use pillows they suck man i i'm never gonna lay on a fucking pillow i use my hands pillows are awful and it's the same thing it's like that's the unfortunate you know repercussion hopefully unintentional repercussion of this bastardized version of a beautiful philosophy uh is it this tool which is all the word god is it's just a tool man it's a tool it's a plug or it's the connection point between you and the sentient divine aspect of the universe but you know once you've been shocked don't use the word anymore come up with a new one call it whatever you want man you get to invent that name i don't have a word for it but i do feel the connection uh when i can i connect with the universe when i meditate and that's where it really it really you can feel that i mean you mentioned Kepler there earlier and um i had um it was it was recommended once in one sort of thing i was reading online to sort of keep a meditation journal and um i did i only did it once and i made one entry and um and if i can try and remember what i said but it was um if you think meditation to me is like when i think it was the Hubble um they ran the the belt of Orion there was an area of space where scientists believed there was absolutely nothing so i think for 14 days they trained the Hubble maybe it was Kepler but i think it was the Hubble for 14 days they trained and focused and spent all their attention on this area where they expected there to be nothing when the photograph developed they saw billions of more galaxies yeah that to me is just that blows my fucking mind man yeah and that that's what i get like i i reach the edge of the observable universe internally when i meditate and when i you know and i feel that connection because it's it's parallel within and without you know from and and it's like you know like that's sort of um an egg timer where the sand is dropping that point right in the center between the top compartment and the bottom compartment that is the center of your head if you like when you're meditating and that connects you between the both universe within and without and you realize you are everything yes that's it i love it that's god to me that's that's it man that's that feeling that oh that that is that is you know god is an easy word man it's it's a written it's a dumb word really anything god god god it really does seem like something a dumb person like if it done it really is like the sound you would make when you're experiencing that exhilarating sense of novelty like the first thing that's going to come out of your mouth is like good good good you know it's like that it's it almost is just like that um it's like the utterance of someone whose mind is getting blown you know it's like good good it's that thing you know ah ah you know that god it's got that ah sound in it you know that sound you're like oh wow it's that you know and and um it's not the first word we say when we orgasm as well yeah yeah exactly and before the word god came into popular use you know or before before the whatever language whatever it is in your language or in all the languages of the earth there is still that exhilarating sense of it's like a combination of excitement and relief that happens when you realize that the the the your every single thing that you think about how every single thing works is only one tiny tiny infinitesimal little piece of the way things really are and for a brief second in this incarnation we get the chance to glimpse that greater thing and it's oh what a relief fuck man i thought i knew everything i really really did and oh wow it's totally different than what i thought like it's so very very different and not different in a bad way but different in a billion trillion times better than what you expected it's like that uh that imminent surprise party that's waiting every single person in every moment you know when you come home from a shitty day at work and you open the door and all your friends are there and you're you know there's just this love comes blasting out at you and everyone's like surprise it's that thing you know at any moment there's that chance to have the entire universe give you a surprise party where it's like surprise check it out this place is awesome you thought it was shit but it isn't it's awesome it's so filled with love and truth and that that's god you know and i don't care about the word i just use it as a form of laziness really it's fun to pray too man actually it's it's like it's really a blast to like you know it's like okay we um like seti you know uh we were scanning the observable universe for signs of extraterrestrial life uh and in one controversial move that some people want to do is they want to start blasting i think lasers or some like thing into the universe that like is saying to people hey we're out here we're out here we're out here and some people are saying you know let's keep quiet about this place that we're at right now because we don't know who we're contacting uh so let's let's let's let's keep this under wraps but so a person an individual existing on this planet is in one of the most unique predicaments that i can think of in the known universe which is that here we are this sentient bit of thinking meat that has this deep deep inner cosmos subjective inner universe filled with all our memories thoughts and feelings and we're surrounded by an external universe that seems to go on forever so in the same way that it might be absolutely ridiculous and pointless to imagine that we can shoot lasers or information beams out into the sky in some random direction and someone might come back to us and say hey what's up oh cool we've been waiting for you guys to call it's still definitely worth the effort if you ask me and in the same way if you are a sentient bit of the universe experiencing itself then wouldn't you want to run experiments that involved metaphysically trying to communicate with any form of disembodied super intelligent sentience that might exist outside of your own self and that's what prayer is and why not give it a shot because you know maybe no one does write back but a lot of people have reported that from time to time you somebody somebody writes back right away you know and the way that they write back is not in the form of like hearing the voice of god but the way they write back is a sudden explosive uh as a sudden explosive occurrence of unpredictable yet beautiful synchronicities around you that are called miracles you know that's the way it writes back and and i think it's worth the experiment you know i think it's definitely worth the experiment to do and it's and even if nothing happens even if you pray you just wake up in the morning go thank you god you can't say that say thank you carl or whatever name you want to come up with thank you you know come up with the name for it thank you carl sagan and and uh thank you that which inspired carl sagan thank you that thing at the quantum level of carl sagan that created the series of electrical events in carl sagan's brain to produce all of the works of carl sagan thank you that point from which all inspiration emerges into the known universe thank you that thing that allows human beings to express love whatever that is just say thank you to it in the morning or at night and who knows worst case you just have said thank you to a phantom you know an imaginary friend what's the big deal it's still cool i i i get that when i'm at night i'm walking my dog and i stand and look at the stars that you know that's if that's if you want to call that praying and and looking up and knowing there's so much that we don't know that completely outweighs what we do know and we know so much yes the dark matter you know and it's but and that space has weight i mean that that was revealing there recently but was it Lawrence Krause he said even nothing weighs something that's awesome that's fucking amazing that's fucking amazing man and and and you know it's to me this is why i love bhakti yoga because bhakti yoga acknowledges that uh one of the great pleasures in life is saying thank you one of the great pleasures in life is when someone gives you something a million times more than you deserve and you go oh thank you thank you thank you and they go oh it's nothing really i love you like that's such a fun interaction to have and it's such a sweet interaction to have and i think that some people rob themselves of this experience by negating the potentiality of a godhead and when you um when you uh uh just allow it for a second nothing to lose nothing to lose and then and you start doing these kind of metaphysical experiments which were recommended by not just by the uh you know fundamentalists but are also recommended by some of the most respected occultists that have ever existed like Crowley Crowley said you know create try to contact every god but once you've contacted each god move on to the next one you're done you know so contact Hanuman as soon as you get the call i'll hang up yeah and then call the next one when you get the message hang up the phone but Crowley said here's a phone book of gods it's uh here's Krishna Hanuman Ganesh here's satan here's Jesus here's a phone book of gods it's called all the scriptures of the world here's what you do make a phone call to every single one of them and then and once you make contact with them get the information you need hang up the phone and then call the next god and keep doing it all the way down the line because they're all just different pieces of this one you know magnificent incredible happening because you know here we have the exterior universe with all its weight and beauty and power and all the things that scientists show us that Phyllis was such ah but man there is no denying the fact that we have a subjective universe that is teeming with all these potent mystical symbols and uh why do we why do some people take all these mystical symbols that exist in our minds all those connections that happen the moment we tune into all the uh myth and all the symbols and myth there is a real beautiful thing that happens when you're a kid and you watch Star Wars for the first time man that is a mystical event and and and when you when you see these archetypes playing out and you feel connected and you say I am a fucking Jedi I think I'm a Jedi you know that's real that's real it's just but because it's existing in inner space instead of outer space it gets reduced and negated by the materialist and I don't see why it's like the sparks and stars that exist in my mind are just as valid as the sparks and stars that exist outside of my mind and if some of those sparks and stars are taking on the formation of mythological deified creatures or beings I don't see why I'm not allowed to connect to those things in the same way I'm allowed to connect to all the data coming from the external universe brilliant thanks sorry I just it's like uh it's like I'm got my own little personal podcast here I'm just listening like I'm that means I'm talking too much I listen to your show all the time man when I'm out walking my dog and stuff and I just you know I get lost in your words and forget like I have to talk back to you no never ask is never ask a stoner what he thinks God is it's just the worst I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I mean I could just nothing to apologize for man I love listening to you I love listening to you man I it really is like I am I really do love it's I like the different ways that people come to connect with the awe and and and I think all the ways are are are valid and beautiful and and inspiring to me it's it's any of them work it's just like what you know it doesn't matter what gate you you go into Disneyland through it's like you're in you know you're in Disneyland go through go through anyone that you want and uh you know we got a little off track but I'm glad we did uh because I love talking about this stuff it's a uh I I do want to get get back into this movie that you're working on I think people hear your passion and I want to how how far along are you and you're fundraising for this thing um but it hasn't been I've I've managed to uh talk to a lot of people all around the world and and you are actually the the last last person on my initial wish list so that's a that's an achievement unlocked right there cool thank you for really from the bottom of my heart thank you for having me on your show this is amazing let's do it again man but I want to yeah let's talk about how people can help out getting uh this story out into the world because it's clearly a story that people need to hear about this should be something that everyone just knows great um well I'm crowd funding right now at the minute on a new platform called dana.io dana as in the buddhist buddhist term for forgiving without receiving um it's the world's first buddhist crowdfunding platform so if you're familiar with kickstarter and indiegogo it's it's along those lines um and if you go to dana.io forward slash the dharma bum um you'll see our campaign page I've I've got a pledge video there it's it's very much like kickstarter um so you got your pledge video and some details there and details of who who have got involved in the film and you can buy t-shirts you can you can actually be in the movie um because I'm this movie is going to be realized through animation um traditional hand drawn 2d animation so there's a certain pledge to your there that we can we can stick it stick you in the movie as an animated character cool um yeah um I find a certain kind of uh poetry in the fact that we're bringing this lost legend back to life in a art form that is considered to be dying so uh yeah that is really cool man and that is what you're doing you know it's like you you one thing that's so exciting uh to me is like from time to time you hear about people saying you know we're gonna bring the mammoth back it's been frozen in the ice but we think we have the technology now to bring these creatures back to the earth uh and and and what you're doing is very similar you're taking a story that has been frozen in the ice and you're thawing it out and bringing it back to life and that's a really cool thing man so I hope you guys listen and we'll uh consider checking out that link I'll have it at dunkintrussell.com uh help get this uh help get this movie made and uh thank
