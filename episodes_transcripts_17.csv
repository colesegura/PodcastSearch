Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, my sweet friends. Feeling really good. I've been exercising. I've cut out sugar. I've cut out the booze. And what do you know? I feel great. I've been taking vitamins. I've been taking psyllium husk at night. Psyllium does for your poop what calling like an Uber black car does for your driving experience. I'll let you interpret that as you will. The point is, I'm just feeling good. Been drinking so much water. Chamomile tea at night. It's great. Somebody should talk more about this. Somebody should put some books out or something about how it feels good to not treat your body like some old bag of rats you found behind a dumpster and decided to tap dance on. I mean, look, you peer into the maelstrom of the world via whatever hell window you decide to open up, whether it's CNN, Fox News, Reddit, Reddit World News, Reddit conspiracy, Reddit politics, Reddit COVID ate my face, Reddit justice served, Reddit conspiracy, whatever the hell it is. And you look out and what do you see? You see a hell storm out there. You see an infinite number of infinite bundles all strapped to each other with cords made out of human suffering. And it's easy to start thinking, what the fuck am I going to do to help the world? Meanwhile, you're riding around in this decaying thing. Not decaying necessarily because you are in a mortal body, but decaying because you've been lavering yourself with all kinds of rot. You've been rubbing all this different hell creams and shit bombs on your interior core just by whatever it is you're chewing up. And I mean me, not you. I don't know what you're doing. You're probably over there getting some kind of special prismatic vegan enema in your beautiful body, your sweet, beautiful, sweet-smelling, tight-toned, glorious, trembling, orgasmic, beautiful body. But for everybody else, you know what I mean? It's easy. You want to help. It's a natural thing to want to help the world. You think, man, I want to do something. What's something I could do in the face of all this cyclonic horror out there? And it's easy to forget, like, oh, well, you know, like what Jack Cornfield says, tend to the part of the garden you can touch, you know? And for me, that part of the garden is like my 47, am I 48 now? Your old body with asymmetrical love handles and slowing metabolism. And I'm not, I love myself, by the way. I'm not fat-shaming myself. I just don't want to be fat. But that to me is like the direct avenue towards like helping. And look, I know there's other ways you could help the world. You can go feed people and do all the stuff the saints do, but maybe start with yourself, your body vehicle. Start with that, you know? It's right there in front of you, you know? Trim the pubes. Trim the pubes. I still got to do that. God, I got to do that. I got my haircut today. They don't do pube trims, as far as I'm aware, barber shops in Asheville, probably somewhere I wouldn't ask for anybody to trim my pubes. It's a private thing. I would never do that. A pube barber. We're just not there yet. I'm sure at some point they'll be pube barbers. But right now we just do it with our beards and our hair. But eventually when we get more comfortable with our human bodies and are no longer encumbered by the societal demands that we wear clothes, instead of walking around naked as God wants us to, there's not going to be pube barbers. But eventually it will happen. And then there'll be like, you know, already there's like pube styles, which is kind of weird. If you've ever gone into like a fuck period where you're like having sex with a lot of different people and you start realizing there's like a similarity in the way people are shaving their pubes, like what the fuck, where are you getting it from? Porn, I guess, right? I don't know. What was I talking about? Entropy. Quick Sam pits. Yeah. It's just a wonderful, see, this is why I love what Sharon Salzberg says. The healing is in the return. And that's kind of the glorious thing when you finally like managed to sort of break out of whatever entropic momentum you've gotten into. You know, whatever weird gluttonous riptide you find yourself being pulled out into the ocean of depression on, which is like, yeah, it sucks. But also there's this kind of like sweet possibility that happens when you just start making like little steps in a non-entropic direction. That is, maybe that's my problem is I like that. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's why I can never maintain a healthy form like some of my friends. Maybe that's what it is, is because there's such a weird thrill in like getting inhaled halfway down the throat of the grim reaper and then clawing your way out. Well, we've got a great podcast for you today. Really good. Now this is going to be a controversial one, friends. This is controversial. And, but I've been fascinated with non-fungible tokens. Doesn't sound like you'd be fascinated by them. Even the acronym sucks. Nifties, NFT, non-fungible token. Ununderstandable, mysterious, complex, arcane, and something that has produced a lot of controversy out there. Here's a something from The Verge. This is a story on NFTs that was written by Elizabeth Lopato and Jacob Castronakis. It's on The Verge. And I'm just going to read the first part. Famed auction house Christie's just sold its first purely digital piece of art for a whopping 69 million. For that price, the buyer got a digital file of a collage of 5,000 images and a complex legacy of greenhouse gas emissions. Individual pieces of crypto art, non-fungible tokens are at least partially responsible for the millions of tons of planet-eating carbon dioxide emissions generated by the cryptocurrencies used to buy and sell them. Some artists, including those who have already benefited from the craze, think it's a problem that can be easily solved. Others think that the proposed solutions are a pipe dream. That being said, I love pipe dreams, they're the best. And I do believe in a lot of Kurzweil's prophecies. I don't know if I'm quite a singulitarian, as Douglas Rushkoff has called people to subscribe to the idea of eventually uploading our consciousness into a machine or maybe the idea that there's some possibility of shifting what's happening on the planet all the environmental and ecological destruction that's happening using some as of yet non-existent technological device or method. A lot of people say that's like just some kind of phantom pacifier that a lot of us are sucking on while the ice caps melt. And it was a real delight to chat with today's guest, JP Downer, aka Pop Wonder. Check him out on Instagram and Twitter. He is a rising star in the NFT art world. His art is really cool. And the story of how he went from someone working in a warehouse to a self-sufficient independent artist is personally very inspiring for me. And I think it will be for you too.

Welcome to you. Bye, bye, bye. It's been Duncan Trussell. River Castle, River Castle, River Castle, River Castle, Kamila. JP, welcome to the DTFH. I am really excited to talk to you. Thank you for having me. This is an honor. Oh man, look, first of all, I love your art. It's beautiful and I've got some questions. I wanna ask you about that first and then let's get into the NFT space, which I understand nothing about. But your art is really beautiful. It's to me, it's visionary and I'm just curious, how are you making it? What medium are you using for that? Is it all digital or what is that? Yeah, it's all digital. And part of my thing is I kind of like try to recreate comic book printing, the old process printing of CMYK. Yeah. But I do it on an iPad with Procreate. Wow. Yeah. And I wanna ask for your secrets there, but when we made the Midnight Gospel, watching the amount of work that went into making it not look like it was something made on a computer, it was like weeks and weeks of effort put into how to do the frame rates and how to do everything. So holy shit, man, good job. Whatever you figured out is so beautiful. Is this, how long have you been working at that style? So I started, so I've been a musician my whole life, professionally, but then certain point when I was doing great and like gigging a lot, but you know, it's still really hard to make a living. And I started doing graphic design and kind of getting back into illustration that I did as a kid and through that, like almost as a side project, I was doing illustrations. And then really, okay, so when the pandemic hit and all of our tours, I was gonna be touring a whole bunch last year and gigging a lot and that ended and like I didn't even wait one day. I was like, I'm going full on with graphic design, illustration, I'd already been getting up at like 4 a.m. and drawing and doing work for clients and stuff. And I just like tripled down on it and started this collection of illustrations and I just tried to have it as pure as I could make it without any kind of outside, like, you know, not thinking about what other people would think of it, just knowing that I liked it. How do you do that? How the fuck do you do that? It's so hard, but that's the way. So tell me a little bit about waking up that early, like what motivated you to do that? Well, so I've been, you know, I've been listening to podcasts and audio books since like 2010, like religiously. And, you know, I came across like deep work if you're familiar, Cal Newport. No. Yeah, it's about getting into the flow state when you're working doing creative work and having outside distractions shut off and things like that. And there's a lot about, you make a lot of decisions throughout your day, like 30,000 little tiny decisions. And so at the end of the day, you have this fatigue for making decisions and doing creative work is a lot about making decisions. Like when I'm sketching out a new piece, you know, as literal as that, like I'm deciding like where this little thing's gonna go and everything. But when I wake up in the morning and go straight to work, you know, I'm a lot more free in my decision-making and they come a little easier to me. And also waking up at that time, how it ties back in with deep work is that that's the time that I with my lifestyle can only time I can get that uninterrupted time because I have a wife and a daughter and she's like two and a half. And so I started doing it when she was about six months old. So because, so I knew that I needed like two hours of creative work before that, at least. So that once you woke up and then it was just all about her for the rest of the day. And then at night I'm too tired to like do that kind of stuff. It's just the way I work. Yeah. Yeah, no, this is, I figured out the identical thing. And I think a lot of parents figure that out. But then also it just happens to sync up with what people like Kotler, all the flow state people, you hear them talk about this early morning wake up, going to some place and just, that's when you do your artistic work. For me, it's like whatever the part of my brain is that's the censoring, insecure, you know, judgmental part of my brain, it just is not a way. It doesn't takes longer to get up. That's true. And it feels magical at that time of day too. I mean, it's like you're conquering yourself or something. Yeah. I did like six weeks where I was getting up at three. Wow. And that's like a different flavor. It's weird. It's like, it's like a little bit darker, like, you know, mood-wise, like it feels weird waking up at three. Four feels like positive. And three feels like you're doing something sneaky. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Three's creepy. It's creepy, dude. Because like my friends are going to bed and stuff. Exactly. Well, you're, so that was when I was really getting into this. Did I lose you again? It froze up. There you go. Oh. Yeah. Okay, great. I brought it out for a minute. Okay. So when I was like doing that, and you kind of get addicted to it and then you do start thinking like, what happens if I go back a little further? Exactly. Because fucking three, man. You know, I would take a drive at like three, wake up, go for a little drive. And it's like, there's either these like hardcore joggers, you know, it's fully like, like just like out with their lights on running, or there's like people on speed running, you know, from themselves. But it's like before people start, you know, the mystical theory I've heard is that there's more energy. It's like, because the day is just starting and it's all this fresh energy that you're consuming. And then as time progresses, everyone's kind of eating whatever that energy is, prana. And then it sort of diminishes. And so at night, that's why you're all tired and shit, but whatever, that's cool to hear. I'll take that. Yeah, I'll take it. So, okay. So when, do you remember the first time you heard about an NFT? Oh yeah. When? It was like at the end of January, and my buddy Muse Bandit on Twitter, he just texted me and he was like, hey, Justin Roiland just put out an NFT, you know, this thing is digital art and he made, you know, he made the X amount of money or whatever. And you can do this now. And he said that I think that your art is perfect for it. And yeah, I had just been creating for about a little less than a year, these just square. And when I started the Instagram page, it was like a side project for my graphic design, like I said. And I knew that it was going to be like really cohesive because that's what I was looking for in artists that I admired, that they had a very cohesive style. They made very, very direct choices. And so I kind of set up some constraints for myself. And then when you do that, it's like easier to start something, but then you can also just like move in and out of it and it doesn't change it too much. And so I unknowingly, I like created a pretty cohesive collection of illustrations that were like perfect for what we're doing now. And so my buddy hit me up. I haven't really thought about much else since then. I have to force myself to break out of it and go and carry a shit in real life. But yeah, so I put together the ones that I wanted to start putting up and a couple sold right away. And then I had a lot of several months of ups and downs and slow times. And then I'd sell something and it was amazing. But the whole time I'm doing my graphic design and my other life and gigging when I can, playing a few gigs here and there, but yeah. OK, so I'm going to go to your website real quick. And do you mind if I just kind of read what some of your art is selling for? Oh yeah, sure. One second. Not to be completely like base, you know what I mean? But you remind me of someone who jumped timelines or something. I feel like this, I mean, talking to you right now is like the cherry on top of the simulation. I'm serious, because I never imagined. That's so sweet to say, man. Yeah, of course, man. OK, so over here at popwonder.io, it's your beautiful art. I'm going to scroll down. So what you're looking at now are the additions. And so that means that any of these pieces, there's anywhere between three and 150 copies of each one. OK. And so each different one has a different size. And so they're kind of, you know, the values. OK, so these are like, this is like in the real world, this is like when you're doing prints. This is what this would be, right? So yeah. And then if you go to popwonder.world, those are my one of one originals. OK, and OK, got you. So like I'm looking here at this stuff is so beautiful, man. Prismic Falls. And so this is just a print, or not even a print, an FT that is $1,700. And so, but then we go to popwonder. What's the address again? Dot world. Dot world, OK. And look at like from Wentz, which is just nuts, beautiful. Folks, this is like, you got to go to this, it's just incredible. It's like a skull, but flowers are growing around it. It's just, but it's impossible. How am I going to describe art? It's incredible. You got to look at it, but here am I reading this wrong? When it says $413,000 is what it's. The reason why it says that is because the person who collected it listed it back up at that price. OK, but we go back and look at the trading history and it's still. Yeah, I mean, people. Go ahead, people. So Ethereum right now is is about $3,000. And I had a couple. I've had a few sales in the last few weeks that have been and they're secondary sales that have been, you know, 30, like 20 Ethereum, 30 Ethereum, so 100 grand sometimes. So the people that collected my work and like people are buying them new for me as well. But the people that collect my work early on really got hooked up because a lot of people bought stuff when I first started and nobody really cared. They were still buying them for like a grand. Yeah. And that was like, you know, I mean, think about it as an artist and a musician, like, OK, I'm selling that piece of my artwork for $1,000. I made it. It's fucking awesome. Yeah, just that. Yeah, that is like, holy shit. This is like I'm this is a dream come true. Yes. And that's the baseline, you know, like if you can sell your stuff. And so then some of the people that bought those for that price, like it's turned around and sold them for, you know, 100 here. Like hold on, hold on and then the pieces and. Now, again, I'm not trying to like I don't want to. I think one of the wild things about NFTs and for me, whenever I hear these stories of artists, like suddenly, like, like not just like doing what any of us would just be thrilled with, but like, you know, exponentially leaping into a completely different reality. It makes me think of the singularity. It makes me think of Ray Kurzweil. It makes me think of like dimensional shifting via some kind of technology. And I think that's kind of what is so wrapped up in NFTs is, is, is seeing, seeing this happen to people and it's spellbinding and confusing. And can you talk a little bit about that quality of it? Yeah, I mean, you're you're dead on because it doesn't, it doesn't make sense, you know, in the old ways of thinking. And now the whole decentralized aspect of everything that's going on with the blockchain and cryptocurrency and NFTs is all related. Yeah, it makes it so that I I'm selling. Directly to the people that want it and the money goes directly to me immediately. And there's nobody collapse, you know, I do collaborations, but there's there's not somebody that like gave me the opportunity to do it. Yeah, I took the opportunity on my own. And yeah, and like you said, like just the. The insane trajectory of it and the way that it could go sideways for years and years and years and then shoot straight up. Yeah, and I just feel very like grateful that and it's not the first thing that I've become obsessed with and tried to be a part of. But I, you know, because I got I'm 38. Some people think like I'm like 23. And this is an overnight success or something because because I'm somewhat anonymous online right on Twitter. But, you know, I've I've been rocking in bands. I've been drawing comic strips. I've been doing graphic design and doing a million things. And I finally feel like I caught like a wave and like kind of like you guys did with podcasting that came out. Yeah. And so, you know, you get imposter syndrome and like why, you know, why is this happening to me? But, you know, if I step back and look at the hard work I put in and waking up at 4 a.m. and like knowing that, you know, like the outliers thing, like I was just kind of like in the right place with the right amount of, you know, the right amount of preparation and the willingness to like do it right as like the wave was hitting. Right. Yeah. That's like definitely that that I feel the same way about podcasting, which is, you know, I like I started so long ago and I got just lucky based on that and did catch that weird exponential leap forward. But with NFTs, in particular, it's it's really caught my attention not just because of like that what I love, which is like anytime artists are getting paid, something's going right. If you ask me, that's a that's a good sign in the universe. You know, and maybe part of the reason people are so shocked witnessing like, you know, the success that a lot of artists are having is because artists have been so devalued that that art has been so devalued by the parasitic entities that form in between an artist and the people, you know, engaging with that artist's work, you know, and that it's parasites upon parasites upon parasites. Now, not all them are parasites. Some of it's a really important symbiotic relationship, you know, like a lot of people that I work with, I have to have them because I don't know how to do a lot of the shit they do at all. I would be fucked beyond. I need someone when I'm on the phone with them to tell me, you know, that might be the worst idea I ever heard in my life. Don't send that email. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? You know, that that's but but you know what I'm saying? Like when you look at like the musician, you know this, when you look at a musician, the the many millions of like weird layers of people taking a piece of the pie between a musician and the person listening to musicians music, the people taking the piece of the pie, many of them they they wouldn't know a fucking C chord if like for a million dollars they couldn't they couldn't play a chord on a piano or a guitar, you know, but they are they're in there somehow. And so this it just plugs the artist directly in with the audience that I love. It's glorious. And so maybe that's part of the reason. But but maybe it's something else entirely. You want proof? There's a force of pure love in the universe that has some kind of sentience and intelligence to it. Then the proof is today's sponsor, Magic Spoon. It just so happens that right when I decided to go on a diet, I am contacted by the wizards of Magic Spoon who sent me boxes of healthy cereal. This is the best thing ever. Do you realize how cool it is? I love cereal. When I was a kid, I used to pound through bowls of sugar and poison. You name it, Lucky Charms, Count Chocula. I never thought about it.

Thank you magic spoon for sponsoring this episode and thank you for making guilt free cereal. You're doing the Lord's work. But maybe it's something else entirely. I mean, because because like the other like romantic thing about I'm going to start to stop going on and on about it is it's like we're witnessing some kind of implosion of the universe, like the universe is being vacuumed in to this metaverse where these NFTs are existing. And do you know what? And so maybe that's the other thing that I'm going to say is that and so maybe that's the other thing that's actually happening is like, oh, no, they're not. It's not just like they're art. They're fucking dimensional riffs. You're looking at these tiny little output points that are now living in and expanding brand new liminal reality that are maybe not brand new. I don't know. But as far as we've been able to see, is that what they are? Yeah, I mean, it's relatively brand new. That's for sure. Yeah, it is kind of like psychedelic like that and knowing that it's it's immutable and it's there forever and it can be your legacy if you do it right. And it can be something you pass on to your your family, these things people are already doing it. People are already setting up their wallets for their kids. Yeah, and collecting. And this is, you know, they believe and I believe that this is like a historic era and the stuff from this era is going to be that much more valuable. Fuck, yeah. I mean, is that is that what the blockchain is? Is it our cave wall? Is that what this fucking thing is? Right, right. I mean, yeah, it could be so it's like a cave wall where they didn't like, but as the whatever the book is the blockchain. Now, correct me. This is where I get really confused. The blockchain, it's evolving, isn't it? Right. The blockchain itself is like becoming the sum total of all the different bits of technology and art that are making up the links in that chain, right? Yeah, and I'll preface by saying I'm an artist and I've just been learning about the stuff just, you know, in this year, but basically it's a ledger of transactions. So yeah, it is. It's just you just keep adding to it and adding to it and adding to it. And it's all you go back and you look at the whole thing. And that's why, like, basically one of my pieces is like a transaction on the chain and it's there and it's going to be there forever. It's a link. Yeah, is that right? It's a link in the chain. Yeah. And so so it's like, you know, the difference between like, OK, so one of the controversies about it that all these like get out of my yard, people are like, it ain't all paper. It's not you can't say you can't sell a JPEG. Yeah, yeah. Sell it in JPEG. It's not all paper. If it's not all paper, it's not worth nothing. Right? Like saved it. Now I can sell it for a million dollars. Now I got it. Oh, guess what? It's on my computer now I got it. You know what I mean? Like they're people are fucking pissed about these things. They're so pissed, man. Oh, I have everywhere except for Twitter and on Twitter. But like I I I carved out my own little like algorithm, just NFTs on Twitter. So it's to me, it's like another like I remember when I was like getting fascinated with NFTs, I made an NFT and just for fun because I was like, what's the process for making an NFT? So like I and I just grabbed a piece of paper, drew some. It's called the seal of eternal value. And then I uploaded it. I don't even know what happened to it. Someone did bid on it, but then I felt weird about it. And then but I didn't know at the time all the controversy surrounding it. And so I post this NFT and it was like within seconds, somebody was like, enjoy destroying the universe. Do you like destroying the planet? Do you know that that NFT used up 7000 years of like, do you know? Like, do you know how many koala bears were incinerated? You know, NFTs are made by tossing koala bears into a furnace. And then converts that into the blockchain energy. But like, but what was to me, what was mind blowing about it was how quick it was. Like somebody had just been sitting there looking at hashtag NFT and been like, you just destroyed 7000 whales. You know, what do you think about that, man? I mean, isn't there some truth to the environmental impact that these things are having on the world or is that bullshit? Well, yeah, I mean, there's some truth to it because it does use electricity. It's like a network of computers that are running. And that's like basically everything is what we're using right now. And, you know, and I can't I can't sit here and like, say that it's perfect or defended or whatever. But, you know, and also like any of the articles that I looked up and was like, yep, that sounds, you know, they're biased towards what I want to hear. Right. But but basically, you know, the the Ethereum network is is what, you know, we use for for buying and selling NFTs and it's there and it's going to be there so that it can create if you're in cryptocurrency and we're using the network, you know, and the network is unfortunately, sometimes buildings full of computers that are running 24 seven. But that's that's what that's a server, right? That's Facebook and that's, you know, everything really. So but as far as I have have read and the stuff that I'm obviously gravitated towards believing, it says that it's blown out of proportion. You know, in the in the long run, it will it can save energy because using cash and transporting cash and housing cash and securing cash and all these things causes uses a ton of energy. Right. You mean that like Brinks trucks? Yeah, everything. You know, like like add it all up if you want. Because that's the thing about the blockchain, too. You can actually go through and audit it and figure out exactly what it's using. But try to figure out how much just supplying the world with fiat currency in every country it takes. You'll never know. Yeah, you'll never fucking know big secret, whatever the fuck that is. Who the fuck knows? No one knows that. I mean, it's arcane and weird and like creepy. You know, it's creepy when you see one of those Brinks trucks, you know, pulling up with their fucking magic paper and dudes with shotguns and stuff. I mean, is it the conspiracy theorist? Part of me just thinks is it OK? Any time like if somebody like yells at me on Twitter, you know, usually I deserve it or I'm like, you know, that was a stupid joke, I guess or whatever. But like when it's instant, that makes me think, wait a minute, that's too quick. You can't just like right away send me a like calculation of how much the NFTs or whatever, just and again, I don't know, someone maybe it's just a real fan or something and just doesn't want me to make NFTs or something like that. But it made me think like. Is there some kind of fucking like? Push like intentional pushback from bot farms against these things, because they it's an existential threat to so many different industries that they have worked out an ad campaign to like try to like make them make it not work because it's that would make more that would make more sense than what's probably going on, which is just people. You know, they they're confused by the technology. They see, you know, making money is really, really, really hard. Like, you know, for most everybody in the world, like really hard. Yeah. And it's has been for me, my whole life. And and then they see these kind of things like somebody just sold a crypto punk for half a million dollars and they're like, oh, that's a scam. Or that's, you know, it's like a club they're not invited to, you know, and then the barrier of entry to get into this is so high that if they tried to sometimes you I mean, it's it's easy when you do it. But, you know, you have to set up a few protocols and things like that in your wallet and, you know, you have to get the Ethereum in there. And it's a pain in the ass at first because it's so early. And the stuff just isn't like streamlined as it will be. And people are just like, well, I'm not invited to this party. And so I'm going to shit on it. Basically, it's fun, though. Man, using it with hours. I was like, God damn, this is some Star Trek shit here. I'm going to like going on my, the whole like connecting to Ethereum through your phone and it's so confusing and so completely psychedelic. But it's more than just the technical weirdness of it that's upsetting these people, man. It's like, I think it's like, I don't know if it's just that whenever an emergent paradigm pops in that poses like a real structural possibility of like a massive structural change of, you know, or I don't know if it's just some primordial power thing, which is like, you know, power structures don't want to lose that power. And the fucking industry around, you know, shepherding or helping artists sell stuff is like a trillion dollar industry, man. And if something springs up that not only like fucks with that, but like fucks with art galleries, fucks with every single level of how we understand this stuff, you know what I mean? You could expect if it's not a conscious pushback, a subconscious pushback. But I don't know, man, I am too conspiratorial just because it's like, you know, trend analysis, you know, like these, like I remember reading this cool thing that like, you know, fashion companies like infiltrate little mini scenes. Have you ever heard this? Like they get deep in there, man. And they look at what these kids are like doing or where they're spies. Basically, you can tell when you go like to target like everything that was super hip like three months, six months ago is right there. Yes. Yeah. And then in like the big fashion houses, they've got their fucking tendrils. Like, you know, like it's like, we know what what like, you know, big scenes look like, but they've got their fucking tendrils in like little mini scenes. You know what I mean? They're deep in kind of just trying to understand the trend before it's the trend because they got to make the shit, you know what I mean? And then they also push it forward a little bit, which is why anytime like Gucci releases something, people are like, what the fuck? I never fucking wear that crazy shit. But then sure enough, you know, a year later, everyone's in target getting the exact same things. They're they're sort of expanding it. But my point is like that this NFTs represent the very beginning of pushing something so far beyond the business models are understanding of value itself. Yeah. You know what I mean? That it's it's scaring people. It's upsetting people. It's and if it is causing environmental impact, it's also causing like it's going to burn down a lot of cultural, a lot of like institutions that you know, that will never come back, that will never recover from it. You know, traditional art gallery, the standard is like 50 percent that they take. It's crazy. And they don't tell you who collected it. They don't want you to know. If the person doesn't tell you that collected it, the gallery doesn't want to tell you either. And if and also then if it sells again, you don't know because it's out there in the world selling again, it could sell for anything. So now I know exactly how much everything sells for. Yes, I get a royalty. So you set it up for however you want. And I get 10 percent of everything when it sells again. So, you know, and that's like a that's like a huge revolution for artists because now I have passive income from digital art. And and before, you know, yeah, I mean, before that, it's like, yeah, you you could sell a piece for a hundred bucks and then you get famous or you die and then they sell it for a hundred grand and they keep it all. You know, it's like, holy shit. So you don't even know your you don't know what your value is there. And they're intentionally keeping that from you so that they can get the art from you at a hyper discount and then inflate it and get and make more money. I mean, that's something that happens for sure. There's great gallery owners that help artists all the time, I'm sure as well. But, you know, this new paradigm, it's like more on us. And and I even, you know, wanted to have my friend like handle all the crypto and MetaMask and all that stuff, you know, side of it. And like, because I was really busy and I was like, I don't know, man, if I could just make the art and then you handle all that. Yeah. But he told me, like, that's great and everything. But like, you can do this and you should do this. Right. Don't create another fucking generation of de-skilled artists who have developed a dependency on someone doing like some technical thing, that's really your friends, really cool. That's super cool. Yeah. Right. Because that that's like, you know, another like the, you know, it's one of the archetypes that like I find to be like is like a sad, self-fulfilling prophecy is it's like, are you an artist? OK, let me go get you a bottle, little baby. You don't know how to pour your own meal. I'm going to put it in your mouth and give you a bottle and, you know, here's some ketamine and you just go do your art, little baby. I mean, it's like, fuck off, I can figure out how to do this. You know? And so to me, that's the other thing I'm really excited about that for for artists, because it's that's how it's supposed to be. It's just normal. Like if you're the one doing the work and you're the one who not just and that's the other thing like, you know, people are probably pissed at you because they're like, what would you do? You could just went to Best Buy, got yourself an iPad, sketched out a couple of robots and look at you now. Well, you know what I mean? I can do that. Yeah. No, it's that stupid song. Oh, God, it came out a long time ago. God, do you know the song? I think Sting sings on it. You know, oh, God, you play the guitar on your MTV. That ain't working. That's the way you do it. You're money for nothing and your chicks for free because they wrote that song because they're like, motherfucker, I'm a moving company. You know, if you're a musician, you're a moving company. You're not a friend. I'm a comedian. We got it easy. But anytime I friend email, I've gone to his shows and like after the show, I want to hang out with him and it's like, oh, no, no, no, no. I got to move. I'm moving right now. I got to load up the fucking truck and make sure my fucking expensive gear doesn't get wrecked. Yeah, yeah, people like want to go to the bar. It's like, yeah, every single one of my friends has had their entire like loaded gear stolen out of the back of their car. I'm good. Yeah, I'm going home now. Thanks. Bye. No, I don't get to do any of that shit that you think we get to do. I've got to fucking try to get enough sleep. But especially on tour, it's like, yeah, we got to drive seven hours tomorrow and like go to the hotel now and stuff. So yeah, get your shit in, get your food in, hope the fucking room service is working. You know, that's what stand up. We got to do that. But then, you know, you just breeze into the club. You don't have to do some two hour fucking sound check and the sound guy comes in. I'll hungover or the sound guy didn't show up and the or the fucking some circuit blues. So like your microphones, it's a nightmare. But on top, but then also people don't acknowledge the process that even before that or like, they don't want to acknowledge like, yeah, I also was like almost got I've almost had my car repossessed. I almost was kicked out. I was almost evicted. You know what I mean? People don't want to look at like all that stuff leading up to the point where and you get to where you get anything for your art. So, you know, I think it's a celebratory moment for artists. But and but probably I mean, do you think it's going to like you think it's going to last? That's the other thing is like, you see all these like stories that look like they've been written by a fucking AI that come out and they're like, well, it looks like the NFT bubble is finally popped. I know, like every week, some asshole puts out one of those. I know. And after a week later, it's just like it's it's crushing. Yeah. I mean, obviously, like anything could happen. The the valuations that we're seeing right now, people could wake up and be like, wait a second, this isn't this is a lot, you know, of money. Yeah. And also if if Ethereum goes way up and then suddenly 10 Ethereum is is 50 grand or 70 grand or something like that, then maybe you wouldn't want to spend them, you know, so so there's definitely ups and downs and I'm I'm keeping an open mind because I know this kind of these kind of things can can move. But the technology and us using it for digital art, it's almost like a warmup for NFTs because. Yeah. Yeah, because the technology is going to be in everything. You don't know, I would love to be able to buy my next house as an NFT and literally just click on my MetaMask and send the Ethereum. And then I get the NFT and that's the deed to the house. And that can be. What's a MetaMask? MetaMask, I keep saying it's your wall. It's like the most common kind of wallet for for using Ethereum and buying NFTs. OK. Yeah. OK, so you mean you don't mean like the you don't mean yet. You don't mean like buy like a house existing on the blockchain and the Meta. You mean literally a real house by the house and like just skip all the weird shit that goes into buying a house. Just nice when you've bought it. I mean, keep going. Sorry, though, I feel like I cut you off. Oh, no. And also because you said like, is it going to last? It will last in some way, shape or form, I believe. And, you know, this could be like the golden era and the salad days that we talk about. Or it could be we're talking about this is the very beginning. And it was like and we'll laugh about it. We I definitely think we're going to laugh about all the crap we'd have to go through to to do this stuff like setting everything up to set up. Because I think that in the future, it's just going to be like, you know, as easy as everything else is for us. But yeah. Yeah. And then you do and you don't you don't. We're using the chisel to go into the to right in the rock. We had to write on the rock. You don't need to use the chisel too much energy, too much time. No one will carve on rock. Why are you? You know, it seems to be a similar reaction, which is like you like any time there's a new medium to hold our simple sets, there's controversy around the new medium. And usually these high controversy things like end up being like the future, right? Like, yeah, the things that get the most the strongest reactions out of people like the internet, people thought it was a fad. And it also was really hard to interact with. And if you had a website or like a podcast and like, you know, I don't know if you did you have to pay insane bandwidth fees and stuff when you started your podcast? No, I skipped that. Thank God. Yeah. So that was like an era, right? And there's like used to have to have a bunch of protocols and devices to connect to it and the modem made this out and it's slow and shitty. So basically that's hopefully just the era we're in now and everything's just going to go up from here. And music, NFTs are something that I believe hasn't even happened yet. Like there's been a couple of bands that release an album and there's been a couple of people doing cool stuff. But when touring comes back in full force and people are carefree going to shows and and also hopefully like some of this controversy blows over so people aren't afraid to offer it. But I feel like having, you know, just like you buy a shirt with the tour dates on the back as a commemorative item from a show, you you would purchase or receive for free an NFT that says you were there. And it's proof of attendance and people are given amount for all sorts of stuff now. But for music shows, I think it's going to be huge because you you show up and you just basically go online, get your proof of attendance NFT and then next year when they come back through your town, that one will get you other perks or discounts. And then you can get the next one and then you collect them, just like people collect ticket stubs, concert shirts, anything, you know, buy the record there and stuff like that. So and nobody's really doing it in full force yet. No, that's crazy, man. That makes me think of like the next generation of tombstones. It's like like you go to see your friend's tombstone, right? It like clicks, it links up with whatever your device is. And then you get a little like miniature version of your friend and AR or whatever. You know, oh, yeah, yeah, you just put your glasses and put on your glasses and you see like, hey, what's up? And then your friend like, can I haunt you? Do you mind? And your friend jumps into you and now you've got this like little because this is the other thing is like, I think, you know, I've just been reading this awesome book about alchemy. And it's just pointing out like in alchemy, when you're looking at a symbol, you shouldn't just, you know, it's meant to be contemplated in a 3D space with movement, not just, you know, looked at as some flat thing, you know, like any of these, like any sacred geometry when you like start imagining it. And that's the other part is like the imaginative process is like, according to this book at least is like activating like latent qualities in the human nervous system. But the point is you should, when you're looking at these things, think of it in terms of 3D space and movement. And I, you know, I think when I'm thinking of NFTs, in general, I'm thinking, oh, these are still precursor beings, like an AI could easily animate any of these NFTs and then populate the, you know, the augmented reality world with them or populate the metaverse with them. You know what I mean? So really they're like eggs too. They're not just, you know, and they're going to be living. That's, I can't, I'll tell you, man, as soon as you have an NFT, as soon as AR becomes as popular as I'm sure it will be, and you have one of your little NFT creatures that I could pick up and that will live in my house. I'm doing all that. Yeah. Cause yeah, for sure it's happening. Yeah. I want to thank Upstart for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

Well, there's gonna be a lot of confusion with, whole home economics and crazy... Really poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo poo Well, there's gonna be a lot, lot more people getting into it on the artist side and the collector and speculative, you know, investor side. Yeah, it's gonna be, it's gonna get a lot more saturated. Right now it's a small community, amazing community, and that's what it's really all about for this stuff. And people wonder like, why could it be so popular and engaging because the community is engaging in, and if you're part of a certain community of an NFT project, like people really like identify with it and they make it their profile picture on Twitter and that's what their whole deal is, right? Like, and they feel like it's a, it's almost like a country, you know, like a country club, digital pass to a country club and there's limited editions, right? There's only 10,000 of them or there's only 3,000 of them. Oh, that's crazy. It's some kind of fucking tribal and like, oh, and one of them literally, yeah, one of them's literally apes. And they're like, you know, they're like apes strong with each other and like, you know, so yeah. And so, you know, what's coming in the next year, it's people are gonna be trying to recreate that a lot and a lot of projects are gonna come out, but also like a lot of people are gonna come in and be like, I can't afford a crypto punk or a board ape because there are hundreds of thousands of dollars, like what's next on the horizon? So people are gonna be trying to get that next big project and hopefully just as there's like an X or whatever that crosses, like where people become more and more into it and it becomes the barrier of entry lowers, so it's easier for them to get into it. And then maybe the public sentiment will shift about it as people get into it because, you know, besides the environmental thing, then people think it's like money laundering or it's a scam in some way or it's, I don't know, but like, I don't know, I've never been a big complainer. And so when new things come up, I've always been kind of like, well, let me check it out, let me see what's up. But then some people that are default is just to be like, oh, I don't understand it or I don't feel like I belong in it. I'm just gonna talk shit about it. Well, that's art, right? I mean, that's what I love about the whole money laundering thing is like, oh, really, are you just discovering what art is? You know what I mean? Like what, did you just, like that's, it's like a bunch of people are like, wait a minute, I think this might be more than just a picture. It's like, yeah, it is, it's so much more. It's a fucking, like, you know, it's a cultural, some of them are time bombs. I mean, it's like, you know, like any one of us who, and like, gone into museums in a bad mood and looked at some incredible work of art, a toilet bowl, just sitting there and we're looking at it and we're like, I could put a toilet bowl in an art museum. Right? And like as though the creator of that didn't know, it wasn't puppeteering you. Like you don't even realize, you dumb fuck, that you are, that puppet bowl is like just making you dance like a little fucking puppet in front of it. Every time you say that, it's hijacking you, harnessing you and making you do what it wants. Fuck yeah, it has value. Fuck yeah, that toilet bowl is more powerful than you. And yeah, it's a scam and you just fell for it when you were like, wait a minute, I think this is a scam. Yes, he got you, didn't it? And it's like, so that's the other thing I love about NFTs is like, my God, it's like the technologically hypercharged version of that. It's like making people seize up. It's just like freaking people to fuck out. And I think that's an indication of its power for better or for worse, for better or for worse. Yeah, and there's real art like you're saying that like, there's a single pixel that somebody sold for I don't remember how much, that kind of stuff. So it's like, yeah, there's gonna be that kind of art that like pisses people off and it's like, I could have done that. It's like, yeah, you definitely could have, but you didn't and you didn't do all the stuff that that guy did for the last 20 years as well. Yeah. To give you the point where you are gonna just sell a single pixel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could have invented fucking toast, but I didn't, you know, I didn't, it's too late. Somebody was like, what happens if I put toast in this machine? Holy, don't put, well, don't put your bread in there. Oh, you like hard bread, is that what you want? You don't like good old soft bread? I don't know who this guy is, but he's fucking awesome. Yeah, that's what they got. He's fucking up society. He's on Twitter. Yeah, he's there. Well, you know how many panda bears died so you could eat your art, bread? Now, so, okay, so to me, it must be really a little bit kind of scary to be you in the sense that you're like getting, you really have just jumped in to this digital river and you don't know where it's gonna take you, man. And so I wonder if we could maybe just talk a little, and if it just is too weird, which I often get too weird, maybe just talk about the surreal quality of your life now. And I would like to know, like when I say, if you seem like you've jumped into an alternate timeline or like you're doing some kind of dimensional navigation via technology, or you're one of the first people who essentially just like blew out of a paradigm of like, you know, this isn't how it works, man. You're someone who just like popped out of a complete kind of like bogged down swampy terrain into, I mean, what seems like an abundant, fabulous kind of existence. Can you talk about that a little bit? Do you have any kind of like metaphysical theories about what happened to you? Well, I'm still, you know, I'm still processing it and it's still very surreal, obviously. And just knowing that, well, just knowing that like my family's taken care of and you know, that like, I don't have to hustle as hard as I've been doing my whole life, you know, trying to find whatever the next gig is and negotiating with people for how much they're gonna pay me to do it and things like that. Cause I'm not good at that, asking people for money because when I was doing graphic design, it was like a lot of times for my friends' bands. And so I would just do like whatever they could scrape up, you know, and like that's like, it was real. Yeah, so now just knowing that like every day I just wake up and I wait for, you know, if I have something I need to, or I want to get done, or I have an idea that I just start right away, but basically it's wait for like the moment to strike and you know, like an idea to pop. And I'll have like half baked ideas for a while and then one will come through that's fully formed. And I just, and then nothing else matters for the next, you know, however many hours kind of thing. But like to be able to do that and then put it out and then people love it and buy it. And then I just move on with my day, compared to what my life was like before that and what most people, you know, it's very surreal. And I feel guilt sometimes, but I also know that like, you mean like the transformation you're talking about, like I truly feel like me waking up every morning at four and putting in the hours over the years was like, it was just like preparation for when this came. And I mean, trust me, like I feel nothing but grateful for what I have and what I've been able to build. But like, and like I feel nothing but just lucky that like it all converged at the time that it did. And you know, to answer your question, I'm still processing it. Yeah. Cause it's been, and I've been doing it for seven months. Yeah. But I only actually like got the real like push behind me about two months ago. So, or three, you know, maybe, but like, yeah. So it's literally been no time at all. Everything else that I've done before it takes years. And I've always thought, known that it takes 10 years to do anything and to be good at anything. Yeah. And I've always been drawing here and there my whole life, but like focusing on this pop wonder illustrations, it's been a little over a year. And it's not supposed to happen like that in my head. You know, but that's the thing I've had like mediocre successes and failures and everything in between like leading up to my whole life. So I feel like, you know, and I've had like my friends that I have similar mindsets to me where, where we're always like pushing for something bigger. Yeah. Because it's really easy to, especially like your musician friends, you can, it's a mixed bunch, right? Some of them are just like trying to not work, right? Which is great. And, and I don't want to work at a job or for somebody else or whatever, but I do want to like bust it every day, like, you know, do something to like further make my life better. So, so the people that I've been in contact with, my friends who have that same mentality, we've been, you know, talking about it and working with it and workshop and stuff and throwing ideas back and forth to each other for years. So, so I have to, I have to remind myself that when I start feeling guilty or- The guilt thing is like another, this is what technology is, this is one of the ways it's fucking with us culturally is it's like so much of our value system is based on this kind of weird quantification of suffering. So it's like, if you've, you know, if you suffered this much, then this is how much you should exchange your suffering tokens. Yeah, suffering used to be the ultimate Bitcoin. It was like you've suffered this much. And look, everyone's suffering. So the value of suffering is really low right now. But you know, but the point is technology because of it's making it so that the amount of suffering required to get to some point is reducing. And that doesn't make sense. It fucks with our heads so bad. It can't be like, I'm like, this is not, even though by the way, it's been like that for the billionaires and the trillionaires for as long as there's been billionaires and trillionaires. It's like, you know, they've been experiencing that reality and justifying it by like, you know, well, my great grandfather invented aspirin. All right. That's how that's why I have 700 houses, you know, but like now, but again, I think it's this paradigm shift that threatens that. It's not supposed to, value isn't supposed to just instantaneously go rushing to people like you, like especially that quick. What the fuck? We got somebody in fucking tie-dye. What the fuck? You can't do that. And you know what I mean? And so it's like, it's, you know, it's like apocalyptic in the best way possible, you know? It's like this beautiful thing. I just think of it as dimension hopping. It's like some kind of technological dimension hopping. You shift it out of one timeline into another timeline. You're probably going to shift into another one. I wouldn't be surprised if time travelers start visiting you. You got to look out. You never know. I will, I'll be ready. It's one of the signs. You know, you start seeing people dressed in weird shiny clothes following you around and shit. Yeah, I'm not that that's ever happened to me, but it's a dream. Look, do you, do you think it's the end of the world? I mean, in what way? Like in the Ray Kurzwell way. Oh, right. Like we're just like barreling towards the singularity and then it's just going to go. Yeah. I mean, it makes sense with the way things are going. You know, like, I hope not, or I hope that if it does, and it's in a long time from now, but, but. Do you think that, and let me ask you this. What are your thoughts? Like if you had something to say to the people who, the paper people, the people who are like, you digital, it's ones and zeros. You can't just do that. You're selling your JPEGs. What about, you know, these aren't canvases. You don't know how to paint. You don't know how to, you wouldn't, I bet you don't know how to put it in a, like I remember when I took one art class, they were all, I stopped because it was like the amount of time spent on like how to stretch a canvas. Like, Jesus Christ, I just want to splatter paint on fucking paper. I don't want to stretch a canvas, but, you know, what do you have to say to the, to the negate, to the people of the negative fucking Luddites out there who feel like you should be painting on paper and going down to your local fucking gallery and asking if you could get lucky enough to hang one of your beautiful works of art on a nail in their gallery. Well, I have, I've stopped trying to evangelize it, even though I know that it's important to reach out to the people in the naysayers and kind of like hear them out and try to, you know, so I do, I wait for questions rather than, then try to come out here and evangelize. But basically it's, there's, okay. The fact that it's not a physical piece is irrelevant because kids these days know that are playing Fortnite and Roblox and things like that, that digital assets have value. Yes. And, you know, the fact that, and when you do stop and break down to the right click, save as guy, which they're called, who says that all I have to do is save this and now I own it. But when you really do like reach out and explain to these people that like, okay, well, but it didn't come from me, you know, out of my, it says created by pop wonder. Yeah. There's only one of them. It's up to me to be ethical and not create another one on another platform and sell it somewhere else. Right. But my reputation is everything for, because it's the community and people, you know, for the most part, I feel like respect the decisions that I make because it affects them. Yes. You can, you can, you know, supply and demand. If I just like pumped out a bunch of crap, then the value of everything would go out. Right. Yeah. Whoa, cool. Yeah. So I kind of try to keep it, you know, just the good stuff. I'm a slow drip, keep the demand there or whatever. But as far as telling these other people, so it's like, if you're not buying it, you know, out of my collection from me, then it's not for me. And then as far as just like the naysayers that want, you know, these digital artists to like stick with traditional art or whatever, it's like, I'm not a painter and I'm not anything. I started drawing, I started drawing on paper, like in a pencil, but then like pretty quickly moved to an iPad and it's all been digital since then because I became an artist like in the Instagram era. And the, and I was doing my graphic design as digital as well, you know, and just printed out. So it's like, basically I'm like, we have figured out a way for a digital artist like me who all of their work is ephemeral and like, you know, ones and zeros, like I said, to turn their piece into a limited edition piece and put it out into the world and make a living off of it, you know, which before, like I literally started my Instagram so people would just like think I was good at drawing and like, that's it. Like, you know, like I never thought like it would become a commercial success at all. Wow. Yeah, I just wanted like, I was already doing my graphic design, that was fun, but I got so much, you know, so much input from other people because they're paying you, it's fine. That I needed something that nobody was giving me any input on, so I created it, yeah. Yeah, input free, that's what you want, man. Like, no matter what, it's always better to be able to do that. Yeah, I know, man. Damn, I am so blown away, man. You are so cool and thank you so much for coming on the show. Thank you, man, thank you. Can I tell you something real quick? Yeah, please. So like, I used to work at a warehouse packing up boxes full of like acupuncture supplies, needles and herbs and stuff. Yeah. And I'd listen to podcasts, go about my day, da-da-da, and one day I was listening to the family hour with Dean Delray. Yeah. And, you know, musician and I relate to him and stuff. And he was talking about how he changed his life and like went from working at the motorcycle dealership to being an actor and then stand up and stuff, right? Yeah. And I like walked straight into my boss's office after that and I was like, I gotta go. I'll give you a couple more weeks. Really? Yeah. And it was so I could have more time to do graphic design. And then, and that was four years ago this summer, this last summer, and yeah. And it was a scary decision, but it worked out like really great. And then, and now here I am. And so it's fucked up, man, right? It's fucked up. And now we're talking? Yeah. It makes no sense. That's so fucking trippy. Yeah. Listen, listen, whatever is, we don't know. I will never understand this. What's happening in the world. It's weird beyond weird. And whatever these forces are that are working to bring people like us together, I think they're wonderful. And I'm just glad that they exist. And that story, like, that fills me with a lot of joy. You know, cause that's, yeah, you jumped. That's it. You gotta jump. You know what I mean? You gotta jump. I remember when I was working in the commie store friends with Rogan and he would fucking, we would get on the phone. I'm like, I got this desk job. I'm the talent coordinator there. And it's like, and he would all, he would just say like, just quit. Just quit. You gotta jump. Just jump. And I would be like, well, oh really, just quit. I mean, come on, man, what am I gonna do? Just jump. Go for it. You know? And sometimes I think that that is not a great advice to listen to. Sometimes you're not supposed to jump. But some, you know, so it's great to hear that you jumped and that it tumbled you into this incredible, bizarre new emergence of like, of art. It's like, that's incredible, man. I'm, that's, that's, that's incredible. Yeah. Thank you. Fuck. That's such a mind fuck. Wow, man. Yeah. Well, who knows what's next? You know, 2045, that's Kurzweil's prediction. Oh, wow. 2045. And before then it's gonna get really weird. Yeah, it seems on track, right? Actually, what's, what's crazy is if you read like the singularity is near, his predictions were actually off in the sense that they're happening sooner than he predicted them. You know, the RNA shit in particular, the RNA, the, the COVID like accelerated people, like his prediction of like the RNA vaccines. And like, you know, next you're gonna, and you're already seeing it. You're gonna see like cancer getting cured. We're already seeing like the cure for AIDS. So like, you're gonna start seeing all these like, again, it's in this, it's very, it's weirdly similar to the, like, okay. So I don't mean to go like, this is gonna be very confusing maybe cause I haven't fully groked it. But in this al, alchemical book I'm reading, it talks about this idea of separating the subtle from the gross, right? So like, in other words, like you can look at water and you can separate from water itself, things that are like water, you know, like the Bruce Lee meme that's everywhere, become like water. If it's, so we can like, you don't have to have water to understand water ness, right? And so this NFT thing that's happening, it's got a quality to it that for just right now, I would call like singularity ness. In other words, it's got this like quality to it that seems like anti-matter compared to the way we understand what it means to be a human, value, suffering, all the stuff we talked about. And so what is, what are the things that we understand about being human? Death is one of the things we understand about being human. Aging is one of the things we understand about being human. But if you take this singularity ness out of NFTs and just look at it, it's like, well, look, here's something that no one fucking predicted. No one fucking predicted that all of a sudden people would be able to take digital art, singularize it. It's literally a singularity, you know what I mean? It's a one thing and then massively profit from that singularity itself, right? Similarly, these other things that we think are gonna be with us all the time, death, old age, disease, it might not be the fucking case. Right. You know what I mean? The singularity ness quality might begin to sort of like show up in other ways that are so important, not the shit you see on Reddit where it's like promising treatment for pancreatic cancer, but shit like, oh no, no, this is like penicillin for cancer. You come in, we give you the shot and your cancer is gonna go away. Like what the fuck? And then, and you'll see it'll have similar qualities as to what's happening with NFTs. It will disrupt industries. It will fall the people who are making money on chemotherapy, which is great cause it heals people. I'm not knocking it like some weird or radiation therapy. All of a sudden it's like, yeah, congrats. You've got that fucking massive radiation gun thing. It's worthless now cause I can go. So it's gonna, so that's the other quality. It fucking creates these seismic shocks that disrupt entire industries. And then also I think you can expect with all of these emergent things that are just down the line, massive pushback. Well, you know, guaranteed as soon as the, whatever the vaccine is for cancer comes out or whatever the anti-aging thing that comes out. Oh, it's gonna be like, no, that should be fucking illegal. You can't reverse age yourself. Look at you. Oh, well, well, well, oh, you're 70 and you look like you're 23. Fuck you. Exactly. Do you know how many pandas had to die? So you could look like you're fucking 23. You know what I mean? And in that, I think what that represents, I'm sorry, I'm really rambling here, is like a bifurcation of timelines. You're looking at like one old, musty, shitty, we rode on stone and your art goes on paper and you fucking die when you're around 80 and you can't take care of you. And the other one was just like, no, I'm whatever I wanna be. When you're born, when you have a dick, well, you're a man, you can't change it. You know what I mean? No, actually I did, I'm changing it. I can be whatever the fuck I want. I'm gonna have a chameleon vagina in my butthole if I want to with the gene therapy that's coming out. You can go fuck yourself. You know what I mean? I'll do, I'll be whatever I want. I'll turn into a pigeon. No, you're a dad. You can't turn into a fucking pigeon. So that, you know what I mean? Like that's what, it's like a meltdown or something. You know what I mean? It's a beautiful, glorious meltdown. I just think anytime, I'm sorry, I'm gonna wrap it up. Anytime you hear somebody doing that thing. No, no, no, no, no, that's not how it is. That's what you need to start looking at. Exactly, that's how I feel. Something's coming from that, you know? Who knows what? That being said, you just start making, stop making these things, man. They're fucking out in the environment. Are you gonna stop? Go back to the warehouse. Yeah, go back to the warehouse. So, do you have anything you wanna say to people listening right now who are most definitely thinking to themselves, I wanna get into making NFTs. I know a lot of artists listen to this and maybe don't understand it at all. And I'm sure that some people listening are like, okay, what do I do? Make a Twitter account. And that was like the deal breaker for a lot of my friends back in like February and March. That's where everything's happening. People don't wanna go on Twitter or something. I made a fresh account and I think that's a good move too. Cause I didn't have, you know, if you have a lot of followers, that's the thing, if you have a lot of followers, they are not into NFTs, most likely. Right. If you're an artist that has maybe a big following on Instagram or especially if you're just starting out and it's like make a Twitter, it'll suck to have zero followers, but you just gotta get in there and you gotta follow some people that are doing NFTs and you gotta be looking at it and you gotta just, you know, keep making your art and observe the community and what's going on. The second would be to, you know, really think about having a cohesive body of work and that's like something that doesn't come, you can't really force it. It's something that comes after like a long time of experimenting, but you can dial it in. You know, it feels like you're restricting yourself, but if you kind of dial in yourself with some constraints, like I was talking about in the beginning, then that kind of starts to sculpt what your style is and basically what people are looking for when they're collecting this stuff is, you know, a cohesive style that they can recognize and also just somebody that's clear that they're in it for the long haul and that they're into NFTs and it's very organic for me, but it's been clear for me and like I said, it took a few months to build up for like people really started catching on, but I've been buying these things and talking about them and like celebrating when I buy them and like also supporting my friends and retweeting them and, you know, and like talking to, you know, it's, I'm into NFTs and it's clear to people. Yeah. You know, because if I was just an artist that had a bunch of shit going on in the real world and I just want to drop a collection and then you guys buy them and then they can just fuck right off after that. And just go and then that work, hopefully you liked it because you're probably going to own it forever because they're not promoting and creating new work. So that they become more popular and that, you know, because I was selling all my stuff. The things you were looking at for like $1,700, like those would take me two weeks to sell out like 20 of them for like 150 bucks, right? Yeah. And so now they, you know, I have to like create new systems to sell them because they'll sell too fast or like, you know, like people will like lose their transaction fees fighting for them or whatever, you know? But yeah, so the point is like, you got to be in it for the long haul and don't let little dips in the sales of your NFT and in the value of the cryptocurrency to affect you a lot and get your spirits down or whatever. You just got to just plug away. I mean, it's just like anything. It's just like podcasting you, like we podcast because we love to podcast. I mean, that's it. Like, I love to, I'm a podcast. That's what I do. I love it. I'll never stop doing it. It's just my favorite thing. So it sounds like that. It's like, don't get in it for a cash grab. Don't get in it for like, like you need to like respect because it's cool because it's more than just the, I hear you say it's more than the art. It's like a, the art is a fractal of this like growing community of artists. It's, wow, that's so trippy, Matt. So cool. Hmm, cool. Well, where can people find you, JP? Yeah, Pop Wonder NFT on Twitter is the best place. Pop Wonder World on Instagram is a good way to like just see all the, all my past stuff in a row. But I neglected it compared to Twitter because there's a lot more action on Twitter these days for this stuff. I love people. And I don't actually, I'm kind of actually like in the closet on Instagram. Weird, man. That's so, I get the, it's so funny. People are like, I'm not going on Twitter. He's like a cesspool. How bizarre is that? It's so strange. No, it's, it's great. If you're in NFT Twitter as a, as a pop in place to be. I'm getting into it. As soon as I, I'm going to follow all the people you follow. As soon, so I've held back a couple of people or a couple of pieces in my collection or I even bought one back one day cause it was listed for too low. I was like disrespectful. I bought it back from the person. And so as soon as you get your wallet set up and everything I got one coming your way. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I could not accept that. That's incredible. I accept it. You don't have a choice how to send it to you. Thank you. Holy shit. Thank you. Thank you. It's been a real, real, real pleasure getting to know you. Thank you so much for doing this show. Yeah, likewise. Hare Krishna. That was JP Downer, everybody. Make sure you follow him on Twitter and on Instagram.

It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast. I almost didn't put a podcast out this week, but I realized that that would be stupid. And what the fuck? What are you not going to? What's the point of that? What does that do or say? It doesn't do anything. It doesn't say anything. It's ridiculous. And more than that, the reason I want to do it was not because I didn't really feel like putting a podcast out because I was scared. Because right now, we live in such a crazy time in the history of the planet that pretty much anything you do publicly has some kind of political slant to it. Whether you meant it to be political or not, you're going to piss somebody off right now. That's the time period that we're in right now. You're going to piss somebody off. I actually have considered, and I'm not going to do it. It's ridiculous, tweeting something along the lines of, love is the most important thing. A rather mundane, cliche, obvious statement that could be on the back of any weird, healthy shit-tasting cereal or bad, flavorless toothpaste. And I know that if I were to tweet that, it would only be a matter of time before somebody would attack me for saying, in some way, shape, or form, just a matter of time before somebody would be like, really? Is that what you think? That's not the solution right now. Or somebody would say something along the lines of, you fucking virtue signaler, which is a whole thing right now. If you were crazy enough to, in public, say anything that is remotely an expression of some hope that the world becomes less crazy, chaotic, insane, violent, brutal, scary, and completely fucked up, then people are going to get mad. They're going to say you're virtue signaling. You know, which is basically the same thing as telling somebody, shut the fuck up. Anytime anybody says virtue signaling to you, just replace it with shut the fuck up, because that's what they're saying to you, just shut the fuck up. You're not really, it's the muttering of beings in hell. And I promise you this, and I hope I never find out, but if there is a fucking hell, I promise you that there's not just people screaming in hell, there's also beings in hell screaming at the screaming beings to shut the fuck up. Stop virtue signaling with your screams, it's hell, what did you expect? You get your face burned off and demons come and jerk off and you're burning eye sockets and the cum steam rises up in the air and steams the face of the person who's stuck right above you by tentacle things that are ripping its nipples off. It's always going to be like that. And your expressions of thinking we can make hell a better place are virtue signaling, you're doing nothing. So fuck it, just right now, we just got to be who we are for better, for worse, and pray and visualize, do the magic, do it all, do the magic, do it all, do the marches, do the visualization, do the donate, do it all, do it, you know what, do everything that's gonna piss off the person who throws around the virtue signal or just piss him off. Besides the dopes who throw around the word virtue signaling, unfortunately I've been one of those dopes in the past, they don't realize that they're on a slippery slope because they're virtue signaling by calling other people virtue signalers. Suddenly you get this incredible echo chamber of virtue signal accusations. And, you know, because they're all, what are you doing? Like what are you, anytime you're on Twitter telling somebody else they're moralizing, you're instantaneously guilty of their identical crime, he was not virtue signaled, tweet the first tweet as Jesus once said, it's just this is the way it is right now. You know, you've got to just say the way you feel. I mean, this is, that's all we got. Once that goes away and you're afraid to talk, then just, it's all over. I mean, that's, that creates a dark malignancy that just secretly spreads until the only people who are talking are people who aren't afraid to yell at other people for saying sweet things online or people who are yelling at people who are saying sweet things online because they want them to not talk or, you know what I mean? You just end up with this cacophony of different encampments and tribes of people with various ethical ideologies telling each other to shut up. And that doesn't do any good for anybody. So we just got to, even if it's, whatever, this intro, whatever, what am I gonna do? You know, the same part of me that when I'm writing is like, well, it's not as good as Hemingway. You know, there's that the ego part of me would love to do, this is what my ego would love. My ego would love for me to somehow manufacture one of the funniest podcast intros that has ever happened, but not just that, that's not enough. It would also enjoy the, I would like it if somehow just out of my mouth flows like the perfect series of sentences that just gets picked up by radio stations, all the news, all the networks just throw like, my God, this 46 year old podcaster, he truly channeled the voice of truth and rationality, justice and love in a way that transcends all political leanings. And then I would like that amplification of my intro to bring aliens to the planet who reveal to us the great secrets of the ages and invite us into some cosmic family where we all have our own personal spaceships and can just fly all over the universe and are no longer stuck in the gravity well that is keeping us trapped on planet Earth. That's what my ego would like, but this is what we got. So that's where we're at right now. And there you go. And we've got a great podcast for you today. Emil Amos is here with us today. Also, let me just say I'm aware of the annoying microphone crackle, but you got to understand for probably two days now I've been working on an intro for this episode and this is the one I'm gonna use. So I just, I'm not gonna repeat it because otherwise I'll go insane. I'll claw my eyes out, I'll pull my tongue out. I'll start smashing my head into the disgusting tile of my studio here in the Valley. And I don't wanna do that. Though it probably would sound pretty cool. And if I put it into my synthesizers, it would be an interesting noise experiment, but we're just gonna go with this. Emil is a genius. He is one of my best friends on the planet. He is in many bands, including the Grails, Olm and Holy Sons, and here is a track from his album, The Cline of the West. It's called, 12 Things You Do While Waiting for the Apocalypse. It's called, 12 Things You Do While Waiting for the Apocalypse. Did you build from the ground your own church? Down with the written histories of the burned-up books that began I read, oh, celebrate the graves that you stand upon. This is love to the death that I'm standing on. A claustrophobic magic spiral, sickens and swirled. Can you feel the failure that I felt with the girl? Liberations, I'll bring the mind prisons back in. Get them safe, keep them safe, forget the past, do as the sickness lasts. Consolescence, pre-designed, and big confights without the bottomized mind. Lockdown, come in, sing, sing, and get the things you want from me. I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I'm not going to let you down, I won't let you down, I'm not going to let you down. I'm not going to let you down. I'm not going to let you down! I'm not going to let me down. I'm not going to let you down. Don't let me down. Don't let me down. Don't let me down! Don't let me down. I can't forget until my mind dies. I can't forget until my mind dies. I can't forget until my mind dies. I can't forget until my mind dies. I went to college with that guy. We're going to jump right into a conversation with Emil Amos, but first, this quick business. Friends, it's not so much that I don't want people to know that from time to time I like to look at BDSM Dominatrix foot fetish porn. It's that I don't want people to see the entirety of my internet browsing history. It's not just the porn. Moving from that to like the Unabombers Manifesto to Hollow Earth Theory to Charles Manson interviews. An incognito mode doesn't protect you.

Now, without further ado, everybody, please welcome back to the Duggar Trussell family hour podcast, one of the coolest, smartest, most incredible people. I'm just going to say I love him so much. And I'm so lucky that our lives cross paths. Welcome to the DTFH Emil Amos. It's the Duggar Trussell family hour podcast. Welcome to the DTFH. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shakin' and going to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duggar Trussell family hour podcast. Emil, welcome back to the DTFH. Woo, it's been like a year or two. It's been a long time. It's been a long time. So many, so much has changed. Do you ever think, do you ever get this? This is the craziest dream I had the other day. I dreamed I was cremating myself. Are you getting any kind of weird pandemic dreams? No, I don't think so. I was going to say, do you ever remember having actual anger at your parents for having you? You know, it's so funny. I was just looking. There's like, I can't remember the name of it. There's a movement. It's a philosophical movement, which is basically saying it's unethical that human life is so painful that having a child is unethical. I'm going to have to turn the AC on a little bit. It's too damn hot. Yeah, having a child is actually unethical, because the child obviously can't consent theoretically, as far as we know, to being born. And then you basically plunge it into a world of despair. And that is just cruelty. I can't remember the name. It's the anti-life movement. It's one of the most hilarious philosophical movements I ever heard. I mean, just because it's like, well, not everyone is miserable. Yeah, did you guys have talks about that before you went through with it, or did you feel like it was just like something ineffable that pushed you forward and made you feel positive, or did you actually wrestle with that? No, we didn't wrestle with it at all. And I wrestled with how un-wrestle-able it was. That's what I wrestled with. I wrestled with suddenly feeling like for a second somebody had opened up the back of some gigantic clock, and I saw all the massive gears moving. And I felt like one tiny little part of that mechanism that didn't have much to say about it either way. And then we had the baby. But I didn't really, you know, up until that point, I had pretty much played all my cynical, skeptical, carowax style, having a child as damning a being to death, sentencing a being to death, all that stuff. But then when I actually was in the presence of the vortex that brought my baby into the world, it wasn't much philosophical anything other than life. Since then, it's been pretty much the same since then. Yeah. I mean, just more and more intense. It just gets like the heart. In the beginning, it was really hard for me because it hadn't fully dawned on me what we'd done. And then now it's a different kind of heart because it's like all the, the problem with it is every cliche is true that you've heard about being a parent. Like it's all true. So you end up like just being completely confronted by your humanity in the sense of being pretty unoriginal. You know, like you, you sort of like watch nature videos and you see these beings, you know, make babies and you realize that's just what I did. I'm just like them. Like they're, you know what I mean? Like that's the game. I'm in that game. And in that way, you sort of take on the sort of elemental quality. I think it's neither better nor worse than someone who doesn't have a baby, but it's just like a, you become this sort of like elemental thing that's like very scary if you don't want to do that. Yeah. I guess if, if you've ever felt that feeling of, of being angry at your parents because you were born, you know that you've wandered into the actual dark waters. Like you're, you're playing with like some Darth Vader shit. Yes. Yeah. That's right. I mean, it's the best though. I mean, that's such a good place to be is to play with that Darth Vader. I mean, that's the idea, right? It's like, go play with that as much as you possibly can. Like any kid should go through that period because then you have to, you're basically the problem is you, you're going to run into a difficult place, which is like, okay, where does my anger stop? Do I stop with my parents for having me or should I be also angry at my grandparents? And then, you know what I mean? Like, and then you're like, well, should I then be angry at the force, the evolutionary forces in the universe? And does this put me on the same team as all the beings that didn't manage to kill someone in my ancestry, but attempted to? Am I now on their side? And you're like, God damn it. I wish that arrow had fucking hit my great grandfather right in the face. Where do you stop being mad? It's my question. Once you take that line of thinking. I agree with you. I think, I think something in your world and your teenage world of like, as I drifted into art, I thought, I thought that that dark energy was sort of like going to save me or something. And maybe, maybe because it probably isn't quite essentially dark in the end, it does. But, but I feel like when you touch the burner and it hopefully what we're talking about will become more clear as it as we keep talking. But, but I feel like when you touch the burner and you do go to that dark side, it, it marks you. Maybe that's what happens in Damien. Maybe that's what the mark of Cain is. But I feel like for the rest of your life that those experiences stay with you so burned into your skin that you it must be good. There must be something really magical happening for it to stay with you forever. You know, it's one thing to black something out. That might be a different thing. But I was thinking when. What do you mean black enough? Like if you're trying to forget something, people talk about how they can't remember something because they don't want to. Yeah. I think you even told me once that you had found like a hidden memory. But I don't know if, if you remember that or what, what, what year that was, but I just think if I'm dialing up like a MIDI keyboard sound to throw an overdub on a song and I'm trying to EQ it, I know that I have to have it sound this particular way that somehow, if I, if someone asks me, why do you want the keyboard sound that way? I would say because it reminds me of like my suffering. Wow. Cool. Like it sounds like that. It sounds like that. It sounds like that. I has to sound like that dank, terrible place, you know, and, but so, so the something good must have been happening for me to to sentimentalize all of that pain. It must, it must have been a great thing in some way, you know, or maybe this, you know, trying to sentimentalize it is just another attempt to deal with pain. It's not great or not great. It's just that you're, you know, it's like, you know, it's like you're, you're, you're getting eaten by the tiger and your last thoughts can be mother fuck. I'm getting eaten by a tiger or it could be I'm giving food to this wonderful being through my body. The tiger doesn't care what you're thinking. It's just eating you and it's not wondering if you having some sentimental relationship with that reality. So that, that, I think there's a, there, there is that quality I love and like chogum Trump or Rinpoche where he's just talks about how like, yeah, this is like, you're, God, he uses so many great examples. I'm sure I've ear beaten you with before, but I'll ear beat you one last time with it. This idea where he says, he talks about you're, you're standing on a floor of razors and you're just cutting your feet and it's just pain. And so you build an imaginary beam in the air and then you pretend that you've crawled into the beam and you somehow imagine that your feet still aren't being cut by the razors. The beam is your ignorance and you've burrowed into it like a termite is what he says. And you're just like, imagine, you know what I mean? You're like, it's, for me, it'll be like, I'm walking around and I will have done no, especially when I'm like really trying to be blurry. And so I've got the pain that you're talking about, I think. And, but I will have drowned it out successfully in the sense that now I'm just thinking about like, I'm angry at Twitter or something. I mean, I'm like, I'm mother fucker. I can't believe I did this. I'm worried about something because it's easier for me to imagine I'm angry at Twitter or I'm worried about some minute thing than to go back to that. Like, oh, well, what do you know? Nothing has changed. I'm still in that painful place. And there's been no shift. And that, you know what I'm saying, man? That's like, I think that can be an panic inducing moment for people. Yeah, I think you, to get through each and every moment, you know, we're probably all a bit autistic. And in order to get through the day, you have to compartmentalize all these emotions. And so then when you sort of reopen a compartment, like you hear a song from 1998, and you think, man, what a song. There are states of mind where you analyze the song. And it's, it's pretty basic, but you kind of forget that along with it, there's this entire prism of experiences that come rushing back. Like you can't, everything is kind of happening all at once all the time. So for you to just sort of singularly memorialize one way of feeling or something is a pretty unrealistic way of illustrating life, because really, along with it is all these other things that probably inevitably remind you of being young and to be young is to feel innocent and to be innocent is to be vulnerable and probably being hurt or about to be hurt. And like the idea of that kind of innocence is beautiful and thinking about it and like meditating on it is fills you with all these positive feelings. So there's so many different things going on when you get sentimental, you know? You, it reminds me of this. I was like, when I was doing a much more disciplined meditation practice, because I was working closely with David Nick turn, who is the person who has been teaching me meditation forever now. And so I'm doing it every day and I'm sitting and like, man, all of a sudden I can't even describe the sorrow that I felt like it was so out of the, I was, nothing was happening. I'm just sitting there looking at like pine needles and pine needles just looking at leaves. You know what I mean? Just sitting outside looking and then all of a sudden it was just like, I've never felt such a sorrow and it was so beautiful and so powerful and I was really, I don't want to say confused, but it just was, it was just all of a sudden there it was. And I was talking to him about that. I'm like, what is that? He said, that is where you, you are supposed to radiate out from that place. That's the, that's it. Like that's the heart of sorrow or the heart of compassion. And that is the feeling. Like that's not to say there's one feeling, but just sort of, you know, it's like, I think another way to put it might be, I don't know why I'm using animals, eating other animals right now. But like, you know, you, you know what it is? I've been watching these Disney nature documentaries with forest. And it's really unnerving because like, I know he's going to have to find out about death, but these Disney nature documentaries, some of them just all of a sudden it's like the mother's snow leopard has found a tasty snack. And there's this monster carrying this adorable elk or whatever. And it's not elk, like a little goat, like a mountain goat, a dead mountain goat up a hill to its children. While there's like the mountain goats, I don't know, brother, wife, I don't know how their social situation is sort of like glumly watching this thing carry corpse up into the fucking mountains. You know what I mean? It's mind, whatever mind is capable of processing that it's life has changed now because his friend is gone is processing. You could see it and yours. I'm sitting with a baby who's like, you know, holding my hand and we're watching it. And I don't have, there's no way I could say to him, well, you know, forest, that's what happens. You see the cycle of life and all that. You can't really say anything. It's just the brutality of nature. Even in Disney, it's just right there on display. But similarly, you, if you were to look at all of those great moments in your life that were so important to you as the goat and you were to look at time as the leopard that just carries them off into the mountains of oblivion, whether you like it or not, you know, you, you, it gives you an example of this like reality that we're really in to the point of, of course, you yourself are going to be like those memories eventually and be on the funeral pyre, however you're deciding to be, um, your body to be dealt with. And that, and then people are going to be very sad for a while. And then they're going to just start getting better. Like that little mountain goat. I'm sure it didn't spend too much time. Morning. Yeah. You know what I mean? You see that in their eyes. You feel like, you know, unlike a human, you feel like they're a little bit more on the frequency of, of like something, nothing happening than something happening and then nothing happening again. Like it's that simple. Something was inanimate. It was born. And then in a second, in a millisecond, it was taken away. But now that's happened. So what is there to do? Yeah. Yeah. And not that, that, that. So then, so then, okay. So now what do we do as humans? We go into this morning period that's really intense. And it's a physical thing. And we go through it. We struggle with it. Cause like you are in a whole new reality now. And you're, you're, you think sometimes when I really look at my grief, I think what percentage of my grief was missing that person and what percentage of it is me not wanting to die. And, you know, being reminded that the any, when someone around you dies, that you, that it just means that, you know, their plane came a little sooner than your plane. And you know what I mean? And that reminder is really intense because you do have to deal with it. And then you get into this crazy idea of reincarnation, which is like, some people say, well, you're just trying to make yourself like, not like fix this problem of eternal death. But the thing with reincarnation is almost even more in some ways dire than Dawkins anesthesia idea or whatever you're just being put down for eternity, which is that some semblance, some trace of you remains. And it's exactly like when you wake up from a dream and you've met some people in the dream, you just don't think about them anymore. Right? You don't think about the people in the dream that you met two weeks ago that you had a great conversation with, even though like in that dream, they seem so real. You wake up and you're like, God, that's all, that was just a dream. Well, similarly, this is like the concept of reincarnation, which is me, your mom, your dad, everyone that you love, everyone that you cared for, anyone you had any association with. When you die, you don't die forever, but they just are kind of like a dream. And then you just go on to the next life and like get back into the, your karmic momentum. And you've been doing that forever. Yeah, I'm still kind of mesmerized by the pine needle scene. The, I can't, I feel like it's been a long time since I've been sad like that. And yet maybe that's not totally true. So I'm trying to think about it. But I almost, like I was saying before, you know, you miss a type of innocence in yourself when you were so easily hurt, like, like a kind of a stupid thing to even verbalize me. Why would you miss that kind of innocence, that kind of sadness? But that's oftentimes when you make or you're the most hungry for the world, you know, you're going out there on the battlefield and you get shot because you don't know what exactly how to navigate it. And it's kind of like, it's hard for me to access that because I know better. I don't, that idea, when we were hungry, when we were like sure that the world would care like nothing about us. And there was like everything to lose. And we were losing in real time that I wouldn't let myself emotionally go there now because I have all these, I don't know if you would call them defenses or context that I built up that create my world of confidence, you know. But I miss it. I miss feeling that level of total vulnerability, although that makes no sense because I probably don't want to feel like that. I don't want to be that sad. What was your, when you traced the source of that pine needle feeling, what do you remember coming up with at all? Well, see, that was the really great aspect of it is that though I could easily feed an explanation in, I could say, oh, I'm feeling this because of my mom dying, my dad dying, my body getting gold. And I, I could come up with a million reasons why I might be feeling that sorrow, but, and they could all be right. But you, this is where it gets really trippy is if we're talking about this fundamental state of heartbreak that is there in the way that your skin or bones are there and that there is in this society, one of the things you used to, you know, talk about is the need for the need people have for a reason. And so you, you, you have, because it might be so intolerable that there should be a fundamental kind of sorrow and existence, you would then want to come up with a reason for the sorrow, because if you can come up for, with a reason for the sorrow, then you're beginning to build this wonderful defense mechanism against it. Cause now if you have a reason, you have a way to stop the sorrow. And you've basically tricked yourself into essentially, you know, basically what you've done is found a part of your cosmic soul land and that you find intolerable. And then you start building a wall, you know, a walled garden around it. And then the next thing you know is you're telling yourself that it's not there all the time. And that's another part of the trick because to be in that state all the time is not conducive to a lot of people's idea of how you would live a productive life. And I think this is why Chogium Trump talks that calls this a warrior, a kind of warrior lineage that he teaches, because the warrior is not someone who's numb, the warrior is someone who's completely heartbroken and yet is completely empowered by that and fully engaged in reality. And with that, never ending loneliness, which is when you look at it, Chogium Trump, I remember talking, he seems like the loneliest person you've ever seen in your life. Like he seems so alone. And he talks about that in his books that that's, yeah, that is the condition is loneliness. That is it. That's one of the qualities is loneliness. It's none of this sounds very appealing, but you know what I mean? But it is just that thing you were saying that longing to go back to that state. That is that part of you when you're sick that kind of wants to be healthy again. Yeah, and you think about it's kind of a whispered about theme with parents like they want their children to rebel to a certain extent. Like if they see that their kid is growing up and really not disagreeing with things very much, they start to get a little bit nervous because they want them to meet challenges, you know, and, and rise above them. And, and when you're looking at a child, especially these days when they just get a phone in their hand and you have seamless for food, Uber for transportation and tender for to get rid of their sexual impulse is like it's there's sort of like this look on everybody's face. It's like, well, why, how would this not be enough? You know, like people are pretty placid in this certain way. There's you don't really see a lot of visible punk rebellion the way I feel like in the 80s, it was like a really tall Mohawk or something, you know, like the scene in the Star Trek movie where the where the guy gives Spock the finger and Spock gives them the Vulcan nerve pitch like that. That kind of like fuck you that kind of that visible sense like you don't see it as much more people are pretty stoked with this context that we've we've built. And it's it kind of I feel like parents get nervous that their kid might not have enough of that artistic rebellion in them and want them, you know, that's a bit of a theme. I don't know if you guys probably haven't gotten that far along or anything, but it is a little nerve wrecking to see a kid be a little too complacent, a little too happy with the situation. Oh, my God, man, you got to come hang out with a toddler for a little bit, man. Like you it's like it's such a raw, savage being that is in the body of an like an angel. It's like literally like the cutest thing you've ever seen in your life. You know what I mean? But this this thing is like is like primordial a thing. It's that song. Be careful. There's a baby in the house. Like you can't find a more honest thing. Like, you know what I mean? Like the baby doesn't know that there's such a thing as like somebody else getting their feelings hurt. So like if in the morning, um, if, if his mom has gotten him out of bed in the morning out of his crib, uh, whichever parent gets him out of the crib that morning, that's what he wants to hang out with. So like I'll come into the living room and Aaron will be sitting with the baby giving him milk, a blanket over him, cuddling with him. And the baby will look at me and just start shaking his head. No, no, don't fuck with me. Don't come near me. Like, don't mess this up. Go away. Like you are not wanted in this moment and it's so cool because it's so honest. It's like, yeah, I get it. I don't, I wouldn't want some hairy ass dude coming in like tickling you while you're in this nice cuddled state. And like, so that rebellion you're talking about, man, that is human. Like that is what they, they rebel against everything and then they fall in love with everything. And then they're, you will watch in the, in a span of five minutes, a toddler will go through every human emotion from the most like extreme love to basic confusion to like rage, murderous rage to like despair. Like they will, they have real despair. Like they throw themselves back and land on the ground and look up at the sky. Like they're being crucified just because you have like taken like the remote control out of their hand. You know what I mean? Like it's like, yeah. And you see, oh, oh my God, that's a human. That's what we're all going through underneath all those fucking walls. So the rebellion is happening. It's just the idea is like people want to imagine it's not happening. This kid, man, like when you hear the certain kind of scream he'll do sometimes when it's not going right for him, it's like, that's in my DNA. That scream is in me every day. I just don't do it anymore, but it's in me for sure. That's howl of complete disagreement with all forces in the universe. And that, that is human too. Man, I know what you mean. Like you, you, you, it's easy to make an appraisal like that and think, damn, man, we were, we had created a culture of, you know, almost religious rejection of what we thought to be the complacency you're talking about. And I mean, it was similar to like, we were like, we thought we were like Moses coming down the mountain, kicking over the idol, right? Like that's what we thought we were. And now we see what we imagine to be a kind of worshiping of the idol. And it's easy to think of it that way. But then again, man, don't you think that at least from this Buddhist model of things, it doesn't matter the external ritual that seems to be happening. You know what I mean? Cause everybody's still underneath it all faced with these primordial, unconsolable aspects of being a soul in a material world. Yeah. No, I don't think, I don't think things are like actually calming down. I mean, really, when you look back at our childhoods, we, we lived in a time that was probably a lot more boring and placid in a lot of ways. Like we were very innocent as a culture in the time of Reagan and Bill Clinton. I mean, there was so much we didn't know. And, and now there's so much tumble. So I'm not trying to say that so much, but, but in continuing what you're saying, do you feel a visceral obligation for that howl that you're talking about inside of you for that to be represented and encapsulized in the art you make? Do you feel like if it lacks that thing, it would be shit? Yeah. Well, I would say I think, yes, I think if you don't acknowledge that you don't have to put it in, you know, like when we were working on the midnight gospel, we, we mapped out this world in like down, down to like the smallest part, knowing that that stuff would never even be spoken of in the show. And if it was, if there was anything that it was going to be like a mild nod to like a big, you know, lore that we had created for that world, but we'd never got, we realized we couldn't go into the lore too much because it is too distracting and basically wasn't the show we were making. But still, because we had that in there, I think it made the show have this resonance or something that it feels, that world feels real because it's built on a, on an actual framework that was, we spent a month on. So I think similarly, that, that howl thing that where you maybe where I would start going wrong, where I would go wrong and have gone wrong is where I am feeling that howl and then trying to express a different world than what that, the one I'm actually experiencing because I'm afraid to bum people out or I want, I have the idea that if I do not express that in some way, or if I've even gotten to the point of not acknowledging it, that this makes it go away. And then that's superstition. And then that's, you know, that's what you meant by that's, that's what he meant by telling you to like that, that that is the source, the source that, that like is your fire and your fuel is, is that feeling with the pine needles, right? That's what you're trying to say. Yeah, I think so. I think, I don't think that I think actually the where, and I get not, this could just, at this point, I'm like, arguing something that I don't understand enough to argue about. So, or not even arguing, trying to talk about this thing, which is like, no, this is the, this is maybe the reason for the sorrow. The sorrow is not a, there is no place. And so there's sorrow. So it's like, there's no place. Now it's like, there's this sorrow that's coming from this sort of, you know, as a quality of, of, of our sort of predicament here, as a quality of trying to be a thing. You know, you're trying to be a thing. You're exerting yourself into the world for this very temporary amount of time. You've put all this energy into this incredible project. And by the time you even get to the point where you're realizing that the whole project itself was just, and was the project was not to exert itself into the world. The project was to try to evade that pine needle spot, the sorrow spot. By the time you get there, your brain is already, you're already becoming stupid. Your memories all fucked up. You're literally, you are an old, you have an old brain. And by then it's like, you know, it's, so it's even more sorrow than, and then all that's left is the sorrow. And then somewhere in there, you realize that's your heart. And the sorrow is pretty beautiful. Yeah, it seems interesting that in answering my question, you're like, you know, you're, you're talking about mapping out the midnight gospel. Universe. And it appears as though, because you guys are such a good team, I think that it came in some ways, let's say it kind of came easy to you to integrate the howl. But like, that's because you guys have, have been working on this, this super highway between you and your articulation and other people and bringing out what is you for years and years and years. And when you get to a really, really good spot, like, if you're making a great record, you know, Dark Star of the Moon or whatever, it's, it's when you get to that place where you, you have worked so hard that at that point you don't need to try very hard. But the road to that path is so, so long when it becomes kind of an effortless thing to integrate something that is quite painful in some ways. But you're so familiar with it now, and it just breathes right out of you. And, and, you know, you see it as the truth. But you roll back the tape to when you're a kid. And a lot of kids have that look in their eye like, I don't know what I want to do. I don't know what I have to say. And it's crazy to me now that we are here at this place where you can just roll right out of you and you don't have to look for it. It's just right there. Exactly like you're saying, you know, you're not having to look for it. You're not having to try. You've come to a place where it just is you and you can just hold out your hands and it rolls off your tongue, you know. Man, you, that, yeah, that place, you know, the, this is the craziest thing is, you know, you, I guess that is the thing that starts happening. And then also you realize how weirdly insignificant that is. And then, you know what I mean? Like you start realizing, especially now this damn pandemic. It's like, this is, this is such a mind fuck because, and this is going to be the equalizer. I mean, for sure. If you're, I think your assessment is pretty accurate. Your assessment of things. If this is like the universal, which is that we have found some kind of digital digitally induced complacency, all these outlets porn, the touch of you can get any porn you want. You can connect, you can, you know, basically fuck people digitally. Now you meet, you don't have to go to a bar anymore to meet people. I can't even imagine how many people are having the weirdest fucking pandemic zoom sex. Like, you know, there's some creep at zoom, you know, like whoever's working at zoom, if you think gets private, you know, there's just people at zoom that just sit and are like watching people shove bananas up their assholes while they have phones. Greatest show on earth. There's all these like, whoever is running zoom is just like laughing and disgusted at humanity. Probably whoever's running zoom right now has like God's view of humanity is just like, you know what I mean, probably so like simultaneously moved and disgusted. They just don't know what to do. They're probably thinking about. They're probably thinking about like canceling zoom. It's like staring into the arc of the Covenant. But like, this is like a super high rate of suicide among the zoom observers. They're all going blind. They're like, they're all going blind. They're all babbling like they've been looking at the necronomicon. They're saying that it's ancient. It's old. It's new. It's old. It's back. He's come again. Watch another banana in an ass. The thing is like for all of us, but I mean, you know, for all of us, no matter what, this is where we're all green horns because, you know, your, your grandparents maybe would say creepy shit to you every once in a while about how they stored up potatoes. You know, some weird thing like that. Or they'd be like, don't waste a potato. You never know when you'll be starving. And you're like, what are you even talking about? We're never going to starve grandma. What do you mean? You know, these are, you know, people who are new, someone who's probably in an air raid where bombs were falling on their city. You know, and in the West, we've been so privileged that that isn't our experience. You know, in general, maybe some bombings, some shootings, some random outbursts of the most horrific violence ever. But nothing like the concerted violence of World War II. You know, so then all of a sudden history really, you know, how many times do we hear on the news? We're part of history now. The impeachment. We're part of history. Oh, history comes again. You know what I mean? And it's like, no, now this is history for real. And now we're all being gobbled up by history. We're all stuck in our fucking houses. People are killing themselves left and right. And like every single kid who has been, who had achieved some glorious glow, I mean it. I don't mean in a condescending way, some glorious kind of like utopian convergence with it. You know, the internet suddenly is experiencing this pause, so to speak, in that or the real reality of like, oh, 100,000 people have died. So far. More than that, you know, more will die. And you can't go outside without wearing a mask. We don't know when the clubs are opening up again. We don't know when the bars are opening up again. We don't know how long they'll stay open. We don't know if this will ever go away. We don't know if it'll mutate. And by the way, there's going to be more of it. And do you really think in a world where there are radical terrorists, that people aren't collecting this shit? You know, like you really think people don't have vials of it, just sitting on their fucking desk. I'm not even talking about some like KGB operatives or some kind of crazy state run terrorists. I'm just talking about your day to day loon goes down to a, you know, urgent care, gets in the dumpster, grabs some medical waste, figures out a way to get that fucking medical waste in some kind of vial and just pops it in their freezer when they want to have fun in a few years. It's like, we're looking at a, like everyone's now experiencing the future, you know, which is not going to be okay until we figure out how to solve some pretty big problems. So I don't know, man. I think in that way, we could probably look forward, even though what I just said sounds so dire and horrific. I think we could probably look forward to some great music over the next few years. I like to think that this situation punishes you for some of the bad decisions you've made and rewards you for a lot of the good ones you've made. You know, you get frozen in this situation and hopefully you're looking at your child who you love and you're like, I'm so glad I'm here with you in this situation. You know, like I narrowly escaped New York and I'm sitting in the woods in North Carolina and I just feel like things worked out for me. Yeah. I am here. I've been set up with a job that I can do by myself out here and things landed right. You know, it's not going to land right for everybody, but I like to believe that like it does reward you for the things you set up for yourself, but it punishes you for like the bad compromises that didn't quite work out. You know? Yes. Yeah, man. There's a lot of like bizarre forms of justice and injustice happening right now that, you know, a lot of like leveling is happening right now. I mean, it's like to me, it's like, oh my God, like just think of the all the people who with all their prosperity or whatever, it's like, okay, great. You have some mansion or whatever and you have your own chef and you're eating great food or whatever, but all the restaurants are closed in New York and LA. You know what I mean? Like you can't really fly safely. There's nowhere to like, I don't care who the fuck you are. And especially if you're somebody who's like incredibly ambitious and you're one of those poor souls out there who has somehow managed to get incredibly wealthy. Not because it's a byproduct of your love of some art form or some craft or some economic thing that you're into or your store or whatever. But just because you were one of those people who thought it would be wonderful to be incredibly wealthy. And that's all you wanted was some wealth and some weird kind of fame from that wealth. And but there wasn't an art. There wasn't all you liked was making the money. You know what I mean? Like that kind of weird thing that is a that's a type of person. But the reason you like to make all that money is because you are so into fucking, you know, like you love to eat and fuck. And you love to like go out to clubs and bars and fuck and eat. But all of a sudden none of that shit matters anymore. It's like for a second you've been put on the bench because you're like, what are you going to do, man? How many are you going to fly girls into your mansion, your pandemic mansion, even that's going to seem fucking weird. You know what I mean? Like that like what everyone's still going to be weirded out and freaked out and more than likely you're ate up with paranoia. You know, and I think that that's a silver lining is that I think a lot of kids and well, all of us hopefully, you know, everything's been put in perspective. So you you see the bullshit for what it is and life online, like Facebook humble brags and all that stuff. It looks so crazy now, like it looks so inane. And so it's magnified the fact that that world that kind of hustle that we're usually Monday through Friday really involved in is bizarrely stupid. And so I think there will be a good effect from that. Unfortunately, there are a bunch of people out there, the same old like usual suspects that have just their voices even louder now like in there. And they're babbling on about their opinions about like the greatest films of 1988 or something. Like some some people think this is an occasion to grandstand and just talk more, which is insane to me. But I think most kids I think most kids are seeing that like the normal race is a silly, silly thing. And I think that something good, a kind of piece could radiate out from this kind of like the environment cleaning itself up a little bit. But oh yeah, I do think I think we're skipping over one of the more interesting aspects of development in like and this Howl thing. I love this idea, man, that like, you know, maybe it takes sometimes it takes a really close friend to tell you like, you've done an amazing thing. You've done a great job doing this. You never get to really hear a lot of that the sort of innate competition between even very close friends is so corrosive and weird. And I don't I don't understand it because any adult should be able to talk to it. Another adult they they love or respect and say, I'm really proud of you for, you know, having a family or do or, you know, doing the things that that I think you did really, really well. And there's something amazing about the fact that, you know, you have traveled that very long journey and you've gotten to a place where you can. Speak and have it make sense and you have a, you know, a message and we both I mean we both have this kind of. It's an opportunity it's a window of expression that we have to honor. And I think it's just there's something about the fact that it comes with a kind of letting go that you let these kind of acidic realities and everything sort of cauldron into your style. You know that your style is is this kind of it's the it's all this former pain that comes down into this MIDI keyboard sound. It's all of that and all of the ways you've been burned. It's and it's such a good thing and I like that. I really like the fact that you immediately without hesitation said that no, you probably want a kid to go play with the dark side, because there's a way out the other side, you know, there's sort of like this common notion that there isn't. And there's a lot of tragic examples that you can see all over the world and on documentaries of people who get hung up in the course of addiction or something you know that that make it seem like yeah the dark side offers no no way out. But I think that in having a child like like you were sort of saying you're sort of you're sort of letting go into the the trust or the faith of this positive force of life that he he's going to be fine. You know, he's going to be the who he is, and that is a certain destiny a sort of peace with destiny, you know, and there's a sense of like sort of fear out there that you shouldn't follow your true path you should tame yourself you should whip yourself into a an acceptable shape and I think in the world of entertainment and the things we ingest you can see that winning most of the time. Like the world of entertainment doesn't really get midnight gospel all that often you know what I mean like it comes along and people are like wow that's not the normal programming. And I think that there's there's a way in which I need to say to you like look at look at what you've done look at what's happened to you. Look, it's totally an amazing long, long journey. Well you started it here. Think about that. How about that? You want to talk about corrosive jealousy. Folks listening I ran into this son of a mother. I ran into you this fucking like, you know, you were you are I'm but like to run into an email when you're in college is like pretty brutal. You know where you're like, you know what I mean you're like big claim to fame is maybe that you love LSD. And then suddenly you meet this person who's like a wizard sitting in his dorm room, making beautiful not not just making music like anyone but making beautiful music, and then also reading and absorbing this like hardcore philosophy. And then in that you were we were having these incredible conversations that were wounding me. There's no other way to put it man it was just like it hurt. It was too much and like you were one of my first friends who would like when I got my heart all broken I called you all broken hearted. You were one of my first friends who was compassionate enough to not give me some bullshit thing which is what a lot of people do. You know what I mean when someone's hurt bad is they try to give some bullshit thing. You were the one of you know I mean you did the thing where you were like let me be in pain. They're what you know I mean you weren't trying to heal it or anything. And then and on from the outside sometimes that those interactions could seem like cold but they're the most loving thing you can do if someone's experiencing the heartbreak we were talking about up front. Let them have it don't try to stop it my God let them have it how lucky you are to get that feeling and especially when you're that young somehow you knew all this shit before you should have. You know you're younger than me you were like this kid who like that's why we loved Hesse while you're reading it so much because we felt like we were in we were characters in one of those books meeting each other. And it was like so badass and so like romantic and so like powerful that like you know it like so many like of the things you introduce me to like burnt me in the best way and then challenge me and then you just sort of like learn you from that. That's you know that's that getting knocked off course thing we talk about sometimes getting derailed in the best way possible. And like if you love someone this then you have to let them get derailed and like you know this is when. In one of the last one of the Ram Dass retreats we were like he was it was in Ohio so he was like Skyping in and I asked him I'm about to have a I'm about what I'm going to have my son. I said something like what should I do with my son I don't know it's out there the recording my son is coming or what and he said this thing of like first of all. He's a soul not your son that's a role that you're giving him you know and you're taking on the role of being the father and we must we have to do that. Not to say you have to go all fucking hippie like I'm not a dad man we're just two souls interacting in space and time baby. No you got to keep them safe and feed them and have a structure and teach them boundaries but you also have to let them be as they are and that's not going to be fun if your egos all invested in them being a musician because like in the beginning I would sit him in front of the Mogue and he would play on the Mogue and just like I was like oh shit maybe we got a little musician or something. And then but you know now you know what he's into basketball loves it walking down the street will point to basketball hoops and go Bob back up Bob Bob. Loves it you know what I mean and so I'm trying to learn basketball you know what I mean because I want to. If he's one whatever he's going to be into that's what I'm going to like support him in right that to me is like a good friend a good parent a good boyfriend girlfriend husband whatever the fuck. It's like yeah man in the dark part of things Jesus Christ. Can you imagine what a demon you would be if you kept a person from going into that spot which brings us to the whole argument about the Garden of Eden being one of the most cruel abominable fucked up experiments ever by a God which is like you're going to take two sentient beings and tell them not to eat a fruit. You know I could like I can promise you I know exactly where my toddler is going to go in the morning. It's going to be towards the empty glass of wine on the on the desk on the table that he can reach every time there's not going to be a hesitate he's going to zip right to it and try and shit and looking at me shaking his head. You know like like no this is not I know I'm not supposed to do it and then he's going to go for it because that's in them. You know so that and think of the Garden of Eden think of that man like you're apparently created these beings you know them backwards and forwards and then you were going to imagine you could keep them from eating a fucking fruit. Come on. That to me is like really compute on from but it only computes if that being is either completely sadistic or a liar or all of the above or some other benevolent force that were too low lead that we can't even understand which kind of makes it a relevant meaning there are whole systems of ethics morality. Irrationality are all wrong anyway meaning that the thing is sadistic again because it just is like sort of allowing us to go off on our own little track of idiocy until we die. So you know what I mean like to me yes thank you for saying that I really appreciate it because you've been one of my great influences and yeah also like fuck man Jesus if we try to get out of the dark side. God damn we've got no Star Wars. We've got nothing. What do we have. Well when you say that stuff I one thing I've said it a million times but I think it's probably worth going back into is that when in the Damien respect we're both I think we're both reading Damien I don't know if that was a coincidence or if if you gave me your copy or I give you my copy but but the one thing I feel like he says something like this in that book but the one thing that drew me to you from across campus and and probably some somewhat likewise is not. I didn't see a person across the campus in the crowd of people that looked like a winner or was like wildly attractive and I had to see their. You know secret or get near them or something I saw someone who was like who I identified as like wounded and I saw someone who was hurt and to me that was it felt so intriguing. You know I just I thought that was so interesting that I could feel that from so far away. And like magnets you know you've told the story before when we first met and stuff but but like magnets I think we just wanted we couldn't keep away from each other. You know we wanted to see what what is that about like what's wrong with that. But and not I mean I mean in an underdog a true celebration of the underdog way you know it's it's it's something that I think that I think about people like Bob Dylan and obviously Lou Barlow but they didn't look like James Dean. You know what I mean that was a big part of the shift of Bob Dylan was that he didn't look like a rock star when he arrived in New York at all. And when he developed into his farm which like you at the midnight gospel it took him a long time to become the thing that people saw eventually in front of the microphone with the black shades and the frizzy hair and the black coat. And looking so incredibly cool but like once he got there he transformed the way men and women saw an attractive person. And I not many people not many documentaries are going to really go into that but like the the rise of the underdog and the transmogrification of what the winner really is. It's a fascinating thing and for me to see you across this crowd and to see someone who is hurt and be drawn towards that hurt and see something beautiful in it is a much more powerful kind of love than you know seeing someone dunk and just wanting his autograph or something. Yeah. Yeah. Although I will say basketball is basketball is a very beautiful thing and I think your son is lucky to like it. I love basketball. Really. Yeah. I think I think it's it's totally one of the most beautiful sports. I love everything about Uncle Emo. Uncle Emo. He's going to need you man because let me tell you to be born. I'll tell you this to be born in the world with a karmic love of basketball and I'm your dad. Listen. It's not like everything about it is just the nature of the movement of basketball. It's one of it's one of the most free kind of Zen sports. It's very simple but it's very fast but it feels very very good and you there's payoff and everything you do. It's very very quick payoff. It feels very very good. See this is what's happened is he's got this athletic side because Aaron is athletic. Her dad is athletic. Man. I'm sorry. No offense to the trust lineage but we don't have a lot of athletes on our team genetically. So like you know what I mean the kids like basically already flipping and stuff you know what I mean we're dealing with like this like break. He's like very brave athletic and like anyway the thing is like I'm really having to adjust man because like I'm I'm putting balm on my back every night. Throwing him up in the air. My back is hurting. I don't know what's going to happen. He's going to need you email because we have to go to basketball games. You know what I'll just start but what we'll watch bad. I don't mean to like bore. I'm sorry y'all. I'm a dad. No no no no like athleticism is a major advantage in life. I mean like just putting his fingers on that mode. He's got this huge head start because he is in tune with his body and how to use his body. And a lot of people don't understand the way that translates to like when you see me play drums and you say like what are you what is going on up there. I'm pretty much just still skateboarding. You know I'm still just I grew up in an athletic manner. So like for me I'm not really thinking about what I'm doing which is a huge advantage. Like it's a great thing for him to be in tune with his body as early as possible. And I'm not saying the Trussell lineage is a shameful one. But you know that's part of like your story. Can you imagine if I was that kind of parent or just you know son you're cursed. Our lineage has been shamed by many of Trussell. I know you will not redeem us. Oh man. Yeah man. Yeah basketball. Aaron loves basketball. I just have to like you know what I just have to have to maybe I need to take like a big dose of acid and watch basketball. So I can really like have that revelatory experience. So you know what I mean. So I could finally connect to a sport because the kid it's like you should hear man. Like I put basketball on just on YouTube. You know just look up basketball find some kind of basketball play it and let you. He goes. Oh man. What the fuck man. You interviewed me for my own podcast which I loved. Thank you. But what what. Tell me what is happening right now. You said you were working on an album. Are you allowed to talk about that at all or what's going on over there man. You're in Chapel Hill right now. Yeah I got I got I got stuck in the middle of things and I I ended up writing way way way too much music. It's funny that there's a problem but but I wrote so much that I have to switch out of you know I'm not allowed to pick up a guitar really because eventually if you have too much music you have to switch hats and you have to be the mixing engineer. And yeah that's like you know it's a strange thing it's like those phases of the of making the show that probably weren't super fun. Do you remember those places. Absolutely I do. I was trying to tell the band one day I was I think I was talking to Grail sounds like you know the whole saying like you know you got to put your toys away after you play before you can like pull them out again and you know it's just a basic fact of life. And they were all just like what I've never heard that saying. Is that is that not a saying. I mean you got to like put your toys away. Oh yeah I mean how does it go when we're cleaning up when they were clean up with the kid we go we have a song the Aaron taught me that we sing which goes clean up clean up everybody everywhere clean up clean up everybody do your share. And then you like clean up. I'm stuck in the clean up phase and I'm going to be stuck here for a while because I made I made something like five or six records and one of those would be the one that we made and it's my responsibility of an obligation to get back to each of these things. Yes. Because they're you know they deserve attention and then I I just get fractured because there's too many different deadlines and I know it's hard to explain to people because you're supposed to be like in a world where nothing's happening but I'm I mean I'm a worse off. I have too much to do. Sorry man I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead. I was I'm sorry I got so inspired when you mentioned our album. I've you know I have been really devoting myself to learning production right now just because I love it. And I suck at it. But if you were to send me the stems that you wanted to work with I could probably also I think I've got a little believe it a little better singing. So I think like I could actually do help. Anyway that's a conversation off the podcast. No no you're getting into EQing and you're getting into the art of like mixing and stuff. Oh yeah man. And like but like I'll tell you know I was talking to Joe Wong not to brag. And he he's so cool but you know I was telling him man I'm just like trying to tune my studio in and like trying to understand signal flow and all that stuff you know like. I liked what he said which is like just remember the more time you spend doing that stuff. And I'm sorry Joe if you're listening because I'm just not quoting you exactly you said what you said was more brilliant and simple. Like but basically he says that anytime you're spending producing you're not making stuff. You know you're you're you're working on producing and he's right that's the cleanup phase. And right you know what I mean but that being said holy shit there's such a bizarre narcotic delight in that wouldn't you say there's something in it that's so. Viscerally pleasurable about learning all that stuff. Oh man I think I think that's where I really got good at what I do in a way but but you know back in the 90s when when you're talking about. Me in my dorm room the whole low five movement was there was an ethic where you were supposed to essentially. Write and record your song in sort of under maybe two hours or less I mean if you spend any more time on it it was like a really idiotic blustery idea in theory you were sort of a bit more like. It was like a street mentality right where you just took a picture of yourself and if you were attractive or you were an ugly person bam that was revealed you know what I mean yeah. And so spiritually and so there was something so beautiful about it and it fit the technology of the time you know it fit the beauty of the four track the immediacy of touching. The small thing that in spending really no money I mean it's. Yeah what was that four track you had you remember that thing do you still have that was so cool that thing was so magical it was like had glass glass it was glass. Oh the rack four track that's a pretty rare one yeah. That thing was fucking cool man you had like a little artifacts there so ununderstandable whatever the fuck you were doing with that you're always mixing something down. I did this day I still bet don't know what that means. I was like yeah I think the through line is that is like once I got into the art of trying to like capture atmosphere because I realized pretty quick you know I'm never going to sound like my heroes and less. I take millions of pictures because somewhere in there I'm going to have a really good one and that particular picture usually ended up being the one that just had the most atmosphere and the song of course had to be special. When you say pictures you mean re recordings of the song over and over again. Sometimes but not not even that so much as just writing thousands of songs right yeah yeah you know sometimes my girlfriend would say at the time like you know I think you've written this one in a better way it was like one of her better compliments. She was like you've you've said this better or something yeah when my song wasn't great which I thought was smart to say it that way but. I think that you know what once it with lo-fi specifically you were you were examining something about the picture being taken that was kind of ineffable you know something that was like when a picture is mysterious. Meaning you know it might not have a traditional focal point and you're kind of you're examining things but you can't quite wrap your head around what's so seductive about the combination of colors. And it just draws you in immediately but then and over time like there's something about it that atmosphere really sells you and part of it people describe it different ways but part of it is that. You're playing a little bit of a guessing game like who is this person and how did this happen and the fact that you kind of can't figure out. Exactly every element you know it's not just like oh they bought this they plugged into that and they plugged into that the fact that you can't really identify how this even occurred. And especially if it's a it's a particularly naive moment a moment that was captured before the person even knew what they were going through. Hence the reason why you would do it as fast as you could before you became conscious you know you. Recording a character right the recording a character and then from there after I kind of got addicted and seduced into that ritual that religion. I started to have to get into the art of repairing the recording and when you get into the art of repairing the recording because there's always something wrong with it in lo-fi. That was the bridge to where I am now which is the bridge that you're walking on which is you use logic to kind of make the thing sound better but you don't really want to necessarily pervert the original instinct you just want to make it you want to bring it to people in its best form. So I come from from a school of immediacy and improv but then I like when I change hats to the thing you're talking about now the cleanup era. I like I turn into a different person and that person judges what the performer did ruthlessly and I'll just get rid of anything or destroy I have no loyalty. So that reparation thing can last forever and it's very dangerous because it depends where I set my standards you know and what bothers me and if something's bothering me that other people can't hear it's it can take a hold on me and it's I've become more OCD I never was like that ever before but the more you know the more you I'm not going to say it gets worse but the more you know the more complicated the machinery that you're using the more complicated your brain activity is and analyzing different EQ spectrums the more it just becomes a fucking huge mess you know whereas the simple take the punk take that I used to come from it was just it was such an easier way of approaching things but these days I feel like you know making Star Wars is like you said is like it's legendarily it was the most miserable time of all of their lives you know they said it was just making it was terrible they didn't want to do it again because it's so hard to make something that good with so many working parts you know so yeah it affects you in a certain way but making it is sometimes a kind of torture you know and you can see why some people some hemming ways or whatever slow down eventually because it's just such a lumbering process you know it's nightmarish sometimes like in lumbering is just the right word for it and also it's like you have been taught through movies and this version of it is so ridiculously quick like that stupid ass movie where the guy goes into the club and here's that lady singing and then they're in like a he's a famous country singer and then they're in this parking lot and he and this is Lady Gaga by the way playing the part of this thing. Why did you watch that? Dude have you watched it? No. What's it called? It's called like storybook parking lot or it's got some dumb name like you know I can't remember the name of it like like story time I don't remember it's story time windows or such a stupid name but like it like so Lady Gaga's in the parking lot. And she gotta watch it dude. Lady Gaga stands up and they're drinking in a parking lot. She's seeing some fucking song whatever and he literally is like what he's just within like two minutes she's on stage in front of his ravenous crowd just killing it on the mic and then like you know for six minutes later she's winning Grammys. You know what I mean? It's like the most idiotic articulation of the process that you've ever seen which is why when you get into the nuts and bolts of the thing and you realize oh my god this is no different than someone building a house digging ditches and running lines and cables. There's nothing romantic about this at all. It's work. It's boring. It's frustrating. And then at the other side of it you get this thing where people listen to it and it sounds so effortless and good that they actually will say like man this song sucks. I've done that. You know like you're listening to like a song and you're hearing you know something that some engineer has put. Like god only knows how many hours into it. The synth the vocals the 808 whatever. It's all mixing perfectly together. You can listen to any thread of that song. You know what I'm talking about? Like nothing's muddled. Everything's clear as a bell. So you're saying I should go over to Netflix right now and type in storybook parking lot. It's called a beautiful name. It's called no it's like story time playbook. I can't remember what it's called. You know what I'm talking about Lady Gaga. Look it up. It's called let me see this fucking thing. It's called Lady Gaga. Storybook parking lot. Country singer. I mean the song was on the radio for the longest time. It's called Bradley Cooper was in it. I don't know why it's called a star is born. I'm an adult. It just shows you my brain. It's just like a vegetable at this point. It like turned a star is born in this story. I would have been rad though that people you know might be Googling this for years looking for storybook parking lot though. Do you remember that? Anyway let's go ahead. I'm sorry. I just I agree with you. I think I feel like part of my job is to you know I'm lucky because because I was born to see you out of a fucking crowd and think I'm attracted to his underdog you know frequency. I'm lucky that that I care so much about that because if I didn't I might be one of those glazed over kids that just floated into the world and just you never heard from them again you know and they just kind of you know washed windows or something. Who knows what would have happened to me man. That's where you get lucky is like someone like you you know you get lucky. That does happen you know where you're just like in this kind of like numbed out state of whatever it is but you are just probably just gonna like oh probably end up who knows what you just can't say what's gonna happen and then suddenly you make that you have this collision which is like one of the name what Mirabai Bush wrote this book with Ram Dass I think it was the last book you wrote about dying walking each other home and in the beginning of it she's talking about Neem Karoli Baba and she said he had all these names but one of the names they named him after like a jaguar that the type of or a tiger that lived out there that was one of his names because by the time you know you realized he was pouncing on you it was way too late you know what I mean like there wasn't anything you could do like if you crossed into his force field or whatever you were done like you were you're whatever you thought your life was gonna be was going to be completely derailed by that and I think that that is something you did for me and that to me is like something that yeah thank God you did like you were drawn to some kind of underdog thing in me because you know I think generally that underdog thing is gonna just from a lot of for many people sadly it just keeps them rejected perpetually you know or you know and it can lead to very dark very dark lives very dark paths that don't have some kind that don't have a cycle to it you know God that we need to embrace the underdog so much more huh it's satanic in this dimension how well we do that I mean it you know that I was I was sort of trained by my own guru and I think man the fact that I was 16 when I met him was so so incredibly important because when you're 16 you're not sure how you want to walk yet you know or like how you want to eat your fucking food or like you know you're like right in that period where you're like I mean I'm sure you're in some ways fully formed but but I just remember distinctly studying this person that I met and you know I guess I guess you'd say I was incredibly lucky especially at this time in my life though because I would watch the way they would talk and what they didn't say which is a huge cliche but God when you really come into contact with the genius like what they don't say and what they won't say like you ask them direct questions all the time because you're a kid you're like what about this what about this and the way they will kind of push you away the particular method of it is so seductive and you watch every little thing they do seriously how their feet touch the ground and the rhythm of how their feet swing when it comes back down to the ground after they lift it up and you're like this person is fucking amazing yeah how do they do it how do they have this much style you know and like that's a thing is like not a lot of people talk about style I don't even know what they think it means but man when I was 16 I got to see the most stylish person on earth you know and so when I talk now and when I maybe hesitate or when I walk they're inside of me you know forever and like you know I was just passing you some of that that feeling or something but it's such a killer fucking age to meet someone like that yeah just like what we're talking about with us you know but it's such an important age because you're absorbing everything and when you meet someone later you know even kids in their 20s in Portland man I was like they're the biggest fucking know it all like they just weren't absorbing anything they refused to absorb anything because they knew everything and yeah something so disappointing and so sad about that environment which is probably not you know it's probably related to why I had to leave eventually or something but there's there's a black cloud on people there that's it's it's almost unnoticeable but if you can find it it's like there's something suffocating the soul there but that's just my impression but it is a kind of morbid depression that lurks in the in the basements in the mold but like and I'm that's not even an overt judgment it's just an emotional feeling that I've heard from a lot of people but I just that was a big difference for me and it was my own personal difference because when I lived here and I was out in the out in the sunshine and I was like growing up I would hit the pavement like I'd go out my front door and I would hit the sidewalk and like the lightning bugs and the fucking crickets just the feeling of the world being a buzz with like total magic that age that feeling that that was the most intense incredible feeling and then just fast forward a few more years and that was gone for me I just I didn't feel it anymore and and I just feel like if that that's got to be a major valuation that I have to at least try to get back to that feeling but man that do you remember that fucking feeling in college when we would just walk outside and get the feeling of the wind hitting your skin there was like a horror movie howl in the sky and it felt so fucking good yeah yeah I know exactly what you're talking about man and this is like yeah this everyone goes through that damn abyss in between those two places because it come you it that I it is completely accessible and and and then I think a big reason it goes away is a good reason because god damn it it's heartbreaking and it's like you just don't want that heartbreak feeling man and you know I it's a high price to pay I can't blame anybody for imagining that it's no longer accessible or not that you're doing that but it's like man I'm telling you I got this kid I sit on the trampoline with him and just get my fucking heartbroken man I just sit there the kid is like what do I do I've you know I've started like chopping the little fake basketballs we have on the trampoline and I go hi yeah and he will he started doing that now so he will go hi yeah hi yeah and man it just shatters you you I can't even explain it shatters you or like he what did he do like the first time he said dad he talk about style the first time he said dad he like leans into my ear and goes da like he whispered it in my ear da and it was just like boy who are you what are you where do you come from who are you how did you do that you're not supposed to know how to do that and like that thing you're talking about man that style that thing you're talking about oh my god it's Odin right like you read about Odin and he would that was one of the crazy one of his games is he would just go into the world is like and nobody would know he was there it was the all father and he was just walking around like some mucky mucky beggar or like in the freaking store Tibetan Buddhism you hear about these different saints in the mishap lineage that Chodium Trump is in these people are like a mess like they're like profoundly like like those I can't remember which one it is Marpa I think is his name but I could be completely confused about that for all the Buddhist people out there my apologies I think it's Marpa I can't remember but you know they're always looking for the great teacher which is your first mistake and one of these people has heard that out you know in this village there's this enlightened being and he goes out into the village and he asks like if you heard of this being I think it's Marpa could be wrong and one of the people he asks is like you mean the homeless dude by the river the drunk yeah he's here he's really enlightened you know like completely sarcastic that's one of the great saints in this lineage of Buddhism and you know he goes down to this guy who's like laying by the river there's like dogs everywhere and the first thing he tells me to do is like there's a wedding party happening go steal their food I'm hungry go bring me their food I'm hungry so he has some wedding party to try to steal soup and he gets his fucking ass kicked at the wedding party he comes he's all broke and he's like I couldn't I was like they beat me and he's like go back and get the fucking soup and he like has to like the final transmission when he gave him the great transmission of the Dharma was he took his shoe off and slapped him in the face with it that was like the last thing he said to him but you know what I mean it's like when you realize that like all this time you've been looking for that thing and the people wearing the clothes that you think are the garments of the high priest of the religion you imagine existed and you've just been barking up the wrong fucking tree and the whole and even if you wanted to find them you couldn't anyway because they're way ahead of you already in that regard you know what I mean whoa that's a decimating realization to have isn't it because like code you want to imagine you're the fisherman yeah I think that's one problem with with learning music is that the student tends to kind of take this literal approach they're like okay so Keith Richards played this particular kind of guitar and this and you hold your hands like this and you look like this and you you know move like this and there's a breaking point when you want to be an artist where like you're following your heroes you're memorizing everything about them and then at some point hopefully the train derails but you you literally lose the plot for some reason yeah but then you realize you kind of stand up and you realize it's going to be this is part of the plan like this is perfect like I don't need to study someone how they did something because now I've already I you know I use their training wheels but now I've got my own thing that's working for me I'm noticing things that are working yeah and then by the time you know you finish with your thing you might show it to your hero and they'll go God you did that so much better than I did and you'll never absorb that probably but there's something about their style that drew you you gravitated towards you the way somebody just lifts off a guitar note with this kind of swagger and this kind of confidence it's a metaphor for so many things just the way that kid that I saw was walking and swinging his legs to the side it's just there's something about it but then in that moment that you realize you don't have to imitate that thing to a T it's not really in the details it's the spirit and then you see the spirit and you that's like the big breakaway moment where you say to yourself I have my own thing you know and that's the that's like the ultimate fire gets lit there but the fact that it's so confusing because when you first start out and you're looking at these great great you know articulators it does appear to be in the details because it's like exactly what they're doing is so seductive you know so you get lost and you start to try to people are so obsessed with mimicking they don't see the lower layers of what they're actually hearing and what's actually the psychedelic effect of what they're experiencing you have to be paid attuned to that you know not just like eventually the details become almost uninteresting because you know the spirit and you know how to conjure it but by then I mean you're a practitioner to you know and if you want to give yourself to it you know that you will arrive there because you know of your true addiction your lust for this ritual that is in you and if you have it you're going to be fine because you you have the lust like the spiritual thing that that wants to get to God or wants to get to basically you you want to fulfill your destiny you know you don't want to deny it and I think there's something to be said for the fact that you know you went from this kid that I saw across campus to now you know you you are you are a sage for for another person because you have that style you know you have your own techniques and you know how they work why they work you know you've become a master of them so I think that's that's a really powerful thing we take for granted probably being in a I don't know this adult form that we're supposedly in now man I'll tell you thank you for saying that that makes me feel empowered and I'll tell you the what's cool is shit man you know I'm only 63 I've still got at least 20 years but still you know the thing is it's like fuck man have you seen Jodorowsky's dune no but I just got the oh yeah the documentary yeah yeah yeah oh my god oh my god that thing changed my life man I watched it so funny the soundtrack just arrived at my house today no way man that's cool he is such a fucking genius man but I was like loving him man I'm well I felt I was sitting there watching him and like my god I'm like what a master and and like you know like you know you're watching a person like that and you're like they're answering all these questions he's answering all my quiet there's so many questions I dad that I forgot I had and he's like seeing they're answering them or explain he's saying things like something on the lines of like if they if they if they let you do it great if they don't let you do it great you're like oh god I fucking love you man like that spirit is so powerful in it man and and in him and and that's true yeah that thing right there that's that to me is the spark and like I don't I would love to think I do I do have a method I think to some degree when it comes to making stuff I do and I and I do kind of feel comfortable with it now but damn man don't you kind of feel like you're just getting started or something like you know like there's not enough years you need another lifetime we need double lifetimes or something to really experiment with the stuff that we're talking about here that's true I know I think that that's sort of like how people say like that's the best problem to have or something that's probably just the feeling of maintaining your hunger you know I always thought it was so great that Willie Nelson has this tape called The Hungry Years you know like you sort of know from the the tapes cover like oh this is going to be like the best songs because he's just fucking starving and he's got to make his way through the world but like the fact that you can say that sort of the later stages of your method methodological journey that you're you're still that hungry that you're still that enthusiastic that things you you're learning still all the time that is where you want to be you want to feel like you are actively learning so much and need to learn so much more so there's nothing bad about that yeah man right damn email I love you man I love these conversations we got to have more of them we have got to get to work on that album and yeah we we got to do it when you have time I know you're you're up to your neck in this but if there's any way I can help with it let me know and I do have something I want to tell you when you finish recording but will you please tell people where they

Robinhood is not like that. It's very easy. They have collections of stocks. I guess you could call it like playlists, things like the hundred most popular sectors like entertainment and social media. If you're interested in combining your activism or ethics with stocks, they have categories like female CEOs. You know what you're buying.

If you go over to patreon.com, Ford, slash D, T, F, H, and sign up, we will be able to have strange live streaming sessions. This episode with Johnny Pemberton was the seedling, the creeper tendril from which I intend to explore this insane medium of live streaming. And Patreon is going to be the venue that I use for personal, I don't know what, we're just all going to hang out and do weird things together. I'm coming up with some ways to do that, but I hope you'll check it out. Just go over to patreon.com, Ford, slash D, T, F, H, and sign up. You'll get commercial free episodes of the DTFH and extra hour long rambling thing once a month. And also you'll get access to our Discord server where you can hang out with other dear listeners of the DTFH. Thank you, my Patreon patrons. Also, if you're somebody who, like me, wants people to know your stance on the very hot political topic right now of whether we drink crow's milk or not, you go over to ducatrustle.com and click on the shop, you're going to find stop drinking crow's milk bumper stickers. Also, if you follow on the other side of the spectrum and you happen to drink crow's milk, we've got drinking crow's milk bumper stickers so you can let everybody know where you stand. You know, in the past episodes, I think I came out a little too hard against crow's milk drinkers. I got some blowback from that and some blowdowns and probably a pretty hard wipe because of that. So I'm sorry. On both sides, I never wanted to offend anybody. I now no longer really have that much of an opinion on it and I just want my family to be safe and happy. So you can make sure your family's safe and happy depending on who your neighbors are. Do they drink crow's milk? Do they not drink crow's milk? Do they don't not not drink crow's milk? You can go door to door and ask, hey, what's up? Do you drink crow's milk or not? And introduce yourself and maybe based on what they say you could offer them for against crow's milk bumper sticker so they can identify themselves in the coming times. Crow's milk, drink it or not, you can announce where you stand by going to dunkitrustle.com and clicking on the shop. All right, without further ado, everybody, please welcome back to the Dunkit Russell Family Hour Podcast, one of our most requested guests. My dear friend, Johnny Pemberton. It's the Dunkitrustle Family Hour Podcast. It's the Dunkitrustle Family Hour Podcast. I mean, there's so many wonderful... Is Perrier being something else besides water? Yeah. Besides the big hats, jackets, sweatshirts, gloves. I don't know about all that stuff. Boats? They make boats? I know that Perrier makes a wonderful vest. Did we get a confirmation on that? I want to see if someone can confirm that. Let me just see if we can confirm that. Then I'm done. Yeah. Okay, we got it. We got it. Yes! I saw Perrier spell Pierre the other day and it was very exciting. I hate it. I hate that. You hate it when they spell it out? I don't want to get political though. Turn this off. I told you. You don't want to look at it. What we can enjoy for a second. I don't want to enjoy it. It's too distracting. It's like falling down the hole you're creating. I know, but it's so nice. It's like, for those who are watching this live, this is a historic moment. Not only is this the first live Duncan Dressel Family Hour podcast. It seems live, right? Doesn't it? It feels live. It seems like it might be live. It's live. It might not be live though. Oh, that's true. It could be a trick. We record this. All these people think that they... They don't know what point in time this is streaming from. Technically, there's nothing we've done so far that has confirmed that this is live and acting like we're responding to the things that we... Obviously, they're going to say the thing and we're going to act like there's confirmation. Right. But technically, we haven't plucked anything from that either. This could have been recorded seven years ago. It could have been. There's no way to know. We haven't said anything that would even indicate that we're from the year 2015. There's nothing to describe that year at all. They could easily just think that this was like from 2012 or something. Yeah. Or maybe 2000. I don't know. What's the crazy year? 2020? 2019? Yeah. Yeah. That's a crazy year. God, I can't imagine being that year at that advanced stage. That would be crazy. Time is a very odd thing. You know, and it's one of the very funny things to me about podcasting in general is that it seems like... They're going to say something funny about time. People don't seem to realize that when they're listening to a podcast, they're actually time traveling. And this is that they're listening to a voice from the past talking to them in the present. In the present. And anytime you record anything, of course, you are sort of sending it into the future. Yeah. Like a capsule. You know, like right now, there's the quad-org capsule that is... Yeah, what is that? You haven't heard of that? I haven't. It's that capsule that's just outside of your hands. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. But it's filled with time. Like basically, I think NASA... Tell me how you shit time. Well, NASA actually... The idea was if we were to pour time on Uranus, then maybe... They would make it smell better for once. Because it really is... To me, I think one of the... Many people talk about simulation theory. What about honesty thong? We'll get to the honesty thong in a moment. Many talk about... Do you have that to play? Many people talk about... Yes. Many people talk about... Do you want to hear the honesty thong? Yeah, I do. All right. Fine. I want to hear what many people think. I'll see if we can do this. Guys, what you're listening to is... That'll be a great podcast. It's just called What Many People Think. Well, many people say that... What are many people thinking? Many people say that chestnuts roasting in open fire and Jack Frost nipping at your nose would indicate that it is Christmas. Many people are saying that it is Christmas. There are many who say it's Christmas now. Who are they? Show yourself. If you think it's Christmas, show yourself now. Many people are saying that it's Christmas now. This is before we get into the honesty thong. To the meat of the brain? Before we get to the honesty thong. In all seriousness. I don't understand why someone hasn't made a movie about a war on Christmas. Why does that not exist? I would love to watch that. What sort of a word do you mean, though? That's my question. It's functioning on several levels. On one level, it's a world where people... You're not even allowed to talk about Christmas. Okay, so it's like talking about... What's currently like that that we can think of? I'm trying to think of... Well, there's a cool conspiracy theory that some Roman emperor fucked with history and just basically erased a huge swath of history. Really? Yeah, it's sort of like... That was literally not the question I asked, though, but it was a cool thing that you said. Well, it's based on the idea of what is history, right? And how do we know what is real is real, essentially. History is based on trust. What happens is a historian announces to us that this thing happened in the past. We hear it, and if the historian is credentialed, we assume what they're saying must be real. It seems to be some kind of convergent timeline, so to speak. All over the planet, there's all this writing about... Tinkling, we call it. Yeah, the Tinkler's type. But yeah, that's what it used to be called. Tinklesprick. If you were writing about time, you would be a Tinkler. That's what it says in German. Tinklesprick. Tinklesprick. Tinklesprick. Ah, yes. Tinklesprick, yeah. Tinklesprick? Ah, wassis das? Wassis das Tinklesprick? Wassis das Tinklesprick? So anyway, one of the Graykin's Bersie theories is that at some point, this awful emperor decided that he was going to just annihilate history. Right. I think it was an emperor. I can't remember. But basically, all the recorded histories were wiped out. There was a sort of like... He burned the books, you mean? Mm-hmm. All the books were burned. And the history that we think that happened is actually not the history. It's the history that he wrote after he scorched everything. The history that Dick wrote. Yeah. He just was like, oh, here's what actually happened. And what really happened was way cool. Oh, guess what? I never heard that. Yeah, it's a cool conspiracy theory. But I guess what I was trying to ask you is that the idea of there being a war on Christmas, you can't talk about it. What's something you can't talk about? Well, in the movie, the war on Christmas, there would be several layers to it. So there would be the basic layer, which is similarly... Okay, let's imagine this, that the timeline that we're in right now has all these people think things happen, like World War II. Yeah. World War I. That was even bigger. The assassination of Kennedy. Who? Kennedy. It's from my timeline. Okay, got it. I thought you said Canada. Oh, no, no, no. Kennedy. Yeah, I don't know. From my timeline. Yeah, it must be from yours. Well, in my timeline, there was Kennedy. There was a president. Kennedy? Kennedy. Kennedy. He was cool. Okay. But he was assassinated. Yeah. And unfortunately, and it's very sad. But so in this sense, in the movie, the war on Christmas, what would happen is people would be existing in a world where they hadn't quite gotten rid of Christmas. Okay. There were still a few people who remembered Christmas. So it's sort of, yeah. I see what you're saying. And so they would talk about Christmas, but if they talked about Christmas, then they would get arrested. That would be the part of it. So like talking about Christianity in China? I don't know. Yeah. What's like a metaphor? I'm trying to think of my timeline. He'd be like talking about Christianity in China, unfortunately. Or Islam. Or any religion. Well, I mean, we all just take for granted. Like the books are the memory banks of the planet, or at least of our species. And so we just take for granted the stuff written in the books is what happened is what's real is what's going down, you know, and so, which is so funny that we just assume that's real because, you know, you can, it's so sad when you hear the data on interrogations where if you interrogate somebody long enough, they just say stuff. They just make up something. Yes, I made a new color. I made a new color. Yes, I did. I made a new color. Only I can see. It's somewhere between red and blue. So you admit it. You invented a new color. Yes, I made a new color. Say it. Say it. Say you invented a new color. I invented a new color. What's the name of the fucking color you invented? What's the name? Is it Lunar? I don't know. Did you invent the color Lunar? Yes. Yes, it's called Lunar. Lunar. Lunar. Yes, that's the color. Why did you invent it? Because I wanted a new color. Because you wanted to hurt the leader. Because I wanted to hurt the who? The leader. Is that his name? Yeah, the leader. Just say the leader. I want to confuse your upset. I get it. You're hot. You're hot. Now sign that. Okay. I created that. What's the name of the color I created? Lunar. I created Lunar to hurt the leader. We're going to take you out back and shoot you in the face. I thought it already was out back. It was another one. There's something behind the back. It keeps going back, in fact. It's back all the way back. It keeps going back. I created it. There's a ridiculous conspiracy theory that there's a kind of like, you know, I guess you could say it's sort of like the historical version of flatter theory. So that's one of my favorites. Yeah. Well, it's the same thing, but with time. So the idea is that our understanding of history has actually been obstructed by someone who created a false history. And then we all believe that this must have been what happened. Similarly, in the war on Christmas, this would be the, so if there were some, let's imagine like, let's imagine there was an Atlantis. And let's imagine that at one point the planet was thriving, that it was filled with these people who were bubbles. Well, Shambhala is a word for it. Bubbles? Shambhala. Shambhala. Shambhala. Shambhala sounds like champagne, and I know what champagne's got a lot of. Champagne. It comes from. Shambhala. Well, it comes from actually, doesn't it come from a valley? Like the Champagne Valley in France? Yeah, the region. Right. So the region. The region. The region. So, you know, champagne comes from this area. Similarly, there's like Atlantis, Shambhala. So the idea might be that there actually existed on planet Earth a time. In this case, for the war on Christmas movie, we could say there existed on Earth a time when every day was Christmas. Would you say, would you call it a perfect Christmas? That's a good name for it. Or maybe a very Christmas. A very Christmas. A very Christmas Christmas. Or the Japanese would say, Maria Christmas. That. Yes. Is the perfect name for this film. Maria Christmas. So what had happened is, who's the person who hates Christmas? Like a Grinch. A Grinch. Oh, Scrooge. A Grinch. Scrooge. Ooh. We both interested it. Scrooge. Scrooge. Scrooge. Scrooge. The fucking sixth. Sixth. He started off as just kind of like a lunatic, but he kind of escaped from an asylum. And because he was sort of, I don't know, a little charismatic. Maybe he was like the second brother. I think you could, you could, you could call him the second son. Second son of a great king. Yeah. Of the king of Santa Claus. Of the great king, Santa. Well, you could. Yeah, so it's so it's almost like Lucifer. What's his name again? Its name is Grinch and! Scrooge. Scrooge. Screnchiest Grooge, Screnchiest Grooge, the sixth right now. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches. Screnches Grooge, the sixth, well, I think it might just be Screnches. Wait, what's Santa last name? Claus. Yeah, Santa Claus. So it's Screnches Claus, well it's both right? Both right? Screnches. Screnches. Screnchist. Screnchist. Screnchist. Screnches. So Screnches Grooge, Claus, he's coming down, do you? He's living in this minor key, he wants to take you under, you're gonna go under the water, whether you would like it or not, he's gonna tie the boat off, he's gonna undo the knot. In this ridiculous movie Santa Claus has two children, one is named Screnches and one is named like Paul, Ben, David, Jeff, yeah, Claus, Paul, Ben, David, Jeff, Stephen, Stephen, Michael, Claus, Paul, Ben, Ben, David, Jeff, Stephen, Michael, Claus, Paul, Ben, David, Jeff, Stephen, Michael, Claus, yeah, that's it. So basically like he's, he had these two brothers and they, two sons, two sons and they didn't get along. Right, bourbon. Yeah, they just didn't get along. And so what happened was, one of them killed the other. I think that Screnchist, Screnchist Grooge, Claus, killed Paul, Ben, David, Jeff, Michael. It's hard to remember his name, that's kind of like one of the qualities of the time that these people are in is they can't remember the name of the murdered child of Santa Claus. Like they, they, they, they can't even remember his name, his name is almost lost. Well, his name is PBDJSM. PBDJSM. Say it again. PBDJSM. Right. Right. Yeah, that's good. So PBDJSM was killed by Screnchist Grooge. Right. But in this sort of time period, what's going on is because like this asshole kid wants to be Santa Claus and he thinks like the way Santa Claus is running the shop. He wants to remember that history. Yeah. Exactly. He wants to annihilate the history of Christmas. Exactly. He wants to destroy the memory of Christmas. Completely. And he knows that it takes two full generations because it's like that old, this, this, I don't know what culture it is, but this is the idea that you're not dead until the last living person dies who remembers you. No, you're not dead until you kill your last enemy. Well, that's a different culture, the culture I'm talking about. I come from the culture of the ninja. Well, I come from the culture of the non-ja. Oh, okay. Okay. We have been fighting the ninjas for many millennia. The non-ja are a peaceful, vegan society. Why don't you leave us alone then? Because we live off of horse, horse. Why do you keep killing us? We don't care. You fall into our traps. Well, why are you setting traps for us? Because we know you're coming to get us. We don't want it. We don't. We've stopped fighting you. You keep putting traps out. Look, here's the deal. Okay. If we have a ton of lotus root, we're growing lotus root to eat it. We love that you grow lotus root. We love that you eat it. I don't know that. I just told you. You're telling me now, but this is the lens of history. Okay. In the past, there were our ancestors. The non-jas are expert trapsmen. The ninjas used to feel that the lotus root was sacred and that it should not be harvested. It should grow free. Do you know why it's sacred? Because it tastes so good. I'm fine with that. I'm fine with eating it. Eat the root. We do. We eat a lot of it. And we are fine with it. But that's what we're killing you is because you're falling into our traps. Well, we don't want you to kill us anymore. We want peace. Then don't come into our zone. Your zone is the entire planet except for like the 17 miles within which we lived. Welcome to life. But welcome to life, honey. If you want to dip your stick in the sweetness, you've got to pay the price. You've got to knock on the door if you want admission. You've got to ask for kettle corn if you want kettle corn. I don't want kettle corn. Then don't ask for it. You're right. Well, to get back to the main point, in this wonderful story of course, so we exist in a kind of time where people, there are swaths of the planet that have kind of... Swaths. Completely, right. Swaths of the planet and swaths that have completely forgotten swaths. The swaths. Have forgotten about Christmas. Right. And that's the name of the people who have forgotten about Christmas. They're called swaths. Swaths. Right. And there was a wraith. Right. So there was a period where it was weird to be a swath. Where it was illegal to be a swath. Where to be a swath was kind of like these days to be a terrorist. Yeah, because you're denying something that's so great, you're denying joy. Exactly. Yeah. And then there was a time, like in this particular movie, there was a time when every day was Christmas. Right. Every day people were just giving to each other. Every day there wasn't even a thought of like Christmas, Christmas, Christmas, Christmas. So there was a time when that was every day. Yeah. That was every single day. Every day was just. But then people who were followers of Scrinches Grudge Clause, yeah, not PDBJSM, started going around and saying, actually, you guys, you know, not every day is Christmas. You should know that, in fact, there's only a few days per year that are Christmas. It started off that, like, you know, they convinced people that actually only 300 days out of the year, Christmas. And they just slowly rolled it back. Yeah. They slowly rolled it back. And that started being less than half was Christmas. That's right. And then it just became. Then there was the Christmas minute, which was on December 25th at noon, like someone would give, yeah, that's it. But then that became illegal. Yeah. And so the movie about the war on Christmas is it's happening right around that time where people are beginning to wonder, like, why do we even celebrate this minute? Like what's the point? Like this minute is distracting us from our work, which is in this new world. It's like people only, they just, they're just working all the time. They work when you sleep. They've learned how to work when they sleep. They dream work. Yeah. You put on a helmet and you do dream work. Yeah. It's like a thing where you're like. You can get a job when you fall asleep. You drive a car, you do all kinds of stuff, you drive a loader. Yeah. Yeah. So in this world, like. Sleep job. You just like a sleep job. Yeah. Like there's no more sleep. You're either working when you're awake. You're working when you're asleep. And when you're, and if you're not working when you're asleep, then it's considered to be like very lazy. Oh, it's not. I mean, it's borderline illegal. Yeah. It's it's teetering on a legality because you should be probably working while you sleep. You should be working. So yeah, that's the, that's the idea of the movie. And so in, in, in this movie, basically like what happens is there's just this tiny little memory of what was right Christmas. There was a time when every day was Christmas. And there's like a small group of people who like kind of remembered a little bit, a tiny little bit, kind of remember a little bit. And that small group of people, the keepers of Christmas, the keepers of Christmas or the Christmas keepers, they, they have a lodge. Yeah. They have a lodge that they gather in a very small lodge that appears to be an old decrepit factory. Yeah. The factory that's been, it's been shuttered. Yeah. And it's like, oh, this is just trash. It's in the nether region. It's designed to look dilapidated. Uh-huh. Or it's actually designed to. It's both. It happens to be dilapidated, but it's also like, yes, we like that. Basically the idea of the lodges, it brings certain types of people in and it keeps certain types of people out. That's the concept, which is that, you know, some people look at the lodge and they think, uh, I don't know what that is. Seems like weird and antiquated. I'm not into that shit. Yeah. Because they're from like, they're from like the Sido. That's it. Yeah. They're from the Sido. You don't understand the lodge. It's like a. It's like that. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a Thrum. I would say it's a Thrum. The Thrumming of the Lodges. The Thrumming of the Lodge is something that is only known by the keepers of Christmas. That's right. Yeah. And what's really weird about it is that even though there are so many people in this movie who hung out at that lodge, at the lodges who actually were leaders, nobody seems to notice it. It's like nobody even thinks about it at all. The fact that like in this world, like many, many of the leaders were an artist and poets and songwriters and musicians all hung out at Christmas Lodge. They all seem to be drawn to it for some reason for some weird reason. Most people out there in this weird world didn't even think it, it didn't, it didn't like pop in their head that there seems to be some similarity among like certain types of artists, leaders, or whatever. They all seem to go to this lodge. They don't get it. Anyway, we talked way too much about something that I think we, we, we didn't mean to talk about what we did want to talk about is something fucking amazing that has happened. They're amazing. Johnny, why don't you explain what, what just happened with Google? Okay. So Google was now doing this thing. It's invite only Duncan and I are very lucky, obviously, to get this thing where you can basically get an email from yourself from the future. It's a crazy, it's a crazy thing. So it's your email address. It's from you obviously. It's only you have your email address and it's from the future. There's a couple of things that I'm supposed to read here now about this real quick. Please do. Think before search. Core brand message of thinking power project. Yep. Thinking power to the people. Initial message of thinking power project. Yep. Think, comma, think unthinkable. Final campaign message of computing. Yep. And as the last thing here is two more, two more last things. Too much thinking is a waste of time. Core message of thinking power project and brain can't compete with heart. Yeah. So that's, so that's, that's, we have to read that and I know why. I guess it's some sort of a thing where it insulates the time differential. Whatever. I don't get it. Google, I'll do whatever they say. Yeah, man. Google. So. We got emails. We got this freaking crazy email from the future and in the future, Johnny and I had recorded a podcast. This is outstanding. And so we're going to end this, this podcast, the DTFH in the year, what fucking year is this? 2018? 2018. Yeah. For a second, I thought it was 2015. Yeah. It can look like a five sometimes if people have sloppy handwriting. Oh, yeah. I guess we all just agree it's 2018. So yeah, regardless of 2018, this is, we got a freaking podcast of us doing a podcast in 6,000 years in the future. Which is crazy to me. I don't understand that. They didn't, they said that it was really far in the future, which I don't understand why it wasn't like 3,000 or even like, even, even two years would be exceptional. I didn't listen to it. Did you listen to it? I listened to it. I don't really listen to podcasts. We're going to play. No, I don't listen to the podcast. No, I don't listen to it. Oh, good. Yeah. Well, we're going to play it for you guys. Here we go. And hopefully you will listen to it. In the meantime, we're going to cut to a quick break and we will be right back. We won't, but the future of us. Boners. Without them, you're not going to get a William Shakespeare. You're not going to get a Stephen King. You're not going to get a Nikola Tesla or any human being at all. They're necessary for life on this planet. Much thanks to blue chew.com for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Well hello, well hello. This is awesome. You know. This is just really awesome. Well, here's, there's a little piece of me that feels, and I'm sorry to say it, but there's a little piece of me that just feels a little skeptical about this actually going into the past. How do I even know? Yeah. I don't know either. I mean, I feel like this is something, it's fun to be here and fun to, that it's supposed to work, but I just don't know. There's no way to come, there's no way to confirm it. Reality of the situation is that we have to trust Google. But. Boots on the ground. Boots on the ground. Yeah. But here's the thing, because after Hyprex discovered the multiverse reality. Not a guy. I mean, it's not a guy, but yeah. Oh my God. Two of them met Hyprex. You know what I mean? Just to smell his ray. Assuming our emails reaches that, which is Hyprex, but I don't know. I mean, it probably goes through that. It probably goes through Hyprex's zone, but I don't think, I mean, everything goes through Hyprex. I just wonder if it's. My heart is that of Hyprex, and I know that as long as I am within this, which is Hyprex is with me. That which is. Yeah. And then that, I guess, is the email to Hyprex. Regardless, I'm sorry that if there's any kind of like wobble in my field here, but it is a little, how do you say, speculative. Scunch. Scunchish. Yeah. To think that this is actually traveling 6,000 years into the past. I just can't even imagine that we are streaming to 6,000 years into a world where they didn't know that Christmas was every day. Yeah. Yeah. The fact that they didn't live in that. It was something that was sort of even on the outskirts, the fact that it was like a thing where, oh, this is just a little piece we do even one day. And even that day, it's like stuff is, stuff is not in line with that on that day. Have you read the Tome of Mandraks? I read the last half. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. That's my favorite part of the tone. Totally. You don't need, the first half is just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's just a sound that confuses you to make you stop reading. Well, that's the idea. Yeah. But if you hear that, then you know, okay, the second half. The first half of the Tome of Mandraks is called, the chapter is called The Membrane of Confusion. It's designed at- Gricks. Yeah. It's called Gricks. But the idea is we, it's to repel people who don't have the, I guess, just the basic sense to just go further in the book. Yeah. To carry on, to plunder through, to pass by. Or just open to the part where it stops being confusing. Yeah. I think the whole idea of Gricks or what you said is to make it difficult. Wow. To make it like, well, you know, you can't see the forest with the trees kind of thing, or maybe it's like the pond. Where does the pond start? Is it the weeds that you're near the pond? It's like a thing where, at what point are you wet? What's that? It's at what point are you wet? Right. Because you're getting in there and you don't know. Okay, am I wet now? Am I always swimming? Or am I waiting? Right. And so it just asks people to jump all in or to just take the time to escalate. This is so funny. It's like you're quoting the Tome of Mandraks word for word, because like my favorite part of the last half of the Tome of Mandraks is the story of Lesilis and Willys. Now, do you remember? Lesilis and Willys, they have swum. They're swimming. They're swimming far, far, far into this infinite lake of the clearest, purest, sweetest water. And Willys said, I'm thirsty. It's so funny. Yeah, it's the ultimate joke. It's like, but you're swimming in this. You're swimming in the most drinkable of drinks. Yeah. Regardless, to those of you living in that part of the time space continuum, 6,000 years previous to where we are right now. We shine our light upon you. Hello. Hey. Let's describe what we're seeing today, because I think it's going to make them excited. I'll tell you one thing. I don't do a lot of looking these days. It's mostly feeling. So most of what I do on my eyes are pretty much, my eyes have become one. I have one eye and it doesn't blink because it's covered with a triple layer. It's a type of special membrane. So basically it looks inward at all times. But when it looks inward, what does it see? It sees what I'm thinking. And what we think about is what we feel. And what we feel is the beautiful, beautiful copper pyramid of reckoning. Yeah. The copper pyramid of reckoning, the K-Pore, as we call it. We hover around the copper pyramid of reckoning and we gaze upon it and wow, it's so fun. The time period that you're in, reckoning. Hello there. Hello. Hello there. Hello. The time period that you're in, reckoning is like it sounds bad, like it's like something that happens. Yeah, like a bad thing. Like when they come clean up the lunchroom. Here comes the reckoning, so to speak. But in the time period that we're in, reckoning is what we are. Every single moment is a reckoning. And so we float around this incredible, beautiful copper pyramid of reckoning and we just hang out. You just draw from it. You feel like the beams of energy that are invisible. Just draw. You draw. You feel. You learn and you laugh. And it's our ships that right now, I am, the thing that I call I, is elevated in a kind of swan-shaped, crystalline, translucent, pelican that has inscribed upon it the something that I guess in your time period, you would look at it and think, is that Sanskrit? Yeah. That's who you are and I'm a giant leather rose. It's beautiful. It's a giant rose. It's beautiful. So beautiful. Tell me why I'm just a giant rose. I'm made of leather. It is. It's so pretty. This rose. I mean, it's not just me. It's part of all of me. All of me is in the leather rose, but I am not alone when I tell you my friends. Talk about that. Talk about the rose. Talk about your friends. Talk about the cluster of friends. Talk about the sole cluster. If you ever looked at a rose, it's many layers. Many layers upon the layer. They didn't have roses 6,000 years ago. They did. They had roses. They had plants. Oh, they didn't? No, no, no. But they is us because we've been around this long. We've got to tell everyone that infinite life is possible now. So that's why this is even possible. How to put it? In a time with no Christmas and no roses. Yeah. I swear we had roses, but I don't remember. Well, that's the problem. At a point, something happened. We'll just leave it at that. And when that thing happened, there was expansion. And when the expansion happened, there was roses. And the roses were leather. So leather roses. Many leather roses. Many. Sorry about that. I thought I'd turn my phone off. Sing the song of the leather rose. The leather rose, the leather rose. The leather rose is growing. The leather rose, the leather rose. Those petals never stop showing. You can't stop the leather rose. You can't stop it from growing. You can pull it out from the ground. But the leather rose is still growing. You never stop the thing, you know. The leather rose is still growing. The leather rose has got those petals. All the petals are showing. Leather rose, leather rose. Leather rose is growing. Leather rose, leather rose. Leather rose is growing. It's a Christmas rose. Sorry about that. It was my attorney. Yeah. He makes that cool sound now. Oh, that's the other thing. Yeah. A lot of things are just sounds now. Yeah. That was one of the wonderful parts of the expansion. You know, sound. How to put it. Sound in your world. The world without Christmas. And by the way, I hope I don't sound condescending. Oh, you know, no Christmas. And I've never seen the sweetness of the copper pyramid or smell the leather rose. I mean, it's, it's, you can't help it. You can't help it at this point. What? Be condescending. It's like just sort of how, how can you possibly? I don't want to be rude. Well, I think it's too late. I mean, a part of me wants just to do the thing. I think you should just do it. You understand that? You understand that? You imitative idiot. That's my banana. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. Well, you did it. I didn't mean to. Now you got it out. You got it out of the way. It's still in there though. Get away from my tree. I bet they've never even thought about leather rose. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry me. Sorry me. Hey Duncan. Hey Johnny. Sorry. Sorry guys. You're going to have to figure it out. Don't worry. You figure it out. You guys are going to like the princesses. And you'll love the princesses and you figure it out. You figure it out. Every one of you, you figure it out. That's the good news. It's just right before the expansion. There's the thing. It's a little turbulent. Well, the thing. The thing. The thing. The thing. Oh, the thing. Ringling ding dong. Ding ding dong. Ding ding ding. I don't want to focus on the thing. The thing. It smells. The thing. It dwells. On top of the pyramid. Oh hell's bells. They ring. They ring. And they've rung. And they've rung. And oh, here come down the angels. And listen how they've sung. What did you say? You said it in past tense. Yes. I said it from wits. Cam. They once wince. What do you mean when you say they did dong-ing? They did a ding. They did a ding. They did a big bong. Bonging. They rung. And they ripped. And they scraped. And they scratched. And they thonged. And they thonged. And they hissled. And they thunk. And they thrashed. And they sang there. But the thing that I'm singing is the thing that I know. That's a song that I say about an honesty song. And this is another part of the, in the future, weirdly, many of us, when we wake in the morning, what you call waking, we don't really sleep or wake. When we wake in the morning as you, we call waking. We sing something that is known as the, the honesty thong. It's the honesty thong. Honesty thong. It goes a little bit like this. We'll just play it for you very quickly. Let's see if we can find the honesty thong for you here. You have to queue it up for the membrane. Any time, would you mind, Johnny, just reciting a few passages from the Tome of Mandrex? Sure. No problem. Here we go. The Tome of Mandrex reads as follows. I have to sound this on the Tome Whistle. Dutch Wish. Kipple Snip. Crackle Cash. Breaveman Gorp Kettle. Stumble Cash. Scamp Candle. Dwarven Curve Bettle. And those are the words that they've established for us at this moment in time. Now you have to ask yourself a few questions. The first question you should ask yourself is, do all clothes have holes? Do all? Think about the words I'm saying. Think about the letters that make up those words. Do all clothes have holes? Are those the same words that... The same letters of the same words that make up the words that are inside the thing that I've said? Also, do clothes all of them have holes? Do all clothes have holes? Do all clothes have holes? We'll answer this very important question right after this.

Now, here in the future, eggs and baking, you guys might get a little kick out of this. Recently, Johnny and I gotten what you would call a, where's my banana? Email and from the future. We got one. So we in turn are, so yeah, obviously we're 6,000 years in the future. Talking to you now, 6,000 years in the past, but it's your present. We, they call it the present still. Yeah, that's so funny. Where's my banana? What's a rose look like? What do we know about banana, sir? What's Christmas? I've never heard of Christmas. Who's Christmas? It's a thing. We got an email from us in the future. So through our technology, we can take from the few from our future and put it in our quote unquote present and send it to you in your presence. So we're just going to stop this, this, this podcast with us from 6,000 years in the future. And here is a podcast that was sent to us from us 10 million years in the future. Did you listen to it? Of course not. I don't listen to podcasts either. No, I was too busy. But yeah, we're just going to send, we're going to play this now and it was very nice chatting with you. I hope you find your bananas. I hope you find your bananas. Don't forget what's yours is yours and what is it yours, who you should get. That's who they were into. They earned a property back then. Oh yeah, they were super in property. This is mine. Oh my God. Mine. I haven't heard that word in so long. Mine. Mine. Isn't it funny that that word mine is also that thing you put in the ground here to kill people? A mine. Like an indiscriminate form of killing? Yeah, they didn't know that that was like encoded in there by God. Yeah, a mine. Yeah, they didn't know that a land mine was just like a desperate attempt from like the future God. Doesn't matter if it worked. But they were still there. Give me back my banana. Mine. I'm going to build a wall. That's mine. I'm going to build a wall around my banana. Miners. Sorry, guys. Let me get a city. That's my banana. Sorry, guys. That's my banana. It's so funny. You guys are so funny. Play that future message. All right, guys, we're going to cut to a quick break. In the meantime, we want you guys to enjoy. You probably can't enjoy anything because you still think that you're a you. They still think they're a you. They're a thing. I got one thing to tell you right now. Breaks your snakes and lakes your cakes. Don't do that. Don't do that. Sorry. Breaks your snakes and lakes your cakes. Don't do that. Do you want to start a black hole? That could start a black hole. If I say two more words, it will start it. You're right on the precipice. I'm not going to say it. Don't do that. Don't do that. Stop. Our snakes, lakes, our cakes. Don't be lame. I'm not going to do it. Breaks your snakes. Lakes your cakes. Don't do the next two words. Please. Just are. Don't do it. It's us. It's us. It's us. It's us. I won't say it. What do you do that? It's like breaks your snakes. Lakes your cakes. Stop it. Please. Breaks your fakes. Don't do that, man. That's not even funny. You're so freaking close. Don't annihilate us, please. I hate being annihilated. When did you get annihilated last? Just 20 minutes ago. Stop doing it. It fucking hurts, man. I'm still at the place. Breaks your snakes. Lakes your cakes. I'm still at the place where it hurts to be annihilated, man. No joke. I really do not like it. I really mean that. I love you. I consider you my best friend, but I do not like to be annihilated. Look, just tell me if you want it or not. I don't want it. I don't want it. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do it. I do. I do it, man. Please don't, please don't. No, sheesh. Don't do it, please don't do it man. Wait wait, hold on, just wait. Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Please don't. Please don't. Mm-hmm. Give it like 10 seconds please. Yeah. Please, just give it 10 seconds. You know what fuck is saying. I don't give a fuck. Breaks her snakes. Lakes her cakes. Rakes her steaks. Jesus Christ! Starting with the schicka. I do. What the fuck is this? I don't give a fuck and... lernate. Hi. Nothing. Nothing. I have no idea what you're saying. Okay, you can stop yourself. No worries, you can stop yourself. But now this is up to this world or the nightmare of having Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? It's literally right now. That never stops freaking me out. That moment when you did the annihilatory thing and you created the black hole and I said I hate annihilation. Every single time you do that we end up exactly back at this point right now. There's like a second where I'm like man I wish I were in the future but then I'm just so happy to be with you because we're back where we started. Johnny I don't care where we are. When I'm with you I feel happy and I guess I don't know if that's like what you're teaching me or what it just is. So that's a cool thing and I think it's worth sending this one backwards to time. I'll send it back into the time I guess from once it came. Wow okay. So gold is worth something. You'll get that joke later on. But definitely remember that joke. Tell them about the Dodgers. I'm telling them. I don't want a black hole. It's too much work. It's not that I don't want to. It's like tipping over a dump truck. It's fun to watch. There's an old saying. It's a new saying to you. It's a future saying. It's old to us. To them it's new. They've never heard it before. They've never heard it. This is going to seem completely new to you guys but Jesus Christ. If I hear it one more time I swear to God I'm going to go nuts. If you're trying to be quiet it's easy to make a lot of noise. Yeah. I'm sorry. I remember the first time I heard it. If you're trying to be quiet it's easy to make a lot of noise. When I heard it it's the first time it seemed cool. It's a cone. Oh I hate those things. They smell bad too. The taste is just not what I would want to taste. The fact that they forced you to taste them is absurd. They taste bad but you can't not taste anything that tastes bad. If that's not marketing I don't know what is. To me and again I never wanted to get political. These are the same people who want you to taste them. They're the same people who believe in Christmas. They're also lodge folk. To taste or not to taste, one thing's for sure.

Art listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. If this is your first time listening, I'd like you to take your hands, place them on your nipples and close your eyes. There, I did it. I entered into your consciousness and have re-corrected the parts of yourself that were a little off. You have now been completely re-combobulated. Your ancestors will no longer experience the burning horror that they have been experiencing. Many of them are burning in hell. But guess what? At the moment you did that movement, the mudra of light as it's called, your grandmother, who at that very moment was getting tap danced on by succubi wearing spiked heels with the venom of hell toads applied to the very base of them, was carried out of hell by angels and is now being scrubbed down in one of the bathtubs of heaven. All because you decided to tune in to the DTFH. We've got an amazing podcast for you today with a brilliantly funny comedian, Greg Fitzsimmons. We talk a lot about Christianity and comedy. Two of my favorite topics on planet Earth. We're gonna jump right into that. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by squarespace.com. Guys, it's time to take the leap. It's time to dive in to the waters of the digital age and form a website. Because let's face it, you really might be the person who gives birth to the great idea. It might be you, that thing that you've been tinkering around with that you think you can't do. Who knows? That could be the beginning of a cascade of good luck in your life that leads to you floating over the cities of the world in a pleasure blimp, getting blowjobs from genetically engineered fuck blobs that were made in your private laboratory. All you have to do is start a website. If you've been putting it off, if you've been thinking you gotta get a web developer, don't worry about that anymore. All you gotta do is go to squarespace.com. You can try it out. See if it works for you. It certainly works for me. I made my website with squarespace.com. You can check out the power of Squarespace by going to dunkintrustle.com. They have everything you need to make a beautiful website, award-winning templates, all you need to create a storefront. You wanna start hawking your paintings or your t-shirts or maybe you're one of those people who sells their stinky socks online. I know people who make money doing that. All you need is a website and just think of it. If the sock market is booming, then what will happen when you take the leap into putting your business out there with a beautiful professional website? Something easily achievable by going to squarespace.com. They've got great customer support. If you ever need to get in touch with them because you're having troubles, you email them, they get back to you right away. I've been using them now for some time and have had no problems. I love them. They're a fantastic company and I hope you will look into supporting them if a website is what you need. Remember, squarespace.com. Use offer code Duncan. You will get $10 towards your first order and if you sign up for a year, you get a free domain name. Also, if you're someone like me who feels when you go outside or around people as though you're getting your eyeballs punched by imps, then amazon.com is the website of your dreams because it makes it so that you no longer have to be accosted by the existential truth that you're surrounded by people who just like you will eventually be devoured by time and transformed into grave dust. You can sit in the sweet sacred sanctity of your home enjoying the glow of your Phillips Hue lights, lights that change color according to your whim. And you can order these lights by going to amazon.com but just go through the link first at dunkintrustle.com. All you gotta do is slide through that link. It's a great way for you to support this podcast because they will give us a very small percentage of what you buy and it costs you nothing. You gotta try out these Phillips Hue lights, man. There is something glorious about being in control of your lights, you know? Right now, if you don't have Phillips Hue lights and you just flip the lights on, you just get this boring ass, normal light color, no. No, make it feel like you're in a forest with glowing green or purple. Get those lights set for the next love making session with you and your sweet darling. Make love under a deep violet while Pink Floyd plays out of your Alexa. Get into the future, sure. Maybe the CIA is gonna be monitoring through your lights but who cares? It soothes you. It relaxes you. It makes you forget what's happening. I'm also thinking about starting up a Patreon page. Hasn't happened yet. I'm still thinking about it. Would like your feedback on that. What do you think? I'm thinking about releasing some extra content because what happens a lot of the times is as in today, I'll spend a long time working on these opening rants and then I'll think, that's too long. I can't use it and I'll delete it but I'm thinking maybe Patreon can be a kind of repository for these opening rants and a lot of you sweet darlings out there have already set up a subscription through PayPal so maybe we could transfer that over to Patreon so that you can get something back for your very kind monthly donations. What do you guys think? Is it weird? Is Patreon weird? I'm thinking about doing it. Let me know your thoughts on that. I would be interested in hearing what you think. All right guys, we have got a wonderful podcast for you today. Our guest today is a really funny comic. He's one of those comics when you're me and you're performing and you know he's watching you, you get a little nervous because you wanna impress him. He's a comedy writer, he's currently working on Pete Holmes, great show on HBO, crashing, he's been on Letterman, all the late night shows and he's supremely funny and supremely smart and it was a real blast to get to chat with him. So now everybody please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast, Greg Fitzsimmons. Come on home! Welcome home to Dunkin' Trussell family longer than ever before. Welcome to Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast. It's the Dunkin' Trussell family. Greg, welcome to the podcast, how does it feel to be back home? Home is good, you know, home's good. I'm seeing it from different, from different lenses. My voice just went crazy because, you know, I was born in the Bronx and then I lived there till I was like six or seven. And then I was a Westchester kid, Tarrytown. Yeah. Then I lived in Manhattan for about 10 years. And so those were all like totally different experiences. And now I'm living in Brooklyn and I've never, I had never spent any time in Brooklyn. And this is just a temporary residence. Well, it's three months. Three months. Well, I'm writing on that TV show, Crashing. And it's- Did they put you, did they put you up? They just gave me a check. They said, here's 10 grand and put yourself up for four months. Which isn't reasonable. I mean, for New York, if you're in Iowa, you're probably going, wow, you're gonna pocket a lot of cash. 10 grand for how long? Four months. Yeah, that's pretty good. You can get by on that. Yeah, you can get a little, nicely, yeah, I get a place for sure. Yeah, so I got a place in Brooklyn because that's where the studios are for the TV show. They're in Green Point. So I got a place in Williamsburg. And I gotta tell you, I love it. I love the diversity. I like that there's a lot of, there's still a lot of mon pot shops, but at the same time, if you want to get your Yerba mate, or you want to get a, you know, a Cortado, you know, they know what the fuck you're talking about. That's right. Yeah. I think that, when I moved here, I was kind of shocked at how weirdly undiverse LA was. Or, you know, it's like, not like here. Like, this is truly the cultures here. It's just this incredible nexus of so many different cultures clashing into each other. I don't know what that is, man. What do you think that is? I mean, why is LA, why does LA feel devoid of that? Why does it feel less culturally alive? I guess there's more barriers in LA. You know, you've got, in New York, you can take the subway and work in any given neighborhood. Whereas in LA, you know, they, since they put the train in, it's a little bit easier. But for a lot of people that are minorities, they don't have cars. And so the access for them to get to Santa Monica or the Palisades or something was kind of insurmountable. So I'd say it's probably mostly public transportation. And then I think also in New York has a longer history of immigration. Like where I was born in the Bronx is still actually very Irish. So it's a very Irish pocket called Throg's Neck. And, you know, and then Italians came in and now Dominicans is very Dominican. But it's kind of, the immigrants kind of layer each other and they come in and they make their peace with each other or they don't. And it's, it becomes like a whole hodgepodge. Whereas in LA, you know, it's a kind of a new city. You really connect with being Irish, right? Like that's a big part of who you are. Yeah. Your wife is Irish. So, and you're obviously your family's Irish, but can you talk about that a little bit? Like what does that mean to be, because I don't connect, I don't have that aspect of myself. What are you? Well, I don't know. You're all over the place. Yeah. Well, I guess it's cause I'm a hundred percent like, I did that ancestor DNA test and I'm 94% Irish, which people say is like alarmingly high to be anything that much. Wow. You know, like my, my gene pool is very thin and it's not a good gene pool. The Irish genes are very alcoholic. Right. Pasty skin, skin cancer, spider veins, just all the skin stuff is terrible, delivers terrible. And Do you wear a lot of sunscreen? Always. Yeah, I put it on this morning. I put it on again this afternoon. Yeah. But to me, the upside is there's a tradition. It's an oral tradition. We're storytellers and I don't, I never set out to only hang out with Irish people, but like I look at my friends list on my phone, my speed dials and my phone's inside or I'd read it, but it's like Dugan, Maloy, Donovan, Fitzgerald, O'Neill, Gibbons, Rogan's Irish, right? That's Irish. Is he? Yeah, Rogan's an Irish. Now he's Irish and Italian. He's half and half. Oh, no shit. But it's like, and I'd never made it, it just happened because we connect to each other because we can bullshit. And I think there's a self-deprecation. I think there's an ability to bust each other's balls. I think when you talk to Irish people, it's different than when you're talking to comedians. You're more comfortable talking to Irish friends than comedians. No comedians there. I can talk to any comedian. That's the other group. I would say I can talk to Irish people and I can talk to comedians. What's the difference between talking to those two groups? Well, I guess with comedians, you know that I think it's the same thing. You can bust balls. Right. Like I mean, I went into the comedy cellar. By the way, I was talking to you up to Estie at the comedy cellar just this afternoon. Dude, thank you. She never heard of you. I'm like, you never heard of Duncan Trussell? Oh wow. I said, he's great. He would be great. You know, I have too many comedians already. When I go, yeah, but she's like, I'm sure if he's in New York, he'll come across my doorstep. I'm terrified of the, I'm not coming across the comedy cellar's doorstep. I'm terrified of the place. Like the place has too much power. When I got in at the comedy store, it was by accident. I wasn't aware of the vortex that it was. So it was purely an accidental series of events that took me there. Unfortunately in my mind, the comedy cellar is like, I have since I've been here, I haven't gone once. Really? I'm terrified of like the energy that was like thrumming out of that place is like for some reason. I don't know. I feel like if I go there, even if I got in front of her, I feel like I've already built it up in my head so much. It's that I'm gonna bomb. It's a guaranteed bomb. I'm gonna like stammer and freak out and look around. You'll just lose all your experience. Con, just gone. Cause it's like, I've seen like, you know, Louis C.K., that his incredible show, he's always going on stage. Actually, you know what? I did go there once cause I did, oh God, I did someone's podcast from there. I was right next to there. Oh, upstairs? Yes. It was during the day it was closed. It was open, the upstairs bars closed. But I went in there, I was like, can I use the bathroom? And I went down to the bathroom and then I went and stood on the stage and looked out at that beautiful room. And you can feel it, dude. It's like, just like the comedy store. Those years of great comedy was just soaked into the fucking wall. Soaked into the wood, yeah. Right, right. But yeah, eventually. Low ceilings and wooden furniture. Yeah. Yeah, it's got an amazing vibe. But you would fucking, you would do so well there because they've really got attention span. They'll let you spin a yarn, you know? Oh, that's great. You don't have to work joke to joke that hard. Yeah, that sounds beautiful. I really appreciate that. Yeah, yeah. Well, whenever you're ready, I'll call on reminder. I appreciate that. So what clubs are you working in the city? I've been doing the stand and the New York Comedy Club. But I'm taking a month off right now of stand-up comedy. Yeah, well, kind of a month. I'm doing a few spots here and there, but I just like, anyway, anyway, I'm enjoying it. It's like really cool. Got this backyard and I'm like gardening and I'm just kind of like, I really like it. I think it's good to do that once in a while, man. I'm doing it. I'm gonna do it for a month this summer also. My family's coming out and I'm just not gonna do spots. It's fun. It's good to do, man. It gives you a chance to reset. But anyway, man, we got a little distracted. So we're talking about sort of the difference between Irish friends and comedians. You're saying you can connect to both of them. But I wanna know, like, you, as a someone who like connects to their cultural identity to such a deep level, as opposed to like people like me who are just kind of like floating on some unknown genetic ocean. It feels like it's a good, it's a blessing to have that, you know, to have roots that deep. What do you think it's like, it's helping you more than hurting you or you seem to be kind of like, when you're talking about being Irish, it sounds like there's a little bit of dismay there, you know, alcoholism, bad skin, spiked. Yeah, I mean, I quit drinking 25 years ago and it was because my father was an alcoholic, aunts and uncles, grandparents. There was a lot of baggage. And then growing up Irish Catholic, I really, I've suffered from the guilt and the shame about sex. I mean, I really am wracked with it. I still am. It's probably my dominating feature is guilt. About sex? About everything, about everything. But even sex, like I still feel bad after I come. Wow. That's from the Catholic church, right? They teach you that the body is evil. All right, and you shouldn't come unless you're trying to make a baby. That's the same with the Hare Krishna as they say the same thing. You should only have sex for progeny. Yeah. That is such a hardcore concept. It is, I know because, I mean, when I remember when I was having sex with my wife to have a baby, I remember those orgasms were really profound. I bet. They really felt like this is what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm finally allowed to do it. And I just remember like, it just went through me. It was like a spiritual orgasm. Yeah, yeah. I can imagine, you know, like when I'm having sex and I allow the thought to cross my mind, maybe I'll have a, maybe we'll have a baby. And then I think about like that experience and like diving into that realm of life with another person. I mean, it's like you and this person are jumping off a cliff, man, and you're holding on to each other and you're like coming at the same time as you're plunging into this giant question mark, which is to be parents forever, to create a life, to like from thin air, create something that's gonna grow and change and think and, you know, grow away from you eventually. How many kids do you have? Two. Two kids. Yeah. How old? 16 and 13. Oh wow, cool. So one of them is growing away now. Like one of them is. Yeah, he's got a little girlfriend now. So he's out with her. And then he just got his driver's license. I left just as he got his license. And now he's got my car. 16 year old boy driving around in a Prius. So he's a Chick Magnet. Oh yeah. They love the Prius to you. Yeah, Uber drivers love Priuses and girls love Prius. It's the two. Teen girls, man. He's got mudflaps on it, tinted windows. I'm sure he has no problem with girls, man. I'm sure he's taught them well. He must be hilarious. Is he funny? Is he funny like you? He's got a podcast. Him and his five best friends. Wow. Started a podcast. They go to high school in LA. What's it called? It's called the Santa Monica High School. They call Sam out for short, Samo Cast. Oh, that's awesome. And so it's like a very diverse group of kids. You know, black kid, Latino kid, Jewish kid, white kid. Wow. And they're all like really interesting guys. You know, I'm like the mentor, so I sit there for the podcast every week. Oh, that is so cool. And I've gotten to know them so well because you know, it all comes out in a podcast. They talked with, the first podcast, the topic was atheism versus agnosticism. Wow. And one kid grew up Muslim and was talking about that and it was really amazing. They're very forthcoming with each other. It's really beautiful. I think it's like a new generation of kids that have been supported by their parents more in different ways that I think they're, you know, like for me, I didn't talk about much with my friends. Well, but do you think they're also maybe being impacted by listening to podcasts? That something? No, I don't think they listen to podcasts. Oh, they just, they don't even know what it is. Well, my son knows that I, part of it pays the rent, you know? Right. But no, I think it was just something that everybody had clubs at school and they're close and they said, we want to start a club. But you're saying kids have more supportive parents now? Is that what you're saying? I just mean in terms of their mindset, like they're more supportive of their ideas and of them, of accepting like my parents would shit on me. Like it was funny, but it was very Irish. It was like you do something and they go, oh yeah, all right, Picasso. Yeah, why don't we hang that on the fridge there Picasso? That's exactly what I got, dude. You didn't get, there wasn't some kind of like all inclusive. Like that would be insane to think that like my dad would, not that he was like, you know, an asshole, but definitely you're not going to get false support for something. No, no. A grumble. Like I might get a like, all right, let it out. Get a harumpth out of dad. A harumpth at the bed, for the most. You know? But yeah, so you're saying now the style of parenting is more like allowing a kid to believe that they have some kind of innate talent or something like that. Cause I remember when I told my mom, I think I would like to act or something. She's like, you really shouldn't do that. You know, don't do that. That's not going to make any money for you. That's not going to do anything for you. Just worry. Yeah. You know, a fusive worry. Right, that'll drive you. That'll give you, that'll give you motivation if you're coming from fear. And you know, when I did, I grew up like that. And I still do. I think my, you know, my biggest motivator, it used to be much more so out of fear. Now it's different. But you know, we're raising kids that I think are more motivated by, and millennials are like this and they get shit for it, is they really want to find out what they're meant to do. And you know, to the point where you can mock them and go like, yeah, you know what you need to do? Get a fucking job. Cause a lot of them are still living at home. And they're kind of like, just like this girl last night, I was, I took an Uber lift or a lift. And I didn't realize I had it set on lift share. So I, we're driving and all of a sudden the guy just stops on 2nd Avenue when this little Asian girl gets in and she's drunk and she's kind of obnoxious. She's kind of like, you know, can you change some music? And he's like, and it was his station, you know? And he goes, well, what do you want to hear? And she goes, anything but this. And then she goes to me and then I go, oh, so I said, have you taken lift share a lot? And she's like, no, no, I'm sorry, I was taking via. I've taken via before, I called it via. And she goes, no, it's via, like vehicle. And so I was just like, who the fuck is this, cunt? And so, and then she goes, I free, and I kept talking because I just, I'm not going to sit there and not talk. Right. And I go, she went to Santa Barbara College. And then she goes, what do you do? And I go, well, I'm here writing on a TV show. Now she sits up straight. Turns out she's getting into production and she wants to work in comedy and TV. And now the whole power shifts. And suddenly she's acting meek and she's being, you know. Yeah, it was gross. So anyway, she's sucking my dick. And nobody was like, it was really made me feel like you shouldn't just be like that because you think you can get something from me. Like that's the thing with millennials is like, they're not open to the world. They're, they're hand, they want to hand pick everything. Right. Yeah. And not just engage. Yeah, sure. I mean, that, that mode of behavior that you're describing there, just, it just sounds like she's just a plague. It sounds like it's a festering horrible person, a bad manipulator, obvious manipulator. Just, just, yeah. Well, that's terrible. I mean, and maybe that is a result of parents being a little too sweet with kids, you know? It's a bad, I mean, look at nature. Fucking animals are mean to their kids sometimes. You have to be, you know? So I don't, I don't know. When I think about the whole millennial situation, I'm kind of confused by it because I don't really like, I don't, I don't know. I don't have kids. So I'm not, I mean, I can only guess a little bit, but I don't know exactly what's going on with them. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder, do I have millennial qualities in me, just from being on the internet all the time? If I absorbed it to some degree, I don't know. But, you know, it's, I would imagine that millennials don't feel guilty when they come. I bet that's not a problem for a lot of millennials. That's a good point. They probably come and they, they probably, like a, like as a female, maybe this is good. If they don't get off and the guy did, and he's trying to wrap it up, they'd be like, excuse me, you go down on this shit till I'm done too. That's right, yeah. You know, they demand it. Sure, they're open about sex. It's just a porn, you know? They all have this like, their idea of sex is not like your idea of sex. Your idea of sex is reminiscent of a pilgrim or something. Like you were injected with the old school idea. There must be a part of you that still believes in hell if there's a part of you. Oh, yeah, well, yeah. I think of hell is like a, I think you get reincarnated into, like sometimes I think if I objectify women in some way, even like looking at them or like if I go to a strip club or something, I always think like, I'm gonna, this will be revisited upon my daughter. Like that's, that's hell to me. Is that, you know, your actions will, they will play out in another dimension later. Oh yeah, well, that's the, I mean, there is the idea that you gotta pay everything back. Like there's just no way around it. There's a kind of universal economy that has, there's just no way out. You're gonna- Do you believe that? Yeah, I do, I do. I mean, but I don't think it's quite as, I think there's a way to look at it so that when there's a problem with the concept ultimately. Like it's a way to like, it can be a way where you look at someone who's like going through something rough and all of a sudden you will create a kind of voodoo superstition, like, oh, they must have done something pretty fucking bad if that's what they're going through. And that sucks because a person who's like going like, oh, so the kid who has like muscular dystrophy, I guess, yeah, in some past life, they went to too many strip clubs or something, you know? No, it's not cool because a person who's already going through something horrible, now you have to hang upon them some metaphysical system of judgment that implies that in some past life there were cunts. So in that way, it can be really bad. But from a personal level, when you start going through shit, as everyone does, you can think to yourself, okay, I'm paying off debt here. I'm getting to burn some karma here. And that's great. That's good. I never thought of that. Really good. So when it's happening, you be like, all right, great, man. I'm gonna pay this back. And as I pay it back, I'm gonna pay it back gracefully. I'm gonna like pay it back in the same way. I would want debts to me paid back, not with a lot of like, here you go, Greg. You're gonna take the $2,000 back that you loan me, all right. I mean, all right, here you go. I guess you need it. I'm gonna be like, thank you so much. Here you go. I appreciate you letting me borrow the money, man. Really appreciate it. So that's a way to deal with suffering. It's to look at it from that perspective. Yeah, I think some of the parts of Catholicism that have stuck with me that aren't so bad, like I believe in service. You know, and that's been a big thing with my kids is giving them to, you know, do charity. And I, you know, I just think that everybody deserves dignity, probably more so maybe. I think Catholics really, you know, they've always gone to foreign countries and helped the poor and, you know, Jesus washing the feet of the poor. You know, I think that was built into me, which is good. I mean, there's good and bad. They're extreme good and extreme bad. You know, I always looked at Protestants like, all right, you kind of got a vague idea of what was good and there's no real sense of hell. And, you know, the, you know, the transfiguration of the Eucharist doesn't happen. It's not like, like with us, the bread becomes Jesus' body, literally. And the wine is literally His blood. Where do you think that comes from? I don't know. I never thought of that. It's interesting, right? Yeah. Because that ritual, you know, it's based, you know, you think of this ritual and you think of the Last Supper where Jesus says, this is my body, eat this in remembrance of me. This is my blood. Really, like he was just saying, like when you guys are having a great time, please remember me. It's like kind of the most heartbreaking, sweetest. Spilling out a little bit for the gang member that died. Yeah, it's so sad. That'll bring tears to your eyes every time because it's the sweetest thing ever. And someone is about to die saying, just when you're having a good time, I want to be there. Oh, I'll start crying now thinking about it, breaks your fucking heart. But then that gets converted into this kind of like hardcore ceremony that's actually based on some like many different religions, which is that we take the sacrifice, the flesh of a sacrificed God and we eat it. And then from eating it, there's this purification or kind of we are imbued with some of the qualities of the sacrificed God. And this is a very old ceremony. There's some old pagan stuff. Yeah, it is. It's high magic. They say it goes all the way back to Egypt. Because when you look at the, for example, when we think of the Last Supper and we think of what they must have been wearing. And then you look at the Catholic Mass and you see what they're wearing. It's like, wait, they're wearing vestments. They're wearing, the things that they're wearing are not mirroring the Last Supper at all. It's gold stuff and robes and incense. And it's very, very intense, man. But it's like, where did it come from? This isn't in the Gospels at all. Nowhere, nowhere did Jesus- The golden chalice. That's what they drink out of up there. That's right. And Jesus never said that. Jesus never said, drink from the golden chalice when you think of me. And transmute the bread into my flesh so that you're eating my skin when you think of me. He didn't say that. So it's interesting. It's magic. I mean, that's what the Catholic Mass is actually a magical ritual. Well, he does say, this is my body, which will be given up for you. Eat this. Drink this wine. Does he say it literally? I mean, it sounds kinda like he would have to, the Last Supper, whatever the passages are in the various Gospels, it's gonna be about 20 pages longer if he went through the ritual that you see during the Catholic Mass. So it's, no, I think- They've added a lot of embellishment. Yeah, they have added a lot to it. And this is what's interesting about religion, because it's like, it's beautiful, man. But what is it based on? If it's not based on the event that Catholicism says that it's based on, which is the life of Jesus Christ and following the cycles of that being's life. And it is somewhat based on that. But if there are additions, embellishments, what are those additions? Who made the additions? And why do they get to make the additions? And are these additions appropriate? Well, yeah, because a lot of the Bible, a lot of the traditions in the Bible come from Paul, who was originally Saul, who was the apostle that never met Jesus. He came many years later. And he supposedly saw him when he came down from heaven, which was, felt like a bye to me, that Jesus returned to earth just to talk to this one guy, to give him all the, you know. So yeah, if you cut out Paul, you're getting back to probably some more basic teachings about the poor and less about the, you know. How to run the church. And Paul, that's why they call it Paulian theology, that people say, well, you're not really, the thing you think is Christianity is actually Paulian theology. It's not Christian. That's a thing? Yeah, Paulian theology, which is the idea of like, all right, well, Jesus was, we thought he was gonna come back in our lifetimes. He's not coming back. So let's figure out a way to encode or encapsulate inside of time his teachings so that every single day we can feel like we're in his presence. It's really quite beautiful. I mean, the idea is that if Paul saw Jesus and if Paul became the person who wrote the epistles and became essentially the founder of the Christian church, then that means that the potential for every single individual to have that kind of contact with Christ is there. And also it's kind of the church in a way is saying, we don't care that you didn't meet Jesus in the flesh because you don't have to meet Jesus in the flesh because Jesus isn't just in the flesh anymore. We're all cells in the body of a living God. That's what's trippy about Christianity. That's what's fucking trippy. That'll melt your brain. Christians think they're cells. The church is the body of Christ. They don't mean that metaphorically. They mean literally. The church is a neural network, a lattice of the mind of God. Right, the Holy Spirit. I mean, the Holy Spirit doesn't get a lot of ink. People don't talk about the Holy Spirit. We all know Jesus really well. We got a lot of stuff about God. And then the Holy Spirit is this thing I grew up with and it was always like the, he was sort of like the mist that was floating out of the bogs. And he was the guy, you know, that if you were a really good Christian, then you would experience this spirit, but he wasn't brick and mortar the way Jesus was. Right, yeah, the mist out of the bogs. That's beautiful, man. That's amazing. Yeah, that is the fundamental relationship, right? It's with the Holy Spirit and the experience of that is what, that's the one thing you'd never want to take away from you. Like in life, the one thing you would never want taken away from you is that experience because that's all you have really. And then everything else is just, who cares? It's shallow, dead matter, you know? So do you still go to church? My daughter, because they both went through eighth grade, they went to a Spanish dual immersion program. So half the kids were from Spanish speaking homes. So Catholicism was really big and there was a lot of, you know, crosses. And there was a lot of going to kids, you know, first communions and confirmation parties and all these ceremonies. And so my daughter sometimes likes me to take her to church. So we'll go to St. Monica's and she just, she's always been fascinated with the mythology of it. And my father-in-law had a religious conversion in his 60s. And so he's very into teaching her all this stuff. Like, so we went to Cathedral of St. John the Divine about two or three years ago and we were looking at, it was a, you know, a, what do you call it on the wall, like a mural on the wall of the ascension. And, you know, and he was explaining to her about the ascension and, you know, about, you know, concepts that I wasn't even clear on. She was really curious about and she just got really quiet and her eyes kind of like narrowed and she really listened and she's always asking me questions about God. Just out of the blue, we'll just be sitting there quietly. And then she'll be like, she'll be like, so if you die and you don't go to heaven and you don't go to hell, what is purgatory like a nice place or a bad place? And I'm like, it's like the waiting room with the doctor's office. Like it's kind of boring, but you know, you're going to get some help soon. So it's not bad. She confuses me. Do you believe in purgatory? You still believe this. You believe it. It's okay. You believe in, right? I guess it's almost like we've, they talked about in catch 22. Is that Joseph Heller? Yes. It's talking about like when the pilots were crashing, they would all, they all had crosses on and they all talked about God. And then ultimately when the plane was going down, they all called for their mother. They all cried out for their mother. And so I don't know in my, in my final breath, will I be thinking about my mother or about God? Well, I mean, it feels like, is that Joseph Heller's nod to the Virgin Mary? Is that the idea? I mean, that's like Mother Mary. This is the, this is one thing I think people misunderstand about. And I think it's very beautiful with Catholicism, which is that the idea of so the, what's it called the immaculate conception. So Mary is actually has received the spirit of God and, and her. And so Mary is the first contact, so to speak. And so the reason I've read that in Catholicism, Mary is held up is because Mary is though, it has the, is essentially the first Christian. Mary has made the decision to allow this thing, this event to happen to her. She wasn't raped. You know, it wasn't forced upon her. It was, she took it in. She sort of inhaled it in her. And so that makes her the original, like receiver of the Holy Spirit. Yeah. And, and so that's why she's the most special cause it's the contact point. She's the node, so to speak, that the spirit of Christ flowed out of into this dimension. And so she's the fountain head. Yeah, she's a, what is it called, specimen one in a virus? Yes. So specimen one? Specimen one. Yeah, exactly. But, but it's also for me, it was again, going back to the sexual shame, it was that, you know, all you women that have had kids, you're dirty. Mary didn't have sex and she still had a kid. Right. She's better than you. She's not soiled. Ah, soiled. Yeah. This is the sad part about it. You know, the, Christian, the place where it, I think where organized religion and any kind of fundamentalism that makes you feel bad about sex. It's like, God, I read the New Testament and I look in there to find, where's the shame here? Where's the anti-sex stuff? Do you find like God, you find like one of the sweetest and most probably repeated stories in the New Testament is the adulterer who is about to be stoned to death. And Jesus stops it and says, you know, you have not sent through the first stone. Right. And it's very enigmatic because he kneels down, he draws something in the sand. It says that in every single gospel and it's like, what the fuck did he draw? It doesn't say what he drew. Oh, is that right? It's really trippy. Like, what is that? Why did he draw on the sand? What does it mean? What does that mean? Why, what is that? I mean, there's a reason they included that. Right. Why did he doodle? He doodled something or he drew something. Or what was that? I don't know, I love it though, it's mysterious. It's like the final whisper in Lost in Translation into Bill Murray's ear. Yes, it is. What did she say? What is it? What did he say? Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is the Old Testament, I always say that to people, like there's two religions. You know, there's Old Testament Christianity and there's New Testament Christianity and they are, couldn't be more different. Right. You know, and that Old Testament stuff is really, I guess, the stuff that fucked with me. Yes. And then the New Testament is John Lennon. That's right. And really, the New Testament is the evolution of, I mean, if there's different ways to look at it, you've heard of process theology, you ever heard of that? No. Process theology is the idea that kind of like God is like growing just like anything else. Like God is like unfolding into the universe and we're in the very sort of crest of that unfoldment. And so when you look at the Old Testament, you're seeing like an evolving God. And then the New Testament is this like growth into a kind of like compassionate, surrendered, turn the other cheek. And like, it's, I mean, the most revolutionary religion. And if you follow it, you're, I mean, you've got to, you're fucked kind of because you have to give up your connection to your body. You know, like that's gone. That's gone. Yeah. Give it up. You're going to die. And you're going to get shot. You're going to get burnt. Dude, do you want to see something crazy? Look at this. Let me show you something. Somebody just gave me this, man. I was at the stand and somebody just gave me that. It's really weird. Like that some, this is a strange story, man. So this is Greg's looking at this piece of rock that's been framed. But so I was at the stand and they came out and gave me this and they're like, you know, it's been sitting in our office for a month. Someone brought this here for you and I opened it and I looked at him like, what the fuck is this? Like a framed rock. It looks really cool though. It's like a framed rock. And then I, so I went and did my set and I went and picked that up and I'm about to leave and this guy walks out of the showroom and he's like, I gave that to you. I gave that to you. I'm like, what? He's like, I gave that to you. I came like a month ago to give that to you. And like, it's weird that you're holding it right now. And I'm like, wait, what you just happened to show up on the night that this thing was given to me? Really? Yeah. It's a very weird story. Are you mean the people from the club gave it to you? Yeah. And he happened to be there on that night. Really? And he just randomly was in town and we crossed paths while I was holding this thing that he gave me. But anyway, what this is, he went to Israel and this is a stone from the enclosure that they put Christians in before they fed them the lions. No kidding. Yeah. And he said that like this stone, all the prayers that must have like soaked up. And I think with Christianity, the thing that people don't fully grasp is that many, many, many Christians have died smiling, have died forgiving the people in the act of tearing their fucking eyeballs out. Have like died, like loving the people, killing them. And like with an authentic peace inside of them, that I don't think people realize that because it's like, think of where your mind has to get to be in the moment of being murdered by a person to be looking at them and being in love with them and like wanting them to be forgiven. Fuck. As opposed to a martyr nowadays, a terrorist martyr is somebody who is giving their flesh, but they're harming people. That's right. That's right. Yeah, it's a corruption. Yeah. And that's what's so beautiful about Christianity is it really gives the middle finger to the importance of this particular incarnation relating to the transcendent truth of everything. And I think that's what's so beautiful about it. Yeah. When I had my confirmation, you get to choose a saint and that becomes your name, your confirmation name. And I didn't have a middle name. So it's actually, you just read it. What's my confirmation? What's my middle name? Shit, I can't remember. It was on, you asked your Alexis what my... I was showing Greg. I was saying, this is how you know you made it. And you could ask Alexa who someone is. And if she knows, you're doing great. And she gave out my middle name, which was my confirmation name, which is Sebastian. And I chose him because he was a martyr. They tied him to a tree. There's a really famous painting of him. He tied him to a tree and they shot him full arrows. And they just kept shooting arrows at him. And he wouldn't renounce his faith and he wouldn't curse the people that were shooting with arrows. And I chose him for that reason. And also because it was a giant white sheepdog down the street named Sebastian. Yeah, that's hilarious. He said drool coming out of his mouth and I could practically ride him. Oh, that's so cool, man. Yeah. Can you fucking... I mean, this is the thing, whatever... One thing that I get really annoyed by, less so, but I understand what we'll do is inevitably, you mentioned Jesus and inevitably, someone will smugly say there was never any Jesus. And you're like, just shut up, man. Like, really? You're that shallow. Number one, that you think you need to tell me that. Like, I've never heard that before. I'm like, you just figured it out? I know. They're so proud, they figured it out. They cracked the code. There was no Jesus. Now we can all go forward in truth. Unencumbered. That, I guess, that is the core of what's annoying about activist. Atheist is that they think they've discovered something amazing. I've had that same thought so many times. Yeah, yeah, it's really grating. But, and so they forget in their obsession with the symbol, the flowers growing off of the tree of the thing, which is that to this very day, people are getting murdered for the Christian faith. And they're not renouncing their faith and people will try to, to this very day, they'll try to kill you. And I've heard of this happening in the Middle East. They'll try to kill you. Oh, and there might be subtle variations of this. And people have placed their human existence in a secondary category to this faith of theirs. And that pisses the world off. Because the world wants to be, number one, yeah, yeah, that's what's fucking nuts, man. The world hates being ignored like that. Right. And it's the oldest story in the book. And that's what's beautiful. And that's what I love about Christianity is just like whatever world, whatever entirety of all things that exist in the material universe, I've found something better than that. Well, that's why I've always liked the Jesuits because they're a very progressive wing of the Catholics. And they always really were a cult of Jesus. They were always just, again, like it's John Lennon. They just saw him as this rock star. And did you read that book? It just came out a couple of years ago. It was actually written by a Muslim guy. But he talks about Jesus in historical context. Like really, fuck, what am I forgetting? As like all corroborating stories of what Jerusalem was like at that time. Oh yeah, I know the book you're talking about. It's called... It's one word. It's really good. It's something. People get pissed at that guy too. He's caught a lot of flack. But he wasn't making any judgments on Jesus. He was writing a book as if you were writing a book about... Reza Aslan. Is that his name? Yeah, Reza Aslan or Reza Aslan. Yeah, go ahead, sorry. And he was writing it as a historical account, finding journals, finding writings that all corroborated this. And giving you a context of the Jerusalem at that time was like nothing. It was the desert. There was hardly anything grew. You were lucky to be a carpenter. And it wasn't... So it's just very interesting because he showed him as like a guy who was just coming out against the corruption of the time. Yeah, they were occupied by Rome. And he was like coming out because he didn't want... They didn't want Romans there because the Romans were an invading force. Right, but also the Jews that were running Jerusalem before the Romans were just as corrupt. Well, and I think during the time of Christ, the Pharisees as they're called were sort of paid off by Rome. They were like people who were like... They were allowing Rome to be more important than God. They were putting Rome in front of their religion. That's one of my... By the way, I wanted to ask you, what is your favorite Bible verse? Oh, my favorite Bible verse. Verse or parable? Either. I always liked the prodigal son because I feel like you have to let your child go. And I think as a parent, I've started to appreciate the prodigal son more and more because I'm experiencing now a 13-year-old girl saying, I don't need you, you know? And every parent tells me she's 13, she's gonna come back at 16. Just tough it out, don't give a shit for it. And I just texted her on the way over here. How was the day? She had her school dance last night, eighth grade. How was the dance? Fine. That's all I got back. But I asked, we connected, and that's all I can ask for. And tomorrow I'll send her another text. I call her every three or four days and I just accept that I know our foundation is so strong because we've always been so close. And she's very affectionate with me and she's very deep and that I know that that can't go away, but that for now I have to just love her and let her go. You're a great dad. Trying. God, so many fucking shitty dads would be like, what the fuck? Yeah. Oh really, just that's it, fine? Right. I feed you. Yeah. I put a roof over your head. Yep. You don't have time to use more than one word and a text. I pay your phone bill. Yeah. That's what it shit is. I'll take your phone away. Yeah. And believe me, there's a part of me that wants to do that. There's a part of me that would treat anybody else that way. I have to put that guy aside. And that's the thing about parenting too today is that my parents didn't have parenting books. There was no Dr. Phil or Dr. Anybody on TV. It was just, you got beat, so you beat them. They drank, you drank, and it's just, I can't judge my parents, but I think that I'm, I've always been very into self-help, and I think that for parenting, it's, there's a lot of amazing resources just in books about how to not make mistakes. Prodigal son, the kid goes away, he does, you know, he's like, just fucks it all up, right? And he takes a third of the, there was two sons, and maybe three, and he takes his chunk of the farm. The dad has to like sell a bunch of cattle and shit. Gives him a bag of gold, and goes, all right, this is yours, go. And he goes, and he spends it on whores and booze, and he goes crazy. You know, he's having fun. And then he comes crawling back, and he asks for a job working in the stables. Just anything, I can't survive. And the father says, nope, you're full partner, you're back in, we're all equal. Ha ha, it's so great. Yeah, that's great, man. That's beautiful, that's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one. That's a good one, especially, because I think that's like one of the demonstrations of the qualities of God being so incredibly benevolent that any kind of human error that you think that you're doing is ultimately completely forgiven, without even like, almost like you can't even see it. Yeah, I mean, you look at these people that can forgive their child's murderer, you know, they go to jail, and you do that, and you just think, that's grace. And it's ultimately a selfish grace, because you will be tortured by it if you don't. You know, holding on to that will kill you. Oh yeah, oh, it sure will. I mean, anytime you're running anybody, you're holding on to that shit. It's just like, oh man, you gotta like, it's so radical to have, I mean, this sounds really weird, man. But sometimes it's worth someone doing something really bad to you, so that you can like, get a chance to exercise radical forgiveness, because it gives you a chance to let go of something. You should make a T-shirt. Exercise radical forgiveness, sell that after your shows. It's so fucking hard though, man. I mean, it's like, you know, to really do it, you have to have given up yourself. You know, you can't really be a self anymore. You have to sort of let go of the self, right? Well, that's what it is, it's a defense of the self. You know, you're threatened by somebody, if somebody slights you, you know, it's only a slight if you perceive it as a premeditated. If you see it as, they made a judgment of you that you were less than them and that their actions were, they're not responsible for their actions, because you don't mean anything. So if you define it as that, how are you possibly gonna forgive them for that? But if you can, like you said, take yourself out of it, and see that, you know, there's a million reasons why anybody does anything, and it happened to affect you in a negative way, but if you hold on to your definition of why they did it, you're gonna just, it's gonna constantly reinforce a negative feeling that you have about yourself. Well, think about Sebastian, tied to a tree, people shooting arrows into him, and or, you know, the ultimate being Christ on the cross, saying, Father, forgive them. They know not what they've done. Oh, dude, I mean, because it's like, the idea is, in that situation, if you wanna fully believe in this, there was, interestingly, there was the potential, I mean, this is a being that could walk on water, raise the dead, multiply the fishes, transmute the water into wine. You could close out a Friday night late show during the check spot. I killed, he killed every time. No one, no one talked, people, it was hard for people to pay the bill because they were so engrossed in his final joke. They didn't wanna miss a word. Nobody's cell phones ever went off when he was on stage. That was considered his ultimate miracle. Waiters and waitresses were silently moving through the aisles, refilling drinks. There was a story that there was a waitress that actually accidentally spilled a drink and started weeping because she felt so bad for making it, the noise during his incredible closer. There was a feature act who lanced himself after doing a closing bit about a toilet because he realized it made it harder for Jesus, but it didn't matter, Jesus still killed. That's right, yeah, there's this story, I guess the feature act, you're talking about the guy who hung himself, right, because he thought that he had killed too hard before Christ, yeah, didn't matter. He didn't realize that it didn't matter to Jesus, that he actually rose above it. He walked on stage and he goes, how about a hand for your feature act? He knows not what he's done. But the implication is that in that situation, had there, if he'd wanted to, he could have rained fire down upon the world, there could have been anything he wanted, he could have done theoretically, and he chose not to do it out of love. And so this is that place where if you get into that place in this particular period of human history, you are gonna have an amazing life because you're not gonna hate people, you're gonna sort of retire from the occupation of hating people. Well, look at Nelson Mandela, he came out of 14 years in the worst prison conditions you could, and he was given, he was elected the president of the country, and he could have rounded up everybody who, I forget which political party was, was he the ANC or was he, whatever it was, his opponents could have been killed in the streets, and instead he made everybody equal. Yeah, yeah, that's it. So that's the, I mean, and that's the thing, maybe I think people don't understand about Christianity is that's what their religion is. It's like, it doesn't make any sense, it's doing the wrong, the math that is being proposed is new math, and that's what's so cool about it, because the math as opposed to the Old Testament, the math is eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, if they fuck with you, you fuck with them, if they hurt you, hurt them double, but that's what justice look like. This thing is like, what is this? It's like the implication is what are they called, what's the dream? If we can find it on planet Earth, everything changes forever, which is based on the laws of physics, you can, energy, the laws of entropy make it that will never have a sustainable energy source that like doesn't diminish. What is that called? People always talk about it like, engines. Did you say entropy? What? Did you say entropy? It's not, entropy is the force that fucks with like energy. Like if we, I can't, you know, I'm, God, I'm such, I'm sorry, man. Anytime I start talking about this, I feel so embarrassed because of the way my voice sounds, because I smoke a lot of weed. And they can't even see the devilish twinkle in your eye. But the idea is if, like, if suddenly, okay, someone stumbles upon something, who knows, they just figured out, oh, if I take these two magnets, throw them into a, this orb and run energy through it, it'll make more energy than I put in. Conservation of energy? That's it. So the idea is if when I put an energy in, I can get more energy leaving, then we have infinite energy and there's no more energy problem on planet Earth. The moment someone discovered something like that, every so many bad people on planet Earth would immediately be brought to their knees. All the coal companies, all the oil companies, all the people making money off of fucking, like selling fuel and polluting planet Earth. The moment anyone discovered something like that, there would be instantaneous justice for anyone who'd been profiting off of like poisonous technologies. So it's like the dream. Well, that's what Christianity is in a weird way. It's like this like new math. It's this idea of like, oh, no, no, no. This isn't all there is. This part of reality that we're experiencing right now, it's one little sliver of reality. Lots of people here are super caught up in it and they're like addicted to this level of reality, but there's something way better. I think that's the kingdom of heaven, right? And the idea is like, anyway, the idea that should you be attacked, do not attack back. Should you be attacked, let them kill you is fucking insane, man. From an evolutionary perspective, what? That doesn't work. How does that work? That doesn't work. Look at nature. That doesn't work to turn the other cheek. Are you out of your mind? They'll crush you. They'll wipe you all out. And they did, threw them to lions, shot arrows into them. But the implication is really cool because the implication is we're not one thing. We're everything. So you kill me, you didn't kill me. And actually the power of a martyr is huge. And that's what they realized. That's what the Christians realized is that if people hear about a martyr and that's the problem with radical Islam is that these people that are martyrs are invigorating their base and making, you look at Syria, you look at all the political unrest that involves radical Islam. It's mostly because of greenhouse effect. Their crops have been destabilized. And so you've got this excess of people from the country into the cities. They've got no money. And they're easily drawn into these cultish revolutionary groups that promise them virgins and another life and all this stuff. And you know, man, I got to stop you there for two seconds only because I think my beard's getting a certain length. Taxi drivers here have been telling me a lot about what's going on in the Middle East. Yeah, and so this guy's been an hour. The taxi driver's been an hour explaining to me what's happening in Syria versus what they're telling us is happening in Syria or what's happening in Yemen versus what they're telling us is happening. And the idea is that you have Sunni and what's the other one? Shiite. Shiite. And Assad is Shiite, but the majority is Sunni. And the Shiites think it's OK to kill the Sunni. But the Sunni don't like the Shiites, so they don't think it's OK to kill them. The Sunnis are more like Mandela or whatever. They don't think it's OK to kill them. They don't like them, but they're not going to kill them in the streets. The Shiites are like, we have to kill them in the streets. And so the problem is there's more Sunni than there are Shiites. And this is what's creating all the unrest, is everyone wants Assad gone because he doesn't represent a majority. He's the minority. But Iran is Shiite. And so Iran wants Assad to be running Syria. And this is why they've apparently brought Russia in. Or so you explain the whole fucking thing to me, man. Yeah. And it was like so awful and so kind. And then he was explaining Yemen, these tribes. It's a tribal society, but the tribes. And then there's the Muslim Brotherhood. But it's not just the Muslim Brotherhood. It's the Sunnis. But it's not just the Sunnis, the Shiites. And then he talks about how whenever there's war in Islam, there's a group of people that comes in and starts cutting people's heads off. He's like, they only show up when the war happens. They only come when there's war. And he had a name for them, like some kind of Star Trek name, like the Kar-Goli or something. Really? There's something fucked up. And he's like, that's what ISIS is. ISIS is a group that comes during wars. They only appear during wars because they're 100% against any government that isn't them. But they only show up during wars. When things are destabilized and they can, they're like the fucking carrion crows that fly down. And so this is like Saudi Arabia. Well, it's what happened in Iraq. I mean, the Sunnis and the Shiites were locked into battle with each other, which stabilized, believe it or not, the region. And we came in and we fucked everybody. And they said, hey, why don't we gang up against the Americans? And that's where ISIS came from. Right. Yeah, well, this guy was saying, there is no ISIS. He's saying that ISIS is this group called the Globally. And he was talking about how like fucking, that guy Zakari or whatever, remember him? Zakari? He's like, when they were talking about Zakari in the Middle East, people were like, who the fuck is that guy? He's like, it would be like if suddenly in the Middle East, someone in Saudi Arabia started talking about like Ron Timon in the United States. We've got to watch out for him. He's leading people. He's deadly. And we'd be like, who the fuck is Ron Timon? We've never heard of him at all. And so his premise is this dude was put there by the CIA to destabilize that the CIA is like using these groups to try to like, or the United States is funding these fucking groups because they're, it's pawns. Basically, God, I don't want to end it on this, man, but the idea is World War III is happening right now. We're at war with Iran and we're at war with Russia and we're using pawns in the Middle East to fight and making them fight each other, but we're the ones fucking Putin and the United States are fighting right now. We're fighting, but we're using these poor bastards in the Middle East as our Vici soldiers to try to like, I don't know, to prevent the real World War from happening or something. I don't know. Sorry, man, I shouldn't have ever talked about this stuff. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Well, it is, I mean, from the mouths of cab drivers, you can get the truth that you're not hearing in the mainstream media. That's for sure. That's right. That is right, man. They are found. That's one of the things I really miss about New York. I mean, try to keep me from talking to my fucking cab driver. I mean, it's just, that's why I take Uber and Lyft sometimes, but from the airport to long ride, I'm in a yellow cab. It's the best. Yeah. And they're fucking cool, man. Yeah. And the Muslims especially, it's Ramadan right now. This is another thing I've realized when I'm with them, I just say, hey, it's Ramadan, right? And they beam and smile like, yeah, it's Ramadan. It's great because they get really excited about it. They're like, when can you eat? And they'll tell you the exact time. Like, I can eat at eight 34 because they have little calendars that they like mark. And I think it's just the most beautiful thing ever, man, that there's this entire, millions of people right now are spending the entire day hungry for their religion. And no one's talking about it. You know, they don't talk. They don't want, the cab driver won't tell you. He's fucking hungry because he's not eating for God. He's gonna be quiet until you ask, like, if I go without eating for like more than four hours, I'm like, God, I'm starving. I'm hungry, especially I'm doing it for God. Yeah. I'm not eating for God. Man, I love talking about Jesus with you. It's really cool. I think it's so important to like talk about Christianity. Christianity really gets like a short shrift, man. It's the Norman Rockwell of religions in this country. It's sort of like, I don't know, there's something about it that's, if it's taken in its pop form, there's a pop form of Christianity that's really kind of nice and comforting. And like I said, good, and look, just, I should say this as a disclaimer, I'm not a practicing Catholic. Right. But I also can't extricate myself from the foundation of that, including my belief in God, which is very strong. Right. I talk to God and I believe in God. And that's, I mean, you were talking about atheists having a problem with proselytizing atheists having a problem with Jesus. What about with God? What about, what about atheists having an issue with their being some kind of a consistent narrative in the universe, just negating that entirely? And I'm not telling you what it is. I'm just saying it's there. That's a whole other podcast. That's another podcast, but I get why they do it because it's comforting, you know? Atheism's comforting because it's like to deal with the other thing, because atheism is like bizarre, first of all, because it's founded on this idea of there being some respite from sentience, right? So, and that's heaven. So when you come into it, ask any atheist who doesn't believe in God, God gets, people will yell at me, anytime you talk about it, people yell at you, but if you go up to someone and say, hey, have you ever experienced nothing? Have you ever experienced that? And they can't say yes, because if you experience nothing, then that nothing turns into a something. So the atheist thinks, when I die, nothing. The thing I've never experienced cannot be measured, cannot be weighed, cannot be filmed. The thing that absolutely cannot exist, just even say a thing as a nothing is to make it a something. And yet, their entire faith is based on this idea that there is relief from human, from being a thing. If only, that's paradise, man. They're talking about the ultimate paradise. As Dawkins says, death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of infinity. And even Dawkins in that statement, there's an understanding of the suffering that comes from being a thing that exists. And for Dawkins, nothingness is preferable to the suffering that he feels every single day. And so his last hope is death. Now, and that is exactly the word that I say to every atheist, explain infinity to me. And then I'll come on board. Yeah, exactly. Where does it stop? How does it stop? When does it stop? You stop? Oh, how do you know? When does time stop? When do color spectrum stop? Yeah, I love that. Well, shit, that is another podcast. Thank you so much, man. It's so nice chatting with you.

It is I, Duncan Trussell, the Skrillex of podcasting, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And today, I am releasing another live episode this one with Abby Martin. It was recorded at the Arlington Draft House in Virginia. It has an opening monologue built into it. So I'm not gonna do another opening monologue. I'm just gonna do some quick business and then we're gonna dive right into that live podcast. This episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Casper.com. Casper mattresses, go to casper.com, slash family hour and get $50 off your order of a premium mattress. Listen, is your relationship falling apart right now and you don't understand why? Is your relationship, are you having weird dreams when you sleep on your bed at night with your new lover? Well, that's probably because you are making love to your new lover on a mattress that you have made love to many old lovers on. Blasphemy, sacrilege. Why would you do a thing like that when as you cuddle and hold and kiss and gently caress your sweet new darling lover just underneath you in the same way underneath all cities is a rivers of shit. Just underneath you, just underneath a couple of thin sheets is a shroud of Turin made of jizz. Is that what you want? You wanna make love to your new sweet lover when just underneath you are splotches and stains and sprays and burps and bubbles of all kinds of sexual and various fluids that have erupted from your old lover's body as you were riding him and her in the night like a banshee on a hell horse? This is an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. Just the right sink, just the right bounce. Two technologies come together for better nights and brighter days. Risk free trial and return policy. Try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days with free delivery and painless returns. Mattress is made in America, 500 bucks for a twin size mattress and 9.50 for a king size mattress. Comparing that to industry averages, that's an outstanding price point. Nobody talks like that, but I gotta read that because that's what's on the sheet and they sponsored this show. Finally, terms and conditions apply. Do you hear me guys? Terms and conditions apply. I don't know what that means, but I'm supposed to say it. So make sure you check out the contract, otherwise ordering a Casper mattress. Who knows what's in there? They might, you might have to marry a horse or something to get one of these things. Here's the essence of it, friends. Here's why you should order a Casper mattress and then we'll jump right into this podcast because I have a Casper mattress. That's right. I sleep on a Casper mattress. I make love on a Casper mattress. I eat mangoes and watch Game of Thrones while enjoying a Casper mattress. That's all you need to know. I would never ever promote something to you guys that I don't actually use. And my current mattress is a Casper mattress. My old mattress was an overpriced mattress that I got pressured into buying because I was super stoned. And at the mattress store I went to, it vibrated. And the guy tricked me, tricked me, recognized I was high as a badger in the sun and he fucking talked me into buying this mattress and when the couple of months it had turned into a, the whatever it was made of just sank in. I felt like I was laying on top of a tepid piece of gum spat out of the mouth of a prepubescent teen at a theme park. My back was hurting all the time. It was a nightmare. Thank God I got contacted by a Casper. They sent me a sweet queen size mattress. I wish I'd gotten a king. If you're listening Casper, it'd be nice if you'd send me a king instead of the queen. I'd like a bigger mattress. But other than that, which is my fault because I got a smaller size than I wanted, this thing has been great. And it's cheap compared to other mattresses. So if you're thinking about getting a new mattress, you want to press reset on the relationship. You want to get rid of the, essentially an old mattress is an Indian burial ground for semen, guys. That's what it is. And everybody knows it. It's the deep politics of a relationship. When you're laying on the mattress of your new lover, you have to push out of your mind the fact that on this mattress, he or she rived around with countless other lovers, their lips and tongues lapping upon his or her sweet, soft, beautiful body. You don't want to deal with that shit. You don't want that cognitive dissonance rolling around the back of your brain as you're trying to merge souls with your brand new soulmate. Guys, Casper's the way to go. Go to casper.com, Ford slash family hour, and you will get 50 bucks off your first order. I highly recommend it.

You can also check out our shop located at DuncanTressel.com. Check out one of the Ron Regi Design Enneagram T-shirts. These things are encoded with sacred occult symbols guaranteed to draw extra-dimensional hummingbirds who will nurse off of your nipples and the joy of extra-dimensional astral hummingbirds is what creates synchronicity in your life to be specific extra-dimensional hyper-hummingbirds. They shit miracles, basically. Those days where you're like, my God, I'm having all these synchronicities and things seem to be going right. I just don't understand why. Well, I'll tell you why. It's because you've been doing some meditative practice or you've been wearing one of these incredible shirts and it's causing your body to secrete the energy known as prana. And that energy gets secreted through your astral nipples and when that happens, it's no different than having one of the hummingbird feeders on your porch. These little invisible guys come and suckle away and they shit miracles and the next thing you know, you're experiencing high rates of synchronicity. That can happen. All you gotta do is go to the shop and pick up one of these shirts and they're, oh, so very, very soft. It feels like a million tiny snakes that aren't moving have been hung on your body. All right, that's enough of those commercials. Let's dive right into this live podcast. This is live. I've only said that a million times so far. So my opening rant here is in front of a live audience. So forgive me if it seems stammery or weird or different from whatever my opening rants usually are, but these are live shows. So there's differences. I don't get to hang out in the inner sanctum of my podcast studio, re-recording these things over and over again. So that's the only difference though. Our guest is a returning guest. Her name's Abby Martin. She's the former host of the show Breaking the Set, which was on Russia Today. You can find out more about Abby by following her on Twitter at Abby Martin. She's also an amazing artist who makes some incredibly psychedelic images. You can check those out by going to her website, www.abby, that's abbymartin.org. And she is the founder of a great organization called Meteor Roots. So there you go guys, please now welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Abby Martin. All right. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. Hello my sweet friend. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Good evening everyone. It is I, Dunkin' Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast recorded live from the Arlington Draft House in Virginia. Hello. Man, I love Jesus. I really do. I'm not a Christian, but I love Jesus. And you know, being a Christian is an interesting thing. A lot of you guys are probably aware of the history of Christianity, but for those of you who aren't aware of the history of Christianity, to sum it up, there's like the gospels, there's these gospels, which are the stories of these people hanging out with this being that no one's even sure existed or not, could have been a archetypical form, a thing created by secret societies to seed history, to create a certain wave in the evolutionary flow of things, to lead us to the technological singularity that Kurzweil is talking about. Some people think that's what Jesus was. Nobody really knows, but one interesting thing about Christianity that I really like is that you have the gospels, and then you have the epistles, which follow the gospels. And those epistles, a lot of them were written by this guy named Paul, who never met Jesus at all. He was somebody whose name was Saul of Tarsus, and he was, as the story goes, back in the day, right after Jesus was crucified, there was one very popular hobby that people had, which was beating the shit out of Christians. They loved it. They'd throw rocks at them, feed them to lions. I don't know why, man, it's really weird to think about that, but that was like a kind of accepted thing, like, oh, you're a Christian. Oh, there's a Christian, grab some rocks. Let's throw rocks to this asshole. He's a Christian. So that really was going on, and one of these guys who liked to throw rocks at Christians was this guy named Saul of Tarsus. I'm not really sure what Tarsus even means or where that is, but his name was Saul, and he was walking to a city called Damascus, and on the way to Damascus, he had this vision where he saw Jesus Christ, the Christ consciousness, the force of all love and good in the universe appeared before this guy as he's walking down this road and said to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? And in that moment, there was some kind of revelatory moment that happened for him where he realized his entire life was wrong. You shouldn't throw rocks at Christians. You probably shouldn't throw rocks at anybody. It's a bad practice in general, because we're all human beings and it fucking hurts when a rock hits you, man, don't do it. It's a bad thing. So he had a series of revelations in that moment when he encountered this divine being, and he was made blind and then wandered to Damascus where he met some Christian missionaries and basically founded the early Christian church. Now, regardless of the fact that if you've read the epistles, it seems like Paul might just be the biggest asshole on earth, definitely a misogynist, and possibly maybe whatever happened. I don't know what happened, but Dostoevsky has an excellent essay where he talks about that moment when Saul meets this entity, Jesus Christ, and is completely transformed. And he says, well, what happened in that moment? Did this being, this Christ consciousness touch Saul in some kind of like metaphysical way? Was there a spell cast and did this create a kind of atomic shift in Saul that made him turn into a better person? If that's the case, well, then we're fucked. That's the most awful thing that could have happened because it means there's no free will. It means that if you come into contact with this divine consciousness, you're immediately shifted and everything's fine. And who gives a fuck? It doesn't really matter. You didn't do anything interesting. It sucks. He said more likely what happened is Saul was walking down the road. Maybe he didn't have enough water to drink or something. And he had a hallucinatory moment. And in that moment of seeing this being, he used it as an excuse to become a good person. He used it as an excuse. He made this vision, the reason for him to suddenly transform his entire life and become a very sweet, kind, generous, giving, loving being. I fucking love that, man. I love that because it reminds me of chaos magic, which is the idea that it's not really the deity itself that matters. It's the decision that matters to transform your life and that you can make that decision at any second, at any moment. You can make that decision at any single given moment. That means that right now, someone in the audience, as you're listening to me, yeah, you could imagine that, or you could actually have a vision of Bigfoot. You could have a vision of Bigfoot. We're Bigfoot. You're like, I was listening to this fucking hippie weirdo go on and on about something I didn't really want to listen to. So I kind of started nodding off. And Bigfoot exploded in front of me, glowing with light, beautiful and perfect and said to me, man, why do you keep leaving those shitty Yelp reviews all the time? You know, you don't have to do that. You know, you don't have to like, you can let people out in traffic from time to time. Like, you don't always have to. Why are you in a hurry anyway? Like, why are you even in a hurry? Don't you realize how ridiculous it is to be rushing anywhere when you're going to die anyway when you're being so dumb? Like, you're rushing to your death bed, essentially. So why don't you stop being in a hurry, stop leaving shitty Yelp reviews, and just be nicer to everyone around you for the rest of your life. And tell them Bigfoot told you to do that. And you could do that. You could really do that. And I think it's a super important time in human history for all of us to have those kinds of what's called the road to Damascus experience. I think it's very important for all of us to have those road to Damascus experiences, no matter what they may be, no matter what it is, whatever the thing is, whether it's because you have inhaled dinomethyl tryptamine, whether it's because you guys are awesome, OK? I know you are. That's a real one for sure. That's a real one for sure. You will see Jesus if you smoke DMT. I guarantee it. I'll give you your money back if it doesn't happen. Or some version of whatever that is. You might see Bigfoot too, honestly. You never know. But you will see. But that's a good excuse to be a better person. ayahuasca is a good excuse to be a better person. But really, the idea is find the excuse. Just find the reason, whatever it is. Find the reason to become enlightened because so many people are waiting to be enlightened. So many people are like, you know, after I meditate for, I don't know, two years straight, or after I go to a Pashna meditation retreat, or some Ram Dass retreats, or after I do this certain number of fucking things, that's when I'm going to start loving everybody unconditionally. And that's when I'm going to realize that I'm part of a unified whole that has its fundamental atomic quality, the essence of love. I'll remember it after I fast for five days. I'll become that after I do a certain number of things. And that after, that I'll do it then, I'll do it now, or I should be meditating. All that leads to is you procrastinating your own waking up, which is what the ego's function is, because the ego doesn't want to die. And the ego has created a situation where you are separated from everything else, an us or them situation, you know? Me, you, me and the rest of the world, me and the rest of everything else, death is the dissolution of the body and the merging into the entirety of all things. And that's a terrifying concept. We don't want to do that, but you could do that right now if you wanted to. You could do it right now, the night in this very moment, you could do it right now. Come to the stage, I'll heal you of your illnesses. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Here's why it's really important to have that road to Damascus experience if you ask me. Here's the reason it's very important to do that, because we need education reform, friends. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. We do, we do need it. But what does education, what does it mean? You know, are we talking about the herding of children into these organized penal colonies where people like do a kind of foie gras style blasting of information in their poor little brains and then kick them out and like, I'll get a job, you're broken, you'll be, you're fucked. That's not education, no. Education has got to be every time you forgive somebody and they don't deserve your forgiveness. That's a teaching. Every time somebody fucks you over, cheats on you, fucks you over in a way that they don't deserve to be forgiven and you say to them, I love you no matter what. We're only here for a second and anything that you do is perfect because we're just here for this glimmering flicker of time. I love you no matter what. You do that to a person and you've taught them everything. You have given them the great lesson. Ha ha ha. And it gets really fascinating because this great lesson that you teach through love now because we have this technology around us, every time you do an act like that, every time you do something like that, there's like a 60% chance someone's gonna film it and like upload it to the internet. And then that's gonna get perpetually and eternally reproduced for the rest of time and that's pretty fucking incredible. This technology that we have in our pockets, these computers that we have in our pockets right now, they are disrupting power structures left and right. Every single day there's another report of a cop shooting somebody, a black guy in the back or a cop doing some awful fucking thing or some person in some part of the world doing a shitty thing or even that ESPN reporter. What's that ESPN reporter's name? No, it's not Cunt. That'd be awesome though. What a great name for an ESPN reporter. Like, no, that's my name, I'm not changing it. It's Cunt. What's her, no, what's that, what's her name? What is it? Britt McKinney. Britt McKinney, for those of you who don't know about this, there's an ESPN reporter, Britt McKinney. She gets her car towed and she's at the place where she gets her money to get her car untoed and the ladies, you know, she's saying to the ladies shit like, I'm on TV and you don't have any teeth in your mouth. How does that feel? She's saying really like nasty, selfish, awful shit to this woman till finally she says to her, I'm gonna sue you, I'm gonna sue you people after this. And the tow clerk says, all right, well, I'm just gonna upload what you said to the internet. And you can almost see like the slow motion turn as she gazes at the camera and realizes that her moment of deep, awful, shitty selfishness has been captured and it got uploaded and for the rest of human history, that little blip of selfishness will roll through time. It will go on and on and on and on and on and on forever is an example of how not to be. If that's not education reform, I don't know what is. That's a great teaching. Yeah. But there's other ways to teach and so that I, and I'm not saying be kind and sweet and forgive people because somebody might be recording it, but I think any reason to be kind and sweet is a good reason to be kind and sweet. If you wanna make that your Jesus on the road to Damascus, just the idea that we're being recorded all times, do it. If that makes you a kinder, sweeter, nicer person. But the whole point is that this thing that we're all doing right now today, gathering here together to have a conversation with each other and to listen to a conversation between me and Abby, this is a brand new thing. This is brand new. This is new. This has not happened before and it would never have happened if not for the technology that is now in every single person's hands right here. You have in your pocket the ability to transmit conversations, ideas, thoughts, whatever you want to the entire planet instantaneously. And this was not available to our species. This has only become available to our species in the last 15 or 20 fucking years and that's crazy, which is why right now it's so important to make sure that as we continue this incredible acceleration in the direction of what they call the technological singularity that as we're moving forward at this amazing speed that you, every single person here, you figure out a way to harmonize yourself so that the information that you're transmitting to the universe when it does inevitably get duplicated and sit in the time forever, it's a beautiful thing and not some kind of, some kind of fart. You don't want your fart to go on forever, which is what that, you want the thing that goes on forever to be that one sweet moment that you had between you and someone that you love. And here's the thing, even if it doesn't get captured by a camera, even if it doesn't get picked up by a cell phone, it's being picked up by the biological computer inside your brain. It's being picked up by what is still the most advanced technology on planet Earth, which is your nervous system and the nervous system of all those people around you. And based on what's being discovered right now in epigenetics, the phobias and fears and potentially the loves that we all feel, those things actually get genetically encoded and transmitted to your children and to their children. So all your beautiful acts and all your terrible acts could potentially forever go rolling forward into time, which is why we have to be very kind right now because those great acts as they go rolling forward into time are being amplified and accelerated by technology. That's my rant, thanks you guys. Thank you. Today's guest on the Duncan Trestle Family, our podcast is a journalist for Media Roots. She recently had a show on RT Russia Today called Breaking the Set. When I bring her up, do you think we could all just sing the theme song for the podcast? Okay, so everybody please open your third eyes and spread as much love as you can in the direction of Abby Martin. Welcome, welcome all of you. Glad you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Abby Martin everybody, let her hear it. You spilled the beer already. I spilled beer already, I'm sorry. Cool man, wow, thank you so much for being on the show Abby. Thank you for inviting me man. No, this is really, you're a perfect guest for what we've been talking about here tonight, but I just wanna talk about, what's it like working for Putin? We had conference calls every morning, he's actually a really good guy. I call him Pat Putin. Shut up. Did you ever meet him? I wish man, no, I never met him. He was as far as removed from the structure as you could imagine. Really? Yeah. But somehow involved, right? He had to be somehow involved. I mean, it's surreal to think that he might have watched me on TV. Yeah. I mean, that's fucking weird. He's cool though, kinda. He's a weird dude. I'm not saying he's good. Being good and cool don't have to meet man, but you got it, if you don't think Putin's cool, what the fuck man? He's kinda that's part of his charisma, right? I just picture him like, you know the shirtless horse photo? Yes. Him just like flying around on a Pegasus, like glistening, you know, sort of like baby oil rubbed all over his body. I mean it was- I picture that every morning. I know that you do. Actually I have a photoshop of that. You just told me you jerked off to it. I am. I'm gonna lie. What was the question? I'd make love to Putin. I think it's important to have power structures that are holding each other in check. Right. Right, I think I know what you mean. You mean like we need a Putin. In the sense that like look at the Syria thing, I mean there's different things that Putin is actually like deterring US hegemony and imperialism. Right. You know, that's kind of, weirdly enough what you're saying is what three of my Uber drivers have said to me. I'm not even joking man. Like, so like get in a conversation, if you get the right Uber driver, get in a conversation with them about Putin because they love him because a lot of people in other parts of the world, they look at the United States as being this kind of terrible and exerable force that is unstoppable and any person regardless of his ethics that stands in the way of that force is turned into a hero in the eyes of a lot of people. Right, and it's turned into, it's demonized in the eyes of the West. Right. Which we've seen incessantly. Yeah, right, I mean that's a really like, so how much of this stuff that we hear about Putin is Western propaganda to make us think he's an asshole and how much of it is, this is our true asshole? I think he's an asshole. Okay. But I mean look, it's hard to be a leader of any country and not have a lot of fucking blood on your hands. So I don't like glorifying any leader, I don't like praising anyone who's leading the country. Russia clearly has a lot of fucking problems, but I think that the incessant propaganda that we're seeing is all strategy. I mean it's cultivated because the military industrial complex needs that enemy. We need to keep manufacturing that enemy to keep justifying military spending. But it makes no sense because we're not looking at communism versus capitalism anymore. We're looking at like dueling economic systems that are kind of on the same page in terms of oligarchies. Wow, that is fucked up. Yeah, that is so spooky to think about that. And to go back to what you said before, any leader has blood on his hands. Except Obama. Except Obama. No blood on his hands, right? Zero. But it's true though, if you become president, you're gonna kill people. That's like guaranteed, right? Like there's no way around that. So anybody running for president knows I will kill people. Like I am going to kill somebody. You know what, fuck that. What's that? Why do you need to go in there and be like, I'm gonna kill people? Why can't you go in there and be like, you know what, I'm gonna be the first president who's not gonna kill anyone. That's a great goal. You might be able to get elected just on that platform. Like you could probably just be like, I'm not really gonna do a great job. I'm kind of lazy, I'm gonna put off a lot of shit, probably, I don't like getting up past 11, but I promise you. And you'll be assassinated on day one. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, but that is like, to me, whenever I see Obama, and there's a lot of things about Obama that I like. For example, gay marriage, and the fact that marijuana seems to be getting legal because of, maybe because of him, but it seems like a lot of great shit is happening under, is that weird? Do you think that's not because of him? I don't think that that's him. I mean, you have, Eric Holder was like straight up being like, we're gonna prosecute people for marijuana. Like he was just like, we're not even gonna respect state laws. Obama at first said he, marriage was between a man and a woman. Dick Cheney, years before Obama was even in the limelight was saying that he supported gay marriage. So I guess on a progressive scale, Dick Cheney's comparable to Obama in terms of like, his likeability? Crazy. But no, I mean, I think the marijuana issue shows that there's giant shifts happening in the country that the political system on a federal level just can't, they can't fight because they're losing, they're fighting a losing battle here and that's the same sex marriage and that's the marijuana reform. But then you have these rogue assholes in the DOJ who are like, you know what, we're gonna still prosecute medical marijuana users. You're like, all right, what? Like, how does it make any sense? How does that make any sense? Are they doing that? I don't know. You don't know why there's no... Oh, well, money. It's just money. I mean, you have big pharmaceutical industry, which is, you know, the US is one of two countries in the world that has direct or consumer advertising. Big Pharma is spending hundreds of millions of dollars in your lobbying Congress. And yeah, I mean, that's basically the main driver, like opposing marijuana legalization. So you're saying that there's, what's the DEA? Oh yeah, Michelle Lienhart. Yeah, she was just, I don't know, did she resign or did she let go? She's resigning. Okay, that's amazing. She had to resign. Michelle Lienhart was, what, can you talk about her a little bit? Yeah, so she was the head of the DEA, which is the Drug Enforcement Agency, and it's incredible. There's this amazing clip of her and Jared Polis. He's a congressman and he's drilling her about why marijuana is a Schedule I drug, which is the same as heroin and methamphetamine. He's just like, is marijuana more addictive than methamphetamine? She's like, I don't, all legal drugs are addictive and bad. And he's like, but no, you're the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Like, you should know this. And it's just like grilling her. And she just looks like she's like on Xanax. She's like, it's so good, man. And so she's, but the thing is she couldn't tell the truth because then that would make her explain why marijuana is a Schedule I. So she had to keep doubling down on that bullshit. So a woman like that, you're saying that it's not just an ideological stance that she's taking, it's that there's actual money going into her bank account from lobbyists and from the prison industrial complex. She's actually getting money from them somehow. It's the pressure. And this is the way DC works, is that it's filtered through multiple think tanks, front groups, lobbyist organizations. So you wouldn't see like a direct check from Pfizer in her bank account, but you'd see it filtered through. And the pressure that she gets from her, all the people. How does it get filtered through? How does that look? How does the filtering look? Well, that's why it's so complicated. I mean, like House of Cards style of shit. That's the way the city works. It really does. So you have like all of these think tanks basically like drafting policy and perpetuating all this stuff. And it can be completely happening outside of the political arena where no one who's actually a sitting representative can even be drafting this stuff. It's all just done outside externally. Let's talk about those think tanks for a second. Is that something that's incredibly disturbing to me to imagine that there are groups of highly intelligent people who get together for meetings and highly intelligent people when they look at the United States drug policy have gotta think, oh yeah, this is fucked. Like there's nothing good about this. This is the most ridiculous, incredibly awful, unethical thing that could possibly exist on the planet right now, which is that we are taking human beings who are farmers and growing plants out of the ground and we're putting them into dungeons for their entire lives. That is beyond, like you can't even, like that is so truly evil to think about. But there's, so there's groups of people paid lots of money who know, oh no, that's evil. Yeah, we definitely shouldn't put farmers in the dungeons. That's horrible. How much are you paying again? Oh, a hundred million dollars, whatever. Oh, great, okay, we'll get them in the dungeons. Don't worry, we can figure it out. There's lots of ways to imprison farmers, lots of ways. Gotta fill those quotas, bro. Whoa. Gotta fill those quotas. And that is on paper. Private prisons have to fill beds every night. That is contractually obligated. Wait, say that again, they have to fill a certain number of beds. Right. So like if you're running a prison and there's like 30 beds that aren't filled. You gotta fill that shit, man. Somebody calls you and it's like, you gotta fill that shit, man. Don't you know where the farmers are? Like get your fucking fill those with farmers. Put some farmers in there. What's the percentage of people in prison? Isn't there a percentage? Yes, no. Nonviolent drug offenders, what's that percentage? I don't know that exact percentage, it's a lot though. I wanna say like up to 30. I mean, that might be insane. Let's ask them, do you guys know that percentage? Yeah, does anyone know that? It's not 80. No, definitely not. What? 30 or 40, that's what I'm saying. 30 to 40, non drug offenders? Is it drug offenders? Nonviolent drug offenders, I'm sure. 30 to 40%? It's what? I'm just gonna believe you because it lets me get really passionate about it, but that's fucked up! 51%. Let's say it's not 50, let's say it's 30%, whatever it is, but the idea that in our, like in the dungeons of our country, 30 to 51% of the people there, zero to 100% of people in prison right now are nonviolent drug offenders. Any percentage, fucking unbelievable, man. Any percentage, any percentage is- No, it's absolutely insane. And you look at the rest of the world, I mean, as much as we wanna talk about police states in other country, the U.S. has 5% of the world's population, 25% of its prisoners. Whoa. Say that again, please. 5% of the world's population, 25% of the world's prisoners. Or in the United States. Right. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, there must be- We just have more criminals than the rest of the world, you guys. Yeah, that makes sense. There's a lot of assholes here, that's all, man. The rest of the world's fine. I mean, and then the drug war bleeds into so much, too. That's what's so insane, the Mexican, that all the violence in Latin America, all the refugee problems, so you have all these hardline conservatives who just hate immigrants, right? But they don't wanna look at the system that produces people who are fleeing drug wars based on Nixon's bullshit war on drugs. No, it's- Awesome. There you go. And look at Afghanistan, wow, that really fucking worked, huh? No opium coming out of there. 90% of the world's opium now, heroin is coming from Afghanistan, a country that the US military has been occupying for the last 14 years. How does that happen? Isn't, now let's get kinda, let's get into some conspiracy land here, right? Cause this is like, you know, isn't one of the ideas in conspiracy theories that the reason that opium has not been curtailed in Afghanistan during the occupation of the United States is because drugs are one of the ways that the CIA funds its black ops. Is that, the audience thinks it's true? Look, I deal in conspiracy fact and there's nothing actually documenting yet the fact that the US is overseeing or somehow running drugs out of Afghanistan, but we did it with the Contras in Nicaragua. I mean, we ran Coke, Michael Rupert exposed that shit, the crack epidemic in LA. And I'm sorry, but a country that the US has been occupying for 14 years, don't you think that we kind of have like, like guard towers and shit? Like, you know, like, like seeing people just like funneling giant bags of opium. And there's actually an amazing report that Geraldo did of all people in Afghanistan where he's like, he's like, yeah, he's like, you know, the troops, he's like walking around and like talking to American troops. And they're just like, there's guarding opium fields with like AKs and these farmers are just like harvesting opium. And when the Taliban was there, they had eradicated 90% of the opium crop. Wow. Right. Fuck them. You ever smoked opium? Bad opium. It's pretty great. Right. It is. It's great. By the way, don't do it. It's very addictive, but no, I mean, and think of the great poetry opiums produced. It's produced some incredible Reed Samuel Taylor Courage or HP Lovecraft or it's an amazing, it's an amazing creativity drug, you know? So I can understand why the Taliban would want to crack down on it because you don't want people using any kind of psychoactive substance if you're trying to like make them believe in some bullshit religion. Right. I mean, all wars are about resources and control. So, I mean, the US is actually missing out if they're not actually putting it, putting invested interest in the opium trade right now. But here, I mean, so in the same way that you were talking, to go back to, how does the money get into the pockets of corrupt DEA agents? It's not like Pfizer was giving them money directly to their bank accounts, but here's where it gets really sinister to me, is it's the way the money in a diffuse way in an untraceable way still gets into their pockets. It reminds me a lot of, were you, did you come from a dysfunctional family at all? No, surprisingly, no. Okay, let me tell you a little bit about what that's like. If you're in a dysfunctional family, where the mother and the father are having problems with each other, and if you do something fucked up and the mother and the father start fighting while after you've done something fucked up, your fucked up thing will be forgotten because of this war between the mother and the father. Weirdly, you start benefiting from the destruction of the marriage because if your mom and dad are fighting, no one's gonna pay attention to the shitty things that you're doing. In the same way, it's like, that's the kind of benefit that we're talking about here, which is that, if we're in a place that's the number one producer of opium in the world, and if we're a country that believes that opium is so terrible that we need to keep it out of the bloodstream of the people at all costs, and anyone selling heroin or opium or anything related to opium, they're so vile and terrible that they need to be locked up for their entire lifetimes and that people who are addicted to the substance instead of sending them to rehabilitation centers, they need to be locked up from their entire lifetimes, you would think a country that really believed opium was that terrible while invading this country that was producing all the opium would be like, and we're also getting rid of that fucking evil opium, guys. Instead, they're like, guard the opium. Let's guard that shit. Guard that, do not let anyone burn that. Don't drop bombs on the opium field, please. We need that stuff, man, because when the opium is flowing then into the United States, then what it is doing is it's filling all those empty beds in the prisons and it's bringing all this incredible money to people in these diverse ways, and that's pretty spooky to think about. And guess what else? Big pharma needs opium latex to manufacture pills. Really? Yeah. That's fucking crazy to think about. That's crazy to think about. So why, with all this stuff being kind of common knowledge, why does it keep happening? How come we can't stop it? Why does it keep happening? War is based on conventional wisdom. I mean, look at the entire war on terror. War is terror. War is the biggest act of terrorism you can do. So to have a war on a tactic that is war itself is fucking bat shit crazy. So people just believe these things, right? We're fighting a war on drugs. We're fighting a war on terrorism. Meanwhile, the US is partners with Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter of terror in the war. Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter of terror in the world. So what does that mean, exporter of terror? I don't understand. I hear that said a lot, but I never know what that means. What does that mean? So Saudi Arabia is probably the most bastardized version of Islam, and it's basically been state sanctioned. And the US. This is Wahhabi, is that what it is? This is Wahhabism, yeah. It's like the most orthodox interpretation of Islam. And Saudi Arabia has openly trained ISIS fighters. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, actual members of the Kingdom-funded Al Qaeda, this is all on paper. There's a whole movement called the 28 Pages Movement that's trying to redact and declassify these 28 pages that prove that Saudi Arabian royal officials were intimately involved in the 9-11 attacks. How do you know that's what those pages say? Because congressmen have said it, that have seen the pages. So there's 28 pages in the, this is the 9- This is a joint inquiry that was conjoined with the 9-11 commission report. So it was like a separate joint inquiry after the 9-11 commission, and during like the investigation from the government. And it basically is all about what foreign governments were involved. So we're told that it was all a bunch of rogue agents that we had no idea what was coming, but really there's this tiny section that shows that there were multiple governments involved, and that we knew about it. And one of them is our biggest ally that we continue to fund and partner ourselves with. How involved, this is something where, this is where I start getting like the real hippie heebie-jeebies to think about this, because this is crazy to think about. Cause I remember, one thing I remember hearing, and I don't know where you are as far as like being a 9-11 truth or where that goes, or what was going, like if you take the most extreme version of the September 11th story from a conspiracy theorists standpoint, then the most extreme narrative is that the Bush administration wanted to go to war with Iraq, and they needed a reason to go to war with Iraq, and so they basically orchestrated this attack so that people would be like, it would drive all of us crazy with fear and anger, and then come up with, it would allow the war machine to move into Iraq, which they had unsuccessful, they hadn't figured out a way to do that yet. So that's like the ultra-conspiracy theorists' notion of it. And it's really weird because you hear one of the truth, like there's true things, right? I'm not talking about the thermite residue they found. Is that true? Do they really find thermite in the rubble? Is that bullshit? That is apparently what they found. So they found, so for those of you guys who don't know, they did find thermite in the rubble of these buildings, right, and what is thermite? Thermite's an explosive incendiary. It's an ex- What is that? Okay, so they found, so is there any, both of you are asking both of you? Let's take that whole argument out. I mean, that's like a, you know, the buildings were blown up, all that stuff, but I think that- Why take the argument out? Because I think that this is all unprovable shit, right? I think that the problem when we deal with conspiracy theories is that it's been so demonized. This is actually a CIA campaign after Kennedy was assassinated. This is all documented. That the CIA, I feel like Alex Jones, I got the papers! I have the documents! No, I mean, no, I mean, they want, Watergate was, not Watergate. The commission after Kennedy was questioned by a lot of people. And so the CIA was like, look, people are questioning this investigation. These are all conspiracy theories. So there was this memo to inject, and this was all Operation Mockingbird. It was an operation during the Cold War to kind of muddy the word conspiracy theory and paint everyone who was a conspiracy theorist with kind of this broad brush to demonize everyone who has questions about official narratives. The thing is, if you don't question official narratives, then you're an idiot. And the government lies about everything. There's never been one impetus of war in the past, I don't know, forever, that hasn't been either altered or manufactured or embellished in order to justify endless war for- Let's go through it real quick. Vietnam, what was that? What was the- The Gulf of Tonkin literally never happened. That literally never fucking happened. For those of you who don't know, can you just quickly describe what that is? Yeah, so we basically said that a ship was down by like Japanese, I'm sorry, Vietnamese forces, and it turned out that it really never, literally never happened. And this is documented. This is all documented. So this is not a conspiracy theory anymore. This is real. No, I like to call them state crimes against democracy instead of conspiracy theories because there's no differentiation between the most batshit conspiracy theories that exist and actual real conspiracy theories. Wall Street is a conspiracy theory. The military industrial complex conspires on a daily basis how to make money. There was just this top CEO of Lockheed Martin speaking to Deutsche Bank, this analyst for Deutsche Bank, and this was published on the Intercept by a journalist named Lee Fong. And it's a phone call between them where the Deutsche Bank guy is being like, you know, I'm really worried that a diplomatic negotiation with Iran would depress weapons sales. What? They have that on tape? Yes. If, I mean, that is a conspiracy theory. Like you, you're conspiring on how to make more money. Who uploaded the tape? I don't know, but it exists. That is fucking nuts. And it's also not a conspiracy theory. Wait, a guy got on the phone. Right. Like, who was the guy who got on the phone? A top Deutsche Bank dude. So like a Deutsche Banker, like a Deutsche Bank guy. Talking to the CEO of Lockheed Martin. Like the week before the phone call. Right. He's like eating with his family and he's kind of bummed out and his wife's like, what's wrong? He's like, ah, just this fucking Iran, baby. We're not gonna go to war with Iran. I don't think we're not gonna sell as many weapons if we don't go to war with Iran. Don't worry, honey, we'll go to war with Iran. It's okay. It's okay. Why don't you do something good Why don't you do something about it? Do you think he was like, ah, I guess I just have to get used to the idea that we're not gonna go to war with Iran? And then he read like a self-help book. It's like, believe in yourself. It's like the secret. If you imagine it, it'll come. You know what I'm gonna do, I had told him that you can just blow up. No, I mean, back to 9-11 though, I don't think it's a conspiracy theory to look at the, not only the PDB, that daily briefing that Condoleezza Rice lied about, how it said Bin Laden determined to strike from the US. Years later, we found out that it was dozens and dozens and dozens of presidential daily briefings to the highest echelons of government from the FBI, the NSA, the CIA. They just, all their wires were crossed, but it's like, I'm sorry, I just, I don't think it's out of the question to think that someone as demonic as Cheney turned a blind eye at the very least, considering what we know. Right, so this is, you know, now this is the interesting, you know about the weather underground, of course, I'm sure you do. So, didn't the weather underground, and I don't think it's just them, but a lot of people think that ignoring violence is violence. Have you ever heard that idea before? So if you see somebody getting attacked and you don't do anything about it, you're part of the attack. Like, that is a violent act. If you see anything going on where there's someone being hurt and you don't do what you can do to stop it, then you're committing violence. So the weather underground, the idea was, you know, we have to bring the war back home so that people could understand what violence is like if you live in one of these countries and they started blowing up government buildings and stuff so that people could see this. So this turning the blind eye thing, if that really was all it was, that Cheney or whoever, someone turned a blind eye to the potentiality of those buildings having a plane flown into them, that's the same thing. That's, isn't that the same thing as like making it happen? Right. So I know that you, I don't know what to think about September 11th. I think it's a very foggy, weird, confusing thing to think about, but God damn it, man. What to me, regardless of the reason it happened or who made it happen, whether it was a group of terrorists living in some cave in Afghanistan or whether it was a small cobble of people or whether it was the guy from Deutsche Bank or whoever the fuck did it, I think that what's really sad about September 11th is right after it happened, there was at least, and I think this is a small number, but there was at least 10 people on planet Earth who were like, oh fuck, we just made a lot of money, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money off of this and that is spooky to think about, isn't it? The dudes from the project for a new American Century going back to think tanks here in DC, PNAC was like the most sinister think tank of all, it had Rumsfeld, Cheney, the Bush, all the Bush family and shit on it, they wrote a document basically called Rebuilding America's Defenses and in the document they said absent a catalyzing catastrophic event like a new Pearl Harbor, we will not be able to instate our new wave of hegemony and imperialism in the world and that was like written in June of 2001. So the very least- What document is that in? Rebuilding America's Defenses and Project for a New American Century. Who wrote that? A bunch of motherfuckers. A bunch of neocon psychopaths and I mean, at the very least, they looked at 9-11 and they were like, we're gonna make a lot of fucking money. Wow, so here's like, this is something I think about a lot, you know the way an anaconda kills somebody? The movie with J-Lo on it? What's that? Oh, I thought you were talking about the movie, I mean, there's a snake, just in general anaconda. I'm just trying to get out of the conspiracy shit so we can talk about J-Lo. Because that's really all I've been wanting to talk about with you, this whole, no, you know the way an anaconda kills, right? The way an anaconda kills is so fucked up. It's so terrifying the way it kills because what it does is if you are so unfortunate is to have an anaconda wrapped around your body, what the thing does is every time you breathe out, it tightens a little bit, it squeezes in and the more that it does that, so with every exhalation, you're one step closer to death because every time you breathe out, it tightens and tightens and tightens and tightens. So, as a form of, like if they're really, like so if there were power structures in the world right now, they would probably know, you know what, we don't really have to orchestrate anything. If we just wait long enough, there's gonna be an event that happens, just based on the fact that there's all this, you know, there's untold amounts of biological weapons scattered throughout the planet. There's untold amounts of nuclear devices and weaponry scattered throughout the planet. There's ridiculous factions of these insane, brainwashed, lunatic, religious people that make the Phelps family seem like a fucking Easter parade. I don't even know what a Easter parade is, but I don't know if that's gonna happen, but there are these groups of people in the world who are so not afraid of death and are totally cool with dying and are so desperate or sad or whatever the fuck it is, that they're totally cool with dying. So, if there were power structures, they know, listen, just wait, something's gonna happen. And when it happens, here's what we do. We go into Iraq, we go into Afghanistan, here's the next war we rate, wage, anytime these things happen. And to me, that's a really, really horrifying idea to imagine, and even as I talk about it, I think like, how the fuck do we turn this podcast in the direction of the positive? Because I'm scaring myself. Even though, even though, yeah, they don't need to orchestrate a defense, it doesn't mean that they haven't in the past, like the Gulf of Tonkin scenario or like Operation Northwoods, where they were actually talking about blowing up the airliners in Florida with people, like actually bombing people to justify going to war with Cuba. So he's in 1967, thankfully, Kennedy turned it down, but Robert McNamara, which was the joint chiefs of staff at the time, proposed this. It went all the way to the top and proposed the scenario. Okay, so let's just, for the sake of this conversation, imagine that there is a force on this planet, an organized force, semi-organized force on this planet, which represents a group of people who are so asleep that they think it's okay to make money from turning people into hamburger meat. I think that's safe to say. There's a group of people on the planet who, I know there's weapons manufacturers, I know there's people who like have meetings in boardrooms where they're like, boss, I just came up with the greatest idea for a new fucking weapon. Listen to this. It really is gonna be a million times cheaper than the current way that we're turning people into hamburger meat. So it's gonna be great. Like somebody in the middle of the night. Some people wake up in the middle of the night and they're like, man, I just thought of the best fucking weapon. This fucking thing is great. I mean, the sad is that all of the smartest people on the planet are used to, like their intelligence is used to amplify death and destruction. Right. That's what trips me out. Yeah, and the other trippy thing about it is a lot of the technology that we're currently enjoying today, it through the internet, it's military technology. A lot of the funding comes from the military. A lot of the great innovations that happen in the world happen via DARPA, Lockheed Martin, all the great weapons manufacturers in the world. And it's really curious how their technology ends up leaking out into society and isn't used for destruction anymore. It gets used for the exact opposite thing. But let's imagine we have a group of people on the planet making money from incinerating human beings. It's a weird thing to think about, but it's true. To put it in perspective, it's like, imagine if you could take an Afghani baby to an ATM machine. And there was a door that opened up in the ATM machine. I think I said this on your show, I'm gonna repeat it. There's a door that opened up in the ATM machine and you could put the baby in a blender and the door dropped and you pressed a button and it blended the baby and then gave you 10 grand. Right? That's kind of how it works. Right? That's actually exactly how it works. That's almost exactly how it works. Because each of those bombs that they drop, so I don't know how much a bomb, how much does one, do you have any idea how much a bomb from a drone costs, like one bomb? No. Anyone know that idea? Okay, let's say it's half a million dollars. Thank you so much. Let's say it's half a million dollars per, it's a really expensive to drop those bombs. They're not cheap, man. I know it's like 100K for sure. So $100,000 bomb is paid for by us. We pay for those bombs, right? So $100,000 bomb gets paid for, someone gets the money for the bomb. Whoever's producing the bombs for the drones use, who produces those bombs? I mean, all the defense contractors, yeah. Lockheed Martin, Raytheon. Raytheon, Raytheon, let's say Raytheon. So Raytheon gets a certain amount of money from the United States government every year and in exchange they give the United States government a certain number of bombs. And then the United States government drops those bombs onto sometimes theoretically terrible people, but sometimes kids, wedding parties, children. So if $100,000 bomb drops on 10 to 20 people. Then you get a baby milkshake. You get a milkshake, that's what I'm trying to get at. If $100,000 bomb drops on 20 people, what's 20 into 100,000? Does anyone know that? I should know that. What? We gotta stop smoking pot, you guys. Yeah, don't throw up math equations. Yeah, back to education reform. The point is, it's a certain way. We have to stop smoking weed, man. We slow it down a little bit. But I mean, what do they fucking think is gonna happen? You bomb the hell out of the Middle East, back into the Stone Ages, and then ISIS erupts in. And they're like, oh my God, how did ISIS get here? It's like, I don't know, did you fucking bomb the rock to like oblivion? Right, right. So that's the thing. So it's clear that there is an organized group of people making money out of creating chaos on planet Earth and killing people. So we know that's the case. So that's definitely happening. I think you can almost with 100% certainty say that is definitely happening on this planet. So then the question is, what do we do about it, Abby? What are we supposed to do? What does the individual do about this? Because every single thing that we've been talking about is entertaining and scary and awesome and dire as it is. It does have, as a byproduct, the feeling of being completely disempowered. When I think about this, I think, what the fuck could I actually do to stop these kinds of things from happening in the world? What are people saying is an actionable, what is an actionable way that we can reduce this kind of corporation or this way of making money? How can we stop this from happening on our planet? Well, I think the first thing is realizing that it's not like an evil, sinister elite, like the Illuminati or New World Order or something. That's bullshit. It's people who actually think that they're doing something right. These people actually believe that the US should take over the planet and kill people for the good of sustaining US civilization or whatever the fuck they think. So they're not sitting up there praising the fucking devil before they draft up war plans and say, how are we gonna kill people and make money? So I think that, if you think that that is reality, then of course it's disempowering because you're like, holy shit, these people are like evil gods, these evil geniuses who we can't touch and they're in these back rooms and it's all smoky and shit. No, they are just normal people. They're walking around DC. I see them. I just saw Robert Kagan's sister and I was like, yo, let's take a selfie, bitch. I love your brother. This is a dude who works with Bill Crystal who is in that new PNAC think tank called FBI now. But I think the first thing is realizing that they're just human beings and it's all based on a really toxic ideology that is dying and the more people realize that we're not the best country in the world, that we can't do whatever the fuck we want, that we're not better than everyone, that's the kind of consciousness shift that is happening. It's been happening and it's happening around the world and people in America just need to get it and really utilize the tools, become media literate. And that's why you guys are all here. You listen to Duncan and Joe Rogan and these people are the media. We are the media. We're making corporate media irrelevant. Corporate media drives on fear and war because their sponsors and advertisers are Raytheon and Boeing and General Electric and all these things that's why you don't hear about net neutrality. That's why you don't hear about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the new coup d'etat that's coming, the trade deal. So it comes with- Wait, what is that? Hold up. When you're saying media literacy, I'm like, oh God, I don't know, man. I wanna be more media literate, but what is that? And I wanna pretend I know what you're saying. What's the, what was the Trans-Pacific? Trans-Pacific Partnership, it's the TPP. You know the disastrous consequences that NAFTA and TAPTA had and all these things that happened across, yeah. They've like, you know, disintegrated jobs and made things really like, like cost more. Well, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is basically NAFTA on steroids. It's a deal between 12 Pacific Asian countries, the US, Australia, and it's going to instill a, like a judicial system outside externally of all these countries that's comprised of lawyers, corporate lawyers, and it'll be this kind of tribunal where these people can usurp the national sovereignty of all the countries involved. So it'll be like, let's say, for example, the US Bands GMOs. Monsanto, whose lawyers are sitting on the board of the TPP, can be like, you know what? We're gonna go ahead and overturn that law. Wow. So it's basically, that's why people are saying it's a corporate coup, because there literally is like a corporate contingent of lawyers that can overturn national laws. And the problem with the bill is that there's all these chapters, they go from intellectual property rights to medicine prices to all this shit, and no one has seen the text, not even Congress, only a very specific group of people who are involved in it have seen it. WikiLeaks has leaked, I think, two chapters so far, and it looks awful. I mean, the Stop Online Piracy Act, SOPA, the bill that Aaron Swartz, like, died saying we need to defeat this, and it did get defeated, while TPP is basically going to take the worst of that bill and instate it globally. And Obama is about to fast-track this shit through, which means fast-tracking it through, like, without even Congress being able to read it. And it's had, like, 700, like, private attorneys, and corporate CEOs. But what do we do? How do we stop? I know, I know, back to what we do, like, you sidetracked me, I know, I'm like making everyone more defeated. Shit. I think, okay, it comes with a consciousness. It comes with realizing that we have the power to change things. It comes with realizing that the system doesn't speak for us, that we're not fucking crazy, because we don't want two parties, that we don't want political dynasties to rule over us, and perpetuate endless militarism. We can do better than that. It comes with us realizing that we can do better than that, reaching out to our community, realizing that people are like-minded, building that momentum, building our own alternatives. It's happening. It's already happening. The media doesn't tell us. But how, so every single person here, you guys live in DC, so you're more connected, I think like, when I think about what you're saying, reaching out to my community and all that stuff, it's like, I'm never gonna do that. Like- Like, DPP, I guess it's gonna happen, man. I don't see how, I'm interested in what turned, you're an activist. You're a person who is very, you're clearly incredibly passionate about this, and you've made an entire life about getting this information out into the world and trying to fight against these power structures. What pushed you from the place of being a person like me, who's like, I don't know, I hate it, it's awful, I like thinking about it, I can talk about it on my podcast, but what pushed you from being a passive person to actively trying to fight against these kinds of social constructs? Well, I was this privileged white idiot living up in the suburbs of the Oakland Bay Area and just totally did not know what the fuck was going on, and my boyfriend at the time joined the military because of 9-11, and then when he went to boot camp, not even Iraq, boot camp, he became this like, psychotic asshole, and I was like, wow, that's what the fucking fucking boot camp did to you? Like, you're not even fucking seeing war, bro. And then I went to college, and I immediately like, I remember taking a sociology class and reading the book Blowback by Chalmers Johnson, and literally one chapter of that book is about Okinawa, Japan, and what like, the US bases there, it's like one of the most militarized places in the world. And of course, when the US goes in and invades a country, it doesn't leave, we have 900 bases around the world right now. That is just one case study of what militarism does to basically eviscerate culture and destroy culture, and it was just awful, it was devastating, and that was just one, like a microcosm of the entire system, and so it made me realize, holy shit, what is going on? So I totally became against a war, and then I was like, fuck y'all, like my boyfriend, I was like, eh, I don't think it's gonna work out. But after that, I mean, the Iraq war was starting, and in San, I was living in San Diego at the time, it's the most heavily concentrated military base city in the country as well. So the Iraq war started, and I was all about like, I hate Bush, Bush is like driving us in this war, but then I was like, wait, this isn't just Bush, this is about the Democrats too. So I became very cognizant of the fact that both parties were selling the war and selling lies, Nancy Pelosi's like, impeachment's off the table, you're like, but he's a fucking war criminal, we can impeach him very easily. And then I realized that basically media was the platform, and honestly Duncan, I don't have all the answers, but I know that we're in an information war right now. There's propaganda wars being peddled at us on a daily basis, and it's up to us to filter that down, to discern what the truth is, take our own perspectives from a variety of media sources, and become literate and conscious, and honestly, that's all we can do. And I believe that getting the information out is the number one thing we need, and people can make their own decisions, because I don't wanna tell people what to do, I don't know what the answer is, but I know that if all of us aren't formed enough, we can be better people, and we can make better decisions for ourselves, and what's better for our communities and our families. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Do you think that it's better, would it be better to turn off your phone, to throw your phone away, turn off the TV, cut off all information, inflows into your life, and just try to be a kind person? Do you think that that is a cowardly reaction, all this? Because sometimes with everything that you're saying, get the good information, then get that good information out in the world. Sometimes I think about, so you know, Ram Dass talks about how there's these varying frequencies that we can tune into, right? So on one frequency, we have this thing that you're talking about, which is we exist on a planet where a very small percentage of our species is figured out a way to turn war into profit, and so they want war to keep happening. And within that paradigm, there's an infinitely complex web of connections that lead eventually to you, to everyone sitting here today, because we all pay taxes. So that's really happening. That's one frequency that we're existing on, right? That's the frequency of the time period that we're currently existing in. Then there's another frequency, right? There's another frequency happening. That's the frequency where no matter what happens on this planet, we're all gonna die. Everyone's gonna eventually, we're all being aerosolized by time. We're all going to be completely, like I don't know how old you are, but within like 30 years statistically, maybe 40, I'm done, like it's over. We're all kind of like shot out of a vagina. I love saying that, into infinity without a parachute. And we're just falling. All of us right now, we're all falling through time in the direction of oblivion. And to get caught up in these things that you're talking about, and that I think about all the time, to get caught up in these things, is it a waste of time? No, because that's the antithesis of the ego. The ego would be to just like obsess about, this is my life, I only have one shot, it's all about fucking me, right? Like so realizing that you're fucking nothing, you're a speck of dust flying on a fucking shooting spaceship in the universe, and that your life is such a fucking speck of nothingness in the grand scheme of existence, that that's why I've sacrificed my life that I'll die doing what I'll do. I'll die in the streets to get the truth out and the information out, because that's what I feel is bigger than me. I'm nothing compared to the information that I'm trying to put out there. Woo! Yeah, yeah. Cool. Great answer! That's so cool. Do you ever worry about that though? I mean, you must worry a little bit about that. I mean, with all these revelations coming out with the NSA and like, you are one of the most vocal people about this stuff. You had your own TV show where you were regularly getting this information out into the world and the TV show was being funded by Russia and you live in the United States. If anyone here is getting monitored right now, it's you, there's probably like a swarm of invisible DARPA drones around you right now, just like studying your brainwaves. Do you ever worry about that? Do you ever think like, I'm probably gonna get arrested or, because one thing that like, and I worry about that, I worry about it a little bit myself because we like to believe that everything's gonna be fine. Like we like to believe that the United States is gonna continue to be a completely open society and everything's gonna keep being open until we die, but if you look at history, you can see how quickly that can change, you know? One fucking, you know, all we need, like that awful, can you say that quote again about the Pearl Harbor we need, that sinister quote? Absent a catalyzing catastrophic event. Catalyzing catastrophic. Like a new Pearl Harbor. Right, a catalyzing catastrophic event, right? A catalyzing catastrophic event. A catalyzing catastrophic, I love saying it. Let's say this again. Cat. Cat. Cat. That event is, that's the sound for a lot of people, for many of us, it's the worst thing ever, but for a lot of people, a catastrophic event like that is the sound of the fucking slot machine siren going off. They're like, great! So like a lot of people want that event to happen and we're always, we're a couple of those away from like laws, from that anaconda tightening even more. And when that happens, aren't you a little worried that people are gonna be like, someone will be like, we can't have a fucking loudmouth like you. Oh really, you're against war? Well look what fucking happened, asshole. You didn't want war to happen. A fucking dirty bomb exploded in Manhattan because we weren't able to attack those people because of folks like you. You need to go to jail. Aren't you a little worried that that could happen? Well I think that if a dirty bomb went off in New York it would be because we're incessantly bombing the fuck out of multiple countries. So I think that that starts like preventing future terrorist attacks, starts with stopping terrorism. And stopping this military intervention in the rest of the planet. But I'm not scared, I don't live in fear of the NSA. I try to be as open as I am, as I can be, about all my drug use, about everything, about my personal life, because I, there's nothing that they can fucking get me on, man. Right. Nothing. Do you have a piece of tape on top of your camera? I do, because I don't wanna masturbate with the NSA watching me, but, that's the only thing. That's the only sign of protection. That sticker is the only sliver of like, privacy. I take a little bit of pleasure in imagining the NSA watching me jerk off the point. To me, it's like you asshole, enjoy this motherfucker. You're like getting paid to watch this. You gotta watch like this hairy 40 year old jerk off the SNM porn. You deserve it. No, I don't think that anyone should live in fear. Like, if I, I think that that is exactly what they want. The establishment thrives on fear. There's nothing they're more scared of than a populist not living in fear. Right. And so when the system drives on us being terrified of the other, of this manufactured enemy, you know, whether it be Islam or Russia or whatever, brown people, that, it starts with stopping. Wait, they're brown people? I'm sorry, stupid joke. Yes, yes. I know what you're saying. Like they want us to be afraid. They want us to be divided. Right. That's the idea. But again, it's that they. Right. It's they, it's like that they. It's like, you were saying it's like, it's not as nefarious as a group of religious people or like cultists intentionally blowing people up. It's people who think they're doing good. Right. That's even worse to me. You know, it would be great. It would be better if there was like a small group of people who are worshiping the our God, Malik and believe that that'd be amazing because we can fight them. Right. But it isn't like that. It's, it all comes back to the fact that everyone thinks they're right. Right. There's a group of people who think they're right and they think that what they're doing is exactly what this planet needs. It's that level of delusion. How do we fight against that? How can we transform that into something positive? I'm really interested in that, in what I can do tomorrow. What can I do tomorrow? That. Well, TNT is not gonna like stop bombs from exploding, is it? Look. Over. There you go. Well, no, I do know what you're saying. Like, I do know what you're saying. Like, I even, like a lot of people might hear that outburst as being like, yeah, what the fuck, man? You're, you're. Well, no, but I do know what you're saying. Like, I do think there is a responsibility to tune into the truth, not just tune into the, not just tune into the truth in the sense of like the right media outlets, but tune into like the truth that's behind all that stuff, right? And there's a lot of access points to get to that truth. And there's a lot of ways people get to that truth. One of those avenues is psychedelics, but there's a lot of other ways to get, to get to that truth as well. Are you a spiritual person? After doing drugs, yeah. Right. Right. But so, so you, are you an atheist? Are you a theist? I think I'm agnostic. Agnostic, so. Yeah, cause I don't claim to know anything. Like, I don't know. You know, and I think that, I mean, I'm more likening toward atheism, but I don't claim to know that there's like nothing because I feel like there is this interconnected energy between all of us on the planet. Yeah. And there's something that I don't, I can't explain everything through science. I don't know if science will eventually be able to explain everything, but I know that there are some things that I can't explain through science that I've experienced that other people I know have experienced. Yeah. See that, that thing you're talking about that we can't explain. Like sometimes I think that the idea would be that the, and this is just really like maybe just like in the face of all of this darkness that you're talking about and that I think about in the face of this absolute lovecraftian horror, I like to believe that there is a transcendent frequency that we can tune into and that we can bring that out into the world through our actions, that it's possible to do that. And that the trick is finding the access point to communicate with that thing and then let that thing sort of be the wind in our sails, so to speak, as we move throughout the world. Do you have a thing like that that's the wind in your sails? Do you meditate or pray or do you have? Art. Art, there you go, that's cool. I have too much ADD to just sit there still, I just keep thinking about shit, I can't meditate, man. So I have to just channel it into something that I'm doing, but my brain is dead when I'm doing this, so that's cool. I don't think about all this shit. You don't feel compelled by, God, forgive me for asking this question in front of an audience. From time to time, you don't feel like you're being compelled by a greater force in your life? Well, I had this weird experience where I did this breathing meditation exercise and I felt like I had transcended to this, this is super weird to even talk about, but I transcended to, I was this woman in some bombed out area in the Middle East and I was just like, I don't know if that's some past life shit or if I just had this experience where I felt like I was so connected to this person that I felt like it was me and so emotionally driven by that moment where I was that woman and I was in that area and like losing my children. And I think it all goes back to realizing that our consciousness doesn't end with me and doesn't end with you. This is like something that we are brothers and sisters and it doesn't stop or start with nation states or borders. And once you realize how much your tax dollars, which by the way, over 50% of our tax dollars are going to war, also we're still paying the debt from the civil war, that's how far this shit goes. Once we realize that people who are dying in Gaza or suffering in Detroit without water are brothers and sisters, I think that's where empathy needs to extend toward every corner of the earth where you can really realize that we are a family and all of this impacts everyone. And if the system is globalized, the struggle needs to be globalized. So it's easy to say like, yes, let's remove ourselves from society and just hone in on your immediate family and existence and that's fine, like you're still making things better for yourself and the people immediately surrounding you. But I think that it's so entrenched internationally that we need to remove ourselves from like our own hub and at least just like start fucking just sharing that stuff, man, at least just start spreading that love and spreading that consciousness. And you're right, it goes past. You have to understand this is a game. You know, participating in the two-party system, this political duopoly I call the two-party dictatorship, Hillary Clinton is a fucking war criminal. Jeb Bush is a war criminal, Rand Paul's an asshole. So, I mean, straight up, that's 2016. How is Hillary Clinton a war criminal? Where do you want to start? At the first war crime. Well... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. All right, well then, I'll start with the Iraq war vote. The what? Iraq war vote. Oh, okay. Two million dead. Okay. Iraq and Afghanistan, so that's the start. But someone did an embedded investigation in Obama's National Security Cabinet and found, like, basically depicted that Hillary Clinton was on par with John McCain, in terms of her, like, utter war hawkishness and trying to just drive war. So, that's where we're at right now. And if we continue to buy into this and keep giving them, like, a referendum to do all this shit, there are other parties. Like, people always guilt me and they're like, oh, you want Jeb Bush to win? It's like, yeah, I'm just not gonna vote for a war criminal. Like, I'm not going to capitulate my moral compass to invest in a system that I don't believe works for us. But, despite the fascist takeover on the federal level, look at locally, man. Like, we are doing some shit. Tennessee just overturned civil asset forfeiture, which is where cops can just steal your property. No shit. There's cities all across the U.S., like, repealing the National Defense Authorization Act, which says that the military can go and arrest you and you surf, like, city law and hold you indefinitely. I mean, these are things that are happening locally that, of course, the corporate media doesn't tell us, but that's how I'm driven every day. That's how I'm empowered by knowing that people are fucking taking it upon themselves with ballot initiatives, with referendums, with city council people. I know it's really boring, but it's true. And that can make huge monumental seismic shifts. I think it's beautiful what you're saying. And it really is that thing where you're like, I know it seems boring, but really, it's like, we've got to overcome that lazy thing where we want to be, you know, here's what it is. I want to be a fucking Jedi and have a lightsaber. And I want to have, like, an evil that I fight that looks like Darth Vader, and I want to be able to shove the lightsaber into the fucking evil and it dies. But that's not where we're at, bro. We're at a very different place where we need to worry about what you're talking about on the local level. I need to get involved like that. We've got to get involved like that because we have to overcome just how incredibly fucking boring it sounds. The idea of going to a city council meeting, are you kidding me? Like, that idea, that's like, oh God, to imagine, I'd rather go to a proctologist than go to a city council meeting. Like, the idea of getting involved at the local level and buying into the machine in the way that you're talking about for, I think me and maybe for a lot of us, we like to, this is something that I've realized I do a lot. I like to pretend that my laziness is a revolutionary attitude. And it's not, man. It's just pure laziness. And what you're saying is that if we get involved, and it's so funny, like, I bet there's like a government think tank that was like, here's what we got to do. Make getting involved in local government synonymous with being a boring asshole, and nobody'll do it. But if we start getting involved at that level, you're saying that we can create actual, real changes in the world. But at the same time, I don't want everyone to think that they need to become a full-time fucking activist because of course we need to work. We need to make money. We live in a system right now that we don't have time. And so it makes us super disempowered, we're disillusioned. We think that we just need to remove ourselves totally. And then we want to see change really rapidly. Change takes generations. Change takes fucking time, man. So you're doing what you do, dude. You're putting out information. Everyone can do what they can do. And it's about finding what speaks most to you, finding out what you can physically and mentally do, and not go past that capacity because you're gonna get burned out. And just figure it out, man. All of us have a passion, all of us have a strength, all of us have some sort of talent that we can use to facilitate that information and spread that awareness. And it's beautiful. And the system makes us feel like we're fucking nothing and that we can't do anything. You know, art and music are the first things cut from education reform. But I mean, no, like seriously, I mean, that's like what we need to hone in on. Got it. Beautiful. Abby Martin, everybody, let her hear it. So inspirational. So inspirational. How can people find you? How can people find you? Medioroots.org right now until my next show is out, and that should be in September. And then abbeymartin.org is my art website. Thank you so much, you guys, and Duncan, you're amazing. Thank you, Abby. Thank you so much. Beautiful conversation. Thank you. So we have a little bit of time, you guys. If anybody asks questions for us, there's a microphone right there. Feel free to hop up and let's get some questions. A question for you. What do you think the biggest problem with the zeitgeist movement is? What's the biggest snag? Because fuck money, let's burn it all. Wait, I'm sorry, what was the end of that? What's the biggest problem with the zeitgeist movement? Why isn't it happening faster, this resource-based economy that Peter Joseph goes on about? I'm really into that. I've done drafting, three-dimensional printing. You really don't need people to work anymore. We got machines to do all this stuff for us now. What's the biggest snag with that whole system? Or do you even see one? Sure, I don't like looking at people who are presenting incredible opportunistic ventures as saying that there's flaws or problems with it. I see it as huge opportunities and beautiful avenues that we can emulate and take ideas from without saying we need this entire thing and we need to all embrace it. We just need to say this is fucking amazing, that's fucking amazing, let's take aspects of that and implement it. So you don't really see any snags or problems or big- I mean, there's a lot of things that they're working out right now. And the more people get involved, we can all figure that along the way, but they are very democratic about it and really open to change and ideas. So I think it's great. Fuck yeah, what do you think, Duncan? I think that was a good question for Abby, man. I don't have an answer for that one. All right, but you're awesome. Thanks, both of you. Thank you, brother, thanks, man. Duncan, I just want to shake your hand, man. Thank you. Thank y'all. Hey, Duncan, we love you. Thank you so much for coming out here to DC. Thank you, brother. We're happy to have you every time. So keep coming back, please. I want to address, you know, actually pretty much what you opened with and something you kind of alluded to with Abby, this tendency we have towards, in some direction, at least towards the greater good, towards kindness and towards love, towards doing the right thing and towards alleviating suffering. Do you think that this is, this is just an opinion, obviously, but do you think this is a result of an external force? Or do you think that this is an emergent quality of the collective human consciousness? Great question. First of all, it's so funny if I just answer that, like I know. Let me tell you, when I plan this whole thing, here's what I thought we'd do. Well, first of all, I think the external versus internal question is a question a lot of people have, especially when they take a psychedelic, for example. You take a psychedelic and you think to yourself, these visions that I'm seeing in my mind, there's no way that I'm producing this. Like I feel like I'm looking at a thing that I just haven't been able to see before. And so you can go on and on and on with that question. You know, is it inside of me and it's producing this? Is it outside of me and it's producing this? But the real question is, where do you stop and where does the outside start? That's a real big question. Where do you, where does the thing you're calling the internal stop and the external start? And that's a question that comes up in Buddhism, right, in the very start of Buddhism. It's just like, where do you think you are in that body of yours? Like, where do you think you're in, where, what part of your body is yourself, right? So when you think about that at all, you realize like, shit, man, I can't, I don't know where I am in my body. Like I don't seem to be anywhere in my body at all. And then you realize, oh, the idea that I am a thing is the illusion, right? And the idea that there's an internal and the external is an illusion. There is no internal, there is no external. There's just this one thing that's happening and this one thing that's happening is fairly incomprehensible. We don't know what it is. We call it a universe. We call it a boundary-less expansion that has within it the sum total of all matter and thought and ideas and everything exploding into time and it's erupted from some singularity that we call the big bang. That's what we call this thing that we're in, but we really don't understand what it is at all. So this compulsion to love, it really to me doesn't matter if it's an external or an internal. All that matters is the realization that it exists, that here in this great totality of everythingness that we inhabit, this totality of everythingness that we get to exist within is this one little temporary transient moat of phenomena that we call our human life or our human body. We know for certain that love exists. Love is real. It is here and it is happening and that in every single moment, we get the chance to express that phenomena into the universe and spread it and watch what happens when you do that. It's pretty incredible. That's beautiful. Don't get, thank you so much. Please come back as soon as you can, all right? I will for sure. So my question's kind of shallow compared to those. Cool. One of my favorite episodes of your podcast and probably any podcast I've listened to is your interview a couple of years ago with Father John Misty. Okay, thank you. I just wanted to know what you thought of his new album. Oh man, I'm glad you asked. Yeah, he's got a new album. I thought it was really good, man. Yeah, I thought it was incredible, man. It's like, and really, it's like, I think you're seeing kind of the evolution of that artist happening in relation to finding love because that album is all about, he's married now and he found his one true soulmate at least for now and like, so when you listen to that album, you're hearing the way that that's, well guys, nothing lasts. I want it to be forever, but it doesn't, nothing lasts. Like maybe for his entire life this lasts. I don't know, but when I, but so in this moment of time, he's experiencing this like love with another person and you can see the way that it shaped his music and I love the way it sounds. So it's a great album. Do you think you'll have him back any time? I'd love to, yeah. I need to, you know, he's gotten so famous now and he's like, you know, he's a big rock star now. So, and I've kind of like added him on Twitter and there hasn't been a response. So I think, well, I don't want to bug him. You know, he's super famous now. I don't know, but I'd love to have him back. By the way, that was one of my, I can't talk about it because if I tell you what happened before the interview, I have to like go back and edit this podcast and delete it and I'll forget and then I won't, but it was a cool interview. Story for after the show? Yes, after the show. Cause after the show, I say goodbye to everybody. So I'll tell you after the show. Okay, cool. Awesome. Thanks for the question. Sup, Duncan. We love you. Love you back. If you could get any guest on your podcast, like living, dead, real fictitious, anybody from Alistair Crowley to fucking Winnie the Pooh. Who would it be? Oh shit. Definitely not Winnie the Pooh. Like even if he was alive today, I would never reach out. What's he gonna say? Like he likes honey. He's confused. Not Tesla. He's cool though, but like I think he'd be awkward in an interview situation. Who would you, who would you have? If you could interview anybody, who would it be? If you could have any guest on your podcast? Jesus, man. Jesus is pretty good. Yeah. Jesus is great. You'd just be like, look at what they fucking did, man. What's their name? What do you think about that? I'd be like, can you get my ball back? Like after the, after the interview, I'd go, I know I don't need it, but it'd be nice. I kind of like hint at it a little bit. Like, oh, you know, I got one ball. And then he would be like, no, I can't. Cause I'm not a fucking God. I'm just a man. Boom. No, I, you know, I think Jesus is up there. Uh, I think Alex Jones, not Alex shit. No, Terrence, Terrence, Terrence, make it a, Terrence, make it a be cool. You know what? I'm going to be really cheesy here and I'm going to answer your question. Honestly. Oh God, it's so cheesy. Forgive me, you guys. My mom, I'd have my mom back on. That was like, that was like the best episode ever. That was really good. Thank you. I love to ask her. So what happened? Like, where are you now? What's, what's going on with where you're at? Cause I think she'd have a lot of really cool answers to that question, but yeah, thanks for the question. Cool question, man. Peace. Thank you. Thank you. Alrighty, first off, I just want to thank you guys for your honesty and your opinions and having the courage to come up here and talk about the things you've talked about. Thank you. I managed to narrow down my thoughts to two things that I want to bring up tonight. After three pictures of beer, if you can imagine. Great. It's not that easy. All right. I managed to narrow my thoughts to two things. My first one is something my grandma told me when I was young and she said, love is quiet. It's silent and war is loud. Wow. Okay. So I want to make sure that everyone knows that there's a lot of fucked up shit going on out there and you don't, you don't have to pay attention to it because love is going to be quiet and it's going to be silent. And you have to make that the bigger portion of your life and of our existence as human beings in general. The second thing I wanted to bring up is essentially just a simple fact that we all have the opportunity of making a change in what our life is today. Whether it's political or whether it is emotional or work or whatever. Today, everyone, more than a question is a challenge for everyone to go home tonight, get on your Facebook, get on your Twitter and do something positive with it because you can reach masses like no one else has the chance to reach out before. This generation has the ability to reach masses quicker and in larger amounts than anyone else in America before and in our lives before because we have the internet, we have Twitter, we have Facebook, we have Instagram. Go home and do something positive, retweet something beautiful, something that encourage people to be positive, that encourages our generation to be for the better. Don't repose some stupid bullshit about someone getting drunk and passing out in public. I don't care about that. I can see it. I can go out to the bar up the street and see that on my own. Can you guys tweet when you go home tonight if you want to do something positive for the universe? Tweet at Brendon Walsh. I love you. Just do that, nothing else. Please, please, please just do that because it will freak him out so much. It'll be so awesome. All right, but lastly, we all came here tonight willingly. No one forced you to be here on this audience tonight. We are looking for a way to change, a way to change our lives. You don't have to look anywhere but yourself. Get on your phone, get on your email, reach out to the people that matters and make the change happen yourself. Thank you so much. Give her a round of applause. How beautiful. Thank you so much. Hi. Hey, so listening to you from the beginning with Lavender Hour and up until now, I think we've all noticed that you've gone through an amazing spiritual growth and really opened up a lot. Have you experienced any connection with, a metaphysical connection with ailments, sickness, stuff like that, particularly maybe with what you went through with cancer or with your mom and how your mindset may have affected. From the loss? Well, just how your mind can have such drastic effects on your body and how, I mean, personally, I think that there's a huge metaphysical connection between your mind and the emotions you hold onto and how they manifest physically. I know what you're saying. Yeah, you know, the hard Krishna's say something, a long time ago, I heard this devotee, the hard Krishna, it's a practice of bhakti yoga and it's a really cool, but it's like, I know there's a lot of stigma attached to it, but it's a very deep and beautiful path that has a lot, the hard Krishna's or ISKCON is just one tiny piece of what bhakti yoga really is, but there was something, one of those guys told me once that I didn't quite understand until getting cancer, my mom died. One of the things they said is, when you experience tragedy in your life, this is the mercy of Krishna. And I never understood that, like, what the fuck does that mean? My Krishna's an asshole then, because why is that merciful? But what happens every time you lose something, whether it's your mom, a testicle, or more importantly, the naive delusion that you're gonna live forever and the people around you are gonna be around forever, anytime you get that kind of teaching, what ends up happening is your attachment to your body, your attachment to the concept of this thing that we're currently in, being around forever, it loosens a little bit, it loosens and loosens and loosens and loosens, and ultimately, that is a great way to ease the suffering that you experience in this world, because if you get caught up in the idea that you're your body, which most of us are caught up in, this is me, man, I'm this fucking weird thing with arms and legs, and this is me, you get so caught up in that, the more caught up you get in that thing, the more you're gonna suffer, and the more that you experience loss, the more that you're getting caught up in that thing, gets kind of cut away by the universe. I actually thought this really weird idea, which is the universe is actually, the dimension that we're in is a healing machine that cures us of the disease of life, that we're being like, that we're the universe that is like a dolphin has gotten caught in the net of selfness, and that this dimension that we're in is gradually snipping away that net so that we can go back to exist is what we really are, which is the sum total of all things. So thanks for the question. Thank you. Thank you. It's trippy and weird. First of all, thanks for the talk, I think it's really awesome, good ideas going when you were talking, I thought you had a lot of great ideas. Thanks. I had a thought, kind of like a brief moment of clarity when you mentioned something, and I wanted to bring it up, and I hope I can convey it correctly. It might sound like utter bullshit, but 15 minutes ago it made sense to me, so I'm gonna try and convey it correctly. That's how I do everything, Fred. Right here. So when you were talking about this perspective they, you know, whatever structure of government or that's doing all this evil or doing, or has this structure that is essentially ruling the world or driving this workforce, and you were saying, and you mentioned that, essentially they're just, they're not bad people, but they're people who think that what they're doing is right. For a second I thought, for us to basically be activists and try to either expose the truth of whatever conspiracy they're making, or essentially dismantle that structure, aren't we essentially the same as those people? But just with less power? I mean, tying back to the fact that we're all gonna die, I'm thinking that, hey, you know, maybe exposing this truth or dismantling this form of government, maybe that's not really the best for us. Aren't we thinking that we know what's best for the greater good in the world? Maybe we could be expediting our own demise. But I think that when you, but people are suffering and dying because of their ideology, not the ideology that we wanna put forward, so I think that- Can you say that again? I mean, I think- People are suffering and dying in mass because of what these people think is the right ideology to enforce and the right policies to enforce, so I think that you can look at people suffering and dying because of policies that are actually perpetuated by our tax dollars, then you can say that's wrong, and I think that that's like a universal truth. That is true, but essentially in any scenario and any structure of government or any system that we employ, there's always gonna be people suffering and always gonna be people dying. But dude, we have the capacity to not make people suffer. I mean, the resources, the money, the ability, the technology, the intelligence to not let people and suffer and die. So if that makes me fucking right, like, I mean, yeah, I think I'm fucking right saying that. And also, and I think it's better than what they think. The thing you just said, which it's an idea that I've heard before, and I think the idea is best summed up in a cartoon, a political cartoon I saw, which depicts like the statue of some tyrant being pushed over by revolutionaries, but the statue is kind of emerging from a pinwheel underground and a new statue swings around and gets put up in its place. So what you're saying is that idea, which is that all revolutions inevitably lead to just more tyranny. I don't think that that's a truth. I don't think that that necessarily has to be the case, like what you're saying, because those ideas of like, here's the way things have always been, here's the way they always will be, they are generally not aware of Kurzweil's idea of accelerating returns, which is that we're existing in a time period that is not going to be the way it always has been because we have the capacity to use technology and to use innovation in the connective power of the internet and the general connective tendency of technology to possibly, if not eradicate, reduce so much suffering in the world and that a lot of the people that we're theoretically fighting against, these are the people who are getting in the way of that process. And what's beautiful, sorry, is that we're on the cusp of something beautiful that has never existed before in time, that we have the world's knowledge at our fingertips, that we don't just need to use to argue with strangers and look at cat photos. Like we have this amazing technology that the old guard holds onto these ideologies and systems of control and we have the ability for the first time in our lives because of the internet and because of this universal access to people that we can move forward beyond those systems of control and build our own decentralized system. I wanna believe that, but I feel like that's kind of an ideology that'll really just keep us going and it's just another reason to just live. I feel like if what I was saying was true and everybody accepted it, there would really be no purpose to carry on on the daily activities. There'd be nothing to really believe in, nothing to really fight for. I feel like that's something that's the human condition that we need to believe so that we feel like we have a purpose. Oh, I love it. You're like Camus, you're an existentialist brother. I love it. It's really beautiful and sweet and it's scary what you're saying. I don't know. It might be real. It might be real. What you're saying might be real. But why not trying? Yeah, give it a shot. In the face of absurdity, you just, you know man, God forgive me. I'm gonna, before I say this little thing, I'm sorry you guys. I have time for one, two, three, four more people, because the venue, and then I'm gonna say goodbye to everybody. I come outside and hang out. So one, four more people after you. I just wanna tell this quick story based on what you're saying. And it's a story that comes from the father of existential psychology, Victor Frankel. And he's got a great book that you should check out called Man's Search for Meaning. And this, it's a great book. All of you should read it. You know this book, Man's Search for, oh God, it's one of my, it's such an incredible book, but so this guy is a psychologist and he gets taken to Auschwitz and all of his research gets taken away. His family gets stripped away from him. And he is a psychologist watching what's going on in a concentration camp, right? And, you know, he's just watching the way that, you know, the way that some people give up in the face of oblivion. Because really, if you're in a concentration camp, it's, you're done pretty much. Forget it, you're done. Your family, and even if you're not done, your family's been killed. Everything you've known has been destroyed. You're kind of mentally, like mentally, your life has changed so much. There's not much left to live for. So he talked about how certain people would, you always knew somebody was gonna die because you'd see him smoking cigarettes, which means that they'd swap their food for cigarettes. So you'd see him like in the mud smoking and you're like, yeah, they're gonna die. And he talks about how he's on a death, he's on, they would march the prisoners to go do work. And he's on this march in the winter and he slips and he falls. And as he's laying there, this guard starts slamming his head with a butt of his rifle. And he's seen the guard do this before and he kills people this way. Because really, they don't care. If you're not able to work, they're just gonna kill you. They don't have to feed you anymore. It's, it makes economic sense. So he's like slamming Victor Frankel's head with a butt of his rifle. And Victor Frankel, while this is happening, has a vision. In his mind, he pictures himself giving a lecture to students. And in this lecture, he's talking about how, in this moment of having his head beaten in with a butt of this Nazi's fucking rifle, that he realized that if he can survive this, if he can use the sheer force of his will to survive in the face of complete oblivion, if he can find meaning even in the depths of darkness that he was in right there, that he could then teach the world how to find meaning in this darkness and help bring so much happiness and he's suffering in the world. And he fucking got up, man. He got up and he gave that very lecture to a group of students and that thing that he envisioned happened. So if Victor Frankel, in the midst of pure absurd oblivion, can find a reason to live or find a reason to do good things, I think you could figure it out too. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks for the question. Thank you. Thank you. This is too high. Sorry. Abby, I think you said something really important earlier and that's that a lot of the violence that goes on here, not here, a lot of the violence that goes on the world is not motivated by or enabled by maliciousness, right? And I wanted to offer a little bit of insight in that maybe you can comment on that afterwards, sure. I went through seven years of really rough graduate school and at the end of it, I knew a lot of physicists and mathematicians, PhDs, and I had an option of where was I gonna go to work? And I could continue in that academia and make something approaching assistant manager and retail or, and I know lots of people who chose this path, make three times that amount and go work for Raytheon, go work for Lockheed Martin, go work for the NSA, go work for NGIC. And these are sweet people and they just looked at, well, how much am I gonna make? And they're not making, a lot of them aren't making weapons, they're not doing stuff that's directly applicable to killing people. Yeah, they're compartmentalized and yeah. Right, but they're working for companies that benefit from people dying and they make more money when people die and they're supporting an industry that makes money from death. And these are some of the smartest people in the country and this is the choice they're faced with and that's like, what are you gonna do? Like, it's a brain drain because of economic incentive and less, you know, Google's sort of like a godsend, like they're offering lots of money for smart people to do things that aren't violent but outside of that, where are these people gonna work because there's not enough room in academia and I don't know what the options are. What did you do? What was your decision? I'm working for a salary that's approaching assistant manager at retail and I will sweep floors or sort shit before I work towards something that contributes to violence. But, you know, that's what we're faced with. That's what we're faced with. And, you know, I want people to realize that all the violence that goes on, the people behind it aren't necessarily being malicious. They're making a choice that's not necessarily directly related to what actually happens. And so, you know, like this consciousness raising, like you talked about, is what has to happen to see past that just strictly economic decision. Right, well, I mean, that's why I think we need a new economic model because I think that the system rewards people who are the most sycophantic, sociopathic, like bottom dwellers, and I'm not saying your friends are that took those jobs, I'm just saying that's what it rewards, you know? I mean, you have social care workers, home care workers who are treated like shit, they're paid nothing, but that's what they do because they know it's like good and they're helping people and we're in a moral quandary right now, you know? I mean, I had to work for Russia today to tell the truth. I mean, that's not an ideal situation, you know what I mean? Like that's all the decisions that we have to make, but at the same time, I had to quit because I cared more about my moral integrity than working for something that I didn't actually like believe in the whole systems that allowed that platform. So I think that when you're looking at like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, I think, I mean, yeah, it's sad. A lot of altruistic people who are good mean and good nature get into these systems because they're compartmentalized and they're working on this and that and they don't understand that they're actually building weapons to kill people and that's just gonna come with time, man, but I think that it has to come with building something that's an alternative and building the options and opportunities for people to use and use their utilities and their intelligence to something towards good. And they exist today. It's just that you're not gonna get $150,000 to do it, but we'll get there. We'll get there. And also, man, one thing that's, I think, an interesting part of the conditioning that we all have is the concept of having to have a boss like that idea, like you need someone to work for. But, and that idea is an antiquated idea because if you look at the resources that you have right now at your command that are just essentially free, you know, you have access to so much that you could use to make money if you wanted to. It makes me think of the idea is I heard this great, God damn it, I'm trying to think of which guest on my podcast said this, damn it. Ah, God, damn it, four hour work week. Why can't I remember his name right? Ferris, Ferris, I'm so sorry. Forgive me, this is what he said. He said the most successful people that he knows ask the right questions. They ask the right questions. And he said, imagine this, imagine if I hired a hitman, like for some weird reason I had shit tons of money and I'm just some weirdo and right now on stage I told you, listen, I'm hiring a hitman. And if in the next month you haven't figured out a way to on your own make the same salary, you would have made it Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or any of these doom companies, he's gonna kill you. There's nothing that you can do to stop it in a month, you have a month to figure out how to make that salary on your own, I guarantee you'd start asking the right fucking questions, right? And you'd figure it out and you'd do it because you're a smart person and you're a person that those people wanna hire instead of hiring you for you to ask the questions, they wanna hire you to answer their questions. And their questions are, how do we kill people more efficiently, do you know how? So ask yourself the own question, like how do I generate this kind of income minus working for Dracula and I think you'll get the answer. You know what, I just read this study that said $80,000 or $75,000 is the ideal income to be happy and anything more than that is just kind of satisfaction where you can put shit away in the Cayman Islands or this and that, but I think that once you realize that life is not about money, but happiness is not about money and you don't need to sell your soul to work for Raytheon to be happy, because happiness is love and it's about just being with people that inspire you. Yeah, thank you guys for what you do. Thank you, thanks. One last thing, the real takeaway I wanted to say is violence is not always motivated by maliciousness. Absolutely, man, and that's good to know. Great, thank you so much. Thank you. Hey Duncan, how are you doing? Great, how are you? I'm excellent, I'm a little fucked up. So am I. I just want to say that I love you a lot. I've been following the Duncan Trunkin'- Trussell, I have problems saying it sometimes too. I started off with Joe Rook and Experience and then I really said you're the best guest on the show and I was like- Thank you. What the fuck is Duncan Trussell? Oh my God, hold shit, like you're amazing, man. Thank you. And I just want to preface this. My name is Mark David Gillan and I've been, I was born into a devout Christian family. My mother and my father did not have sex till they were married. They didn't drink, smoke, anything like that. They're a very devout Christian family and I was born into that and I'm one of three boys, male children and I was born into a family where I was supposed to be a Bible thumping Christian person and I was brought up into it until I reached the right age of reason around 18, 19 and you inspired me to, like I'm a whimsical person. I'm not an Excel, I'm not, listen to me, listen to me. I'm not an Excel spreadsheet. I'm a flute, I'm a guitar solo. I'm a whimsical fucking person. I, listen to me, Duncan Trussell, I want to tell you, I love you so much. God bless you, whatever mystical deity there is in this realm, God bless you, God bless you. And Joe Rogan, you've radically, listen to me, you have radically fucking changed my life. At the age of 21, I delved into the shamanistic practice of psychedelic drugs and it's radically changed my life. I love you. Now listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. You have inspired me to write stand-up, you have inspired me to paint, you have inspired me to be a whimsical fucking poet. I'm telling you, God bless you, listen to me, listen to me. All right, I'm fucked up, I'm fucked up, listen to me. All right, all right, I have delved into psychedelic drugs. I've done nine grams of psilocybin mushrooms on an empty stomach. I'm telling you, man, I've talked to Gaia, I've gone past, I've glitched off the map, video game terms, I've glitched off the map and I'm gone. Now listen to me, from a Christian standpoint, I can contextualize all of this because I was raised in a Christian home and it seems like there's an upside, there's a right side up cross, there's the deity, there's the trinity, there's the Holy Spirit, there's the Alpha, the Omega, it seems like there's a biblical light and there's a biblical darkness. That's what I've realized from my experience with psychedelic drugs. Now I'm telling you this, I've tripped on Adderall and 4.5 grams of psilocybin mushrooms on the beach and the fucking Sobek came up to me and looked at me right in the fucking face. I was like, oh my God. Wait, what, look to you? The Egyptian God, the mystical demon Sobek looked me right in the fucking face. Oh, Sobek. Sobek, the Eye of Horus, the serious, the serious, the dog star looked me right in the fucking face. Okay, okay, I got it. Well here, can I inspire you? I want you to address this. Can I inspire you? I want you to address this. I'm gonna address it. And I'm gonna, and you have to do what I say. Oh, no, no. Your turn to speak. Based on everything you just said, you have to do what I say, right? I'm listening to you right now, sir. Say I'll do what you say. I'm a student right now. Okay, student. Here's what I want you to do. Please, I'm begging you. Start your own podcast. Yes! Great. And that's it. You're a very passionate person. Fuck yeah. And you've got a lot of charisma. And I don't know what could happen, but I do think that we have this medium accessible to all of us. Everyone here should do it. It's so fun to do. Get a recorder. Get some friends together. Talk about your visions. Talk about Sobek and put that out into the world because it's definitely entertaining and engrossing. Don't get done. Listen to me right now. I love you. You're a fucking artist. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Everything you put to do it is onto the, this is like the final shit, final product. The sum total of your life, everything that you put your hand to make it be the sum total of your life, just put it. Fucking put it out into the realm and everybody listening, just fucking insert it into their fucking consciousness. Thank you, brother. Thanks for the question. Thank you so much. God bless. Thank you. Hi. Hi. He's a little hard to follow. But so I actually have a little bit of a similar story to him. I was raised in the Bible Belt with a very Christian mother. Wonderful mother. I love her, but very Christian. And so I was actually turned on to you, but my boyfriend, he was a big Joe Rogan follower and then came, he was like, Duncan Charles is amazing. You have to listen to him. And I think it was about a year and a half ago, two years ago, you did one of your opening rants. And I think it was in some way, you were talking about, what if a creator, what if we're all doing a program and it's just, we've all been programmed. It's like a video game. So like something about that clicked to me in some weird way, maybe it was the Christian way I was raised and the woman I was supposed to be, it changed everything for me. So thank you for what you do. It means a lot to me. Thank you. I also, now that you're back, I have a second question for you. So conspiracy theories just kind of crack me up. I like to read about them. So when you were talking about Clinton, or not Clinton, the Bush administration in 9-11, it's like, do you really think the Bushes were smart enough to do that? I made it pretty clear that I don't think that they were. I don't think that 9-11 was orchestrated by Bush. So I think that that's what people degenerate into is that they hear like everything about 9-11 is like, oh, they think that Bush orchestrated it. No, there's many, many things that are documented that should raise questions for all of us, including the 28 pages thing, to prove that we were lied to. At the very least, like we were lied to, that's completely obvious. It's not a conspiracy theory. The government, we're probably lied to a lot, but. Right, but we're lied to about a government that was involved in it, that we're allies with. Isn't that concerning? I know, I think it's concerning. What I got to was when, some people do think that it was the Bushes that did it, and I just don't think they're that smart. I don't think they could pull something like that off. Right, I don't either. Well, I think one thing really smart people do is make people think they're not that smart. That's a one method, that's a one definite like smart form of camouflage. It's like really, really, really smart people have realized that if people think you're smart, the next thing they're gonna do is arrest you. So they're like, let's make them think we're idiots, and we can get away with anything. So who knows? I don't know if that's really the case. But to address the Christian fundamentalist thing, which I hear a lot, one really rough thing about being raised to Christian fundamentalist is that you end up getting cut off from the Bible, because what ends up happening is your revolution, your personal revolution, means fighting back against your parents or fighting back against those power structures, and you abandon the whole fucking thing. A lot of people who are raised in fundamentalist Christian families become devout atheists because they've associated the Bible or the word Jesus or all the information in there. They've associated that with pain. It's no different than the experiments that they run on mice, where they take a mouse and they expose the mouse to any stimulus at all and electrocute the mouse, and then now the mouse is gonna be afraid of that thing forever. In the same way, you have this book, the Bible, a lot of different information sources sort of like shoved into this one fucking thing. You've got the Gospels, the Synoptic Gospels and the Book of John, that doesn't even represent the whole story of Jesus. There's a lot of other valid Gospels that didn't make it into the Bible. I'm sure you're aware of the Gospel of Thomas. Do you know the Gospel of Thomas where this is some psychedelic shit? Do you know about the Gospel of Thomas? It's amazing, but there's a lot of Gospels that didn't make it in there that talk about Jesus as a baby. They talk about the weird shit, like Jesus just killed somebody when he was a kid. He was getting bullied and he turned around and touched the bully and was like, see you later. That's not the exact verse, but he actually killed people. Like crazy shit, him playing with mud and making pigeons out of mud and bringing them to life. Like a lot of other incredible stories are there. So don't let your fundamentalist upbringing cut you off from the beauty of that story, whether it's real or not. It's like an incredible story that really is so sad and beautiful, which is the idea of someone who gave everything. It literally was like, I'm going to die. I'm just gonna let these people kill me to show how much I love everything in the world. It's a beautiful way to live. It doesn't matter if there was a real Jesus or not. That concept is so incredible and poignant. Take LSD, listen to Jesus Christ superstar, and you'll understand how beautiful the thing is. It's an incredible... Well, don't say it like that, man. Don't say take LSD like a Norwegian death metal guy. Take LSD! You don't have to take LSD, but revisit them in case you... Thank you for the question. Thanks. Hello. So disclaimer, I am a little bit lifted, so I'll try to articulate this as best as possible. Thank you. All right, so first off, thank both of y'all very much for what y'all are doing. Thank you. And specifically for you, Ms. Martin, I want to thank you for giving my friend, Marcel McCartier, a platform to express his personality. We went to college together in Mani and just seeing where he was in and where he is now is amazing. Thank you for giving another opportunity. And Mr. Trussell, I have a question for you. I'm getting ready for my first DMT experience. Okay. Cool. Now, first of all, by the way, I know that when you're saying that, you're saying it symbolically. You're not really taking DMT. It's a joke. Of course, of course. I will neither confirm nor deny that those kinds of things will happen. Right, but let's say you were. Let's say a friend of yours was. Hypothetical, hypothetical, right. I just wanted to get your perspective. What would you suggest to prepare for that Teres McKenna joint? What are you doing? Are you doing the death dose? Silent doctor? Or are you just doing like a normal dose? Well, I heard Teres McKenna talk about like 70 milligrams. Okay, so you're doing the death dose. All right. And then the three hits and silent doctors. Okay, first of all, here's the thing. The whole death dose thing are like, here's the thing. When you started drink, do you drink? I'm more of a smoker. But did you ever drink? Do you ever had a drink? Well, actually, I'm drinking yingling right now. Okay. So when you first started drinking, right? People weren't like, drink 50 shots of tequila. Get fucked up, man. People were like that. The first time I drank was in Mannheim, so that was the case. Okay, well, okay, right. But the thing about it is this, like, and I understand the death dose and I understand McKenna's idea of the heroic dose. And I think that there's something to be said for that. But I don't know why we have to, with our immediate contact with any substance, we have to take the highest dose possible to understand or experience it. I don't get that. I, it doesn't make sense to me. I say, it may be hard to find, but yeah, is it really? You know what's so interesting? Go on amazon.com and act like you're ordering Mamosa Hostelis. And then look at people also ordered and you'll see all the information about how to make TMT. It's like actually- I'm going through that right now, actually. But yeah, so, and I'm not saying manufacture an illegal drug. In fact, you should never do that at all. Of course, I do not promote drugs in any way. But I'm saying it, so yeah, maybe it's hard for you to find, but it's probably if someone wanted to, then you should never do it because it's illegal, but I bet it's not that hard to make. So, all that being said, and I don't, I would say the way to do it is with an attitude of respect, do it with an attitude of opening yourself up. You're doing this substance. So to prove. You're not doing it recreationally. You're doing it because you're trying to understand the universe that you're living in. And you've heard that people who have had contact with this substance have had heightened states of awareness that have taught them, right? That's why you're doing it. So the general recommendation when it comes to taking a psychedelic is you do it with some intention. Do it with people you love. Don't do it with a frenemy. A lot of people end up doing psychedelics with a frenemy, and that's a bad thing. Don't do it with a frenemy. And I think that if you wanna find some great advice about taking a psychedelic, you can actually, and guys, I really am not a Christian, so I'm sorry if I keep referring to the Bible, but you can go to the New Testament and look at the advice for taking communion, the idea for what to do when you're going into the temple of God, which is to forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. You forgive the people around you. Before you take this substance, make sure that any secrets that you have that you're holding onto that are toxic, that you've let go of them. You've let go of the secrets. You're not holding anything back. If you're hiding something from your friends or from your family, tell them what you've been hiding and tell them why you're telling them, because you wanna be a better person. Then once you've done all these things, some people say abstain from sex. I've never done that, but some people recommend don't like have sex for a few days before. The point is, make it a real event. Make it something real. Make and do certain sacrifices as you enter into that state. And then you'll have this incredible experience. And guess what? If you don't do those things, you're still gonna have an incredible experience. But so you could do it either way, but the time that I did it, I remember that the person I did it with is someone who'd been to the Amazon a lot. He said a prayer. He said that, he said this incredible prayer and said that he used all these symbols from the Amazon. He said be like the hummingbird. It can travel thousands of miles in a few days or be like the jaguar that eats. It's like a force of destruction or a force of destruction. And it eats the bones of its prey. May you use your darkness for sustenance. Eat the darkness. Transform your darkness into light. He said these beautiful prayers and it was really work. Like entering into that space with the same reverential attitude that people enter into the sacred space of temples. Take off your shoes, burn some incense. Here where you are standing is holy ground. That's what God said to Moses in the burning bush. By the way, the burning bush, what was it made of? You guys know? Acacia. And Acacia is in DMT. So if you enter into that state of reverence, I think that you can have a lot of great results. All right, cool. Thanks for the question. Do you mind if I get a photo real quick? Yeah, well, yeah, for sure. Yeah, you want to get a photo here? Okay, great. Let's do it. Well, if you're not in it, if you do that. Here, come here. Here, come on stage for a second. Here, I'll help you up. But I love you too. Here. Thanks, man. Aw. Here, take a look. There you go. Let's do it in front of the audience. This is gonna be really tricky. Wow, yo. Yeah, here, let's do it here. This is surreal, man. We got a black one, so I'm gonna put it in the DMT of my first allegedly. Did you get the picture? Yeah, I got a few. All right, great. There you go. Thank you so much. Guys, I'll hang out with all of you so we can get pictures after the show. Oh, are you okay? Okay, great. I'll be hanging out after the show so we can all get pictures of you guys. Abby Martin, everybody. Let her hear it. I'm so honored to be on stage, man. You want to talk a little bit?

Oh God, you've done it again, you've tuned into the Delta Trestle Family Hour Podcast. And this is a very special episode because today we're going to be talking about what happens when you die. Many people think many different things, but most people don't want to think about it at all. They want to pretend that they go on forever. They don't want to imagine themselves being incinerated in a cremator. What is a cremator? Today I traveled from my bedroom into my office to do a Skype phone conversation with one of the top most researchers in the near-death experience. In fact, he coined the term. We're going to have a conversation with Dr. Raymond Booney today. But first, the news. The hand-bellied lemur of Afghanistan has gone extinct. We'll also be looking into the Delhi strike happening in East Side Manhattan by the Meatpacking District. But most importantly, you're going to die and that thing you call your body, you're just going to turn into dust and everyone you know is going to die too. Coming up. And now a clip from Ram Dass' Experiments in Truth, available on Audible or at RamDass.org. It's not the physical death that's so scary. It's the psychological death. It's the ceasing to be who you think you are. The thread was held and I have been now with many people and just holding them as they die. And being right with them, looking in their eyes as the spirit just leaves, as they just leave and the last breath occurs and the eyes glaze over and the being just leaves. And there's just a release, an opening. Because by the time they got to that moment, they were no longer clinging to that which dies. Don't be silly, where could I go? There's no more clinging to that which dies. For who we are was, is, and will be. And these are just processes of transformation that we're going through. Just like it's very hard for a prepubescent to understand the time will come when his baseball cards aren't that relevant. So the time will come when even our mortal coil isn't that relevant. Friends, if you have ever been curious about what happens when you die, then this episode is for you. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. Friends, I don't need to tell you that you do the most important things in life on a mattress. You eat nachos on a mattress. You watch TV on a mattress. You freak out on a mattress. You make love on a mattress. You sleep on a mattress and more than likely, you're going to die on a mattress. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Casper.com. If you go to casper.com. You're going to get $50 towards a brand new mattress. Casper, it was one of Time magazine's top inventions of 2015. It's got just the right sink and just the right bounce. That means it's good for humping. It's an obsessively engineered mattress at a shockingly fair price. If you don't like the thing after 100 nights, you can send it back. You can try it for 100 nights, risk free. If you don't love it, they'll pick it up and refund you everything. It's made in America and there's free shipping and returns to the US and Canada. Most importantly, I sleep on a Casper mattress and I love it. I've slept on one for a couple of years. If you want to avoid the horror of going mattress shopping, just order the thing. It comes in a box. You cut it open and a mattress is born in your house. Throw some sheets on the thing, turn on the TV, lay back, and get ready to sleep. Because it's a great mattress. I love it. Casper.com, Ford slash family hour, use offer code family hour. If it doesn't please you, send it back, my liege, and go and purchase a mattress made of the finest hairs of a wildland unicorn. Casper.com, Ford slash family hour, offer code family hour. Friends, if you like the DTFH and you feel like chipping in, there's lots of ways for you to do that. One of the best ways is to go through our Amazon link. The next time you're going to buy something over at amazon.com. I just bought a Modbox cat litter box. This son of a bitch is pretty great. What it does is it lets the cat jump in through the top. So the filthy little white bastard that my wonderful girlfriend rescued from a shelter and I'm glad that she did, will no longer track his disgusting urine soaked cat litter throughout the house and onto our sheets. Now when he jumps out of the top of the box and walks off of the box, the cat litter falls back into the Modbox. You can get one of these things at amazon.com along with anything else. It actually doesn't matter what you get. If you go through our link, they give us a very small percentage of it and it helps support the DTFH. We also have a shop with lots of posters, t-shirts, stickers, et cetera. And if you want to come see me live, I got some dates coming up which are located at DuncanTrussell.com. I am going to be in San Francisco. I'm actually coming up there for the map psychedelic conference. So if you're going to that, maybe I will see you there. But I'm going to be doing some stand up on April 26th at the independent and I'm also going to be doing stand up at the Feral Audio Theater, the Harmon Theater. I don't know they're calling this thing, but I'm going to be doing stand up in LA. If you want to come to that, it's going to be on Thursday, April 27th at 8 o'clock. That's at Starburn's Castle. That's what they're calling it in Burbank. So I hope you guys will come to that show too. I'm really interested in seeing what this new Feral Audio Theater looks like. Come to one of these shows. I'm also doing regular shows now at the Bell House live podcasts. The next one's going to be on May 16th. All these tickets as well as all the nights that I'm just doing like 15 minute sets around town in New York are at DuncanTrussell.com. I'd love it if you would come out to see a show. Today's guest is the author of one of the most famous books on near death experiences out there. It's called Life After Life. He's a philosopher. He's a psychologist, a physician. And what's really interesting, if you have been listening to each episode, you know that I just had a long conversation with Jason Louvre about John Dee and gazing into mirrors to communicate with spirits. And as it turns out, Dr. Moody has in Alabama, something called the Theater of the Dr. John Dee Theater of the Mind, which is a psycho mantium, a place where you can gaze into mirrors and connect with spirits. He is an incredibly fascinating person. And if you want to see him live, you can. He's going to be at the Bell House in Brooklyn. I've been doing my live podcasts with Alex Gray, and they're going to be talking about near death experiences and the afterlife. That's April 13th at the Bell House in Brooklyn. I'm going to be in the audience. I hope you'll come out and see the show. All right, guys, let's do it. Everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast, the author of Life After Life, Dr. Raymond Moody. It's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us today. Welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast. Welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast. Welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast. Thank you so much for joining us today. Well, thank you very much for having me on your program. You are the preeminent researcher of the near-death experience. You have come into contact with thousands of people who report, I guess what you could call a pattern after they are clinically dead. And I was wondering if we could just start off with you describing what that pattern is. Well, basically, there are about 15 common elements that recur in near-death experiences. And one experience may have two or three or four of these things, or seven or eight or 10 or 11 or some, especially in cases where the cardiac arrest was very lengthy, they even have the entire picture of 15 elements. But as to the more common elements, what people tell us is that they will say that at this point where their heart stops beating, they very often report hearing their doctor or somebody else's presence say, oh my God, he's dead or we've lost her or words to that effect, which is very surprising to them because one thing I've heard from people all over the world repeatedly is the same sort of idea people say that when they hear their doctor say that they're dead, as one man told me, he said, I've never felt so alive as when I heard that doctor say I was dead. Because actually people say that at this point where their heart stops beating, it's not like, as you might imagine, that you enter into a dreamlike state, but rather people say that everything is hyperreal and that compared to the state of consciousness when they enter at this point where they seem to die, that ordinary waking experience seems very dreamlike in comparison. People say they enter into an extraordinarily vivid hyperreal state and they tell us that they seem to slip out of their bodies, they very often rise up above and typically from a point of view right below the ceiling, they can see on the table down below their body, which incidentally they might not necessarily recognize. You think that we know what we look like because of photographs and mirrors and so on, but people say actually this is very startling because your body doesn't look exactly like what you imagine it does. And in this hyperreal state as they look down from above, they say they can see the doctor or nurse or other people present and they can understand what the doctor or nurse are communicating to one another. Typically not in the sense of an auditory voice, but it's more as though they can understand heart to heart or mind to mind what the doctor or nurse are saying. But when they try to communicate in turn, when they try to ask the doctor, how can it be that I'm out of my body up here looking at you down there, no one seems to be able to hear them or to see them. If they try to touch the doctor or nurse to get their attention, they find that they go right through instead of making physical contact. Are they scared? Are they scared? That sounds terrifying. No, actually people say to the contrary that they feel complete peace. And at a certain point as they think of this, they say they become at some point aware that this must be what we call death. And at that point they tell us they enter into a state of consciousness that no matter how articulate they may be, or however many languages they speak, that they say they simply cannot describe it, that it really lies beyond our ability to put it into words. But nonetheless they try and very typically, what they tell us is that they enter through a tunnel of sort, a narrow passageway, I've heard it called a hallway, or a tube, or an illuminated passageway. And they come out on the other side into this incredibly brilliant and warm and loving light. And they see this light sort of permeates everything. And in that light very often they tell us that relatives or friends of theirs who've already died seem to be there almost in the role of a greeting committee. And that they see their departed relatives and loved ones there, not exactly in physical form, but they say it is a sort of form, it's a shape, but it's not a physical matter. But they become aware of who these people are because they have the feelings and the memories and so on in the sense of a personal presence. As this develops, they say that there's kind of a switch goes off and they find that they are surrounded by a sort of holographic review of every single thing they've ever done in their lives. And they say this experience takes place in timelessness. That no time passes is a timeless state. And yet when they relate it to us or try to narrate it to us, they have to describe it as a sequence because language is sequential. But they say in the experiencing of it, it's not a sequence. Everything is there at once. And they say that you can see every single action you've ever done and that when you do, however, you don't review the action you did through the eyes you had when you were doing it. Rather, you assume the position of the individual with whom you've interacted. So if you see yourself doing a mean-spirited thing to somebody else, then you feel the sadness you brought about in that person's life. Or if you see yourself doing a kind-hearted action, then you feel the good feelings you brought about. Now, at some point everybody says, obviously, that I've talked to anyway, has to come back. Some people tell us they have no idea how they got back. At one moment they were there in this light. The next moment they found themselves back in the hospital in the operating room with no sense of transition. Other people tell us that they were told they had to go back, perhaps by one of their departed relatives or a sort of presence of light. Then a third group were given a choice. They say that they can either choose to go back to the life they had been leading or to continue in the light. And interestingly, almost everybody says that personally, they would rather have stayed in the light, but they choose to go back. And it's most commonly because they have young children left to raise, which is certainly something I can understand very well, having an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old. They are pretty much the only reason I'm staying around here. I understand that because being 72, I'm ready to go at any time except it'd be great to be able to stay with my kids for a while. And when they come back from this, they tell us that their lives have been transformed. They have no more fear of death because from their point of view, what they experienced was a life hereafter. And they tell us that whatever they had been chasing or pursuing before, whether power or money or fame or knowledge is in my case, that what they feel that the important thing we can do in life is to learn how to love. And that is a very typical kind of scenario for in your death experience. What do you think that light is that everyone reports? Well, I accept what people tell me that it really is, it's not something we can describe in words, that it lies beyond our ability to comprehend it and the state of existence that we're in now. But what people tell me is the closest word you can have for it is love. It's just like this palpable love that is so far beyond anything we've ever experienced while we're alive. And it's also information. Now, I should point out here that people say that this experience does not take place in space, as you and I experience space, and it's not a temporal experience. It's neither temporal nor spatial because everything is happening at once. It's not a matter of sequence or time duration. And that if, for example, you want to see something which is at a distance, you just think about it and zap, all of a sudden there it is manifest in front of you. So it's an informational state as well where people say that knowledge is sort of instantly accessible to you. So this field of loving data, I mean, is that God? Do people just think of that as that must be the creative force or the Godhead? Yeah, a lot of people say God. And with that word, Godhead, it shows you are interested in mysticism. And yes, in a way, this is what William James would count for sure as a mystical experience in the sense that it imparts knowledge and also that it's ineffable or indescribable. And also as William James said that a mystical experience is passively received, and he said, for example, you can induce a mystical state by chanting or isolating yourself for all these other things. But once it starts that you receive it passively, you're just sort of a spectator or swept up in it. And also that it's transient by definition. I mean, this doesn't last very long by definition. People come back here. So yes, they do use the word God or Christ sometimes or an angel. I've heard people say like a divine being, like an angelic being. The thing that this obviously anyone who's living today wants to hear this because one of the great terrors of existence is the end of existence. And what's really fascinating to me is how little it's studied. You've spent a lifetime studying this. There are researchers who are looking into this, but you would think it's one of the most important questions. Or I don't know, maybe the least because we're just supposed to deal with this thing here. But what I wanted to address as quickly as possible because I don't know what the point is of spending too much time on it. We do have these studies from the University of Michigan, the EEG activity in rat brains after they died. Most recently, the University of Ontario detected Delta spikes in a brain 10 minutes after death. And there seems to be some correlation between cardiac arrest and this kind of like intense brain activity, which seems to indicate some kind of sentience or consciousness after clinical death. What do you think about that? I know you've been asked this question a million times. I've seen people ask you this in interviews, but I have to ask it. Isn't it just a hallucination? Well, I would say absolutely it's not. And in terms of the neurophysiological things you're talking about, you know, we live in an age of scientism, right? That is people who are perhaps very accomplished at science, but who sort of take that as their religion and to use that word or their ideological system. And I am a medical doctor and psychiatrist, so I can talk that way. But I also understand before I went to medical school, I got a PhD in philosophy, which we can't require people who do the neurosciences or psychiatry or neurology to become a philosopher before they do all this stuff because that would just take too much time. But that's what I did and what I will tell you from that point of view. This is still a philosophical question. Now, it's very pleasant for a certain sort of mind to try to reduce consciousness to electrochemical reactions that the brain matter. And of course, they have to do that. It's this kind of psychological thing that they need to hold on to because incredibly to me, so many people are just terrified to say three simple words that come very easily off of my tongue, which is I don't know. But I think the theory you're talking about there is what's called epiphenomenalism, which is a philosophical point of view, which is that there is no independent reality to consciousness, but rather what is called consciousness is the secondary sort of unreal byproduct of the primary reality of the brain substance and so on. Now, what is difficult with that is that identically this same phenomenon, which we call the near-death experience, also occurs very frequently and people who are not ill are injured. Your brains are not compromised, but what's happening to them is that they happen to be at a location, say, beside somebody else who is dying in a bed, for example. And the shared-death experiences, which are identical in content and probably even more common than near-death experiences, occur to people who are not ill or injured. And so obviously some other factor or factor than a chemical discharge in the brain occasioned by the stress of death is involved. Another thing about that word hallucination, my dad was a medical doctor. I grew up around medical doctors. A lot of my friends are medical doctors. I am a medical doctor. And I will just tell you this. To import that term hallucination, which is a clinical term that I have to use and practice and so on, to try to solve the epistemological problem of whether these experiences are real or not is simply reasoning in a circle. It just means these people haven't thought this out very much. Because when I see a patient, for example, seeing patients in the ER, I go in and I see their eyes tracking motions when I don't see anything in the room or you seem to see them listening to something as though there's... That's hallucination. But the reason I introduced that term is nothing to do with solving an epistemological problem. It's to go through a diagnostic process where I determine what's wrong with this person and what I can do for them. To import that clinical term into try to solve the epistemological term of whether these experiences are real or not is just ludicrous. And it's a way of getting away from reality, in my opinion. And there's a real problem here. I mean, if millions and millions of people who come close to death and who articulate and who are doing very well, very functional people, tell us they have these experiences and that they are convinced it's real, it doesn't follow from that that it is real, but it also follows... But it does follow from that that we're just not in a position to be able to solve that question with introducing the clinical term of hallucination. It's a lot more difficult than that. I agree with that. And I think what a really important consideration is the experience of being near someone when they're dying. And all the things that happened during that, which are so difficult to explain, I've seen it with... I used to work at a... I volunteered at a hospice a little bit. Yeah, yeah, good, good, good. You see the... I remember this wonderful woman who was dying of Alzheimer's disease and I was there with her a few hours before she passed. And I remember, maybe you know something about this, but it was the strangest thing to watch because you could watch her kind of surrendering to what was happening and every time she surrendered to it, and let me guess that she lit up with a light. Yes, yes, that's it exactly. That is just so astonishing. Wow, that's it. Your guess is as good as mine, Duncan. I don't know. The whole room lit up. I've seen it so many times and it's like they become hyper-conscious, right? It's like sometimes even people in a diminished state or maybe they've been obtunded or delirious for weeks, when that happens, they are perfectly coherent. They look around and they address everybody in the room by name and they say they're good vines. Yeah, it's really quite fascinating. That experience you're referring to has a name. It's called FETI, F-E-Y. And if you look in the dictionary, that term sort of dropped out in the early part of the 20th century when people started dying in hospitals, or I'm sorry, say 30s, when people started dying in hospitals, but when people were dying at home, everybody knew about this. It's FAY as defined as an extraordinary enhanced state of consciousness that pretends imminent death. Wow. And people seem to drop all of their neuroses and their consciousness is just extraordinarily clear. That is wild. That's one of the, I cite that anecdotal evidence from time to time only because it was one of the strangest things I've ever seen. The flowers in the room. Oh my God, and it gets stranger after you do it. I mean, I just was there with lots and lots of people when they died and this is just something that leaves you scratching your heads. I mean, it's just really extraordinary. They seem more alive than ordinarily alive. Right. Right. And this, so your field of research, it's interesting to me because it points to this sort of other dimension, or some sort of intentionally concealed aspect to the human experience that because it's repeating, not only in near death experience, you must know that what you described is also very similar to people who've had smoked DMT, report the tunnel and the breaking through and being visited by beings of love. And you know, with the diamethyltryptamine, the question emerges too, where you think to yourself, well, there's no way my brain created that. Like whatever that was was not, I saw something, I didn't project something. So, but this is interesting to me because it implies some kind of law that is not based on the, an organism's physical existence, some kind of transcendent law. And I was wondering if you had any theories on, or if you could describe what that law is, or what, from this research, what principles you have learned that seem to function in this, in this state, which by the way, it sounds, even though it's not religious, it sounds religious in nature. Yeah, well, I kind of think that the, the causation is probably the other way around, rather than people's religious beliefs causing these experiences that, that these experiences are what are, are the basis of a lot of religions is the way I look at it, that these experiences are part of the input, which cause religious systems to be formed. And so what you, you said there about some other dimension. Yeah, absolutely. That is the crux of the problem here. And that is, how do we prove some other state of existence? And, you know, and in my opinion, and as I mentioned, I went through, I was a philosophy professor for three years before I went to medical school and have continued to study philosophy. And in the real world, in my opinion, there are two figures in Western history who've come closest to the, getting it nailing down as it were, the afterlife problem. And one was Plato in his Republic and his dialogue, the Phaedo. And incidentally, in terms of that, the Phaedo is the ultimately the basis of the Christian philosophy of the afterlife or theology of the afterlife. That's a long story, which I won't tell now, but that's the fact. And the Phaedo is the first document where Plato attempted to apply the rational process to the solution of the afterlife question. And then the second person who I think stated the difficulties most beautifully was David Hume, who's kind of the archetype of the skeptic. These so-called people who call themselves, I'm a skeptic. It irritates me not to do anything with the near-death experience, but because I love teaching Greek philosophy. And when I get up to the skeptics, which was the movement formulated by Phaedo about 20 years after Aristotle died, those are the real deal on this. And the people who call themselves skeptics generally, they don't even know who Phaedo is and they get the concept wrong. But in terms of the archetype of a skeptic in the modern world, David Hume is the standard. And David Hume lived from 1711 to 1776. He was, for example, he was a friend of Ben Franklin's. And in his essay on immortality, he beautifully states the real problem. And he said, and if you follow this along in your mind, say the words, you'll see that he was right. He said, by the mirror light of reason, it seems difficult to prove the immortality of the soul. By what arguments or analogies could we prove any state of existence which no one ever saw and which no way resembles any that ever was seen? Some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose. And some new faculties of the mind that they may enable us to comprehend that logic. Now, presumably, Hume was speaking ironically. And what he meant by that was that since Aristotle's logic, let's face it, has done pretty well for us for 2300 years. I mean, it's not an easy thing to come up with some new species of logic. And we think, falsely, but we do think that we know our minds pretty well. And the idea that there could be some new faculties of the mind that would enable us to comprehend this new logic seems preposterous. Now, here at the age of 72, and see the grim reaper coming at my age, I can just go on and cheerfully announce not really to make a pronouncement or a state in ideology, but what I want to claim is that I have solved Hume's problem because see my area in philosophy was logic and philosophy of language and ancient Greek philosophy. And so I have developed a new set of logical principles about how we can think logically about things that from the worldly point of view don't make any sense. And so over the, since I've been teaching this since about 1969 in my philosophy classes, and even a set of exercises which people can use to actually reformat their mind to think logically about things that don't make sense. This is not published in the US yet, by the way, so I'm not trying to sell a book here. I just published about a month ago in France, but thus far no luck in the US. But I'm prepared to go to the wall on this one and say, yeah, yeah, we can, not that we can prove life after death, but that at least we can open our minds to achieve entirely new ways to think about this in a genuinely rational problem. By the way, I am not in a genuinely rational fashion. Incidentally, I'm not a parapsychologist. In my opinion, parapsychology is a pseudo science and that in 2017 anyway, the question of life after death is not yet a scientific problem because it can't be confirmed by a certain kind of test. But what we can do, which is a different approach, is to reformat our minds so that we can think about this major question of existence in an entirely new way that then opens entirely new pathways where we can investigate this question. What is the reformatting? Well, if you could give me a pass on this one, I just basically, what we, here's the thumbnail sketch. Plato was trying to work out the rules and principles by which meaningless, unintelligible language, namely nonsense works. But Aristotle was a very compulsive guy and anything that smacked of irrationality to him was anathema. So when he talked about nonsense, his favorite terms for that was random talk. But I could prove to you very quickly, just in a few minutes, that far from being random talk, nonsense or meaningless unintelligible language is actually less random than ordinary meaningful language. And it operates by its own rationally discernible principles. Does it mean like baby talk or like, what do you know? Well, no, actually, no. What would an example of that be? Baby talk is not nonsense, but simplified sense. Right. Okay, sure. But nonsense is, for example, everybody would think of Edward Lear or Lewis Carroll or Dr. Seuss. And in my work on this, it's been going on, gosh, I guess, 50 years now, amazingly. But what I found is that there are over 70 different types of meaningless, unintelligible language, namely nonsense. Here are just three of them. Okay. Listen to these. Twas Brilligan, the Sly the Tove, did Garen Gimble and the Wave. Okay. That's one type of nonsense, obviously. But listen to this. Holiness breeds the vestigial lipstick of spontaneity. That's a different type. It's still nonsense, but it's a different type. That's the kind of nonsense I hear, and I'm like, I know exactly what you mean. Gotcha. And listen to this one. That cannibal you man just ate was the last one in this county. But basically, what I'm getting at is that nonsense itself is a separate domain of language. That's hilarious. What's the last one from? It's own rationally discernible principles now. And this is a complicated topic. I know, but the fact is that when you, you can take people through a series of exercises, I do it in a sort of seminar. Sometimes I've done it like as an entire semester length course at universities, which I've taught multiple times. So you can actually reformat people's minds with exercises so that they are able to think logically about things that don't make sense. Now, I have been doing this for many decades with the anticipation that eventually somebody who has learned this new logic is going to have a near-death experience. And for reasons I won't go into, I mean, it makes sense, but it's just, this is getting into complicated stuff here, but basically to get to the point, when somebody goes into a near-death experience, and it's just by chance, years later perhaps, already knowing the rationally discernible principles, which enable them to think about this logically, that when they come back, I conjectured, they would be able to talk about this experience in an entirely new way. And that by comparing the old accounts, which we already have, which make it a travel narrative, I got out of my body and went through a tunnel into a line, so a travel narrative. Now, the people who go into it with this new logic will be able to have new ways of expressing it. And I was sort of patiently waiting on October 15th, 2015, got a call from an old friend who is a distinguished artist and scientist who had been to my nonsense seminar about maybe six or seven years before. So he called me because he had been through this gosh-awful, terrible, horrible infection, just, oh my God, it's amazing that he lived and was in the hospital for 60 days. But he was telling me about his experience in a very sort of weak tone of voice. He had been through a terrible ordeal. But all of a sudden, like his voice got clear and very expressive, and he said, and you know, Raymond, when I was over there, he said, I got to thinking about the nonsense the sentence seminar was in. And this is what he said. He said, what he realized when he was on the other side was, he said, I realized that in order to think about how this realm we're in now is connected with that other realm, he said, you've got to take the intelligibility access into account. And again, I think you can see that this is something that's really difficult to put in a synopsis. But it's my life's work. And it's on the, you know, this is in progress. Another student of mine or now a colleague of mine about five years ago started out on this herself, herself, and she now has published just an amazing new book with some of the initial findings that we've made on this. Well, I think it's, you know, this is on the way. I think this is, I think that two things come to mind. Number one, near death researchers or whatever happens after death researchers, these kinds of explorers, it's, I guess, a form of astronaut almost. Like you're trying to train these Absolutely. Astral cartographers or something to go into this place and come up, come back with maps. But the, what, what occurs to me is if let's just imagine that in the same way we have telescopes that somehow this research comes together, we utilize technology, we figure out a way to actually get something over there that can record it. And we come up with some substantial proof that indeed upon the death, there is another place that we go to. Do you think that this would be disastrous for human society? Don't you think that should be Really interesting. That's a great point because I hear so many people say it the other way around. They say, oh, if we could only rationally prove the afterlife and everything would be fine and would be all, would be hugging each other in the streets all the time. I was a forensic psychiatrist and I worked in a maximum security unit for the criminally insane for quite a while. And I have perhaps from that experience a little bit of a warped view of humanity. But nonetheless, with all those prejudices aside, I do think it's overstating the case to say that this would make everything okay on the earth. I think people would still be just as mean as they are now. But what I do think it would do is to reformat the mind in such a way that we may be able to think not just about the afterlife question. Incidentally, I don't conduct these seminars specifically with the directed to the afterlife question. The point of my seminars is more to just to enhance critical thinking and to, you know, stimulate creative thinking. And so it's the purpose is not to send people over to the other side. It's rather to help us while we're here. And the side effect, one of the many side effects would be that this would give us a new way of investigating not just near-death experiences, but also the enigmatic communications that people give as they're dying. I'm sure you have observed as I have observed that it's a very common and that all physicians have probably observed. It's a very common thing that on the brink of death in the last few days or hours or minutes of life, people will start talking nonsensically, right? Yes. And now we can look at these enigmatic communications in an entirely new way. Not to make them into sense because you can't make nonsense into sense. Nonsense is the thing in itself. But that nonsense sometimes does reflect realities in a way. Since we have a universal structure, a universal structural formula that we know that underlies all different kinds of nonsense, then we can, I think, have a better map of the mind of the dying person in such a way as that I am convinced that assuming that as people are dying, they do enter into a transcendent state. And if that is true, then we have an entirely new way of showing where that point is, where people go in from this state of consciousness that you and I are in right now into some transcendent state of consciousness. This transcendent state of consciousness, it's so beautiful. And my experience with it has solely been through DMT. I don't know if it's the same thing. But when I smoked DMT, I remember going into a loving presence, an incredible clarity. But in that state, my thought was, why did you make me be human? Why do you get to be here and I have to do this human thing? Because that place is so peaceful and tranquil and perfect and creative and instantly creative. So this is where, to me, it starts getting scrambled up in my head because I think to myself, if there's some system out there that involves people like you and I and every human being getting blasted out of a vagina into time, suffering immensely for decade after decade, and then popping back to this beautiful surprise party where your relatives are like, you did it. The question is, why did I do it? Or who made me do it? Why aren't we coming here in the first place if this other side is so filled with love and perfection? You know, that's a great question. And it's one I've faced rather acutely in the last few years. Because just to set this out plainly, I just never was religious. My dad was a surgeon and a professional military officer who was in the Pacific Theater in World War II. So you probably get the picture from that. And so we weren't religious. My dad had a brief flirtation with the Presbyterian church that lasted about three weeks when I was 12 years old and mystified by, what is this? So I never was religious. And still, to me, the notion of an afterlife is highly counterintuitive. The reason I got interested in these near-death experiences is that they are very relevant to the understanding of early Greek philosophy. A lot of these early Greek philosophers were fascinated by these stories of people who died and almost died and came back. And having learned that in 1962, in 1965, three years later, I met at the University of Virginia Dr. George Ritchie, who at that time was a professor of psychiatry there, who had had such an experience. So George was the first living person I heard this from, and subsequently I've heard it from thousands of people. And I didn't get interested in this because any sort of religious thing. To me, it was something I learned about in Greek philosophy. And so I have always trusted that the people who tell me these things were sincere. You can see that on their faces, especially if you talk to thousands of them. But to me, I just didn't know the answer. And I also knew that there's no way of proving it either way with science or with any other form of rational thought. But what has happened to me over the decades of being very curious about this is it just becomes more and more puzzling. And there is a new book out on this called The Science of Near-Death Experiences. I think that's a little bit of a misnomer, but the book is excellent. The Science of Near-Death Experiences, edited by John Hagen, MD, and it's through the University of Missouri Press, and it just came out. And a lot of the stories in there are physicians who've had their own near-death experiences. And so the things I've heard from physicians are just, they got to the point of just what is going on. Let me give you a fairly recent example. About two years ago, I was in Italy, and after my lecture, this really nice surgeon came up. And you could tell from his eyes that he was haunted. I don't mean in a negative way, but you could tell that he was working on something that had really gotten to him. He just couldn't comprehend. So he led me over to the corner, and this is what he told me. He said that some months before, he had been operating on elective operative procedure. I forgot what it was, but not anything significant. And this man was fairly young, and he was in overall an excellent state of health. So there was no thought that anything bad would happen during the surgery. But in the event, the man underwent a cardiac arrest, and the surgeon was unable to revive him. So he told me he was just beside himself, which you can imagine he was thinking, Oh my God, how did this happen? And what am I going to say to the family? And whereupon he said the operating room doors flew open, and this woman came in who at first he assumed was psychotic. And you know how when you're under stress, you have a hard time understanding what somebody else is saying anyway? Yes. So he said he had to focus in on this woman's face to figure out what she was saying. And he said finally he picked up that she was saying, My husband is not dead. And she said I was out in the waiting room, and my husband came to me and he said, that you think he's dead, and that I should come in here and tell you that he's not dead. Oh my God. And the surgeon, the surgeon told me that he was so blown away, just he doesn't even remember resuming the resuscitation. But he said, and he did, and after a while the guy's heart started beating again. Whoa. Yeah, and he said he was there in the ER when this guy regained consciousness. And this is a surgeon, this isn't someone, this isn't some, this is a real, this is a person who's every day operating on people. He's not lying about this. Yes. Wow. Really, look at that book. Like I just said, the science, the near death experience, just came out with the University of Missouri Press. You're going to see a lot of physicians in there who are just blown away by this. That is. But I hear this kind of thing from doctors all the time. But he said, when this guy regained consciousness in the recovery room, he said the first thing the patient said to him was, doctor, I was up above my body up there and I could see that you thought I was dead. And he said, I kept trying to tell you, I'm not dead, I'm not dead, but you wouldn't hear me. So I went out into the operating room and I tried to tell my wife out into the waiting room. And I tried to tell my wife to come in here and tell you that I'm not dead. Wow. Now, to get back to the point I was making with this, you were talking about one in the name of God, are we here for? Yes. Yeah. And in the process of thinking through this, I woke up one morning and a writer I really greatly enjoyed back in the 60s that maybe you're too young to have read, but his name was Ellie Wiesel. And he had been through Auschwitz and he was a wonderful scholar and a very wise and kind man. And I used to love reading Ellie Wiesel stuff. Well, when I was thinking through all this, I woke up in the morning and I remember a line that Ellie Wiesel said that seemed so improbable to me when I read it. But now it makes sense. Ellie Wiesel said, God made man because he loves stories. And you think about it, what is your life but your story, right? Wow. Now, I think that, and I think Plato really had a lot of insight into this. And to make a long story short, what I think we're here on is a kind of adventure. It's in narrative format. We learn things from it. So we're here for education purposes and entertainment purposes, not to use that term flippantly, but life is a pretty fascinating experience in itself. And I think that what it is ultimately is a kind of learning experience. Do you follow any of the new philosophies from Nick Bostrom's simulation theory, the idea that this is some kind of simulator that we're in? Oh, I know a little bit about that, but it's the idea that I've come up with on my own. It's pretty much that idea that was Plato said in the cave metaphor, if you've ever read that, the state of existence we're in is very dream-like and that there is another realm kind of superimposed over the top of it. Yeah, so I've always kind of think that. But then it's kind of sinister. Excuse me. It's kind of sinister because, and I don't mean sinister. What I mean is, okay, I love the idea. Well, God loves stories, and that's beautiful. Until you're like, you know what, God, how about you don't get me to write the story about being in Auschwitz? How about you get me to write the story about being some wealthy prince with a harem and who becomes Buddha or something? Why do I get to tell this story? The thing that seems interesting is that, yeah, maybe this really is a story-generating simulation for some kind of other intelligence that's harvesting our life stories out of some desire for maybe it or his or her or its own realization. Or our own. Or our own. But we still are confronting suffering. Yes, we are. The problem of evil. Yes. Now, let me ask you this though. Let's assume that tomorrow you went to the doctor and they diagnosed you with some terrible illness. Yes. Not a fatal illness, but some terrible infection that required for you to be isolated on a desert island all by yourself for, let's say, 10 years. Okay. And they could take you out there in a cargo plane with all the food and water and medicine you're going to need for 10 years. And in addition, there was room in the cargo plane for, let's say, a DVD player and 2,000 DVDs. Okay. Now, let me ask you, would you choose all comedies? No. Would you choose some tragedies too? Sure. Yes. When you were watching the tragedy on that desert island, would you be crying? Yeah. Probably. Yeah. There you go. You know, again, religion is not a big deal to me, but you know, I think that David Hume said, he said the only concept of the afterlife that he felt that a philosopher about which he met a rational person. Who with curiosity could entertain would be the idea of reincarnation, that you get to come back multiple times, that you get to experience. And it's terrible as it sounds. I mean, if I asked, like in my masking, like I got my 2,000 DVDs, would I choose one of them to be in Auschwitz? Yes, I would. Wow. Would I choose to be a guard? No, I would not. Well, what about that? He's choosing to be the guard, you know? I don't know. I don't know. This is tough stuff. I don't know. These are, you know, and perhaps the problem is like addressing these questions with the minds locked into the time space continuum. You know, I don't know. And you know, we could probably talk about this for 100,000 years. We have a few minutes left. And I just wanted to ask you, because I think this is, people know about your research into the near-death experience. But I think fewer people are aware that you use scrying. Mirror scrying is a technique to gain information. I was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what that is. I saw a mention that you actually have in some way been influenced by John Dee. And I just wanted to hear a little bit about what that is. Yes. Well, I'm quickly going to expose myself here as a very boring person. I doubt that. Because essentially all of my interest go back to ancient Greek philosophy and logic. And that's where it started. And when I was 18 years old and reading about the Greeks, anybody who does that will quickly realize that a big formative factor in the origin of Western thought were these institutions known as oracles of the dead, where alleged, according to Plutarch and Herodotus and Aristophanes, many other great Greek writers, that you could go to these places and have some sort of experience, which you interpreted to be an actual visitation with a deceased loved one. Now, in my psychiatry career, I learned about this process you're calling that many people, when you gaze into an optical clear depth, you see these visions. Like a crystal ball or a mirror. Yeah. Yeah. Or a city and mirror like the Aztecs used, a clear pond as my Cherokee ancestors used, and so on and so on. And it's worldwide. And in about 1988, I read an article in a classical journal about how one of these oracles of the dead had been discovered, the most famous one that's mentioned by Homer and Herodotus and a lot of these people. But during the excavation, I read the excavation report and based on what they found there, I put two and two together and figured out how they did it. And to make a long story short, I set this up and it works. Now, for further details, I wrote a book on this called Reunions, but more recently in the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology in 2012, Arthur Hastings at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology describes his replication of my work. And there are other articles that also have replicated it. But yes, you can do this. You mean you can communicate with people who've passed on through this? Well, what I would say is that you can have an experience which seems to you to be a visitation from a departed loved one. Now, and I can say also that the people who go through this and incidentally, my initial subjects were my medical colleagues, my sociology professor, my graduate students of psychology. This is not a new age thing. We were going into this out of curiosity. But the fact is that you can induce these experiences from within a full waking state of consciousness where you actually do seem to be seeing and conversing with somebody who's died. Now, the question that you're going on from there to ask is, is this real? Yeah. Well, what I would say is that the people who go through this almost universally say, yeah, this was real, but we're still in that big question. See, is that the impression of people is that it's real? Does that mean it's real or not? I give up. Well, I mean, before even whether it's real or not, I want to know, what did you say going through this? Is it an extended process? Yes, it is. It takes me a day. I do it one-on-one. Now, I am no good at group therapy, but I'm just sociophobic to tell you the truth. But I think somebody who was a group therapist, I believe, could take multiple people through this at once. And it's happened a couple of times, actually. I've taught lots and lots of people how to do this over the years, and there are actually people who are practicing this now. And in one of the standard textbooks of grief therapy, it's now recommended as a method to help with grief. It was very well known in the Middle Ages. You mentioned John Dee came a little bit later, but even in the Middle Ages, this was kind of a medical procedure that doctors would use to help people with grief. Doctors would have people gaze into a speculum. Wow. Yeah, some kind of speculum. Oh, my God. I wish I'd asked this question at the beginning because I want to know how to do this. It keeps coming up. You hear it so many times. I've heard it so much lately, this concept, and I think people... Hey, listen, if you want a really good sort of scholarly take on it, my book was published in 1993, I think, Reunions. But in 2001, there was a book published at the Princeton University Press, which is called Greek and Roman Necromancy. Cool. It's the title. And the author is Daniel Ogden, who is, I guess, a classics professor somewhere in Britain. Yeah, this is... I mean, it's one of the most astonishing things that this got lost. I mean, this was very well known. You've probably... I can tell from your... You mentioned John Dee and so on. You probably are also aware right of the Greek magical papyri that were discovered in the Egyptian desert. They're in the Greek language, so this was after the Alexandrian conquest. And you can get, for example, you can get it through the University of Chicago Press. And the volume we're looking for is volume number one. But there are these extant manuscripts that have survived from antiquity that give you full instructions on how to do this. Do you still do grief counseling? I do grief counseling all the time. That's what my remnant of a... Yeah, that's what I still do in my... The therapeutic aspect of my work, although I think I really do more... Philosophical counseling is what I do is... Because, I mean, obviously I learned a lot about grief as a psychiatrist, but all in all, I think I learned a lot more about grief from my philosophical background than I did from my medical background. And do you do these sessions one-on-one, or can people do it over the internet? Do you Skype with people to do this? I gotta laugh about the Skype, because to tell you the truth, my last computer had a crank on the side, and my wife was yelling at me the other day about my total inability even to operate a cell phone. The reason you and I can do this right now is that she set this up before... I mean, I'm just totally inept with respect to machinery. Well, I'm so grateful to her for this, and you two... I'm left after this conversation spellbound with a million more questions for you. Hey, great! Well, let's do it again. I'd love to, and I hear you're coming to New York. Is that correct? Yes, yes, yes. You have the info there. I have the info, so you're going to be doing, I guess, with Alex Gray. You're doing an event at the Bell House, so I will definitely be there. All right, great. I can't wait to meet you. I can't wait to meet you. You're a curious person like I am, and I gather that your favorite thing to say is the same as my favorite thing to say is, I don't know, but I sure am interested. Yeah, well, I mean, and also I'll have another drink, unfortunately. Well, I don't drink, but I'm not immune to all substances. I don't know what the current law is in New York, but I don't know. Well, you know, I think people are pretty lax about it right now, Marijuana, if you're doing an event with the right person, but you're doing this with... Hey, by the way, at the site of the Oracle of the Dead in Thespertea in northwest Greece, just before you went into the apparition chamber, the archaeologists found sexual little burned-out nens of hashish. Wow. And incidentally, that doesn't mean that the hashish did not cause the experience, right? Because you can do this perfectly adequately without any helpers, okay? Yes. But I'm assuming that it probably enhanced or amplified the experience, but it's nothing to do with causation. Well, I mean, yeah, I agree. The whole causation thing. I mean, of course they had hashish. Why wouldn't they? It just makes sense. And, you know, I think it's fascinating that these black obsidian scrying mirrors are now in everyone's home because it's their phones. And when your computer's off, that's what it is. Exactly. So it's wild that they're everywhere. Wow. So I'm going to... This is amazing. Are you going to... At the bell house, do you know what the focus of your talk is going to be? Well, I'm just going to talk about your death experiences and things generally. But, you know, I just... I'd love to just see what the audience wants to hear about, too. So I'll have a lecture and then we'll have plenty of time for discussions and so on. Beautiful. Well, I look forward to it. Thank you so much for giving me an hour of your time. I really appreciate it. Please thank Cheryl for me. I would happily give you two or three more. Cheryl says she's got... She wants one of those hooks, you know, to get me off, pull me off the stage. But also if you could give the specifics on what the... where the meeting is. Oh, yeah. No problem. I'll have all those links will be in the comments section of this episode. Also, I'll mention it in the beginning of the episode, too. Thank you so much, Dr. Moody. I really do appreciate this. This was really interesting. Likewise, man. It's great to hear from somebody that doesn't have much of an opinion, which I'm in that same category. I just... you know, this is just baffling to me and just totally different from what I would have imagined. I want it to be true. And I think it is. I mean, I've... But I think there's a reason we don't... I don't know if I want it to be true or not. You know, they say everybody wants there to be an afterlife. That's a stretch to me. I want to think about that one some more. But I've got to the point where I've got to say it seems to me to be true. I mean, I mean, it's just totally counterintuitive and a big surprise. But I'm beginning to gather that to my utter astonishment. There is. Thank you so much for being on the show. I'll see you in a month, I guess, or whenever you're at the bellhouse. I will announce those dates at the beginning of the show. Links will be at DrTrustle.com. Thank you so much. And your name is... Duncan Trussell. Yeah, Trussell. Okay, good.

It's time to rip your gaze from the crucified babies that dot the mountains of your subjective hell-round reality tunnel and gaze upon the gently breathing breasts of Mother Earth. Bring your cracked, dry lips down upon Earth, pulsating, throbbing, fertile nipples and suckle at that eternal nectar which gives birth to mountains. Suckle as I watch. Suckle as I watch. Hello, sweet friends. We're back. Thank you guys for being so patient with me. I've been away for a month. As many of you know, I was on a month-long tour and then right after that, I went to a... I've got a lot of snot in my nose right now. Very unprofessional. Oh, God. Jesus Christ. What's happening? Oh! Excuse me, pals. I think I caught something over there at that meditation retreat. But we're back and I am very happy about this episode, which I am about to upload. So I'm not gonna spend any time in an opening rant or anything like that. I love you guys and we're back. I'm back in town for the entire summer now. So podcasts will return to their semi-regular schedule and thank you for hanging in there. We're gonna jump right into this podcast with my pal, Emil, but first, some very quick business. Today's episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast is brought to you by the mighty sleep lords over at casper.com. Go to casper.com forward slash family hour and use offer code family hour to receive $50 off of an obsessively engineered mattress. Are you sleeping on a thing reminiscent of the swollen, gangrenous underbelly of a rotting possum and some cursed forest on the outskirts of town? Does your mattress whisper to you at night? Does it speak to you of all the opportunities that you've missed? Sometimes do you wake with a feeling of gnarled clawed hands trying to pull you in to the thick, milky rot that used to be a wonderful mattress, but over time is slowly decayed into a kind of foamy graveyard, which you pretend is okay to sleep on. And have you considered that not only is a mattress a thing that human beings tend to make love on and sleep upon, but it is also a thing that humans die upon. In a way, a mattress is like the launching pad that sends your soul into heaven or hell. And what kind of afterlife do you think you'll go into if you're a launching pad consists of a million bed lice and old tears that you shed in your depressed periods? We don't have to die like this, friends. Thanks to casper.com. All you have to do is go to casper.com. Ford slash family are put in offer code family hour and my sweet, sweet patrons over there at Casper will immediately mail you a new spiritual launching pad. These are great mattresses. They are just the right sink, just the right bounce, two technologies, latex, foam and memory foam come together for better nights and brighter days. You get a risk-free trial and return policy, try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred sweet, sacred, blissful days, and they've got free delivery and painless returns. Other mattress companies, when you try to return the mattress, they make you actually Skype with them and they force you to whip your back with a thorn belt that they mailed to you. It's quite painful. Casper doesn't do that, you just send it back. The mattresses are made in America, America, America. It's $500 for a twin-size mattress and $9.50 for a king-size mattress. Who's gonna sleep on a twin? Are you out of your mind? Get a king, get a California king. Comparing that to industry averages, that's an outstanding price point. Okay, so that's what I have to say, but here's the real pitch. I sleep on a Casper mattress. The mattress that I lay my fleshy, freshly fattened body down upon is a Casper mattress. Last night, I slept on a Casper mattress and had a terrible dream where someone told me that my mother's phone number is also the number of mothers that have died on earth. So that was a fun dream that I had. I don't blame it on the Casper mattress in a way. I think it's a fantastic dream because it tells you that when it gives you something to think about, whenever you call your sweet mother, call your mother, but first order a Casper mattress. What are you doing to yourself? P.S., if you wanna go buy a mattress at some mattress store, oh God, you might as well take a fish hook and shove it into your juggler vein and attach it to some backwood son of a bitch's pickup truck and let him rip your throat out and go to a mattress store where a hypnotic mattress man or woman will trick you into paying way too much for a mattress that you don't need. Try a Casper first. If you don't like it, if your sweet, dainty prince or princess-like body cannot sleep on a Casper mattress, send it back. Go to a mattress store in order a mattress filled with some kind of chemically softened diamonds so that you can finally sleep. Oh, great king of the earth. But if you're one of us and you just want a nice mattress that isn't gonna send you into the poor house, and let me tell you, I just visited a poor house recently because I left my phone there and it's filled with people weeping and moaning, all of them with different stories of getting hoodwinked by a mattress crook. Babies, you don't wanna do that. Go to casper.com, forward slash family hour, put in offer code, family hour, and get yourself a brand new mattress. Are you seriously going to let your ancestors in the afterlife gaze upon you as you sleep upon that bloody doom raft you used to call a mattress? Let's get a new mattress today. Thank you, Casper, for sponsoring this podcast. We're also brought to you by amazon.com. If you go into the comments section of any of these episodes, you will notice a beautifully designed icon, a weird thing with breasts that's our Amazon portal. You click on that Amazon portal and you will get sucked in to amazon.com and anything that you purchase there, and they sell everything, anything you purchase, they give us a very small percentage of and it costs you nothing. It's a wonderful way to support this podcast while preventing yourself from going out into the world, the world, I don't mean the world, the world is a wonderful place, where there's forests and the little rabbits that dance and the dandelion groves and the mystical parts of whatever town you happen to live in. These are wonderful rabbits and I highly recommend spending your time climbing or driving or doing whatever it takes to get there because if the rabbits like you, then they will give you a special wish granting ruby that will allow you to summon an alien that will take you to a planet where he will remove your spine and replace it with a titanium alloy thing that'll gives you telepathic ability. Spend your time driving to that place. Don't spend your time driving to some noxious target where you're more than likely going to get berated by some kind of lunatic fundamentalist Christian who is completely obsessed with genitals and cannot deal with the fact that the times they are a-changing. Do you really want to deal with the howlings of some genital obsessed apocalyptic psychotic pseudo Christian when you're trying to buy toilet paper? Hell no. Get it at amazon.com. They have every kind of paper that you desire, not just toilet paper, they've got printer paper, they've got wrapping paper. You name it, it's there, but you don't need to risk. This is just the beginning of it, friends. It's not gonna be too much longer before one of these lunatic psychotic pseudo Christians drags one of these target clerks and in the middle of the store composes some kind of terrible pyre made of old board games and playstations and ignites the damn thing. I would highly recommend avoiding all stores in general. There's really no reason to do that. Spend your free time basking in the glorious photons that blast from the beautiful sun above our wonderful planet. Don't spend it basking in the sneeze viruses ejected from the pestulent bodies of quivering babies recently infected with unknown viruses when they traveled to Key West. Go to amazon.com, go through our portal and you will support the podcast while fulfilling that innate need for us to order things covered in plastic and made of plastic. It really is just what you need as a human being. Amazon.com, go through the portal. I love you. Thank you for putting up with this. Oh shit, also you've got a shop located at DuncanTrussell.com and that shop is about to have brand new shirts, very limited edition shirts from the tour. We're only gonna sell, I think, I don't know how many we're gonna sell, but it's a limited edition run. So the t-shirt company that's making those says it's gonna be the middle of the month, which were three days past it. So go to the store, the shirts are gonna be there. These are the You Are God tour t-shirts. So those are gonna be at the shop. I hope you'll visit it. And thank you to all of you who continue to donate. Some of you have signed up for a monthly PayPal subscription plan and that is an amazing gift that you give the podcast. And thank you guys for that. I thank you just for listening. I thank you just for tuning in to this thing. And I thank you, all of those who came to the shows. Okay, there we go. That's the intro. I love you all. And now please, everyone, open up those glorious third eye nodules that contain within them some quantum flake of gold and allow the astral ejecta, which explodes from the souls of all sacred men and women to go zinging through whatever metaphysical circuitry makes up the universe that we currently exist in and to fill the heart of my best friend in the world, Emil Amos. Emil Amos has been on the show several times before and we inevitably have my favorite conversations of all time. So now, and I have to apologize, I'm using a different computer so I don't have the theme song right now. So he's gonna come up cold. Everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, the wonderful, the beautiful, the amazing, all links to find them will be in the comment section of this episode. Emil Amos. Dear God, Emil, how wonderful this is to have you as my first guest after the two and a half week hiatus. I've been on a break for two and a half weeks. I think it's the longest I've ever gone without releasing a podcast. Well, you were on tour before that too, right? I managed to get some out while I was on tour, but then I got really tired and just passed out for two weeks, but it's cool. I'm just great. I'm glad to be back. It's great to see you. I can't believe we're doing this. I don't even think people know what we're doing. Well, you were on tour. You went to Maui afterwards, right? Yes. And now, literally a day later, I flew in and we're gonna generate a lot of content. We're content generating. Emil and I sat down with a couple of Hollywood types. They analyzed our brands and we basically made the decision that we're gonna merge our brands temporarily and try to create content based on what we think our audience will like the most. We're gonna start with a sandal, designing a sandal. Yeah. And it's the one we're working on right now, guys, is one of the most beautiful beach sandals I've ever seen. It's not like normal sandals where they get celebrity lines and the guy has nothing to do with how it's designed. Now, this is hands-on. Yeah. We had a lot of ideas to bring to the table. We're using bio-sustainable materials. We're actually using, I live right next to JPL and Jet Propulsion Laboratories and they do a lot of animal experimentation over there. Cool. They'll do a lot of high-altitude mice experiments. So they put mice into high-altitude weather balloons. They send them up into the stratosphere. And so right around my house, it's very common for right around the mid-afternoon, it starts raining mice carcasses. And I've been gathering them up, saving them in the freezer and we're using mice skin to create the straps of these sandals. Do you wear sandals? I don't like them. Flip flops. Does that count? It counts. Yeah, it counts. If I'm at the beach, I'm gonna wear my flops. There's a war on flops. There's a big war on flops. I remember when I first came to LA, comedian Eleanor Kerrigan saw that I was wearing flip flops and she's like, what are you doing? She was so disgusted. I don't blame her. I'm nasty feet. Still do. Nothing changed. Probably worse than when she gazed upon them. But yeah, this fucking flip flop war is sad. Sandals are great. You just pop them on whenever you want. You take them off. You don't have to go through the whole sock process. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't really want to take a side. And insult the, you know. Take a side. Fleets of sandal supporters. Don't be a fence rider. I don't understand why people have such strong opinions about things like that. Well, because either you love feet or you hate them. Feet haters. Some people just don't want to fucking deal with disgusting, I don't, but man, my feet are not aging well. They're not. They're like curling in. I had a list of things to talk about. And this was, I was just, I didn't mean to start off on this direction. It's like the aging process has started in my feet. And I think it's, I'm not that I'm not aging other places, but it seems like it's going to move up as the years progress. My calves are going to become eroded. It's going to get up into my legs. My cock's going to shrivel in even more. And then it's just, that's aging, man. You looked at, you just see this spacesuit start popping leaks. Usually it's me that says all the negative stuff. I don't think that's a negative. That's a problem, man. It ain't negative. You know, like the real problem is, cause you know, we have, you talk about the conspiracy, the great conspiracy about like shit you can't talk about politically. You don't want to talk about the JFK assassination. You want to talk about September 11th. You don't want to point out these things that we know are fishy, but really the real conspiracy is that whenever you talk about aging or dying, people are like, God damn man, do you have to be so fucking heavy? Because their idea of it is that it's unnatural and they look at it as an abomination. I mean, Christ, God forbid you should be a 40 year old woman who wants to do a music video. Look at those YouTube comments. She might as well. There was like, I was watching Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and one of these like housewives did a music video and I thought it was funny. So I went on YouTube to try to catch the whole thing cause the whole music video was her going like, fuck you, you don't like it, you can fuck you. And I put the middle finger up, fuck you, kind of do what I want. And I said, fuck you, I put the middle finger up. It's just this weird like, she's just telling everybody to fuck up. It's really silly, you know? Cause she feels oppressed, I guess. Like someone's trying to inhibit her and she's fighting back. But the comments, she might as well have been tap dancing on freshly born kittens with stiletto heels. The comments are just like, you putrid mass. Look at you, you fucking ancient old hag. And it's like, just cause she's old. And then like someone, you know, in the comments section is like, you know, anyone posting about her being old that you are also will get old. FYI. That's funny. This is gonna seem like a bit of a digression, but when I was growing up and I was entering the concept of like, I'm gonna make records. That's what I'm gonna do with my life. I would record myself and give you a tape and you'd go, this is cool, you know, whatever. But eventually I started to notice certain friends or certain people being like saying it was kind of, you know, it's like bummer music. You know, it's like negative music. I'm sure I said that. But even more than that, like I think, I thought it was kind of like a form of radical honesty just to like be yourself. I mean, I didn't even, when I was young, I didn't really narrate it. I didn't really think a lot about it, but I liked music where someone was being super raw and there wasn't like a big wall between them and you. But that shouldn't even really be like a big distinguishing factor, really. That's just like, I guess that's a type of music. I've had people in Columbus, when we did that show, a girl came up to me next time I was there and she was like, what kind of music was that? Which I thought was like a really interesting question because I was, you know, I'm just, I have an acoustic guitar. It's like, this is just the John Lennon thing. This is just you pick up acoustic guitar and you just like sing something that's vaguely confessional. I thought that was pretty mainstream, you know? Right, well, that's what I've, over the course of my little career or whatever, I find myself exotically trying to study this, I guess, mainstream value system that I'm rubbing up against as I play music and because I don't intrinsically understand it. So I'm meeting up with this entity or this segment of the population. It's like, your music's really like, it's really, it's really low energy or like, it's really like, you know, kind of sad or this or that, you know? But all these descriptive terms that like, obviously it doesn't jump out at them and grab them. And so as an artist, you think like, well, how can I do that more? You know, how can I, how can I speak to you or articulate better? And then, you know, I mean, you can say something punk, like why would you ever fucking care? Or why would you, why would you change anything? But it's more like you were, you're thinking of it as a challenge, you know? But I find it so strange in some way that I'll never understand what they're talking about. You know, I'll never know. Because I don't care and I don't know and I just want to hear what I want to hear. And like you, maybe they categorize that as like a raw form of, you know, organic stuff or something that's hard to digest. But I never thought it, I never categorized it. I just thought that was fucking the Beatles or something. Well, they differentiate in a really specific way, which is a very sad thing to do because you end up cutting a lot of nutrients out of your diet that way. This is a thing that keeps coming on my brain is something Terrence McKenna said about shamanic ecstasy. And he said shamanic ecstasy encompasses all feeling tones. There's, it's not, whenever, because before I heard him say that, I always thought of ecstasy as being only related to bliss or versions of blissfulness. But what he's saying is actually there's ecstatic sorrow, ecstatic loneliness, ecstatic grief that these all emotions can fall into the exact same category of true actualization of the self because you're sad is not an indication of a mistake because you're talking about or singing about your inevitable extinction or pointlessness or whatever it may be. That is just as much a prayer to the universe as some upbeat fucking like Pharrell Anthem. I'm so happy. Oh, so. But clearly we live in a time or maybe it's always been like this where that's almost an occult belief, right? Like that's such an obscure school of thought to think that it's all completely off limits and you should just be yourself. It's like this radical belief. Yeah, sub-ec, sub-ec, all one, all one, all part of the same beautiful thing. Yeah, that isn't a cult idea. Sadly, it's not even, you know, it's not, if you just give yourself the next time you find yourself in an undesirable state of consciousness, whatever it may be, if you just give yourself a couple of seconds of pretending that what you're experiencing is one of the most incredible things the universe can produce, which is the end of 13.7 billion years of evolution from the Big Bang to now experiencing whatever it may be experiencing. It's really beautiful. Actually, man, when I was talking with Ram Dass at this Ram Dass retreat, they'll probably upload it sometime. The thing he said is, look upon your predicament as though you were gazing at a flower. Oh, look at that. How beautiful. Look, there it is. Look at this incredible life. That's how you look at yourself. Look at this life. Oh, look at the karma. Look at this poignant, sweet, dramatic predicament that this being is in, and gaze on it in that way and then love it instead of looking at it and being like, why are you depressed today? Look on it and think, oh, beautiful depression, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sorrow, beautiful numbness, beautiful emptiness, if that is what you happen to be feeling. And it's really interesting when you start doing that how really incredible everything begins to seem. You know, because all the shit you're trying to pretend to be is just diminishing your experience of what really is and sucks. Yeah, isn't that kind of like what's supposed to happen to you as you get older, like this mellowing sweetness. So you're sort of like, you're looking out at the world and realizing you're gonna leave it sooner or later and you're looking at a child experiencing something for the first time, but there's that kind of that understanding of the fact that it's all fleeting and it's sad, you're leaving it, but you're acknowledging all that and you can see the beauty in its fragility or something. Yeah, and then add to that if you start a spiritual practice and you start having contact with what really might be going on, which is that it may be that this whole time that we thought we were in some kind of safe and comfortable biodome called our human body, warming our hands on the fires of experience, surrounded by a howling void of doom and non-existence, it may be the opposite. It may very well be that this thing that we thought was the most important thing is in fact a terrible jail cell, a form of solitary confinement turned with the ace down really low and we're freezing our fucking asses off in this thing we call human life, like a little bubble in an ocean of love and that this whole time we've been battering back the embrace of the universe in a desperate attempt to individualize ourselves and then so then instead of it becoming a sweet sorrow, you get to the really blasphemous thing where you start saying, you know, death might be kind of amazing. Oh, God forbid you should start saying that. God forbid you should start talking about like, ah, this is incredible, I get to die. That's next on the menu. I got to have orgasms. I got to have great food. I got to enjoy the experience of a career and a job and falling in love and up next, the bubble pops and I become part of the, what in this book I'm reading by Lama Suryadas called Awakening the Buddha Within. It's called, oh God, it's the base luminescence is how it's described in Buddhism as a kind of clear light that is all things. The base is a clear light and that's what you transform back into a kind of formless orgasmic field that is somehow still aware of itself. The great relief, the final fucking orgasm, this whole life was just a hand job and death is the money shot as you blast your soul all over the face of eternity, as the Buddha said. Yeah, I mean, it would be nice to have a release from, there's a certain part of your consciousness that accepts that life, that you are an idiot. There's a feeling, there's a deathbed realization that you would look back on your life and be like, oh my God, I ran over here and then I went over there and I worked so hard to sort of run up this mountain and build this totem pole to my own ego and I was such a fucking fool. And I wasted the time I had on earth. But then in that realization in your hospital bed too, you're like, but I'm not, I can't transcend that idiocy. I'm still that idiot. I would do it all again, I'd fuck it all up again. So death would be a kind of a welcome release of that idiocy. Well yeah, two things in what you're saying there. One of them is based on the concept of limitation. So in one version, it's like, God, this whole precious life, I blew it. And then the other thing is that it's like, when a child brings you a drawing, you don't look at the drawing and say to the child, you fucking idiot. Did you? But you want to. Usually you're like, it's sweet. That's all. The baby drew a picture. And usually the picture, what you call this false idol, what did you call it to your ego? Like a erroneous totem pole or something. Yeah, usually the little drawing that the kid made is an erroneous expression of mommy, daddy, I love you. And you look at it and you think, oh, that's sweet, man. That's sweet. So in the same way, if you're trapped in your identity in any phase of your life, that's where you will be like, you fucking moron. Did you picture the most cruel, wise, like father figure just like patting the kid on the back and sending him off to play and being like, you'll never learn anything, you idiot. Good luck in the world. But how sweet is that? That is so sweet. I mean, the problem is, well, the problem is it's probably all very sweet. And everything you're dreading, you should be looking forward to. And when, or really not looking forward, I mean, you should just be in the moment and know. Because really, it's like, OK, when a person has no money and they get money, they get an artificial enlightenment. So you have no money and you get money. It's very similar to getting artificial milk versus breast milk. So you get this pseudo feeling of, OK, now I'm all right. I can relax now. You might have that for a few seconds. Then you got to get more money because it always runs off. So in the same way, there's wisdom that you can start cultivating where you realize that you always have enough, no matter what. And that this is not a thing that is trapped in your body. And that crazy idea is the song of the mystic. And when you hear it, it sounds like bullshit until you start experiencing it. And then all of a sudden, all of these weird tendencies to denigrate yourself or to look at what you're doing is this foolish series of dumb things, which it is. It is from one level. When you see kids playing make believe, if you look at it from one perspective, it's like, you fucking idiots, you're not cops. You're not bandits. You're not Indians. Oh, you really think you're an astronaut? You're not. You're wearing a fucking bed sheet moron. Wake up. On one level, it's like that. But on another level, it's like you're just playing around. And this is why it's so funny to me, man. I love the more I start thinking in this line, you always get these amazingly upset essays by people debating over whether God is good. And it's always like, how could a God that loved us do so many terrible, terrible things to us? How could a God that loved allow these awful things to happen in the world? And that is from the perspective of a very limited, temporal understanding of what it is to be a human being and the conceptualization that your identity is based on having a body. But the moment all of that kind of evaporates and you realize this just seems to be a bit of spiritual, amphibious acrobatics as we explode from some unknown realm into this one, then it no longer seems like you're an asshole because you tried to do a couple of flips before you fell back into the sea. It's just like, yeah, that makes sense. I see why you did that. And that's when you start treating yourself in that way. Oh, fuck. Everything sweetens up, man. It's like everything. And people who formerly seemed like absolute assholes just start seeming like they're caught in a dumb game of make-believe. And I like that POV. And you know what? If it's wrong, who cares? You texted me from Maui and you sent a picture of you kind of lying in the sand or something. And you said, being down here is really surreal. It's so calm and it magnifies how crazy I really am. Oh, yeah. What is that kind of an extension of a little bit of what we're talking about, that the howling specter of all the troubles of the world are really just like inside our psychology and the world itself. Maui is this picture of the benevolent graceful force of our environment, but the problems are within us. Yes, for sure. Because you're surrounded by beauty. We spend a few days in the fucking four seasons. And that place is just like you really are being treated like some kind of sultan at that place. They've got it all fine-tuned, man. And so there's a pool at the Four Seasons in Maui called the Serenity Pool. And it's funny that they call it that. So I've been eating marijuana. And I think when I texted you, I was experiencing that terrible ramp up when you realize that you have ingested way more than you thought you have. So the roller coaster hill is a lot higher that you're going up than you expected to go up. And what I was experiencing was the end result of months and months and months of freaking out over this tour I had to do in that momentum still pushing me. So my poor fucking brain having nothing to do was now coming up with ridiculous things for me to do. Like, oh, you better get some sunscreen. Should we go get another margarita? I don't know. Shit, maybe I should get up and get in the hot tub. I hope I'm making the most of this. Am I making the most of this? I think I am. I've got to relax. You're not making the most of it. You're not relaxed at all. Look at you. Look at you. You're a wild spring. You'll never relax again. You think you're going to relax? You're not going to fucking relax. If you can relax here, how are you ever going to fucking relax? You're going to be freaked out for the rest of your life. So that's all the mind. That's getting caught up in the mind. And the moment you drop out of that down into the heart, everything's like, ah, this is fucking great. But then you pop back into the mind. So yeah, that was what I was experiencing is I was like making a kind of weird, erratic, frenetic series of rounds in the serenity pool from the hot tub to pool to fucking thing and fucking get the fucking thing. And oh, should we put the umbrella up? I think we're getting burnt. Am I getting burnt? Doesn't seem like it. That's when I'm like, oh, this is insanity. You're fucking insane. But it's always going to be there, man. So does that mean that, to some extent, like life is you sit somewhere on the spectrum and you slide back and forth in life where you're distracting yourself with enough stuff that you are not focusing on the confusion of all these kind of schizophrenic voices. And so you feel really productive or you drop out of that productivity and that distraction and you start to be haunted by the sort of void behind it all. Yeah, but it's a yeah, but you get a yeah, but. So it's like what'll happen is you'll float into the, really the clear light is a pretty great way to describe it. There's a field of love. It sounds so crazy, but there is. And it's endless. And when you tune into it, everything's fine, no matter what's going on. And as long as you stay tuned into it, things are incredible. Like you're like, my god, this is the best day of my life. Nothing really needs to be going on. It could be anywhere. It could happen in traffic. It could happen in Hawaii. It could happen right after you have a great meal. It can happen when you're hungry. You tune into this thing and it's like, oh, shit. It's the undiscovered country. Shambhala, the fountain of youth, the city of gold, the Ark of the Covenant, the Grail Cup, the thing they all talk about. And you find it and you're there and you're like, oh, this is it. This is the most revolutionary state of consciousness. It transcends all economies. It transcends all power structures, all governments. Nothing can control it. It can't be moderated, can't be metered out, can't be bought, can't be sold. You experience it and then, yeah, but my fucking back hurts. Yeah, but, yeah, but remember what that guy fucking did to me? Yeah, but I'm dying. Yeah, but I'm getting old. Yeah, but I'm balding. Yeah, but I'm whatever it may be. Whatever your particular little anchor that's holding you to suffering is, comes in. So that pulls you out of it. You get caught up in a mind spiral. You stay in the mind spiral for as long as you happen to get floated through the goddamn thing and then you'll find yourself right back at that place again. Oh, shit, there's that place again. Wait a minute. Oh, shit. And then, so it's like these places you could almost look at as punctuation marks in the novel of your life. They're like punctuation marks in paragraphs of sorrow that you're writing about your life story and every once in a while you'll end in. Now a lot of people don't even know they're doing it. They'll just be all of a sudden like, what a day. This is great. And they don't even know they're enlightened in that moment. And then they're like, ah, fuck. Are you fucking shitting me? And then they're gone again. It's so cool though. And I think the practice you could say is to extend those, to one, become aware of when you're there. And two, become aware when you're not there. And then start extending that being there longer than the not being there. And that's the game, I guess. Yeah, I take rollin' the clock back. I remember I've been thinking about since I got here and I picked up this little interview you did and somebody's asking you about the world being a perfect place or something like that, which takes me right back to 1997 and 98, all the conversations we were having right then. And without giving too much history behind it, I remember lying on the top of a car at night out on the farm at the college with three different guys that you knew. And they were kind of just talking about their various frustrations in a very normal way, nothing heavy or anything. And I remember just kind of interrupting one of them looking at the sky. And this was in my religious period where I was on fire and preaching this gospel. And I just said something like, would there be anything that stops you from thinking the world is a perfect place? Like, look at it, it's perfect, right? It was kind of, it sounded a little bit cocky. It came off a little bit cocky. But I was trying to be very matter of fact and kind of playing about it just to see what their reaction would be. And they essentially all three said, like, what if we kicked your ass right now? Hilarious. They were pretty mad. They were kind of like, like. You'll piss people off if you dare talk about the innate beauty of the universe. That wasn't my job for a year there. I was pissing the campus off. You pissed me off too, man. I didn't know it back then. I was like, fuck you. This world's shit. Well, that was that's it's funny to me now to like pull into LA and and come to your house. And and once again, I feel like this gospel trades back and forth between us, you know, it's like, but the central point way more powerful than really anything the hard Christians were saying or any of the any of the Buddhist stuff we were playing with seems to be the central point seems to be the idea that the world is perfect. That seems to transcend all these other, you know, somebody rattling on about some scripture or something. So does that seem kind of like in a way? I find it so interesting that somebody was asking you maybe a little bit about that or maybe even misread it. But in this interview, but does that seem kind of like really? Like if you could condense the central tenant or message that you kind of feel compelled to kind of remind people about, do you think that is the central tenant? That is the tenant. I think that is the tenant. It's all present moment. It's like you you you're you are you find a place and the place is not it doesn't have any GPS coordinates or temporal coordinates. It's a and that is the present moment. And then you find it, you find it, you hear about it first. You hear people saying, I have found a place and it's the most beautiful, infinitely replenishing, infinitely, they call it the fountain of youth, I think, because it's infinitely young and because when you were young, you weren't experiencing youth. You are experiencing the present moment. And so when people look back fondly on their youth, it's not so much the elasticity of their body or the health that they were feeling as much, even though those two do seem to be related to staying in the moment. It was more that they were just there and it feels good. It's romantic. It's infinite. It's never endingly exciting. It's amazing. Not that it's always exciting. I get bored as a kid, but it's like, even the boredom is great. And this is the ecstasy that McKenna was talking about. And that's what everybody's longing for. So this, and it's really a frustrating thing to hear, a fucking present moment. You hear it, people talk about it. It sounds ridiculous, but it's real. There's a reason people yap about this all the fucking time. There's a reason that, but yes, central tenant is in that place, there's a great place. It's really fucking cool. What's better than to get lost and then to be found? And what's better than when you're the thing that finds itself? It's like the greatest predicament to get in and then get out of. It is sexual in a weird way. You're building up tension, releasing the tension, but even sex is, everything's based on it, you know? So it's like, everything great is something that radiates from it as almost a form of echo or imitation. So everything great is sort of originating from it. And the thing itself is hilarious. Always dying, always being reborn. Every time it dies, there's a sadness. Every time it's reborn, there's a joy. And it's an incredible, never-ending cycle that's pretty and that's just beautiful. I mean, this is the guru. The guru becomes that. So like some people become that they just, that's all they are is the voice for that. And they're not, and that's why people get really frustrated with gurus because they don't follow any rules. There's no, actually, I was just listening to, God, I fucking love Christian radio. I always have it on in my car. Sometimes it's absolutely insanely idiotic, but sometimes it's really smart. So this was a sermon on the law of God. And boy, it was fucking boring at first because it was talking about like Old Testament law versus New Testament law. It was Jesus, when Jesus came to the world, did that negate the previous 10 commandment style, Jehovah law, then we no longer need to follow it or did it underline it? Did it, or is Jesus like the fermentation of the thing? And so they talked about in medieval times, there was a wonderful debate or a controversy called Xlex, not Xlex. That's what I got, Xlex, which is, is there, does God have to follow the law, right? If God is the thing creating the law, does God then have to follow that same law or is God lawless? So that's the philosophical debate. And so the answer is everything God does is the law. Everything that this, if you wanna use the word God does is a perfect expression of truth. And so that is the present moment. Everything that happens in the present moment is a perfect expression of truth. And that is the law. The present moment is the only law, that's it. Whatever's happening right now is the law of the land. It's the law of the universe. It contains within it all the laws of quantum physics discovered and undiscovered. It contains within it all potential energy forms or all energy forms discovered and undiscovered. It contains within it every single thing is completely like a compacted data set stored within the present moment. So anytime you're there, you are a flowering of the truth. And anytime that you find yourself distracted by the past or the future, then you sin. You break the law because you're not there anymore. And what is the fucking punishment for sin, Emil? What is the punishment for sin, Emil? Tell me, tell me, Emil. Wearing uncomfortable sandals. Yeah. The punishment for sin is death. And so when you're not in the present moment, you're dead. That's the only time you can really die. When you're not in the present moment, what the fuck are you? You're not anywhere. You're just dead. You're not living, you're dead. When you're not drinking from the fountain, you're dead. And that's it. And so it's really beautiful when you realize all the people yapping about God were just talking about the present moment. Yeah, I think, I mean, the darkest corners of our, our little crises that we've had in our lives don't seem so bad, so idiotic, or so regretful, but the thing that really frustrates me the most is if I really wasted any time struggling with them. It's like, you know, you're basically saying and affirming that like the hardest times of our life weren't bad. That's right. You know, so having a crisis, like a religious crisis, or some sort of nervous breakdown, you know, where you hide away and can't function, can't eat or something for months. You know, you are malfunctioning, basically. Your body and your mind are malfunctioning. On a God's eye view, you're not malfunctioning. It's just part of this hero's journey that, you know, it's just a crucial part of it, a very important part. But there are elements of the struggling against it that appear to waste time. And that's what frustrates me the most. You know what I mean? Yeah, struggling against it. Yeah. So there's in Buddhism, there's three poisons. And I can remember two right now, but attachment, of course, but the other poison is aversion. That's a poison. So that feeling of resistance to what's happening is poisoning your experience of what's happening. So you're fighting against, you're just fighting. You sing about this sometimes. Some of your songs, man, it's like that great song. Why did you try to control something that's pointless to try to control? While the universe, what is it? While the universe tries to expand, it won't do what you want, meet your demands. That's such a great line, man. And that sums it up. That sums it up. It's like, it's pointless. Your struggle against what's happening is as ridiculous as a baby trying to touch the moon. Like you can't do it, man. It's not gonna, but you can. You can go ahead and do, have the tantrum. We're just talking about a tantrum. Like when you see the kid with the good parents who let the kid have the tantrum, who just let the kid do the thing, let the kid go down in the sand, let the kid roll around, let the kid scream, let the kid convulse, let the kid seize up, let the kid relax, let the kid sleep, let the kid wake up and then hold that baby and kiss it. And it's great. And that's it. That's what happens to us. Those nervous breakdowns you're talking about are so important and so wonderful in retrospect. But dude, check this out. One of the teachers at this retreat said something that really stuck with me. They actually sang a song as these Hawaiian women who sang a song about how Leo, a writer, is her name. But she said in the song, she's like, whatever's happening right now, you're gonna forget it. You're mostly just forgetting it. So you're living in a forgotten dream. You're living in a forgotten memory right now. So all the stuff that you think is so important, you won't remember 99% of it anyway. So that's the whole beautiful truth of what's really going down here is it's like all this importance, play the game. It's not an invitation to become an apathetic, disconnected being. You can play the game. It's just, you don't have to be in sorrow the whole time that you're playing the game. You don't have to. And what's interesting too, when you're talking about it, worrying about the times you struggled, the moment you worry about the times you struggled, you're struggling still. Yeah. I think it is, I mean, to be fair though, I think it is there's something to be said for learning and processing and being able to apply having learned from knowing what is a waste of time. True that. You know, I mean that, it's like in record digging, I've learned it the hard way. You start out and you're in Prague and you're like flipping through these records. You're like, I'm never gonna see these again. I'm never gonna see them ever again. And so you spend all this money and you get home and you immediately experience this weird wave of humiliation as you're putting them on. You're like, what did I see in this one? And the next one, what did I like about this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you have this strange process of the seduction and then the let down. You know, and so as time years go by, the more you've made these mistakes, you learn to like look at something that seduces you and go, I don't need that. Right. You know, and I really think that is something that you take away from the summation of these failures. And that is an unappetizing state of being for a lot of people who want, who associate being in desire of a thing with being happy so that people have actually begun to confuse their hunger with satiation. And so that's where you really start getting into trouble is where you started thinking like, this always needing a thing is the right way to feel. And that's where you, that's what I was texting you about being crazy. It's like in these, in this moment where everything I need is right there in the most magnified, garish, almost embarrassing way, even then I'm not satisfied. And so this is the, this is the hilarious part of getting what you want is like, oh, you wanted all this, here you go. And that's why there's a hell in Tibetan Buddhism called the hell of hungry ghosts where the beings have an insatiable appetite but really tiny long necks so that they can't get food down but there's all the food that they want. And so it's clearly just a metaphor to talk about the predicament that people get into where they start confusing their appetite with the feeling of being full. And when they are full, they don't like it because they think that being hungry is the best way to be. And so it's your, you actually find yourself trying to avoid that sense of sinking into life because you consider it to be boring. Yeah, that happens to me daily. Some people are probably assume it's like a Western way of thinking but I think it's just a big part of how consciousness plays a little trick on you. Yeah. So I find myself doing that too. And the irony is that you texting me this sort of message of insecurity or something. I think insecurity is a really profound word. Yeah. But like you texting me this message, it reminded me of myself so much. It made me feel weirdly good to know someone else feels that way. Is out in this perfect environment and is only, it's brought them closer to reflecting on like their own flaws or something. I think that's a really interesting metaphor. But I've spent so much of my life like, floating on a raft in a beautiful beach and just looking out at everything and wondering if it was real, you know? And I just, it's, maybe, you know, maybe there's a truth to that question and that feeling and that sensation. Maybe that's not an erroneous state of mind, you know, to wonder if it's real. But part of it, the weird shade of sadness over it is when you're in that situation, you're looking at it and you're like, I'm not even enjoying this. That's a different thing and that sucks. Well, yeah, I mean, it is, well, this is why, you know, one of the things that came up with this retreat they were talking about is like, why a practice? Why do you have to fucking meditate? You know, it's so annoying. And so the reason is just what we're talking about here. It's like, the reason they call it a practice is because you're practicing for when you're out on that fucking raft. So the next time you find yourself out on the raft, you don't have to be like covered in a psychological aluminum foil or whatever you've like coated yourself in that's separating you from the experience. Because every day, at some point in your day, you're sitting down and connecting with reality or at least making the attempt to connect with reality. And then over time, you can do that no matter what environment you're in. But the interesting part of that process is that the more you do that, the more you realize the environment is absolutely meaningless. And that's why since this retreat, I've been meditating again and you like right away, they're, oh fuck, there it is. Now this, I'm not, how is it that sitting in front of a picture of Neem Karoli Baba burning a fucking candle in my house, I feel more at peace than I do drinking fucking my ties and some kind of nice fancy dumb, dumb bar in Hawaii. And it's just what, it's the reason is because this feeling is not something that has anything to do with reality. Reality is running down the feeling like droplets of water running down a window. It's, this is the thing behind all things. And the more you connect with that, the more that insanity diminishes in all forms of the insanity, including regretting the insanity diminish, all forms diminish when you, when you all forms of suffering diminish when you come home. And that's what they call it, coming home. This is the story of the prodigal son. This is the story of the ultimate forgiveness of the universe. Cause what happens is the prodigal son returns home after going out into the world and fucking and getting sick and being an asshole. And the father doesn't reject the son, but it's like, I love you. You're fine. You're fine. You're fine. I love you. You're upset over nothing. You've come home. I'm glad to see you. Welcome back. Let me fucking give you everything now. You poor fucking thing. When your dog runs away and comes back, you're not saying to the dog, oh, you filthy mongrel. How dare you leave this house? You're like, I love you. You're back. You're back. And I think in the same way, the return to that place is a very similar thing. And when you're on a mushroom trip, quite often you'll be faced with the ridiculous predicament of having the universe anthropomorphized through the psilocybin, telling you, I love you. And you're like, how can you fucking love me? I'm filthy. And that's the conversation. And eventually you've got to do the same thing any good rescue dog does. When it's adopted, you got to stop growling and then sink into that moment. And it's so blissful and true and real. And so yeah, that's the practice, man, is like learning how to accept the love instead of fight against it. When in light of like the dichotomy of being at home and kind of safe and like in kind of a repose, versus the big tour you were just on, that being like the biggest tour you've ever been on, did you, were you out there? And did you feel some levels of like total comfort in the fact that that's another form of the same thing? Like that that's a natural way of being or was it a natural way of being, but a natural way of kind of serving the same thing you would be doing at home kind of in meditating or did you feel like it was distinctively a different activity and a different challenge and something that was very like maybe exhausting? It was exhausting, but it was also the endless, I mean, the endless lesson is the pattern of the tour was, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, it's coming, it's coming, it's a month away, it's a fucking month away. Do I have the material? Am I gonna be able to do this? Am I gonna have to do 25 shows in a fucking row? Are you kidding? What if they hate me? What am I gonna do? I wanna reflect what I've been saying on the podcast. What if I revert to old shitty stew? It was like this like fear, terror, terror, fear, fear, fear, fear, bliss, this is so fun. Oh my God, oh my God, this is the greatest fucking thing ever. Oh my God, I love this. Over, it's over, what? That whole thing for six months I was dreading is now done. It's over, like it never happened because it didn't because there's no time, you know? And I'm creating these fucking, I'm creating all of this turbulence for my attachment or aversion. And that's the thing that's giving my life a sense of, that's giving my life a feeling of progression. That's just a joke. And so, but yeah, it was beautiful. The tour was beautiful. And during the tour, I was experiencing moments of peace and which was pretty cool because generally with stand-up, I have been always freaked out in the day. But with this all of a sudden, it was just more of like, okay, you know, we're doing this now, we're doing, it felt great. But again, it's not related, I mean, I don't think it's necessarily related to circumstance. Though circumstance doesn't hurt. It's nice to have things lined up and you don't wanna be a hoarder. You don't wanna be laying in cat shit or whatever. But in the same way, you don't wanna trick yourself into thinking that it's the fucking nipple theory, which is you either realize that the entire universe is a nipple, that you can suck on and experience the nectar of the divine mother, or you pretend that there are multiple nipples broken up into specific configurations of circumstance that will produce the milk you need to feel happy. And the former makes you feel great all the time. The latter makes you a fucking dick because you're like protecting the nipple. You're gonna put a fence around the nipple. You're gonna tell the nipple not to wear that fucking dress when she goes out. You're gonna look in the nipples phone. You're gonna try to get other people who are going, you know, not just with relationships either. It's like, you're gonna fucking try to like, your job, your career, you're gonna start thinking that everyone's out to get you. Sure, you know, that's the difference of perspectives that one leads to a kind of embarrassing joy. And the other leads to an embarrassing, hilarious parade of endless humiliations as you parade around in whatever outfit or uniform you've decided to wear, guarding a nipple when you're in a garden of nipples. It's so funny. It's like, stay away from this one. Man, Emil, it's so cool hanging out with you. We just took a break, everybody. We're working on this album and it is so cool. It's so fun to do. You're a musical genius. We're close to actually closing it down so we can kind of, you know, actually manufacture it. So, well, I guess we'll have some more news on that soon. It's really cool seeing the process, man. It's a fascinating thing. I have no familiarity with. It's really interesting to see how precise a process it is. It's kind of a crazy thing to try to do is to control sound. Like, why would you do that? Yeah, right. Yeah, it's a really weird thing when you consider like all the stuff. I'm just like, you're really good at making stuff appear. You're a manifester. You're good at bringing stuff out of the imagination into the world. I get stuck at that point where I'll think a bunch of cool shit but then making it actually happen. Outside of this podcast, it's really like, I always get distracted in the process but you're really focused. But isn't that your, isn't that sort of the lifeblood of the podcast is that your brain just happens to be able to fire on this super rare frequency where it just, you know, you're not even thinking about, oh, I have to fill up all this content or whatever. It just, that's something that you do. It's not easy too. I'm sure people know that it's not so easy to do. Yeah, I guess that's it, man. But yeah, I mean, the podcast is awesome. But shit, spending all this time coming up with chords, like making music, there's so many things. There's so many intersecting bits of information and knowledge you have to have. You don't even realize it, I'm sure. Do you? It just seems like a natural thing because you've been doing it forever. Yeah, I mean, you take in all this information when you're a kid, maybe you look from the outside, you probably look like a slacker, but you're taking in so much information about the sound of crickets at night in North Carolina or something we were going through that we, it ends up being applicable later. You know, like with your math teacher always tells you, like you're gonna have to, you're gonna wanna use this later and you never do, ever. But that whole time you weren't listening to her, you were looking out the window and you were absorbing all this other stuff that you did end up using. Isn't that cool? That's something I, someone, I can't remember who says it, someone about comedy. One of the sayings is, you will use everything. You will eventually use everything you know. And I guess it's true for any art that you end up or anything you do in life. You do everything that, it's interesting. Everything that you think is an unimportant thing quite often is fertilizer from something that grows out of you later. Well, it seems especially true for like a writer or a comedian who their commodity is, you know, maybe potentially using the humiliating circumstances of their past. Right. You know, this one like has a bit start. This one time I was going on street, you know, whatever. It's just all anecdotal, which I really like about the potential of podcasts. But I suppose that's the wager you're taking is like, this will hopefully be interesting to someone else if it's, if it marked a great turning point in my life or something. Yeah, that is the, I think that's kind of where faith comes in, where you get to make the decision when whatever happens in your life while it's happening, you can either decide, this is it. This is the grenade that I fell on top of that's going to blow me to smithereens. Or you could think, this is the thing that's going to destroy all of the bullshit and leave what I really am behind. It's going to be something down the line that is completely useful for me or for other people. This is why, like you never hear this story. You'll never hear this story. Today, I went to Starbucks and I ordered a latte and it was an iced latte. I paid the clerk, got back in my car and drove away. You'll never hear that fucking story because who cares? But you will hear, dude, I went to Starbucks today and a dude punched me in the fucking face who was on PCP. You will hear that story because you know what I mean? Those are the, those moments that, I guess I'll sum up this podcast. These moments that we're avoiding are actually the great moments. They're every moment's a great moment. That's the whole point. Or I guess the point is there aren't multiple moments. They're just one moment that we're breaking up into a series of stories that we tell ourselves to give a feeling of having an identity. Is that the point? I don't remember the point. Yeah, no one ever can. I mean, seriously, I think sometimes about my friend who's a bit of, he owns a label I work with and, you know, he was said once something like, I heard somewhere that, you know, the attempt to write the best song is just the extension of the old world craft of like, the challenge of who can tell the best story or something, you know, and whether or not people take anything away from it, I don't even, like you're implying it. I'm not even sure exactly what matters, you know? I think we're just, we're sort of like, just the feeling of being seduced and pulled into something that feels like it matters is maybe what's actually important. I mean, and feeling like you're engaged. I mean, if we're acknowledging that life is largely an illusion a lot of the time, then it seems a little, I don't know, like there's some hubris to suggesting that like, everything is this very pointed attempt to make something that matters, you know? But if I enjoy the sound of your voice, it's kind of like my songs is like there, you know, you can read criticisms of people being like, I don't know what this is about, or actually that was an old girlfriend of mine was like, I don't even know what these songs are about, you know? Which is a pretty, that's a pretty damning criticism to a songwriter, that hurts pretty bad, I guess. But it's hard to say how much that matters when, you know, these art forms are just reflections of the sifting through process, the taking stock process of life. And unfortunately, although the labelhead might want it to be about something definitively and like the product needs to be kind of shaped into something that looks like a very sort of focused, cohesive product, what if none of it really is? What if it's really just all these unorganized vibrations that just keep kind of rippling through time and you just kind of moan for a while and it feels good? I love it. It reminds me of that amazing video of that stalker talking to John Lennon, who's been living in his yard and John Lennon is like, they're just songs. And the guy's so disciplined, it's the most disappointing thing. Right, right. Because you want John, you would want someone to say. He thinks he's found the Wizard of Oz or something. Yeah, like these are authentic. Right. Moats of true God-inspired truth. These are the 10, every one of my songs is like one of the 10 commandments, brother. Yeah, that's what people want. It's so frustrating. And again, man, this is the difference, I think, between wise people and cult leaders is that a wise person tells you, not to keep using my nipple symbol, but a wise person will tell you, man, this is just, this is not the source. This is just one of many sources, an infinite field of sources that you can pick from. And a fucking cult leader is like, this is it, man. Yeah, that's where you know that you see the, the Maharishi or Rajni, you see the red flag go up is when they kind of give the exclusivity factor. That's it. Yeah. That's where you, the moment you do that, you have tiptoed into the gardens of Satan. And you know why they do it? Because it prays, it's perfect capitalism. It prays on the ego of the consumer, because they're like, I, I know. I found the way. Yeah. Only me, I figured it out. I found the doorway. I just paid for it. Yeah, it's the only true path. Yeah, see, that sucks. Don't ever do that. And not only with religion, philosophy, music, with anything, whenever you're telling someone, you know, the classic thing, if you're in a fight and you're breaking up and you're like, you'll never find another person like me. It's so, it's like such a wretched thing to believe or to tell someone, I'm the only nipple you will ever find true sustenance from, you will starve. It's all bad. And if you tricked yourself into thinking, a person, place or thing is the only way, then you're in hell. Then you have to be in hell. It's like that guy, oh God, I just saw this incredible video. This fucking guy was in an air bubble in a sunken cruise ship for three days. And these divers are filming. And like, you can hear the divers are talking and he finds, you know, he sees the guy from the waist down. And of course, you just think it's a body. He's like, I've got one. And the guy's like, you got a body? And he's like, no, he's alive. And you hear the, whoever's running the show be like, oh fuck, because they knew the person had been in this air bubble for three fucking days in an air bubble in a cruise ship, thinking that they were just gonna die because that's the only air. So in the same way, if you find yourself attached to the idea that any person, place or thing is the only source of your happiness, then you're like a person stuck in a cruise ship air bubble and you can't fucking enjoy it. You're gonna be freaking out because you think the air is gonna eventually run out. And I think that's like the Bodhisattvas, the teachers, the gurus, the true ones are the ones who swim into that little air bubble. And they're like, here, let me show you something. I'm gonna take you to the giant fucking air bubble we call Planet Earth where there's air everywhere. They take you out of your little minuscule shit air bubble and they take you into a place where it's like, oh no, you never had to be afraid. There's air everywhere. Yeah, I think it's hard to discern inside the message and pull apart what's really seductive, almost too seductive about a really well-delivered message. And so when the guy is sitting down with John Lennon, he is, in his hands, the Beatles songs are like, these permanent, eternal proclamations or something. But I was just, I'm finishing this book, one of the greatest Beatles books I've ever read and I've read a lot of them. It's called Many Years From Now and it really diagrams the beginning of the Beatles, which is something I never really spent that much time thinking about. I found myself so fascinated with their pre-London days before they were really cool and it explains a lot of their psychology by letting you understand that coming down from Liverpool, they always define themselves as just like street kids and not cool and kind of assimilating into the coolness of London. And my point is in the quest to become what they became, they really came from, not necessarily trying to be commercial, but there was a jingle, there was a jingle aspect to how well those songs are written and how simple they are. So when you dissect a lot of those early like McCartney lyrics, they're kind of hollow. And I'm a massive McCartney fan and I don't think that's necessarily a really bad thing to say, but the I wanna hold your hands and stuff, they're kind of cooked up. You see what I'm saying? Like in a Brill building kind of songwriter team way, they're cooked up to like sell you something a little bit and that's not because of anything bad. It's because they loved that kind of music and that was the period of that coming out of the 50s as they were trying to slowly build what they became. That was that period of like great short pop songs. And so you see the point I'm making is that like the kid coming into Lennon's house is having trouble discerning the seductive quality of the message itself because it's so well delivered. So these songs are so economically tightly crafted that they're so fucking good and there's some sort of really indescribable magic to the melodicism of them that, I mean who wouldn't be kind of tricked into thinking this is the voice of God. It's like so perfect. So we start to lust and all young people do lust after things and cut ourselves in their shape. You think about how much of life has spent imitating everything. Like you are really just a carbon copy of other things. Yes. And yeah, that is the funny thing whenever there's like a Justin Bieber, there's like legions of dudes who start cutting their hair like Justin Bieber, it creates these hilarious echoes through the biosphere, the human part of the biosphere where it's just all these imitation Bieber's pop up, all these imitation things go rolling down from these strong personalities. It's really hilarious. And that is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita, what a great man does, others will follow. And so whenever you have that, yeah, it's so interesting, isn't it? It does create a crazy imitative ripple through society. Yeah, and you want, but the main thing is that yearning, right? That's the main thing. You want something to be definitively God. You want some, whatever it may be. We are a species that has the inclination to worship false idols. It's a hilarious part of our species. No other species has this tendency that I can think of. You don't see dolphins constructing, you know, not that they could, but you don't see any being, you don't see monkeys making stone bananas and worshiping them. They just eat the fucking bananas. They're directly connected to nature. But we want a fucking symbolic grail cup filled with the essence of God. And for that to work, we have to have things that aren't God. We have to have things that aren't blessed. To really pull off idolatry, you need to have things that aren't good or blasphemous or unclean. Then you can really get off on your suck, suckling away at the fucking pseudo-nipple you've constructed out of the ocean of milk that you happen to be floating in. That's the fucking weird fetishy game everybody's playing. It's hilarious. It's so funny. I love looking through all the stuff that I think I have to have, I must have to be happy. Cause guaranteed every single, almost everything that you're thinking of, you don't really need, including your breath. That was another thing that Lama Suriados in this great book was saying, he was, this guy's really fucking cool, man. He, he's a Tibetan Lama. He's, I think he's maybe the only American Tibetan Lama, but when he was a kid, he went and studied with these, with a bunch of different teachers and some of them were these Tibetan Zogchen teachers and one of the teachers asked him, how do you meditate? And he said, well, I focus on my breath going in and out. And this teacher said, what will you focus on when there's no more breath? Is it really cool? Oh. Really cool, man. And that, you know, that, that, that's the frustrating, that's the frustration is that you, you want an imaginary friend. You want a pacifier, whether it's in the form of some fucking music that you think's incredible, or a religion that you think's incredible, or a person that you think's incredible. It's all just pacifiers tricking you, tricking you, tricking you into believing that there is, you're not part of everything. It's a, it's a great game. It's fun. It's fetishy. It's fed, it's like having a foot fetish or something. It's a different form of fetish, but it's, and fetishes are great. I love them, but still it's just a fetish. It's just a game you're playing with yourself to avoid. Yeah, I don't even know if you, if it's as deep as like human beings even needing an answer or like a meaning, as much as just the temporal scientific law that, you know, you have to act. You have to walk in a direction. You just want a direction to go in, you know? It's easy to forget that like, you're just a materialization for a small amount of time, you know? Right, right, right. So that materialization, I've walked down the street every day and think it's like the fundamental stuff as our teacher used to call it in college, is like this rushing river of just, you know, somewhat chaotic just grouping of elements. And so you just like dip a cup down into this river of elements and just pull it up. And that's a person, just a random materialization of elements. And that doesn't really mean there's any great meaning to their existence or anything. It's just a collection of chemicals exploding for a time being and then it's gone, you know? So it just seems kind of like that person as a waking ego just really needs a direction to walk in. Some narrative, just something they can believe in and sort of trust, but it largely seems like it's a very brief script and then it's gone. It's not even there, it's barely there, but it is a bubble. I mean, what you are talking about is for life to exist, there has to be cells. Cells are bubbles. We're just a bunch of bubbles that have congealed together in the form of a human being. And when that bubble pops in the form of death, you do become that river of who knows what? A quantum flow of energy that our neurology at this moment is differentiating in the forms of colors, shapes, sounds. But really when the bubble pops, it's just back into the luminescence as it's called. I think clear light is a great word for it. But when the bubble pops, this is the question, you know? And everyone's freaking out over. But yeah, is it the whole meaning game? I mean, which is a fun game, but meaning is such a drag. And whenever anything gets a lot of meaning attached to it, it's always gonna embarrass you. You know, you're pretty much gonna get embarrassed by any God. When I think about that, I'm trying to think of like, oh God. Let me go on like a blister in the sun. Let me go on. When I first heard that fucking song, I'm like, that is me. Yeah, that song is me, man. That sums it up. Oh, fuck yeah. When I'm walking, when I'm walking, I strut my stuff and I'm so strung out. I'm high as a kite. Oh, fucking, that is it, man. That's how I feel. He's singing about being fucking high. He's like a blister in the sun. It's me. And then you're so into the song. And then you're like, oh, you know what? I really like this girl. I'm gonna put this on the tape I make for her so that she can hear who I truly am. And so you put blister in the sun on a tape that you give to a girl that you like because you think it sums you up as a being. And so later down the line, you're only gonna be embarrassed. You're like, oh my God. Blister in the sun is not the synopsis of my life anymore because there can be no synopsis. That's the whole thing. And that's like the goal. Anytime you're worshiping the golden calf, you will be embarrassed. You will be embarrassed. You must be embarrassed. Yeah, it makes you feel mean to even realize that that's going on all the time, all around you. People identifying their entire realities with their look or something. Yeah. You know, it makes you feel mean to see through it. And you're like, you're not that. Yeah, you think you're that, but you're definitely not that thing. Like that thing is a stupid thing to, it doesn't sum you up like your song analogy. You're not the tattooed dude. You're not the fucking, you're not the badass lady who's like not afraid to do whatever the fucking thing it is. You're not the badass guy who's like, you're not a fucking astronaut. You're not a fucking whatever it is. You're not a president. Let's face it, man. You're a bubble in a never ending river, a phenomena that's temporarily become aware of itself and convinced itself of some importance. And you're clinging onto that importance and that's what's causing all your pain. The moment you let go of that clinging, sink into the embarrassment for a little bit. Let yourself be embarrassed. Recognize that you just got caught up in a hypnotic, rhythmic worship of a non-existent God in the form of whatever symbol structure you decided to try to congeal around infinity and then sink into the nothingness and that's where you find love. That's the experience of love. It's that you, you climb out of the biodome, you've constructed of symbols and you realize that the thing you thought you were protecting yourself from was in fact everything you needed, everything you could ever possibly need. And it goes on forever. This is the sigh of relief. They say you take your last breath, that final exhalation. It's a sigh of relief when you realize you're in a river of love, I think. Either that or it's just your breath leaving your body as you go into the void. But I think that it's a sigh of relief, man. It's a big, fat sigh of relief. Shit, I've got my idols. I wish I still, like when I think of, or like Ram Dass, Niam Krolibaba, you know, my friends, my girlfriend, my mom, I still have motes of phenomena that I place a great deal of importance into. I don't think it's anything wrong about it. No, it's weird to think how much unbridled enthusiasm has come through those portals of inspiration or whatever and then, you know, as it happens often, you meet the person later on. And not in your case maybe, but like I could say in some of mine, and they're not the thing you made them into. Not that that's in any way some profound realization. It's exactly the opposite. You're just like this imagery, this visualization that I experienced in encountering this art with stuff going on inside of me maybe, or that I needed to harness and put into something, but all that time spent worshiping at the altar of some imagined icon, it's kind of disgusting, honestly. Like looking at all the think pieces and articles about what David Bowie wore, or like Lou Reed's cool, how to get it, you know? It's like, fuck you. Like it's just such a fucking, it's such a fucking product, you know? And the fact that people just think that they can put it on, literally wear something like he once said, like the clothes make the man or something, there's like, people really think that shit. Yeah. It's frickin' disturbing. Well, they like to turn themselves into movie screens for other people's beauty, and that's okay. I think it's fine. I don't find it disgusting at all. I think it's fun. I think that it's a fun thing to worship somebody for a little while, but it's even more fun to get disappointed, but the question is, when you get disappointed, will you be angry? And if the answer is yes, then you still have a lot to fucking learn, because if when you're disappointed, really, it's just like, ah, okay, yeah, okay. That's the great teaching from all of them, man. I'm trying to think of people who've severely disappointed me. That's a long list. I think that that moment is the birth of an artist, though, because once you realize that someone didn't provide you with the thing you were looking for, that's what gives you the diving board to start off for yourself and articulate what it is you wanted. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. That's the big break, historically, when you've been following a thread and you're part of this cult, which everybody is, whether it's a fashion cult or... Religious cult. Anything, you know, skateboarding cult or... Nationalism. Yeah, right, or Nashville lap steals, you know. Like that's whatever you're over-focused on, this thing that you think's giving you all this joy or whatever, once you experience that break with it, like a little loss of faith, and you know you can do something better or provide something that you weren't getting, that's the birth of a new artist. Or it's where, or the birth of a lunatic. It's a, or you could just go insane. That's, because you hear about this all the time, this does happen, I've heard about it, where like someone will have a stalker, right? And this, or someone will have like an Uber fan, and the Uber fan will inevitably discover some kind of contradiction, something that just doesn't fit into the... Is this happening to you? Not to me, yet. It may be in small ways, it happens. Sometimes like, you'll get into like, you'll email somebody who's emailing you and they'll get really mad, it's something you wrote. And it's just a pure misunderstanding, but usually it's because you're not behaving according to the model that they shoved you into. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I mean? You're not playing the game of Maple Leaf, I wanna play. I want you to play a game of Maple Leaf where you act like the person that I created in my mind that you're supposed to be. I told you about the time in college where the guy who yelled outside of my window, up at my window, that's against everything you stand for. That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that. That, that is it. So all of us at some point or another, maybe not so vocally, will find ourselves yelling up at someone's window, this is not who you are. I want my money back. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Common, very common. And it's a people always find themselves in that predicament. You don't have to be famous to be in that predicament. Just be a human and someone will yell at your window, this is not who you are. And it's a funny situation to get into with people because it's true, you're right. Whatever thing I've done to disappoint you, it's real. I probably fucked up or I did something weird or who knows but the reality is I am a mall Santa and anything that you worship, you turned me into a mall Santa. The moment you made me into a thing that was going to bring you joy in your life that you couldn't bring to yourself, you made me act like a mall Santa. Now I have to play the part of Santa Claus. You're forcing this relationship, which is why I've heard that to put a person on a pedestal is one of the ultimate forms of aggression because you're making them fucking act like they're on a pedestal when there ain't one. And it's not cool. You're forcing them to be a thing that just is higher. It just generally sucks, man. And it can only be bad. Cause when the moment the mall Santa's beard comes off, the baby starts crying. The moment the mall Santa is like, I'm a lie. I'm the manifestation of a gigantic fucking lie perpetrated by corporations to try to sell shit at the end of the year. I'm sorry, but that's just what I am. There's no Santa Claus. Baby's going to get their heart broken. In the same way, anyone acting like anything is putting on a show. They're putting on a show. And the real question is what's the intention behind the show? Some people, the intention behind the show is malicious. Some people, the intention behind the show is some form of wanting the world to be a better place. That's it, but it's still a show. And sometimes the intentions are self-centered, but it's always switching. Intentions don't stay the same. The main thing is go through your mind, think of all the beings that you have decided are holy beings, all the beings that you are worshiping and pushing them off that fucking altar. Let yourself enjoy the incredible, exciting, exhilarating thrill of realizing that you, as I just read in this book by Lamasuryadas, must become a lantern unto yourself. Ooh, that's a fun place to be. That's a scary place to be. It's such an exciting place to be and just hang out there. No one's going to give you the answer. People will remind you of this. This is why I think the spiritual community is so important. It's not because some person is like an envelope containing a sacred glitter that you can throw on your life to make it beautiful. It's just that some people are really good at reminding you that you have all the answers inside of you. That's why we want these conversations. That's why we need the sangha, the satsang, whatever you want to call it. That's why we need the spiritual community, group of good, true friends. It's because they're always going to remind you, it's you, it's in you, it's you. Remember, wake up, wake up, wake up. That's why we do this. That's it. Do you ever have to deal with boardroom meetings or anything? Do you ever have to go in and talk to, I'm trying to think of a parallel for me having to go in and talk to labels and stuff. Pitching shows. Yeah, yeah. You have to pitch shows sometimes or if you have some idea or you go into write a show with people or you have to collaborate on some endeavor like that. You end up having to translate stuff to people. Yeah, that's pretty brutal. That's a brutal, that can be very, that's why the God blessed the internet and the podcast because it's reducing the necessity for those kinds of things. I only bring it up because in parallel to what you were just saying, it's like one of those situations where you kind of, you sort of glimpse what makes the world go around in the ugliest way is that you're talking to someone who's trying to please someone else, who's trying to please someone else, who's trying to please someone else. You know, this endless bureaucratic line of people trying to appease their boss. Yeah. And that boss may not know, like if you enter the world of the music business, the one thing I've learned is that it's just a constant shuffle of turnover of publicists. Yes. So you come in one month and the label is like, we've got Sherry now and she's just amazing. She's incredible what she's been doing lately. She's gonna kill it on your project. And then like clockwork, three months later, well, we decided Sherry just wasn't, it just wasn't a good fit. Yeah, like the emails that you get where people are like, I wanted to let you know that I'm moving on from Warner Brothers, the person that you're about to like sell a project with. Yeah, it's a, what do they call it? It's a fucking rotating, endless parade of executives going from one job to the next. Yeah, I mean, you can't really put the blame on any, like you said, one person or anything, but it's a systemic. Yeah, right, right, right. It's just a very, it's like everything's gotta evolve. It's an old school structure. Everything's gotta evolve. We just don't need it anymore. We don't need it. We don't need the artistic priest class. We don't need it anymore. We need the artistic congregation. We need a collaboration with all people, not someone being the arbiter of what's good or what's bad. That's an illusion. It's the myth of the arbiter. Those don't exist anymore. The people are the arbiter, really, you know? And you don't need a bunch of people anymore. We don't need that. You only need, you don't need the massive percentages to be okay if you're producing stuff these days. Really, you just need to be technologically savvy enough to produce your own stuff and a relatively small number of people to enjoy what you're putting out there and you'll be fine. You don't need 20 million people to appreciate your thing. And that's the stress these fucking record labels and TV companies are operating under. They need millions and millions and millions of people to love the very expensive thing they're putting out there. What a rotten predicament to get at, rotten. Yeah, there was a time when what you were doing wasn't real unless it was on the shelf in shrinkwrap and shit. Yeah, that's right. And so that concept of making something real has been warped and it's like melting into some other future thing. But so maybe it's a good thing that we're waving goodbye to a lot of that systemic arbitration. But then, is that a word? Yeah, sure. And then, but we're losing something in the process too. Right. But you have to give it to the young generation to have to build a new model of integrity, which will happen, it's just that... Well, the model of integrity can't be the boon from the thing that you've put on a pedestal. The model of integrity has got to be the feeling you get when you make something good, that's it. You make something good, you feel good. You make something bad, you don't put it out. That's it. If it feels bad, don't put it out. If it feels wrong, don't put it out. No matter how long you fucking spent working on it, that is the, that's it. The paycheck cannot be when you've hit the exact right configuration of executives to get somebody to give you a check in a contract to put a thing out. The paycheck has got to be that incredible feeling you get when the fucking universe comes pouring out of you temporarily, just pours out of you, like some kind of explosive mystical diarrhea where you've completely lost control. Do you know there's, in Buddhism, sneezing is considered a form of enlightenment or an example of enlightenment, that moment when you lose all control, orgasm and death are the other two. That moment when you're like, bleah, and something's coming out of you and you're done, it comes out of you, you recognize it, oh shit, I just gave birth to a cool little thing, you put it out, let it swim around in the brains of your species and forget about it, that's the fucking paycheck, man. And if money comes from that, if success comes from that, which it generally will, congratulations, icing on the cake, but let me ask you, would you rather have green rectangles covered in masonic symbols, or would you ever have the experience of God's throbbing penis ejaculating ideas out of your heart, because I'll take the latter any day of the fucking week, or vagina, whichever one you wanna use.

All right, here we go. I'm recording this episode from Asheville, North Carolina. I'm here visiting my family. I'm about to head to Hendersonville to play a game of Monopoly with my brother, his wife, my stepdad, and my nephew. So this might be the last you hear of me because there's a likelihood the whole thing could erupt into some kind of bloody brawl with such intense violence and anger that it spreads out from the house like some kind of terrible radioactive wave rolling into the Blue Ridge Mountains, incinerating all the trees, burning up all the animals and leaving North Carolina a smoldering wasteland filled with lumbering radioactive rage zombies, breathing hot black fire out into the sky. The beams coming from the mouths of these demonic zombies will intersect and form a pentagram, which will shoot an iridescent rainbow over America, from which a million Donald Trumps will emerge and attack the remaining human beings on this planet, devouring them and forming one massive Donald Trump, which will shit out a giant Zika virus-laden mosquito, which will inject its probiscous into the planet and cause the planet to give birth to a new, slightly deformed Earth. So that's probably going to happen. If you're hearing this today, that just means the game of Monopoly hasn't started yet. I'm going to jump right into this podcast only because I'm in a hotel and I want to go walk around North Carolina. This is where I grew up. It's beautiful here. I can't believe how happy I feel being back here in North Carolina. Of course, my brain is actively contemplating ways that I could manage to live here. I mean, it's not rocket science. I know I could live here, but how do you do it? Is it possible? Do I become bicoastal? I don't know. But I do love North Carolina. All of you in Asheville, maybe I'll see you when we're walking around. Tweet at me and let me know what's stuff to do around here. The place is incredible now. What happened? It's beautiful. I mean, it's always been beautiful, but now it seems to have really, I don't know, had like gourmet drinks at some fancy French-like bar last night, sovereign prospects or something, some beautiful handcrafted phosphate brew made by a handsome gentleman who seemed to have teleported in from the early 30s. It's incredible. Beautiful place. Go to Asheville. Everyone come here. All right. Well, I guess that's not much of an intro. I really like this episode that you're about to listen to. This is a, I had a kind of breakthrough from this episode from what Aubrey was talking about and I don't want to ruin it. So I'm just going to let you listen to it. But I feel like I do want to ruin it because he was, God, I don't want to spoil the thing. You know what? He's going to describe it better than me. The synopsis of the thing is the concept of the sun. Think of the sun, this beautiful, glowing, incredible, perfect, life-giving orb floating out in space. The sun doesn't care about compliments. The sun doesn't care if it's doing a good job and the sun doesn't care if it's shining its light on monsters or on saints. It's just an ever giving super organism out there in space. And then that idea that Aubrey talked to me about made me start thinking about ways that I could be more like a son, ways that I could be less selfish, ways that I could give more. And if you start thinking about yourself as a son instead of as a hungry, attached, all devouring black hole, then you realize that maybe you realize, I realize that a lot of the shit that was bothering me had nothing to do with my life or people around me or situations and everything to do with my inability to give more than I was giving. The answer is always to give more, generally. That's the paradoxical cure that you hear about in the ever quoted and much maligned book, The Secret, the idea being that if you want more, give more. And it seems ridiculous. It goes against everything that we understand about the way that stuff works, generally. It's not if you output more energy, you don't get more energy back. It seems like it breaks the laws of physics or it goes against my understanding. I like talking about the laws of physics. Nothing more ridiculous than a 42 year old acid head talking about the laws of physics. But I'm going to do it. It seems from my very vague, blurry, kaleidoscopic understanding of physics that putting out more energy should not get you more energy than you put out. In fact, this is the dream of modern civilization. If we could find some kind of engine that brings in more energy than it puts out, then we have perpetual motion. And that idea of perpetual motion is driven in winners crazy forever because if somebody could figure out a way to create an engine that doesn't require more energy input. This is actually, I don't know if you guys remember this or not. I don't know what happened to it. I got really excited about it because a few months ago there was all this ridiculous talk about a brand new engine, a microwave engine that theoretically created thrust from bouncing microwaves inside its conical interior of this weird device that someone had invented. The idea being in space, there's no friction, no resistance, so that if you produce just the smallest amount of thrust, and if you can do that without having to bring fuel, then theoretically you could have a kind of hyperdrive on your spaceship and over a few month period just tiny minute bits of thrust will get a thing in a place where there's no friction, no resistance going super fast. I don't know what happened to that. A lot of people said it was a bunch of bullshit, but my point is this, perhaps there is a kind of metaphysical perpetual motion machine that exists inside the human heart. And if you start experimenting with outputting more energy instead of taking more energy, if you start experimenting with giving more than you think you can give, give away that fucking thing, whatever it is, you know the thing? You definitely got the thing laying around your house, something expensive that you'd never use, but for some reason you keep the thing and you look at it because you think one day I'm going to use that thing. Well, if you experiment with giving that thing away, watch what happens. And the more you start giving away those stupid things and you've got all kinds of those things inside of you, you've got all kinds of these compliments laying around inside your brain that you're not dispensing because you're waiting for the perfect moment to dispense the compliment, the kind word, the smile, the hug, the phone call, whatever it is. You're waiting in the attic of your potentiality. There are all these moldering, mildewed, covered compliments, smiles, waves, happy gestures, gifts of a phone call that you aren't using because you're waiting for the perfect time. And they're up there in your brain attic gathering dust being chewed on by the demon rats of your soul. Look, get them out of there. Nobody, no, a painting sitting in an attic is doing nobody any good. Just try it and then you can start experimenting with becoming a human son. And the sun, I think, if it could gaze upon the earth, which I think it does, I think the sun must look at the earth and be constantly astounded by the effect that its output is having on a formerly dead planet that used to float around it, covered with some kind of warm, briny, dead sea to see the things spring to life must be incredible for that sun. And I think in the same way, if you experiment with becoming a son, you might notice that formerly dead parts of your life, relationships orbiting you, your job, whatever it may be, will suddenly begin to grow tiny little tendrils of hope, of potentiality. And then the more you keep giving out, you will maybe witness all of this new stuff coming into your life, stuff that you never possibly imagine. I know this is the secret. I know. And the secret deserves to be put on a wall and newagers should placed in front of it and poisoned so they projectile vomit all over the book. It's a much reviled book and there's all kinds of problems. But I'm telling you, man, after this episode with Aubrey, and when I started experimenting with some of the stuff he was talking about, I think I had some kind of semi breakthrough. So there you go. That's all I have to say about it. Let's listen to this man. He's incredible. He's done the work. He's been out there in the jungles, slurping back that bitter doom brew for over and over and over again. And it clearly works. It works. I've seen him transform. So there you go. We're going to dive right into this podcast, but first some quick business. Today's episode is brought to you by Aubrey Marcus's bad ass t-shirt company. The website is www.w e a r s p a s e dot com. Aubrey has whipped up these awesome shirts. I go to the gym, believe it or not. And I'm always going to the gym and I'm proving my theory, which is that I am a robot. Incapable of any kind of true physical change and destined to always be chubby. But I still go to the gym and I'll keep doing it just to shake my fist in the face of whatever God created me fat. Also I love to eat sweet things and I eat pizzas at night. So that's the real reason. The point is I go to the gym and you know, compliment. I never get complimented at the gym ever except once. The only time I've ever gotten a gym compliment that I can recall actually maybe twice, but the first time I think that was nefarious. The guy asked if he could walk me into my car and said he liked my shoes, but it seemed weird. But the second time it equinox, somebody complimented my shirt and the shirt that I was wearing was a shirt designed by Aubrey Marcus from where space.com. He's made these shirts that represent all of these plant medicines. And the one I was wearing was the representation of ayahuasca. It's got a Maudrey written across the front and big, thick, red letters and a crazy skull like thing on it, which I think must represent mother ayahuasca and the, the skull aspect. I mean, I don't, I don't know exactly the symbolism behind this. Forgive me, Aubrey, if you're listening to this, I'm completely fucking it up. But Kali, mother Kali, as she's called, is sort of the representation of the divine mother in a kind of destructive form. So you see Kali, she's wearing, she's just got a very ferocious, ferocious visage. She's wearing a necklace with the heads of the gods. She's destroying humanity. This seems terrifying at first until you realize that Kali represents the force in the universe that rips away from you, all of those things that you have become unnecessarily attached to. And so Ram Dass even recommends, if you've got an aspect of yourself that you're tired of, if you're an angry, slug person who's hissing at the wind, then you could offer those aspects of your personality to Kali. Well, ayahuasca is known as the vine of death. And if you've listened to other episodes with Aubrey and listened to them talk about what happens on an ayahuasca trip, quite often you have to die. And I imagine that the more you resist that, according to many people I've talked to, have taken ayahuasca, the more difficult the trip can be. So here we have Madre, mother ayahuasca, the skull representing that aspect of the trip where you finally allow yourself to die. Which really is just getting out of that shell. I'm sure that there are hermit crabs who have shells that have grown too tight for them, who are terrified of climbing out of the shell into a brand new, sparkling, beautiful shell. In the same way, lots of human beings are terrified of climbing out of that old, musty, ego-carapace that's grown around their heart chakra. And so they would rather live in a tiny, bachelor-pad ego mechanism than experience the very temporary rending a part of that useless and pointless callus that's formed around their ability to experience pure autonomy and freedom. That's my interpretation of what that shirt means. There's also writing on the inside of each of these shirts, which Aubrey has written. He's a great writer. And this writing describes what each of these shirts represent. The point is, they're cool. And if you go to wearspace.com, that's W-E-A-R-S-P-A-S-E.com, you can see all the designs. And if you use offer code Duncan, you're going to get 10% off of these shirts. Here's what else is super cool about these shirts. Every shirt has a specific charity attached to it. So a minimum of 5% of the proceeds go to charities like MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is seeking to make MDMA prescribable, which it's sad that anybody has to seek to make a drug that has the potential to cure PTSD and a great many other problems prescribable. But that's the dimension that we live in right now. So we just have to deal with it. These shirts are the premium line of these shirts is our custom made in Italy. And if that's a, if those shirts are a little too pricey for you, check out the Austin Fitline, which is a little more affordable and they are printed in Austin. And those are only 2850. Well, you guys, please go check this out. Aubrey, as you're about to see, if you've never listened to an episode with him, is one of the coolest people on earth. So anything that he's creating is definitely worth a little bit of your attention. And he's sponsoring this episode of the podcast. So check it out, won't you? OK, everybody. Oh, yeah, before we get going, very quickly, we're also sponsored by Amazon.com. Use our portal, which is located in the comments section of any of these episodes. You don't need to leave your house if you are terrified of the Zika virus, ISIS, if you're terrified of meteor impacts, hail storms, if you just don't like the way your neighborhood smells, if you're just in a, in that space where you've been eating edible marijuana and yet you desperately need some kind of video game console and you don't want to go to Best Buy to get it. You can go to Amazon and you could have, depending on what city you live in, if you use Amazon Prime, you'd have a PlayStation delivered to your house in two hours. It's glorious. It's the good. This is the golden age of the shut-in, friends. And if you're going to go to Amazon and buy plastic stuff, why not go through our portal located at DuncanTrussell.com in the comments section of any of these episodes. I just bought a Bluetooth guitar thing, which actually I don't like. So don't get that. But there's a lot of other cool stuff on Amazon. And well, there's literally everything on Amazon. Unicorns, spinked or cream, you name it, you can find it. But do go through our portal first, won't you? Also, I'm going on tour of the East Coast, a bus tour, the You Are God tour. And all the dates are listed at DuncanTrussell.com. That starts in late March and goes for a full month of glory. So check that out. I'm going to be everywhere. I'm going to be in Asheville. I'm going to be in New York. I'm going to be everywhere. Nashville, check it out. Go to DuncanTrussell.com, grab tickets because they're going fast. And I think that's it. OK, fine. That's it. All right, everybody. Now, today's guest is not just the founder of Wearspace.com. He is also the founder of Onit, which is a vitamin company. I don't know if vitamin company is the right word for it. Sports enhancers. I don't know what you call it, but it's the dispenser of one of my favorite supplements, Alphabrain. And I don't think Aubrey agrees with this description of Alphabrain. But I'm going to say it. It reminds me of low level Adderall. And I know a lot of people who love this stuff. I if I've got to do a podcast, I need to focus. I will gulp down three or four Alphabrain tablets. I think that's more than the recommended dose. But fuck it, it's fantastic. And I have to do more than the recommended dose because my brain. Well, my brain needs more and they're wonderful. Anyway, they're fantastic and they give you crazy fucking dreams. And I've verified that with other people as well. So I don't know what it is exactly that it does. What's what what it does or really what's in it. You can look all that up. I just like the way it makes me feel. Aubrey's company makes a lot of other cool stuff. Crazy workout things, kettlebells with ape heads on them or zombie heads. Spatial mace maces that you work out with. These are, you know, a lot of you guys are out there super in shape. And this stuff probably appeals to you. It appeals to some dormant part of me buried under all this pizza residue. The idea of being in a home gym, lifting zombie heads and swinging massive battle maces around while roaring at the sun sounds glorious. I'm not there yet, but I've seen this stuff and it's super cool. Battle ropes, heavy ropes. You know, you could go out in your backyard with one of these big, heavy ropes and just swing it around, swing your zombie head, kettlebells and throw that. Throw the kettlebells into your neighbor's yard. Just do it. It's a good it's a good it's a it's one of my recommended exercises. Anyway, not only is he the founder of on it, but he's also an author. And he is a I don't I want to call him a shaman, though. I don't know if that's the correct term for for what he is. I don't really know what he is. He's an enigmatic, super cool fella who every time I hang out with him, I find myself learning something more than I knew before. You can find out everything you want about him by going to AubreyMarcus.com. A U B R E Y M A R C U S. Dot com. Now everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family hour podcast, my dear friend, Aubrey Marcus. Aubrey, welcome back, man. Thanks for coming out here all the way from Malibu to Pasadena. My pleasure, brother. It doesn't sound like that much of a struggle when you say all the way from Malibu. You know, you don't get a lot of street cred for making that drive when it starts in Malibu, but dude, I'm somebody who deplores traffic. I'm weak, I'm weak, so I don't like traffic. Traffic freaks me out in the most extreme way. And so if anyone takes a long time coming here or goes through traffic, I consider it to be a great honor. Well, it's my pleasure. It's not like you want in the old days, when you went to visit someone, you'd wander down a forest trail and they were dangerous. And you had no time. You had no time to meet. You had no stuff like watches on your hands. I was like, yeah, when the sun is highest in the sky. Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there soon. A lot of waiting. Yeah. Uncle Jim's coming when soon. Soon this week, six months. And then when people came to you, they'd stay for a long time. They wouldn't leave. That was a, I remember my grandparents telling me how there used to be, you know, there weren't highways. There was like when there were, you had certain mile markers and you would make a right turn at a mile marker and a left turn at a mile marker. And it was traveling across the United States. If you weren't going by train was a real serious endeavor. And it sounds so fun and beautiful. But the point is it took so long to get to a place. That once you got there, you'd stay. If someone came to visit you, you wouldn't be like, all right, see you later. You traveled 30 days to get here, just stay a week. You would stay months and months. It's kind of cool, man. I like that. Or taking a boat across the Atlantic to visit your relatives. Yeah, you're going to fucking stay for a while. Maybe a year, maybe forever. Yeah, exactly. Time was different back then. Yeah. Isn't times that time is different now? Like the way that we approach time is very frightening in a lot of ways. The effect of it is, you know, I was thinking, man, what do you think it is? We worship two false gods in this world. And, you know, in the Old Testament, God, nothing God hates more than when somebody worships a false God, like the old Jehovah's spirit, you get so pissed. If you're worshiping the wrong God, he freaks the fuck out. But so the punishment from the universe for worshipping false gods is very extreme. And that means anytime you are allowing yourself to to plug into a delusion, you're going to suffer. So the two false gods, the past and the future, right? Right. And you realize all of society is built around the worship of these false, non-existent states. Demons, demons, demons. Yeah, that's the classical definition from the shamanic perspective of a demon. What is a demon? A demon is a delusion. Somehow, in some way, it is a delusional idea, concept, archetype, thought. It's something about it is not reconciled with truth. And those are two things that certainly aren't, you know, the past, at least the dwelling on the past or the dwelling on the future. I mean, there is obviously the actual past and future, which are abstract kind of thoughts. There's something that's happening soon and something that's happening past. But identifying with those, like through your personal history and attachment to them and then thinking about the future to take you out of the present. Because the present is where truth lies. Right. For sure. Oh, that's the Lord. Yeah. And when you when you look at, you know, the funny thing about the past and the funny thing about the future is there, like to prove the past exists, you only can use you use imprints of the past, like you can use pictures, neurological encodings of which we call memories. But there is you can't. There's no way to get like scoop out matter from the past. It's gone instantaneously, annihilated in any given moment. And then when you look at the future, obviously, there's no fucking way that you can prove the future. We can't. There's nothing you can do. You just have to believe in the future because stuff happens. But really, it's a delusion. And that that that shamanic concept, it seems that if you really wanted to incur the wrath of God, then you would allow your society to be built upon the whims of two false gods and this entire society, the whole world functions on the concept of the past and the future. Even talking about it right now, be like, you've got to have the goddamn future, you fucking hippy shit. How are you going to run anything if there's no future? How are you going to do anything if you don't remember the past? How do we try? How do we put someone on trial? There's no justice without the past. You know, but then you see someone on trial who's done some awful thing and you witness them and you realize that's not the same person who committed the crime. Yeah. And you see in the look in their face where they're like, I was in a dream. I don't know how I got here. Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes and no man steps in the same river twice because it's not the same river and he's not the same man. Heraclitus said that that that now there, how do you but how do you how do you have industry? It's hard. Our society is built upon these these precepts, but always there's the choice that we have to just anchor to anchor to the present moment. And in that present moment, there can be pain, but there cannot be suffering. It is not possible. Well, there can only be just the pain and pain is very easy to deal with. We're very good at that suffering, which is our feelings and fears and concerns and worries about the future and all of these things. Like imagine when you have a cold, you know, like so much of a cold is not the physical symptoms of your stuffy ass nose. It's projecting into the future about this cold things that you're doing. But if you just anchor to the present moment, you got a little bit of a stuffy nose, like not a fucking big deal, not a big deal. Even if it's even more like, you know, something a lot harder, anchoring in the present, you know, you're with the truth of what's actually happening, which is maybe a little bit of pain, maybe some pleasure, maybe whatever else is going on. But there's always that that volitional choice, which is, I think, one of our, you know, main choices of free will is to just anchor to the present, clear the mind, anchor to the present and you'll alleviate 90 percent of your suffering. Now, this is an interesting thing that you said here because it it gives us a compass or a canary in the coal mine to determine whether or not we're in the present moment. Because sometimes you think you're in the present moment and you're not in the present moment at all, because you're thinking you're in the present moment. That thing, you know, where you're like, it happened to me the other day. I was just driving down the. I was just driving to go eat dinner. And I was like, you are so in the moment right now. As you pat yourself on the back, comparing yourself to the past of not being in the present moment, patting yourself on the back, not in the moment at all. It's far away from the moment as you could be. This is the, this isn't another demon. This is another delusion is this terrible thing that will perch on your shoulder and say to you, oh yeah, you are really, really right there. You really are like, oh wow, this is amazing. This is like your Bodhi tree moment, man. You're awakening as you drive to this pizza place. You really know, not even close because you're thinking. And then you start thinking about like the, how you're going to articulate the beauty of the moment. Like, you know, that's the next talking about it on a podcast, putting it in a blog. Oh yes. And then you think, I will say that there are two false gods and then you say it. But you're still not there. And so this canary in the coal mine that you're talking about is one way to identify that you're not in the present moment is if you're experiencing suffering, as you say, versus pain. Right. Now, help me understand these two things. What is the difference between suffering and pain? Yeah. Suffering is the extra piled on top anguish to the physical stimulus that you're feeling, you know, so like whatever you're going through, whether it's, you know, physical or emotional, there's a direct physical stimulus that's happening. Some kind of issue that's going on somatically within the body, right? That's all that, that's all that the present moment allows. It allows stimulus to be kind of washed over that present moment. And then the suffering comes from all of the mental kind of maneuvering that goes around that thinking, projecting into the future. How is this going to affect me? How long am I going to be this? When am I going to get? Well, what do I have to do? What did I do to cause this? All of those things are the suffering. Whereas just if you're at peace with the stimulus itself, the stimulus is often very little, no matter what, no matter what you're going through, we're very adept at dealing with the stimulus. I mean, think about the, when you get a shot or something like that. I mean, the suffering comes from the anticipation of the prick, right? You know, and also, you know, whatever, mostly the anticipation in that instance, when it actually happens, it's like, Oh, well, it's so bad. And it's over in a minute and it's not a big deal at all. But the suffering comes in the projection towards the future. And then, you know, potentially if it was traumatic, you can think, you know, in the rear view and look back at the event and have suffering about something that happened in the past. But in the present, you can look at yourself and ask your body, you know, am I all right? Or as castanet of that crazy fuck said, you can ask death. You can say, death, have you touched me yet? And death will say no. And you'll know you're all right. Wow. That's really cool, man. Yeah. It's so liberating. And it's so blasphemous. That's the other thing I like about it is. Many people, I think, when they consider the present moment, do not realize how revolutionary a state it is to be in. Yeah. And, and, and it's like, I think the times when I really managed to get there or where it just happens, the moment I realized I'm there, I do get this feeling of like a prisoner who's wandered out of the prison and is about to get abducted again by the cops. Like I'm breaking rules. You're not supposed to feel okay right now, man. You, you can't just feel good. And there's that voice when you do feel really good. It says, Hey, be careful, motherfucker. You're feeling really good. That means the fall is coming. You know, this, the fall is coming. Voice is one of the nastiest demons we all have. I feel that all the time, like everything is so amazing. It's like, watch out, motherfucker. What's next? Yeah. Keep your eyes out. And I think there's some wisdom to the, what the stoics called premeditation of potential disastrous events, but then you got to let that go. You do what you got to do and then just let that shit go and anchor back to the present moment where that, where that pleasure lies. Yeah. That's right. But then that other demon that you're talking about base, it's a demon of the future. It's just some, it's, it's like, I was thinking, okay, these demons that we worship, the false gods, and then I was thinking, okay, you know, and like the grimoires, like the lesser key of Solomon and the various like weird books about how to summon demons, which are so, I don't know those, but I'm interested. Oh, check them out. They're awesome. Yeah. They're awesome. The whole, it's called, um, oh fuck, there's a name for it. Oh, I'm going to say it wrong. It's pronounced, it mispronounced everything to go at it, go at, it's spelled G-O-E-T-I-A, but basically this is the idea that there are elemental forces in the universe that you can, if you are a clever magician and do the right purification rituals and then the appropriate summoning rituals, and then you could theoretically control these forces. And so there's a lot of theories about the varying, the various grimoires and where all this comes from. The best being that it's a pre-flood technology, that it's the remnants of a pre-apocalypse technology that still lingers and no one really understands it. But many, many, like powerful Western sorcerers are really into this shit and Crowley being one of them. And I know other people too, who claim to have made contact with these beings. But when you, it's really fascinating when you read like the Lesser Kyosama, because you'll have the, the demons, the main demons, and then they'll have servants or they'll have like legions beneath them. Like any, there's a hierarchical, in the same way, if you look at like certain old texts on angels, there's a fascinating hierarchy in angels where there's higher angels and those angels have servants and those, so it's like a weird celestial corporation. So past and future, these demons, they have a legion of workers underneath them and those make up all the other sufferings. You know all the, all the little things, you know, but so still what you're talking about, it's still like, if, if you are not in the present moment, you will suffer. This is interesting, because when you hear the Buddhist idea, life is suffering, the cause of suffering is attachment, it's a little more difficult to understand for me, like attachment to what? And what do you mean? I know what you mean theoretically, but this is, to me, right to the point, which is, if you are not in the present moment, you're gonna suffer. Present moment is hallowed ground, like this is hallowed ground, like all of those warcraft and wizardry movies, you know, where do you go for hallowed ground? The fucking present moment. Demons cannot touch you in the present moment. Nothing can get you. Nothing can touch you in the present moment. I mean, someone can harm you physically, obviously in the present moment, but as far as these constructs and archetypes of the mind, and for people who have difficulty looking at these demons as entities, you can just look at them as archetypes. These forces that are these coagulations of archetypal thoughts and influences that are coming at us. You don't have to necessarily accept that there are entities that are drinking blood and doing whatever they do. Whatever helps you organize those thoughts, I'm all about it. And I don't try to get caught up in whether a lot of people ask, are these entities real or are they just precepts of the mind? Same fucking thing. Real or precepts of the mind? It doesn't really matter. Doesn't matter. Yeah. But what matters is how you deal with them. And absolutely. And I write about it in the book that I'm releasing here pretty soon, the best way to escape to truth, which is obviously away from all delusion, away from all the demons, is anchoring to the present moment. So what do you do yourself to anchor to the present moment? Like, what are some of the techniques that you use to get there? So the techniques that I have, I was taught, I got these Rondost retreats, they're the best. And you have the thing I love about them. When I first started going, I really just was tripping out to see someone like Rondost talk, because the vibe that guy puts out is just, there's nothing like it, man. But then you realize, oh, it's like, that's just one tiny little piece of it. Because what starts having these retreats is you have this, you know, ecstasy talk? It's like a never ending ecstasy conversation minus the ecstasy. Everyone's so opened up that they're just like talking and you're, and then you know that thing where like, you, the universe will talk to you through overheard conversations sometimes, or the way you get, it's funny what our people, the way people's filtration mechanism works is because they think that they can only take in information if it's being directed to them, from one person to them, or from a book to them. But no, the universe is teaching you in the way the wind blows through the trees, or a conversation you might overhear in line at staples, or it's always talking. You can open it up. So then that stuff starts happening, or the universe just teaches you. So this, man, I wish I could remember his name. He's the coolest guy ever. He's somebody whose job it is to administer. He helps people relax before big surgeries and hospitals. So his job is to come in if someone's like got some big thing going down. He teaches them how to get calm. And so his technique that he taught me is so simple, but I use it and it works, which is like, you can do it right now. You just feel, if you're sitting in a chair, notice, here's something that you don't have to worry about holding yourself up. That chair is going to hold you up no matter how you sit in the chair. The chair is supporting your way. A lot of people, they over effort when they're sitting because they don't feel supported by the universe. So if you're sitting in a chair, you actually realize like the way your muscles are working is as though the chair is suddenly going to collapse or something. You know, like you're doing the chair's work. You don't need to. The chair is holding you up. You're fine. And then the other thing you do, so you sink into wherever you are, whether it's a bed, a chair, and you realize like, oh yeah, the chair is going to do all the work. I'm on vacation for a little while as far as gravity goes. So then you can feel your muscles relax and then you feel your feet in your shoes. If you're wearing shoes and feel the way that your feet are sinking into the earth and just doing that for me, I'll get me right there. That'll do it for me. Simple, simple stuff like that. But then my problem or meditating, falling the breath in and out through the nose. Don't get me there. But you know, it's like the interesting thing about all of this stuff is you don't know that you've been there until you're not there anymore. So it's like, you know, I had this mushroom trip recently where all of a sudden, I'm sorry, you guys, I talked about this in an early podcast, but it applies. As I was coming from down from the mushrooms, I started thinking, because I had just been in this realm of pure symbols, you know, just this beautiful like, like the, you know, that's that you're just like, I don't know, just like face it, beautiful faces and incredible. Like, you know, you're seeing that like the weird, dewy spider web, like tendrils of the sentient non embodied consciousness that spreads over everything in the way it's always expressing itself. But suddenly I was like, wait, I was doing this. What was I doing? I was doing this thing. What am I doing? I'm this thing. I'm a human. Oh, I'm a human. Oh, shit. I'm a human. Yeah, right. You know, but before that, I want to come back to remembering I was human. I was not huge. I was not me. And so I came back into myself again and remembered, oh, I'm not doing this project called human for a little bit of time. So in the same way, the present moment, it's like that kind of like when you're there, that this is where you get into the, and this is where I'm sorry. I'm, this is a very clumsy and stupid rant, but this is where you get into the whole problem that Zen addresses, which is like, we're talking about a thing that the moment you're talking about the fucking thing, you're not in the thing, or maybe you are, but more than likely you're not. So for me, I think, and I think that's what you're just about to ask me probably. But for me, I think there's, I think it's the most pleasurable state that we can get in. And I think we, we access it sometimes without even knowing it. I think sometimes when we have sex, we're in the present moment. And that's one of the most pleasurable aspects of sex. And I think the, the kind of field of Tantra is built around that is using that as a tool to help you access the present moment. But I even think like, even sometimes you practice Tantra, like, like just scratching the surface is on my list of like areas of expertise that I need to explore, but enough to understand like the basic premise and know that it works. Like, like I basically have proved the concept by just scratching the surface enough to say that that is a method that it works. You've had the extended orgasm. No, well, I've stretched it, but not the Tantric, you know, five minute, the full, the full thing that philosophy professor at our school claimed that he could have six hour orgasms with his wife from Tantra. Yeah. I mean, that's, that would be pretty rad, but, you know, the only time I've had a really extended orgasm feeling was on DMT a few times. I've had that where it just stretched out for like five minutes or something like that. But, but yeah, so sex is one way. And I think actually even there's certain conversations in certain times where we're more in the present, like that first date, you know, a lot of times where you're just enraptured in somebody. Yes. One of the reasons why we like that is because it forces us to be in the present where with people we're familiar with, we're running these background discussions and thoughts in our head. We're thinking about our phone or what's next or whatever. So I think interactions with people, of course, flow state is another one of the classic examples and flow state is accessed when there's generally when there's stakes on the line. So you have some kind of risk like you're surfing a big wave. It's kind of a classic example where that wave will absolutely pummel you. So to access to your highest performance, you have to be in the present moment. You have no room. There's no wiggle room to be thinking about this or that. This is Alex Honnell. Yeah. Just have to be in the zone a hundred percent. And Steven Kotler wrote a book about flow state. And I think that's really an interesting way to access it. And then of course there's the other kind of meditation techniques, one of which is Tom Brown's, he talks about it in the Sacred Silence. It's called Awakening Spirits. And he has this Sacred Silence meditation that I really, really like. He has a couple of methods. One method is out in nature. He uses the widest peripheral gaze that he can. So he's looking at everything but nothing at the same time. So just relaxes his eyes and sees everything without focusing on anything. So just pure perception at that moment and the stories of what he's able to see. Like if he's looking at a wooded landscape and we're looking at a wooded landscape, like what he's able to see just because he's cultivated that ability to just perceive life and all of everything at the same time without thinking about it is pretty legendary. So that's one method. Another method that he has is he goes through this meditation. And actually this is the guided meditation I have on my website because I like it so much. But he goes through this guided meditation that will get you to access the present moment. And then at the end he launches what he's called a trigger breath. So that's a breath where you breathe in and then you breathe out really slowly. Keep breathing, keep breathing. And you'll start to feel your heart like palpitate as you start to lose breath. And you'll start to feel your pulse. And when you start to feel your pulse, it's just this kind of unique feeling and unique way of breathing. And what he does is after the meditation, he has you do that breath so that you're anchoring. So that breath is synonymous with being in the present moment. So it's kind of like a Pavlovian response that you can build. Right. So then the idea is you do the sacred science meditation enough, anchor that breath at the end of it when you are present that no matter what you're doing, all you need is the breath to remind you of the present moment. So it doesn't work until you've patterned it, but eventually like the bell that causes the dog to salivate, you know, when there's food there, all of a sudden you can pull away the food, just have the bell and you'll get the salivation. That's cool. Classical conditioning into the present moment. Exactly. Badass. I love it. Yeah, that's super cool, man. Yeah. All these techniques are so important. And this is, you know, the thing, the more I experiment with this present moment, and it's a fun, it's like a romance almost. It's a dance because you can't stay in the dance and dancing is another great way. Talk about a way to do it when you're really just dancing and like that kind of ecstatic dance or enraptured dance moment where you're just feeling your body. It's another way to access the present moment a great way, but it is a dance in general, not literally, but metaphorically because you're in and out of it at all times and just. It's a new friend and it's a perpetually new friend and it's like, so sometimes when you're having a difficult moment, you can think, I'm going to visit my new friend and see what happens. And then there it is, this wild thing. Now, if you embody the present moment, it has characteristics. The present moment is the ultimate revolutionary. The present moment does not care about the machinations of society. No. The present moment doesn't care about the president. The present moment doesn't care about the government. The present moment doesn't care about money. The present moment doesn't care about anything that humans are caught up in. And this is the present moment cares about the taste of the juice of the pear as you're biting and it's dripping down your beard and it's flooding your mouth with the sensation of pleasure. That's what the present moment cares about. Yes, that's it. And it's wild, you know, because it cannot be domesticated because it seems like domestication requires this kind of like a feeling of what will happen in the future if you do the wrong thing or punishment for the past. The present moment will not be domesticated. So it is an undomesticatable, super rebellious being. And I think it's like if you look at the not the fundamentalist Christian version of Jesus, but like the hippie version of Jesus or whatever that being represents, it's best articulated in that being and all the stuff that Jesus says in the New Testament that I'd choose to pick. And by the way, I just do a filter system, man. If there's shit in there, I'm like, yeah, that doesn't, my Jesus would never say that. I just take whatever I want. But all this stuff that I, you know, like things like do not store your treasures on earth. Where the, what, we're rusted. I'm low tide. Yeah, don't, don't store your treasures on earth where rust and moths will corrupt. Store your treasures in the kingdom of heaven. Or like, you know, Jesus is always talking about the kingdom of heaven. Yeah, build your castle upon the rock, not upon the sand. Yes. We'll get you something like that. That, well, yeah, well, or like the concept of the kingdom of heaven. Again and again, if you read the New Testament, definitely read it. Everyone revisit it. It's awesome. Just take a psychedelic, you'll get it. But there's always this reference to this thing called the kingdom of heaven, which Jim Baker has transformed into a celestial place with, you know, the streets of gold and blah, blah, blah, or you get to watch the centers burning hell through special televisions or whatever. That's like that, but the kingdom of heaven is, it's something he keeps referencing. And I'm certain it's the present moment. Totally. Because when you enter into the present moment, you're in the kingdom of heaven. You're in heaven. And so Jesus is always saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand, or like they were asked, they're always trying to trick him. So they're asking questions like, what about, you know, I don't remember who they're mentioning, like John the Baptist or whoever, is he in heaven? And the response is like, I am the God of the living, not the God of the dead. It's super fucking cool. It's like this idea of this present state. Anyway, man, the point is this thing that we're talking about, if you have been raised by hippies, or you've heard it over and over again to the point where your ears are bleeding from assholes yapping about the present fucking moment, it's the most boring sounding place ever. I know I used to think that it's the last place you want to be. Some boring, docile, sedated state. That is not what it is. It's the opposite. It's the opposite. Yeah, it's alive and enriched with all the sacred geometry of the universe coming in and crashing against your perception. Yes, exactly. Yeah, totally. That's it. Did I ever tell you about in ceremony, in one of my last ceremonies, my encounters with the Jesus and Lucifer archetype? No, I don't think you did. And if you did, I'd like, I still want to hear it again. So I was in ceremony and in a very safe container, this awesome container called the medicine space that my friend Hamilton Souther has kind of created where you anchor your heart to kind of the heart of the universe. And it's this amazingly... This is in Brazil? No, this was not in Brazil. This was in the States. But it's this amazingly high vibration, high frequency place that you can anchor to. And it's very, very safe. And so in that container, we were exploring different archetypes and we started exploring the Jesus archetype. And I was able to see this as this emerald column, this spiraling emerald column of this glowing light. And it was this really amazing experience, because I'm not... I don't have a lot of Christianity roots or anything like that. I've been pretty much agnostic concerning Jesus. I know he said some very wise things, 100%, but for me to encounter that archetype, and what it really was, was it was a force that was saying like, show me all your worst, show me all your demons, show me everything that you think is bad about yourself. I'm not even gonna flinch. Right. I'm still gonna love you. But there's nothing you could show me that'll make me go, ooh. You know, it's like, I love you all the same. What is it? What is it? What is it that you're hiding? What's that deepest thing that you're ashamed of? Show that to me. I love you. Yeah, that's it. But it was this impartial thing. It wasn't like he was trying to or it was trying to dig that out of you or it had judgment about it. It's like, I'm here. Anytime you need absolute 100% love and forgiveness, just come find me. That's it. You know, I'm not motivated to try. This is your choice. If you want, if you want this, come find me. You know, and that was just this cool thing because you have this missionary idea of Jesus that the religiousness of it all has kind of perpetuated. Like, yeah, we got to go fix the sinners and we got to go convert people or they're burning hell. Like the actual entity that I encountered was like, no, no, no. I'm here. If you want, you have them forgiveness. I'll hold down. I'll hold down that end of the spectrum. And then on the other side of the spectrum is the opposite. And this was the force that, you know, biblically would be called Lucifer. And this is the force of ultimate resistance. And that allows the cosmic duality to exist. That allows the tension that creates this game of free will. So on one side you have the Jesus archetype and the other side you have the Lucifer archetype. Tell me about that archetype. So that archetype was really interesting because I realized that the game could not exist without that force of resistance. Without an equal force of resistance to the force of good, people would get enlightened like this. There wouldn't be actual free will. You wouldn't have a game where your choice mattered because it would already be tilted in one side or the other. It has to be a perfect balance. And the Lucifer archetype, I've envisioned it as this. It was this swirling chaotic black. It had no light. It was just like the absence of light, just this black swirling brown void chaos spectrum. But really one thing that struck me is that that was a force that willingly chose to hold down that archetype so that this game could exist. So that was a force that was doing something, doing that out of love for humanity at its very basic root. It was like, I love humanity so much. I will be the force of resistance that everybody hates. I will cause all this pain so that we may have free will. So that we may have a game to play. Right. But, and then so I started getting this sympathetic feeling like, oh, thanks. And then there was this voice that came through really, really clear. It's like, but don't get a twisted motherfucker. I take this game for real. I could take this game seriously. I will fuck you up because that's my job. Like don't think we're friends. Like just because I love you enough to do this and to hold this down, doesn't mean I'm going to put my game aside and not try to fuck you up. Because that's what that thing is. That is the source of the delusion and resistance that allows us that gravity, that force pressing against us that allows us to ascend and allows us to have the opportunity to choose pleasure and choose enlightenment and have this interesting game. That's right, man. Yeah, Lucifer, the light bringer. I love thinking about Lucifer. The contact I had with him, it was on LSD. And again, you guys. Well, I'm not going to do any more disclaimers. Fuck it. If you want to think, I actually think I saw Lucifer. I don't care. But I was laying in bed on LSD, staring at the stucco ceiling. A fantastic thing to gaze upon when you've taken the right amount of acid. It's beautiful. You'll see the entire all mythology in front of you. You'll see everything. But I was looking and I saw this beautiful male figure with wings looking at me. And I was beautiful. And I was thinking, my God, it's an angel. I'm seeing an angel. Beautiful, beautiful angel. And I'm looking at the being. And the being seems aware that I can see it. And suddenly I realized, wait, why doesn't it seem like an angel? Like the way, why doesn't it seem like an angel? I realized the thing was enjoying the fact that I thought it was beautiful. The thing wanted me to think it was beautiful. And in fact, that's all the thing wanted was for me to recognize, like, look at this. Look at how powerful, how incredible. Am I not the greatest? I am the greatest. Am I not? And I think that to me is one of the characteristics of that force that you're talking about. And any body who is acting like that, the human who wants to be worshiped, we must have compassion for ourselves when we get in that state or for anyone who is in that state because they're suffering in the most intense, terrible way because they've gotten themselves in this awful situation where they're demanding respect. They're expecting the glory. They want to feel that they want to be worshiped. Whereas the Christ archetype, there's nothing in it that cares. Not a shred. Not a shred. Not a shred. Not a shred. He's not there in the sense of worship me. The thing is always trying as much, not trying even, but the concept is like, it's more about unification. We're one thing, or if it's not that, then it's about pointing in the direction of the greater thing. That's the difference between Satan and Jesus is one's pointing to themselves and the other is pointing in the direction of you or the light or love or all things. And these archetypes are raging inside ourselves at all times. And that's this inner universe that we have mirrors the outer universe. So there's all of these forces. In that same meditation or ceremony, I should say it wasn't meditation, but in that same ceremony, we started exploring other archetypes, like the Zeus archetype. It was like a really cool force, this kind of very paternal fatherly force. And I think the way Hamilton described it was perfect because a lot of times it's difficult to put these forces into words, you just get a feeling. But he's like, he's the dad who would never let you drive, but if you take the keys and you go out there and you drive, he'll be somewhat proud. He'll be proud of you. You know, like that's the Zeus archetype. Like, I'm the father, you don't get the car, but if you go out there and do it, he's like, that's my fucking boy. That's my boy with the car ripping around, picking up chicks. What other archetypes? We explored the sun. That was an interesting archetype as well. Just this constant pushing of warmth without any judgment or without any decision about who gets the warmth or what gets the warmth. It's just like here, like here. That's cool. Here is what will sustain life. Right. You know, and it was this very, because a lot of times we have this kind of idea of reciprocity of like, I give you this and return this. And I think that's a very fair thing that exists in the universe. But the sun asks for none of that. Thank God. Yeah. The sun asks for, you know, it asks for no worship. Can you imagine? The people who worship the sun are silly. The sun is not asking for worship because the sun's energy is just, just give. Just give constantly. If the sun started issuing power bills, we would be fucked. We're sure. There's no way to repay the sun. No. Ever. No. Now, I gotta say though, Matt, the sun worshiper thing. Now, here's, first of all, I do understand why people worship the sun. Like if I, even now when I look at the sun, which I don't very often, you're not supposed to, but even feeling it's heat. Are you not supposed to though? Because I've heard some different things of like, maybe it's actually a little bit helpful, especially with eyes closed. Oh, with eyes closed, perhaps. I know you're supposed to absorb the heat of the sun. There's like all kinds of benefits. Some ways that it helps your melatonin production differently. You need to be in the sun. There's varying times, but you definitely, here's what I know for certain. At about 10 a.m., the cat and both dogs go to the exact same part of the house in Sun Bay. And they love it. And the war between the cats and dogs is over in that time. They just lay and absorb the sunlight. And you can tell they're getting drunk or high from it. They're just super relaxed. If you pet them, it's like giving someone a massage on MDMA. They just love it, man. So that's just nature gravitating towards absorbing the light. But as far as sun worshiping goes, here's what's wild, man. So okay, we worship the sun. We'll have a picture of the sun, right? We bow down before it. We imagine it's telling us what to do. People still are fucking sun worshipers. It's on your watch. You've converted the periods of light and darkness into a circle that you wear on your fucking wrist. Or you put it in the goddamn factory. The workers gaze upon the symbolic representation of the sunlight. And then based on that, all of the pulsations of society are determined. Everything. So we still worship the sun, man. It didn't stop. It's just now we don't have paintings of the sun. We have a round thing with numbers and lines on it. It's still the fucking sun. A clock is the sun. There's no time. Remove the sun and we've got nothing. There's no time. If you get away from the sun, if you get far enough away from the fucking sun, there's no more sunrises. There's no more sunsets. There's no more afternoon siestas. There's just a moment that never stops. Yeah, you see those in those science fiction things, like pitch black. Where the sun doesn't shine. And it's just a nightmare at the whole time. That's what it's like. And then you go somewhere else. I know stepping off the plane in the Sacred Valley in Peru, you step off that plane and you're at 12,000 square feet and 12,000 feet elevation in the Sacred Valley or something like that. Very high. And the sun is just so dominant in the sky. You see where that Inca sun worship came from because it's like, whoa. Yeah. This is fucking something even different when you get to that elevation. It's clear and it's pretty wild. If you're picking things to worship, picking the massive ball of light giving light that hovers around your planet is not the worst choice. It certainly is the source of all light. Anything you've ever thought, anything you've ever eaten, anything you've ever done, you owe it to the sun. And then if you look at the new NASA videos coming of the sun, have you ever watched those close up crazy fucking when you solar flares? You see that thing. If that thing ain't alive, nothing is like it seems to be alive. These tendrils shooting out of it and rolling back into itself. It seems like a super organism that we just don't understand. No doubt. I think it has sentience. God damn it. It felt like it when I encountered it for sure. And you know, I think with that sun worship though, just making sure that you don't get it twisted and think the sun needs that. I mean, the sun doesn't need that. Right. You know, I think that's the only place where the sun worship has got off track. It's like, we must worship the sun and do sacrifices. No, no, no, no. It's cool. It loves you. It's doing this. It's doing this out of just an altruistic gift for life. That's right. And that's where you learn the lesson of these archetypes. Because I think that where people start getting into trouble is where they become the sun god that wants people to give them sacrifices. And that's where you're up shit creek, man. Anytime you've landed in that spot and it's natural to get there from time to time, if you, you know, if you just become a baby, you know, kids are like that. Like the kid, okay, like when you're toilet training your kid, the kid wants to be cheered on if it finally manages to shit in the toilet bowl. No great feat, but you need to do it. Yeah. Because otherwise the kids are going to shit his pants for the rest of his life. Right. So you need to, you need to cheer the kid on. And it is a big feat for a kid. He's been, for a being who just learned to walk and for the, has been shitting his pants regularly to finally manage to not shit your pants for the first time. Yeah. How victorious, how liberating it is for, it must be the most liberating thing to realize from now on, I'm not going to have shit in my pants intermittently throughout the day. That's a good feeling. Deserves to be rewarded. So, but the thing is when adults start wanting the world to congratulate them for not shitting their pants, that's where you get into trouble where you start realizing like, oh, I'm expecting pats on the back and I'm expecting, you know, you want like a parade around you. You want people to throw fucking ribbons at you, you know, at least once a month, you know, and you start getting addicted to that. That's where you get sick, man. That's where you can start really collapsing. Because your self-identity and then self-worth gets tied to a relational effect of how much of this adulation you're getting and then, and then you're really fucked. So it's like this cascade that starts of wanting it and then needing it. And then when you need it, then there's never enough because it's not actually fulfilling. It's like eating empty calories over and over again, you know, like only having cotton candy, just trying to get full and fuel your muscles with protein. But all it is is more and more cotton candy until you just eat it, but continue to get sicker and sicker and sicker, you know. And it's fascinating because what is a black hole? Yeah. What's a black hole? Literally, do you know what it is? Something that sucks all life in the matter. It's a collapsed sun. It's a collapsed sun. When the sun stops giving light out, it falls into itself and it turns into a fucking black hole in the same way a person. When you stop this endeavor of like, I'm going to just give it out. You don't deserve it. I don't deserve it. No one deserves it. But I'm just going to give it out. You don't deserve it. That's the thing, man. When you get around someone who's really fucked you over, it's a fantastic opportunity to operate as a son just for once. And just like, here, take it. Keep taking it. Are you using me? Okay. Use me. Keep using me. Let's see how much there is of me to be used. How long will it go on for? And when you start doing that, then the planets around you, the beings around you, the things in your presence, they will start growing life. They'll start coming to life just like what happens around a sun. It might not happen with all of them. But man, if you go the opposite direction, I know you and I both must know these people, these poor sons of bitches who have supernovaed and turned into fucking black holes. And now they've got an orbit of doom around them. And anything that gets sucked into it gets ripped to shreds. This is the problem, man. You see it, man. You see it a lot of times. One black hole will create more collapsed stars around them. It will need that. And they just keep sucking different light and turning more suns into other black holes. That's right, man. That's it. The one drug that I think facilitates that more than anything, cocaine. You're right. I've seen that so many times where you'll have these people who are a mixed bag. They're part black hole, part sun. They're this swirling of sometimes this outward and sometimes this inward. But reliably, cocaine will get them to the fucking collapsed star mode. So they just need more. They need more coke. They need more conversation. They need more ejaculation. They just need, need, need, sucking, sucking. And what they are giving is this crazy, not altruistic, it's a weird, weird thing. So I think watching how these things, what you're surrounding yourself with, making sure that you're not turning to the dark star. And when you do turn to the dark star, I think at least you just know it. Totally. You know, and I was talking to a friend of mine recently and she told me, she was telling me that the mind is responsible for, I would say your name. I don't want to be rude, but I don't know if she, I don't know, but she was telling me the mind is responsible. She believes the mind is responsible for great many human ailments and that understanding the strut that these things inside of you, that you're a black hole today or that you're, you've been being a black hole for the last couple of months or years or whatever. Just that understanding is all it takes to heal yourself. Yeah. It doesn't require you to then go in and do some kind of like analysis and fix it. It's just the, the, just allowing the thing to emerge into your consciousness is the beginning of the, the transformation that, that will happen. So I think if you feel like you're a black hole, that doesn't mean you're a black hole. That's okay. You have compassion. You got there for a good reason. You didn't get there because you're evil. You got there because you want love. You got there because it feels good to be loved and it feels good to be congratulated and it feels good to be complimented and it feels good for people to treat you like you're more special. That does feel good. It's great. We love it. Look at my mind. I can tell with my, my sister-in-law picks up my nephew, you know, and holds him or when my brother holds my nephew, he loves it. Of course you would. Sure. So it's, oh, but, and if you've gotten, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't absorb and appreciate all the love that you get. It's just this matter of whether you need it or whether you can just enjoy it. Like the need is the attachment is the fear of not having it creates this desperation. You know, whereas the acceptance of it is just, yeah, like awesome. Like breathe it all in, feel it to the fullest. Like live it with passion. Yeah. Don't shut yourself off on the word. I'm sucking too much. No, that's part of the gift that creates it and it allows you to be energized, but the needing it and the hunting it and the manipulating so that you get it. You know, that is, that is the dark side. The dark side and it's based on limitation. Like imagine if people all of a sudden everyone knew that for the next hundred years, a massive iron sphere was going to surround planet earth and no one would experience the sun. And there was only four more hours left to experience sunlight. That'd be a sad four hours as people rushed into the streets and desperately tried to experience the sun and you'd be so depressed and you want to figure out a way to bottle it or box it or save it or keep it. And so that's what happens. I think that was the fucking dark ages. People think about the dark ages as dark because of many, you know, the thoughts and the different things that were going on. No, it was actually fucking dark. What? They actually have, yeah, they actually have geological records that show that the time at that point was dark because of volcanic activity and different other things. No shit. The dark ages were actually dark. What? Yeah, you can, you can look it up. I actually tweeted it not too long ago, but the dark ages were dark and that was one of the reasons why it was such a fucked up time as the sun was largely gone. It was cloudy every goddamn day, you know, in search of facilitates disease, which facilitates all of these other fucked up things like the sun withdrew. That's wild. And in all of these like post-apocalyptic fantasies, like you see in matrix three, they're all underground and shit. You know, can you imagine not having to, not being able to experience the sun? I was actually thinking of writing a novel with the first line being grandpa, tell me again about the sun. Right. You know, like just the old wise ones were the only one. Ah, yes. It was this glowing orb of light. And when it bathed across your skin and tickled and filled you with warmth and you'd be drunk from vitamins that could only blossom in your skin from the light of this giant orb. Like, whoa, grandpa, was it real? Yes, my son. Don't listen to your grandpa. He hasn't had his medication. There was never. Yeah. And then there'd be people who would be sun deniers. Yeah. Oh, shut up. You don't believe in the fucking sun, do you? There's no proof it ever exists. There's a bunch of assholes from the past. You made some shit up. Trust me, there's no fucking sun. Yeah, man. No, it's in that seat. To me, it's that the best way out of being a black hole if you find yourself in a super compressed state of need is to, you have to just start giving to people. Yeah. That's it. Even though you don't feel like it. You have to start being a son yourself. You awaken your own son. Yeah. And then internally, that sun in your heart, nine layers deep, deep, deep in your heart, which is a sun. Why do you say nine layers deep? Just a way to envision all of the dimensional layers that their heart actually exists in, you know? And for me, nine layers is the amount, in the shamanic tradition, nine layers is the ninth layer is God, is pure unification in oneness. So it goes through the layers. Obviously, fourth is time, fifth is dream, sixth is this place of entities. More like the astral seventh is starting to get into the celestial. Eight is a place of pure potentiality that's kind of very much, pretty much the highest that any shaman can access. And then ninth is just unification, pure unification with the oneness of all light. What's the first layer? Well, one, two, three, one is a dot, two is a line, three is, you know, the regular dimensions apply, three is 3D space, four is time, fifth is dreams, the world of dreams, which is somewhere below the astral. The astral is the projected visionary state of, you know, of things which is somewhere, you know, around the sixth and then seventh is the celestial, more angelic beings in there. And then eighth is that dimension of potentiality. And this is inside a human. This is inside us as well as, as within, so without, as above, so below, you know, what Hermes Trismegistus says, that's inside us. We have a universe connected to the other universe, which is all part of a multiverse. And it's all this matter of, you know, you can look at it in any different way you want. But in our heart, in our heart is that point of ninth dimension. It is pure sun, pure God, a ninth dimensional point that is our seat of consciousness. So anchoring to that, that is the medicine space that I was talking about from Hamilton Souther. It's like, that's what he identified is that's our peace of God that we have inside. So that's why I say nine layers deep to that peace of God that we all have, that innate sun that is just willing to give and will warm us out from within. So giving to somebody is like waking that up. It's like, here I'm going to be the sun. And then all of a sudden, like that, like a quantum particle, you know, you can see it when you observe it. But if you don't observe it, it may not be there. You know, like the rules of quantum physics will have that observer effect, where observing it actually manifests it. And that's the way it is with our heart observing that point in our heart and giving it that ability to do what it's capable of, which is love unconditionally. Then at that point, you know, we are the sun. And that's the best way out of being a black hole for sure. Cool, man. That's so cool. Like, yeah, you can almost just see it inside of you. This like super luminous, perfect light that's just covered in shit. Yeah, it's just not there because we're choosing not to see it. It's just a choice. We're choosing on the quantum level not to acknowledge the God that's in our heart, you know, the oneness of all life, of all creation that's there. And then as soon as we do, as soon as we acknowledge that and acknowledge that that's connected to all things through perpetual motion, everything moving. Once that becomes a particle that's real, it's connected to all of the atomic movement of all of ourselves in our body, connected to all the atomic movement of all the atoms in the air, connected to all the atomic movement of entire space and planets and everything. It's all connected. And then at that point, you're in the medicine space. Wow, Aubrey, you're the coolest of all time. Thanks, brother. Thank you so much for being on the show, man. For sure, man.

They opened up a wormhole and connected to a radio station from the future. That's actually three months from now. We have got a wonderful podcast for you today. I imagine many of you have heard of today's guest, Dr. Eben Alexander. He wrote a bestseller called Proof of Heaven. This is a neurologist who got a horrific form of meningitis, got in his brain, went into a coma, and had a near-death experience. I had no idea how much near-death experiences have been studied and how much data there is out there and how absolutely weird they are. You know, you hear stories of these things and if you're like me, you probably write them off as some kind of hallucinatory experience, some kind of way the brain reacts to being engulfed into nothingness, but as it turns out, these experiences that have been reported forever by people all around the planet might be a little bit more than just some last desperate attempt that the human brain is making to protect us from the horror of eternal annihilation. My dear loves, before we jump into this, I would love to invite you to subscribe to my Patreon. It's at patreon.com forward slash DTFH and I would really love it if you would come and see me next weekend at Hilarities in Milwaukee. You can find the ticket links at DuncanTrussell.com. I'm coming to a lot of places. I'm going to be at Charlie Goodnights in Raleigh. I'm coming back to Sweet Portland. I'm going to be at the Helium Comedy Club there and many, many more dates. Again, those are all at DuncanTrussell.com. Okay, here we go. With us today is Dr. Eben Alexander. You can find everything about him at ebenalexander.com. He has written more books than just Proof of Heaven. His most recent one, Living in a Mindful Universe is now available everywhere. If you love this conversation, please check out his website and tune in. He was an amazing guest and I really took a lot away from this conversation. I hope you do too. So everybody, welcome to the DTFH. Dr. Eben Alexander. Dr. Alexander, welcome to the DTFH. I am thrilled that I get a chance to spend some time with you. How are you doing today? I'm doing great, Duncan. It's great to be here and I appreciate very much your having me on. Well, look, we, for those of you who are familiar with Proof of Heaven, I'm sure you all recognize that if we wanted to, we could spend the entire podcast talking about Dr. Alexander's near-death experience. But I have some other topics that I really am excited to chat about with him. So for folks who are, who maybe are just meeting Dr. Alexander today, you probably heard of his bestselling book, Proof of Heaven. He is one of a multitude of people who has experienced what we are now calling NDEs, near-death experiences. But maybe something that differentiates him from so many others is his background as a doctor. And I think it would be safe to say, Dr. Alexander, that prior to your experience, you had a more secular world view that many doctors have that didn't include the mystical. And so the fact that you were given one of these experiences with your medical background and, of course, with your comrades, I think, is what really sparked a lot of people's interests, which I guess is sad if we depend on the medical establishment to determine the validity of human experiences. That's another podcast altogether. But still, thanks to this crazy confluence of who you are and what happened to you and the people who analyze what happened to you, you have produced what I would call one of the most convincing explanations of the near-death experience that I am aware of. And that is, no doubt, why your book is the best seller. And also, it's an incredible book. It's well-written. So Dr. Alexander, with all that being said, do you think you could summarize what happened to you when you went into that coma, when you had meningitis? Well, absolutely. And you do bring up a very important point. And that is, it's really the details of my illness that are so important. And they've been corroborated in a medical case report on my medical records by three doctors who were not involved in my care, but were fascinated by my recovery. I'll get into that a little bit later. But yes, I had spent the first 54 years of my life honing a very kind of conventional scientific worldview. I taught neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School for 15 years. Thought I understood something about how brain, mind, and consciousness work. But all that changed very dramatically. November 10, 2008, woke up at 4.30 in the morning with horrific back pain, headache, soon grand mal seizures lapsing into coma. I spent the next seven days deep in coma, from which my doctors initially predicted I had about a 10% chance of survival. By the end of that week in coma on three powerful intravenous antibiotics on a ventilator for the whole seven days, that estimate had gone down to 2%, with no chance of recovery. And that is why my story is so amazing, because I came back from that. And even though my brain was really wrecked when I first woke up, I had basically a complete recovery over two months, which is inexplicable. Now to get to the essence of your question, what happened to me during that time? Important to point out, one of the atypical features of my near-death experience, this is something you don't often find, was amnesia. I had no memory of Evan Alexander's life. I had no knowledge of Earth, humans, language. It really was an empty slate. And it was really over months and years after my coma that it became clear to me why that kind of empty slate was so important. It's mainly because there was some tremendous lessons I had to kind of unlearn and relearn about the nature of reality. And that was the nature of that amnesia. But it all started in this primitive course, unresponsive realm, the earthworms I view, like being in dirty jello, kind of foreboding when I discuss it. But at the time, given my amnesia, I was perfectly fine with it. I mean, it was the way existence is. It's all I knew. Luckily, I was rescued from that by this slowly spinning white light that came packaged with a perfect musical melody. And that white light served as a portal up into a higher, richer, much more real world that I call the Gateway Valley. And in fact, the Gateway Valley was an intersection between the material realm, our earthly, you know, this universe, material universe, and our spiritual universe. And this is a region where we go through life reviews, where we encounter souls of departed loved ones, planned next incarnations, all that kind of thing unfolds in that realm. But it was much more real than this world. That's the thing that most people don't understand. And hence, part of the problem of the ineffability, the fact that we don't really have words to explain these experiences, because our language is great for a trip to Disney World, but not so great for a trip like this. Turns out, in that beautiful Gateway Valley, I wasn't alone. I was a speck of awareness on a butterfly wing among millions of other butterflies looping and spiraling in these vast formations. And there was a lovely young woman beside me, sparkling blue eyes, high forehead, high cheekbones, broad smile, soft brown hair, framing her lovely face. She was dressed in this kind of simple peasant garb, as I called it, although it was very colorful. And her garb really matched that of what I witnessed in the valley down below us, because in this Gateway Valley, there was this verdant, very rich, fertile valley surrounded by forests, sparkling waterfalls into crystal blue pools. But there were thousands of beings dancing in that valley. And when I came back from all this and wrote it all up, I said there were souls between lives. And all the joy and merriment in that valley was being fueled because up above were these swooping orbs of angelic choirs leaving sparkling golden trails against that blue-black, velvety sky. And there were emanating chants and anthems, hymns, that would just thunder through my awareness and completely enliven that entire scene. Now, early on in this part of the journey, there was a soft summer breeze that blew through. And that summer breeze, I called in my early writings to the breath of God or the divine wind. That was my first knowing and kind of connection with that God-force of pure love that was all through all of these realms. But it was my reminder of the reality that that was really the source of my very conscious awareness. Okay, can we pause there just for a while? I'm sorry, doctor, can we pause there just for one second? Now, let's imagine we take just what you just said and go back to before you had this experience. Maybe you're in Harvard and someone presents this story to you while you're looking at MRIs. I don't know what they would use to look at your brain, but you're looking at the damage. You're just like, here's a brain that has gone through the trauma that your brain went through. And you hear this person relating this very, very detailed, very coherent, very like beautiful picturesque story. And you're looking at that brain. What would you think? Well, actually, we can answer that very definitively because of all the medical details in the case report written on my medical records. And that came out in September 2018, Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, is by Dr. Surbhi Khanna, Lauren Moore, and Bruce Grayson. But the points that they make is based on the neurologic exams, which is really the best piece of evidence about just how badly my brain was impacted by this. The CT and MRI scans help because they show that this process was global, that there was no part of my brain that was spared. And that's their value, but truly the most important medical data about predicting my outcome and how ill I was were the neurologic exams. And they very clearly made me so sick from this. And with the scan data also showing that the entire sixth layer of the neocortex throughout my brain was so inflamed that there was a lot of edema, a lot of fluid swelling, even deep inside the brain, deep to these layers in the neocortex, it basically the conclusion that the doctors who looked at this medical information came to is this brain could not have harbored any kind of dream or hallucination. At best, that brain could have harbored the most primitive rudiments of consciousness. There is no way, given the construction of the brain, the way the neocortex is wired, that that brain could have come up with any kind of rich, extraordinary, ultra-real, multidimensional, memorable, detailed, life-transforming set of experience, which is what I had. And this is why the scientific community takes my story so seriously. The medical... This is like one of my kids pouring orange, like pouring a gallon of orange juice into my PlayStation and me playing God of War and everything's running perfectly, even though orange juice is just dripping out the sides. Any technician who looked at that would be impossible. Okay. Sorry to cut you off. Please continue. No, that's... But it's a very good point. I mean, in other words, what these doctors were saying was this brain could not... And that's what haunted me in the months after my coma. I was going back to the hospital. Now, my neurosurgical knowledge was still returning because it took about two months for all my prior semantic knowledge, cosmology, physics, neuroscience, neurosurgery, for all that to come back online. And during those two months, I was going in for follow-up care at the hospital, talking with my doctors, looking at my scans, medical records, trying to make sense of it, and none of it lined up because it was just impossible that I could have any such experience given the damage to my brain. And again, this is the main reason that I'm sorry for our puppies. They're very... Are you kidding? I thought, did you hear mine? It's there synced up. My poodle was just yapping outside, perfectly timed with podcasts. It's like he has access to my calendar. I was like, oh, I need to join in. They're telepathically connected. So anyway, thank you. You're welcome. Well, no, I would love to hear... I would love for you to continue your story. I just wanted to emphasize how absolutely bizarre what happened to you is based on our understanding of consciousness, the neocortex, the human brain. Absolutely. Well, see, that's what haunted me. You know, in fact, that's why I ended up writing the book, Proof of Heaven, is once I realized the deep truth behind my experience. And of course, that is all told in the book, Proof of Heaven, as we get towards the very end of it. But that's one of the biggest points it's made by the three doctors who wrote that medical case report. But another very important point that they make is when they submitted the case report, the peer review editors, scientific editors of that journal, challenged them and said, wait a minute, this case is absurd. That's the word they used. It's unprecedented in medical literature to have somebody this ill from gram-negative, bacterial meningitis, encoma for a week to then end up making a full recovery. How do you explain it? And the three doctors who wrote the case report said, it's because he had a near-death experience. That explains this kind of unprecedented kind of recovery. And they said that because they were aware of other cases of NDE's. For example, Anita Morjani, who wrote the book, Dying to Be Me, had an advanced stage four lymphoma that just disappeared after she came back from a profound near-death experience. Likewise, Dr. Mary C. Neal had over 30 minute warm water drowning in a kayaking accident in Chile. She wrote a book called The Heaven in Back. And our three cases are all beautiful examples of people with medical evidence that they should have just died from their experience. And yet, when associated with this profound spiritual experience, it allows them to come back with a tremendous amount of healing. And that, for me as a neurosurgeon, as a doctor, is one of the most important lessons we can take away from this is the spiritual power we all have in coming into wholeness and healing. And that, to me, is the most important lesson of my journey. But of course, it all has a tremendous amount to do with love and kindness and compassion. That's how this healing is accomplished. We can't achieve that kind of healing if we're running around with a bunch of hatred and selfishness and greed in our hearts. But it's by being loving and caring for self and others that we can really harvest that beautiful love of the universe and bring it into our lives as a form of wholeness. And it allows us to share that healing, wholeness, and love with others. It seems to point to this correlation between a feeling of being isolated, cut off from any mystical universe that somehow that experience could lead to so many diseases and disorders and just a general malaise, if nothing else. And it seems like you all are reminded of sort of your true geography or where you really are in relation to everything else. And somehow just that gnosis or whatever you want to call it has a physiological component. That is very strange. I understand coming back from an experience like that with a spiritual attitude, with less clinginess, with all the things that go along with desperately trying to protect your mortal, finite, relatively tiny existence. But the physiological part of it, that is a real chin scratcher. I mean, what is that saying that you're, why would your body, your physical body upon experiencing something like this suddenly just be able to fix itself and not just fix itself, but fix itself quickly. Like it shouldn't be so fast. Like what is going on there? Well, it is absolutely astonishing how quickly this kind of healing can happen. But it really has to do, I think what it tells us, it's kind of a measure of the kind of high degree of what I would say is kind of ego toxicity we have in our society of kind of me-focused, self-focused, selfishness, greed, narcissism. Those things are horribly toxic. And they end up damaging your life if you're a victim of that kind of approach to life. And I would actually attribute a lot of that kind of egotistical behavior to broadly, to our cultural buy-in to scientific materialism. Materialism in science is basically reductive materialism which means you break everything down into the component parts like subatomic particles, atoms, molecules, et cetera. And that's how you figure out how it all works. And of course, that implies there's some kind of bottom-up causality. But the ultimate problem there is this notion of materialism is that everything's separate. And when you combine that in the 20th century with a lot of the discussion around Darwinian evolution and the fact that even though Darwin was wise enough, for example, in his book, The Descent of Man, he uses the phrase, survival of the fittest twice, but he uses the word love 98 times. It wasn't Darwin who got us on that bad pathway. It was very militant atheists who wanted to weaponize evolution like Thomas Huxley in England and really make competition this huge giant battle prize that it became with our social sciences, economic systems, things like that in the mid-20th century. And a lot of that has led our whole society into this crazy ego toxicity. And you can see how bad ego toxicity is at large because addiction is absolutely a manifestation of ego toxicity and kind of this warped focus on self and not acknowledging kind of the higher good. And it gets us all into trouble. God bless you, Athletic Greens, for reigning your sweet, holy, delicious vitamin supplement into my cells. I love Athletic Greens because I am a disorganized fool.

She takes a thousand vitamins a day at different time intervals, some every five minutes, every 30 minutes. I don't understand it, but it is a galaxy of vitamins that she is consuming every day.

God bless you, Athletic Greens. You can see how bad ego toxicity is at large because addiction is absolutely a manifestation of ego toxicity and kind of this warped focus on self and not acknowledging kind of the higher good and it gets us all into trouble and that's why this huge wave of deaths due to opioid addiction and other addictions and what I would say is the awakening that we're talking about here and now, the awakening of humanity to the primacy of mind and to the fact that we are all truly interconnected. So if you hurt another, you're hurting yourself and that's a very concrete observation about the nature of reality and it's something that comes especially from my familiarity with the world of near-death experiences because the vast majority of near-death experiences will tell you that life review which happens anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of NDE cases is very strongly a message of the golden rule being written into the fabric of the universe. Treat others that you would like to be treated. The reason I say that is the life review as commonly described is much more of a reliving of events than of remembering. That's a very important point because it lets you know this is not just vague access to memories you go through. It's actually a reliving of events of your life that allow you to set the record straight, make amends, etc. This brings us to a question I have for you that I don't want to say troubled me, but kind of has troubled me. How do you know that this experience right now isn't the life review? Sometimes I wonder to myself, is this life review that people talk about which you just described, is it so... It's more than just a memory. It's not like I'm sitting on the couch thinking about yesterday. It seems to be in 3D VR like simulated reality. You are there for the whole thing. So what would be the difference between the life review and the current human experience where we're at right now? Well, I'll tell you the other major observation about life reviews in the scientific literature on NDE is not only that they're more of a reliving than a remembering, but most especially, and this is in about 75% of cases from Bruce Grayson at least, is that you relive it from the emotional perspective of others around you. So in other words, when we live this life forward, you're living it kind of from your ego and higher soul perspective where you're a being that interacts with other beings. But in the life review, you actually become some of the other beings to be on the receiving end. And that's the best way to teach, you know, how to behave. And that's why so many people come back from a near death experience and they're far more concerned about the higher good and treating others with love than they might have been before. And it's really because we're all truly sharing the one mind. That's where we go in our third book, Living in a Mindful Universe, as we go deeply into this notion of the one mind and how we're all ultimately facets of the diamond of the one mind. And that's the way I like to describe it. The diamond is the one mind. And each one of us is a facet. So we're never separate from it at all. We're never separate from it at all. And that's where, you know, I think Indy Ears kind of bring a unified message that we're all in this together. And we're here to take care of it. And that's something that's been kind of lost in our modern society. So the distinction here, it seems to be between localized and non localized consciousness. So the general assumption that most people have is I exist within my body, within my brain. Once the body shuts down, the me is gone to quote Dawkins, death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of life. Turn off the computer. It's over. This is the general assumption and many people who make this assumption, they're basing it not on any real research that they've done, but just what they have seen skeptics or scientific materialists put out there. They, they, they, and what you're talking about and what many others are talking about, not just Indy people have experienced Indy Ears, but I mean mystics throughout the ages have pointed to more of a kind of oceanic consciousness within which we are sort of these like floating sugar cubes that are dissolving into the thing and, and that, you know, sometimes when I'm looking at like, I don't know, this seems ridiculous, but slime molds, are you kidding me when you're looking at what a slime mold can do? There's no brain there. When you're looking at beings that don't have the neocortex that don't seem to have the hardware to perform some of the activities that they perform. It makes me think, okay, this, this can't be something just based on the brain. There, there, there seems to be just what you're talking about that we're drifting within this field or something like that. And so, and, and, and thinking that you're not drifting in that field, well, that's the path to selfishness. That's the path to war. That's the aggression makes a lot more sense. If you're you and I'm me, and we're not sharing this Buddha mind or whatever you want to call it. So what based based on your experience, but not just your experience, your familiarity with research, what is science saying about non locality of consciousness? Is this idea becoming more accepted or is it continuing to be something that like the scientific materialists think of as pseudoscience? Well, I would say the scientific materialists are basically Newtonian determinists who have no clue what quantum physics is actually telling us about free will and the nature of emergent reality. And so scientific materialism is actually going the way of the dodo. It's going extinct and that's because anyone who studies consciousness in the modern era is coming to realize that there are horrific problems with materialism. That is the notion that brain creates consciousness because only the material or physical world exists. And I work literally with hundreds of scientists around the world and I would steer people if you want some resources, go to scientificandmedical.net or go to Galileocommission.org. Those are both groups that I work with and they can educate you very quickly up to speed. Now, our third book Living in a Mindful Universe goes a long way towards educating people about the synthesis of science and spirituality and to answer your question about this notion of kind of the primordial mind, the cosmic mind, I would tell you that the evidence is only getting stronger and stronger that that is the case, that there is truly one mind that we all share and therefore the brain serves as kind of a filter that allows that primordial consciousness to come into us in a way that we interpret when we're living these lives in these bodies, we interpret as being, you know, this is my consciousness, nobody else has access to it and I don't have access to anyone else's consciousness, but that's not true. Telepathy is very real. Geely on Playfairs book on twin telepathy where he talks about 35% of identical twins having powerful, documentable telepathic communications and of course telepathy goes far beyond just twins, but it's very easy to demonstrate in twins. Look at remote viewing, you know, the science of remote viewing. Now Wikipedia being the everybody's encyclopedia, which means any nut can say any silly thing they want to Wikipedia is one of them on remote viewing. They say I'm sad to say a desecrated Wikipedia from time to time. Go ahead. That's another. But you know, I mean, I go in there and post ridiculous. I love it. Go to the most serious Wikipedia posts and you could just put in anything you want and just see how long before a frustrated Wikipedia editor has to take it out and make a note. Another idiot is infiltrated. Let's compare then Wikipedia with Jessica Utz. She was the head of the American Statistical Association 2015. She had done serious science and statistical analysis investigating precognition, investigating remote viewing the ability to discern information across time and space. And she said that scientifically this stuff would be fully accepted as absolutely real long ago. If it weren't something that pushed so many people's buttons, you know about spirituality about, you know, a soul and stuff like that and people just recoil. But the reality is the data is right there supporting the reality of all this. You know, mind is not something that we just have in our own little head. And for example, when you read near-death experiences like Anita Borjani, when she was deep in her NDE that was induced by a severe case of lymphoma, she was able to mind meld with her brother who was flying from India to Hong Kong supposedly to be attending her funeral. And likewise, her father who had passed over years before and her father's spirit. So in that mental realm of the NDE, you have access to the living that are at a distance and across time. You have access to those who've left the physical plane. So in NDE, you have access to this much broader mind that we all share. And in our book, Living in a Mindful Universe, we go into great detail about all of this. And you know, not just the quantum physics, which is very relevant to the notion of one mind, but also neuroscience, the hard problem of consciousness and the binding problem and philosophy of mind and all this evidence for non-local consciousness out of parapsychology. Every bit of it adds up to tell us the brain is a filter for this non-local consciousness and that all of emergent physical reality is due to events in that mental realm, not the other way around. So the mental, spiritual and mental create the physical, not the physical creating them. Right. Now, you know, I don't want to get sinister here, but sometimes I will get drawn into Gnosticism a little bit, the notion of the Demiurge, the idea of there being a kind of shadowy sort of momentum in the universe. And like the egregore of the material universe would want people to believe exactly what you just described. They would, if it would, it doesn't want to just be a product of mind. It wants to be the King, Dominion, power, control. And in the moment you experience some of the things that you've experienced or trust people enough to believe that the reality you're describing is more accurate than the one you might think you're in, then the world sort of loses its hold, doesn't it? It's the fear, the, you know, the, the attachment, the entanglement with protecting your stuff and all of those things. What's there to protect if you're just, it's just your mind. If it's, you know, with quantum physics, you know, it seems like what's happening in this realm of science that you're discussing is being mirrored across the board. I mean, because, you know, any, everyone's heard a hippie yapping about quantum physics and you know, you don't know anything, you don't know anything. You wouldn't want to, you wouldn't know a quirk from a ham sandwich. Stop talking about quantum physics, but then you look at the science coming out, the Nobel Prize that I think was just given to someone based on quantum entanglement, spooky math. You look at like, no, no, no, this is no longer hot tub conversation when you're coming up on MDMA. This is quantifiable and, and, and useful in the sense that people are using this new understanding of the material universe to send information and that this new understanding of the material universe is going to lead to computers that are going to completely, radically transform the way we do everything. So this is wild to, to see how it's emerging in this case. Um, but I want to, I want to ask you, um, a little bit about that idea of being able to reach out to people or however you would term it from that space after you've let go of your body, because I think all of us who've lost, lost loved ones have had that very real experience of, oh my God, they're here. They're in the room. Like not like I wish they were in the room, not, but literally like, why does it feel like they're standing next to me? Why does it feel like they're talking to me? Can you talk a little bit about that? Like, how does that work? If we are in this valley and we decide to go back into the human realm for whatever crazy reason, how could it, like, is it that we're existing in all of these states simultaneously? Or something. Can you describe the cosmology of, uh, like how the map of this, I can't figure it out. Like, you know, reincarnation. Okay. So you've taken another birth, but you seem to still be here. Well, I saw it all as, yeah, I can. I saw it all really as a vision deep in my journey. You know, when we were, I was sharing my story with you a little while ago, we got, you know, to kind of the end of the Gateway Valley, but I, I never really said where I went beyond that. I went to the core route where all of four dimensional space time collapsed down all of that spiritual realm that Gateway Valley, including a whole different temporal orderly, very important deep time or meta time is the way that things work there. So for example, that's how you can see your whole life at once because you're in a different temporal dimension that completely contains Earth time within it so that you can have simultaneous exposure to all the events of your life. And so this is kind of giving us an a glimpse of just how grand those spiritual realms can be and how our perspective is so broad. And but in my journey into the core realm, which was as far as I went and then I would cycle back down to these other realms and repeat my journey through, but the core realm was an infinite inky blackness filled to overflowing with the divine love of that creative source. That's why I first realized that the very source of my conscious awareness was that infinitely loving God force at the core of the universe. But I had one of many of the visions I had there as part of the lessons I learned was one that I call the Indra's net vision and this was one where I saw each and every one of us as a eternal soul basically represented as a weaving thread in this fantastic tapestry that was interwoven of all the threads of sentient life, you know, throughout all of eternity all weaving their way towards learning and teaching these lessons and it and it was not and the weave had a lot to do with reincarnation. So in other words, just the kind of motion of the weave had to do with being incarnate and then between lives incarnate between lives and that all of it was leading towards this Golden Center and it was when I read Pierre Taylor de Chardin's book The Phenomenon of Man about a year after my coma where he talked about evolution being a real, you know, like not just Darwinian evolution but the evolution of all consciousness throughout the cosmos and that's what I realized my Indra's net vision was showing me so beautifully and it was showing me that kind of viscosity I would call it of our soul lines so that we tend to kind of keep memories that are related to us in our soul group of with our soul as we go through these things. There's also a process of program for getting so for example when you review the scientific literature on reincarnation for example at uvadops.org University of Virginia Division of Perceptual Studies where they have more than 1700 solved cases where they actually identified the person who lived before that's described by the child. You'll realize how extensive this literature is. It's huge and there's just absolutely no way that it's kind of you know made up or imagine this stuff is amazing and but the thing is there's program for getting is Ian Stevenson and now Jim Tucker who does that work at UVA will tell you you have to harvest these memories before age six or seven because the memories tend to be over covered as we go into adulthood. So most of us as teenagers don't have past life memories or memories of of between lives etc and it turns out there's also a phenomenon called the amnesia of childhood which is a related issue and that has to do with most people will say they don't remember details of events that happened before age six or seven because of the amnesia though how unfortunate that that's where all of our memories of past lives in between lives used to live but now gone into program for getting they can be recovered and transpersonal psychology through hypnosis through having a near death experience yourself where past life memories might be revisited hypnotic regression is a therapeutic modality for getting back into past lives. But you know it's basically I'm just painting a picture of us is much bigger than just some little ego mind living birth to death in this incarnation. I would say that thousands of people who contacted me about proof of heaven after it came out loved it because in them it awakened a memory a similar memory of a similar journey. So this program forgetting is pretty serious stuff but we can overcome it and this is where meditation is so important because I would tell your listeners you don't have to have a near death experience to know everything I know and more about the reality of these afterlife all you have to do is put in the time to do you know some deep prayer or meditation centering prayer or meditation where you're getting rid of your ego mind. That's the most important goal of meditation is recognize that little voice in your head is not who you are. Thank you Zip recruiter for supporting this episode of the DTF age.

I love how Michael Singer is with the untethered soul calls the voice in the head the annoying roommate. Yeah, that's good. That's a nice way to put it that annoying roommate can make a request ask a question of whatever when I go into meditation but then that little ego voice goes into time out because there are aspects of us that are far grander of our conscious awareness the same ones that expand tremendously when we die when we leave the physical brain and body once and for all well we can expand those within meditation and centering prayer to and that's what I would encourage people to do it's a huge part of our book living in a mindful universe it's what my partner Karen Newell who co-authored that book her company sacred acoustics dot com is huge and providing binaural beat brainwave entrainment which is what I've been using daily for the last 10 years plus to return to my indie to cultivate relationships with the various denizens and guides and spirits and that infinitely loving God force meditation is a very powerful tool for each and every one of us to try and honor and cultivate that kind of higher soul that's connected with others and it's involved with the love of the universe to help bring the higher good to all and the more any one of us to vote our lives to that kind of thing including the going within because that's an important part but even more important of course is how we live our lives based on those lessons this is how we can really you know grow forward and make this world a far better place do you think though that maybe there is a I don't know a sort of a good reason for that amnesia and you know anyone who's had kids has probably heard them just happily talk about what is obviously their past lives with no inhibition they don't understand that you're not supposed to have a memory of being an an Indian child who got hit by a car or whatever the particular memory may be it's incredible it's astounding when you hear it but do you think maybe part of the reason that amnesia kicks in and by the way you know this is mentioned in Greek Greek mythology what's the river leaf I think is what it's called you drink from it you forget your previous life what's that river sticks as you cross leaf is the one you drink from and you were before that's it leaf you're right it's certainly well promoted in Kabbalah Jewish mysticism this notion of the angel touching you in the memories of your past lives going away I think it gives us skin in the game and let's just say that this stage in development and by this stage I mean these few thousand years of the name of the game is really for us to come into a knowing of the oneness we share through the binding force of love and I think that's the primary lesson of near-death experiences and that's really where the the science of consciousness is headed is to a wide support of this kind of notion of the one mind and this binding force of love that's so apparent to near-death experiences and helping us to realize we need to grow into that our little self-focused toxic ego world with all the addiction and narcissism and those kind of problems that we see today is kind of a symptom of where our culture has really gone off the rails in the last few centuries and I would say that this really gives us kind of skin in the game this program forgetting and yet I think that our culture is reaching a point with the spread of this kind of information this kind of thinking that I believe we will evolve beyond that kind of demand of skin in the game to a much more enlightened spiritual awareness that will allow all of us to know the power we have to come into wholeness and healing and that will be a magical era indeed because all physical mental and emotional illness is ultimately spiritual in some sense and by spiritual I don't mean anything that demands religion for me fact when you realize that 90% of near-death experiences come back to this world whether they were atheist or whatever before believing in some form of a loving God force. I'm not going to lay that at any one religion because it's accepting of all religions that can believe in love, kindness, compassion, mercy, acceptance, etc. So and that's a huge part of it is this realization that you come back having been through that knowing the reality of our interconnected spiritual nature and that it's all about love and the power of love to bring healing to our lives. And that's what I think this is all about. I mean, when you look at the world today, this world is in a little bit of trouble, you know, our addiction to fossil fuels, climate change, which is all on the verge of being irreversible. If we don't wake up pretty darn soon and start doing the right thing about it pollution, toxic, you know, plastics twice the size of Texas floating in Pacific Ocean. We've really got to change our ways. Homo sapiens, the what the wise, you know, species is on the verge of kind of driving to extinction a million other species. So this is why this awakening is so important. We need to know if you are sometimes okay, sometimes people pretend they're not killing themselves, but they're definitely killing themselves. Sometimes you know what I'm talking about like people who are like drinking themselves to death or people who are, you know, sort of disguising their annihilation as a form of like very intense recreation or something, but they're melting their organs are melting, they're dying and they're in there and it's almost like they have the part of themselves that hasn't forgotten is like, okay, let's just get out of here. Let's cancel this particular incarnation, get back to the butterfly Valley, head on into the deep golden Omega Point Love Center and we'll try again next time. And this is I think what is paradoxical about what you're talking about the skin in the game thing is that we do even with skin in the game, even with many people not having a real firm belief that there's anything after this. In other words, this is all we got. You got to make it work. We're still destroying the dang thing. So and also in a commonality in these nds, you hear people are like, I'm not going back. It's like, you know, when your kid gets a day off from school, God for big Christmas break and then they got to go back to school and no hell no, I don't want to go back. This seems to be the a lot of people say like, come on, let me just stay here. What's the point of that place? So should we get this a new perspective and not just a perspective that people have taken ayahuasca or DMT or ketamine or whatever the psychedelic or people have had an NDE or people have meditated. But you know, if it spreads through all of the modes of understanding the universe. Why? Why stay here? Wouldn't there be a wave of suicides? Every time credit card bills came in, wouldn't people just be like, I'll go to the butterfly Valley. Fuck you, AmEx. I'm out. Well, I can tell you my my experience, you know, not not only what I went through personally, but talking with thousands of other NDE years over the last 15 years, reading a tremendous amount of these reports, and also broadening beyond just the NDE literature about kind of the spiritual realm. I believe that this is where we get the work done. You know, we don't get the work done over there. And so this is where we really grow. And that's a very kind of important consideration of it all. And in fact, I would say I've heard many accounts of people saying that basically, or I would say that souls are chomping at the bit to get in here. This earth realm is a place where they can do some real work. And they know they're going to be temporarily dumbed down, that they're going to have to do some serious work to recover the that kind of spiritual wisdom. But the thing is over multiple incarnations, a certain amount of it keeps sticking more and more, and you get to be a more and more advanced soul. And so sooner or later, you're coming back here completely altruistic, philanthropic and just working for the higher good. That's ultimately what ends up happening. But but don't diss the earth realm and earth school, because this is really where the progress is made. Oh, I love it here. I mean, this is I'm quite happy with the earth realm. And you know, anytime I've had the grand vision from psychedelics, and the familiarity and all of it, I'm very happy to be back here. But just some people I don't think are enjoying it as much. Now, okay, so this, there's something I'm really excited to say to those who are not enjoying it so much. Might I offer that if you're so busy, you know, being the ego and the me me me and grabbing for this, that and the other, as opposed to, you know, seeing the higher good appreciating how you can show love to other people help the least, the last and the lost, serve the higher good. And I suspect that that a lot of people who find, you know, this earth school to be dull and they want to get off. Maybe they're just too of self focused. And maybe they would benefit from kind of opening up and helping others and find that that actually is a very rich kind of source of taking your next breath and to keep doing that day after day. It's beautiful lesson that I think most indie ears learn from their experience. They come back much more focused on the higher good and on love and on compassion. And in fact, most indie ears come back more spiritual, but less religious. I think that's a very important point. Religion can be great, but it awakens spirituality in us. But only if it's a rich, authentic, heartfelt spirituality that honors the higher good and love and kindness and compassion. You know, otherwise quite as useful. So that's really kind of the focus for indie ears. And that's why I think all of us can grow through this. Because in fact, all of us are indie ears. We just have not remembered in many cases. I never looked at it that way. That's wild. Yeah, right. Of course. Yes. Based on this cosmology, we've done it. Why proof of heaven? So many people told me a reminder them of something and awakened in them their own journey that they'd forgotten. You know, ever since they were a kid. So I was watching YouTube. That happened when I was watching a clip. Of you and you know, whatever that amnesia is, I just remember it was very interesting. I've only had that a few like, you know, I if you've ever said if you ever smoke DMT, sorry to ask, you don't have to answer that, by the way, if you ever smoked, I'm I'll tell you what, it's an important question. Because, you know, many people like Sam Harris said, Oh, Evan Alexander just had a DMT trip. And they all just assumed it was a DMT trip. So I took it on myself as a scientific researcher to work with professional and did a dose escalation trial of five methoxy DMT, which is the most powerful form of that particular plant medicine. And what I can tell you is that that was looking through a tiny keyhole of definitely into the same realm. But I prefer the panoramic penthouse view I had from my organic natural near death experience to the psychedelic experience. And in fact, something we talk about right about often is how meditation, I believe it's a better way. Now you can supplement that with with those serotonin two way substances like psilocybin, LSD, DMT. But ultimately, I think far better true soul work is accomplished in meditation. And, you know, interesting work now with some of those psychedelics is beautiful. For example, from Roland Griffith, said John Talkins, using psilocybin magic mushrooms, one or two doses, that's all you need, you don't need to keep taking it. That's the interesting thing. It serves as a catalyst. But he's used it in the management of addictions, especially alcoholism, nicotine, nicotine is one of the worst physiologic addictions we face with great success, you know, in 70 to 80% of people. Likewise, he's used psilocybin to manage debilitating fear of death in terminal cancer patients, right? Very effectively. And and again, one dose, it doesn't take a lot. And what I would argue is meditation can give you the same thing and an even gentler and ultimately more powerful fashion. So I'm a I agree. I mean, no one wants to hear that none of the I agree with you. I remember hearing Ram Dass talk about that when I was in my deep psychedelic phase and giving a big old eye roll to that like, give me a break sitting around, you're not going to get that breakthrough experience. But in my old age, I think it's, it's that you know, the thing you're talking about is like a viewfinder, you want to go to the Eiffel Tower? Do you want to go see the Eiffel Tower or you want to see a viewfinder of the Eiffel Tower? Which do you prefer? And and I think that's what meditation offers also a more stable platform, I think, because the psychedelics are also unpredictable and they have their own personalities, and they add their own filters to the experience. Okay, before I knew this would happen, we barely scratched the surface here, but I would love to hear your thoughts. We can always talk. Oh, you're going to regret saying that get prepared for infinite emails. Well, I would strongly advise including my partner Karen Dole if we do that because she brings a tremendous amount of wisdom to the conversation. That's what we'll do next time now. Okay, so love that man. Here is the, I guess this is going to be the last little thing we get to talk about, but I am obsessed with AI. I just am so fascinated by the way it is impacting our culture and it's only been around for at least the current iterations been around for maybe 14 days or something like that. And already it's transforming so many industries. But what I'm really interested in about it is that it's challenging people's idea of what is consciousness, what is sentience. And the definition or the way I think people are trying to determine whether this thing is woken up or is aware is that they're doing, they're viewing it from the, that's what we talked about earlier, the Newtonian scientific materialists, one taking the thing away from the inner dependency that we all have and waiting for it to manifest traits or qualities that are more like byproducts or something of consciousness. But what you, if we are in a non localized field of consciousness, then that would imply that we're dealing everything as its own kind of animistic sentience. It might never be able to express it, but it's still like vibrating with whatever that fundamental love force thing is. So what are your thoughts about this chat GPT and all the various versions of it that are currently appearing and how, how would you, how do you analyze this thing based on your background and your experience? Well, first of all, I want to point out that Alan Turing back in the 1940s came up with a Turing test, which was, you know, basically, if you're on a keyboard and you're communicating with a computer and you're wondering is the entity on the other end a live human being or an intelligent system, you know, an expert system. And Turing just, you know, pointed out that if you can't tell the difference and if it looks to be human, then you pass the Turing test that has nothing to do with consciousness at all. Right. An expert system is just something that can can use the speed and the memory of computer systems to kind of outpace you like, you know, right playing a chess game by where billion moves into the future and it can tell which way to go. But it's not through self awareness. It's not through consciousness. And in fact, there's zero from my perspective, zero way you will ever have a digital computer that will be self aware conscious. It might mimic that emulate that, but it's not going to be that. And there's a giant difference between appearing to be self aware and being self aware. Okay, but if we're all in this field of consciousness, I'm sorry to interrupt. If we're all in this field of consciousness. In other words, if it is non localized, if we're all just various like perceptual mechanisms floating in this oceanic God mind, then just the fact that you're here in whatever form, whether it's a butterfly, a frog, me or a harmonized neural network, isn't there consciousness there no matter what? Well, I think the way to look at it, what you're you're dancing around an interesting philosophical question, where the the two main answers I would say are panpsychism and panentheism. And this is where it's important to kind of draw the distinction panpsychism is a basically a pseudo materialist position that tries to attach elements of proto consciousness to subatomic particles, for example. Okay, and so that's me put the subatomic particles. Okay, and panpsychism is not the correct answer. Okay, there are some philosophers who push panpsychism because they realize there's much more to mind than just brain. And so this is their form of dualism saying okay, well, mine cannot be fully explained by brain, but let's put them in parallel by, you know, this panpsychism wrong. Panentheism is a better way of looking at it. And that's more kind of the not only mind over matter, but spirit over matter. It looks at the connectedness of mind as being that God force. And this is a way of seeing the universe exists within that mind. This is the important distinction. So it's not as if we look out in the world and you see rocks and trees and you see a asphalt road, you say all these things are conscious, because the actual consciousness is that they exist within that mind. And that's a very different that allows for top down causality. That allows for a tremendous amount of organization and understanding within the universe to realize that this is all within consciousness. And there's an excellent essay I can send people to it's by Bernardo Castro. It's in the Journal of consciousness studies in 2018. And I think it's called the universe in consciousness. And it's an excellent scientific article that really kind of puts it in perspective helps you understand why panpsychism is wrong. But this view of panentheism makes a tremendous amount more sense. Wonderful. Thank you for the correction there. I mean, I can't even argue with you because I'm not smart enough. And I haven't researched either either of these philosophical viewpoints enough to like even understand it fully. But that's that sounds good. That sounds good to me. So okay, so there we go from your perspective. We're still just dealing with a machine. Sorry, folks. Not the answer I expected but as you were asking about chat GPT what I can tell you is you better go back to the drawing board people because that's the most in those software modes are the most embarrassing if you're trying to pretend that that is self awareness. That's pathetic. Give it up. I'm glad they're putting a six month hiatus. Are they? I really just want to. Yeah, must and Bill Gates and others have just gone public in the last day or so saying we need to put a six month hiatus on this insane focus on AI because it can be dangerous. And I would say inept incompetent, useless AI can absolutely be dangerous because people start thinking, oh, it knows more than I do. And they start, you know, looking to AI to guide the way into the future. Well, no way. Forget that. I think until they can really up their game tremendously beyond this embarrassing kind of rollout we've seen in the last few months of AI technologies like chat GPT. Just just quit people. Give it. Why is it embarrassing? What do you think? What's embarrassing about it? Why is it? Why do you think it's embarrassing? It's embarrassing. Well, for example, look at what happened to Google stock when they when their little system AI system was asked about the James Webb telescope and it's put out this big article that said, well, James Webb telescope is the first one to discover exoplanets wrong right out of the gate. It was completely embarrassingly stupidly wrong. And for that to pretend to be a system of intelligence. Yeah, it's artificial. All right. It doesn't even exist as an intelligent. Okay, so I'll tell you go back to the square wall. I think you have to the problem. Here's the problem with I think your your point of view there is that you know, look at agrarian revolution to industrial revolution, industrial revolution, technological revolution, all the amount of time we had to sort of get used to every like in between moment in each of those revolutions, you're this thing is not been around that long. And I agree with you, my God, one of the funniest moment I have synthesizers many of them I don't understand. I asked chat GPT out of like dialing a patch for like a mystical flute. This thing with the confidence of the person who made the synth was like, do this, then do that, then do this, then I'm like, what? This is amazing. Everything it said was wrong. It was just emulating confidence. Well, then I fed it the PDF of how to run the synth. It read it extrapolated that information and then correctly told me how to do the thing. Now, the newest iteration of the thing, it will give you I don't know how to code, but it gave me the code to make a video game that I thought of, and showed me the steps to take. And that's been around for about 10 days. So I think that our judgment of the thing is is based on a very early phase version of it. It's only going to get more confident. Duncan, I would also point out that computer code is very different from, you know, the way we use language and telling stories and in trying to make scientific statements and all that. Computer code is very literal. And so in that setting, a system like chat GPT, if you put, you know, no more garbage in garbage out, if you put in good data, you might get some very reasonable and useful results. I'm just saying the way these systems are being used currently, they're not not very good, and especially for kind of general information, but computer code is a very different category. I would consider that as realm, especially when you're putting in good code, where this kind of an intelligent system could give you some very good output. So don't get me wrong on that one. You're just saying it's that if you if you are, you know, it's like bringing a blow up doll to the bar or something. It's like, come on, that is not your girl. That's a raft. That's a raft that you've been making love to stop. I see your critique. Dr. Alexander, thank you so much for this time. And as soon as we hang up, I'm having I'll reach out so that we could schedule the next one. Will you tell everybody where they can find you and where the best place for them to order your newest book? All right, well, if you go to ebbenelexander.com, there's information on all the books and of no proof of heaven, we just came out with a 10th anniversary edition that includes 36 new pages to it. So I would highly recommend people who are interested, get that new 10th anniversary edition. Also sacredacoustics.com. That's an excellent site for learning about minor binaural beat brainwave entrainment, the kind of meditation I've been using daily for more than 10 years now, and it was created by my partner Karen Newell. Also, I would steer people to there's a whole set of interviews that we did with thought leaders around the world on consciousness on spiritual and modern science of consciousness, quantum physics, etc. That set of interviews is available at inner i n n e r sanctum center dot com.

Looks like we got us a little butter baby playing over here next to this rotting crow carcass. Let's put some earbuds and see if he wants to listen to a podcast. He does. These butter babies love these podcasts and all of you gathered around the flickering digital fire that is the DTFH. I welcome you. You have tuned in to the nation's top rated podcast. It's considered to be the number one podcast. It has been given every award possible. I can't even go through the list because there's so many. I don't want to bore you and I don't want to seem like I'm bragging. I feel very fortunate to have received three years in a row. Monsanto's top podcaster in America award. I've also received the Halliburton Let's Have Fun Listening to Podcasts trophy as well as four different awards from the Department of Defense, including the most important podcast for transmitting a secret Illuminati message to the world vaguely disguised as some kind of interview style podcast. For that, I am very, very grateful and this is why I kissed the stone feet of the statue of Zornax every night before I go to bed in my golden tomb. I hope you guys are having a great day. Man, fall is here. Nothing can put me in a better mood than fall. No matter how rotten things may seem, fall will always pull me out of any kind of personal despair just walking outside and feeling the cool air realizing that God has turned on his air conditioner and that Goddy old fucking summer has gone galloping off into wherever summer spends summer's fall. Let's face it, fall is the best, spring a close second. Any of these liminal seasons, the seasons in between the big seasons, that's where I'd like to hang out. If we could extend fall to all year long and figure out a way to grow crops in the midst of that and not disrupt the ecosystem and cause a terrible ecological disaster that would more than likely end with all of us covered in ash eating each other's molten flesh then I would do it in a heartbeat. See you later, summer, you're out of here, you're fired, you're gone, you gotta go. We will no longer be trapped in your rotten cycle of blistering heat. We will no longer be forced to wear short sleeve shirts. Nobody wants to wear short sleeve shirts and shorts and flip flops, only a fool would want to dress like that. No, what we want to do is wear long sleeve flannels, pants, boots, fall style hats. We want to listen to fall style music. It's Nick Drake time, baby. We gotta turn on some Nick Drake and lay in front of the fire with our darling lovers as we discuss a fall style movie like Mother. We're not gonna get shat on by these summer blockbusters anymore. Nope, we can look forward to a series of nice independent films that we can have controversial heated discussions over as we drink red wine and stare into the stuff ahead of a deadly wolf that we captured outside our family's mansion. I just want to cover myself in fucking rune stones and suck off a unicorn. It's fall, it's memory foam style sleeps and big soft comforters that you pull over yourself and blasting the heater so it feels like you're sitting in the mouth of an overheated walrus watching fall documentaries, Ken Burns, Vietnam's and drinking cider with your sweet darling who's cozied up against you and whispers secrets into your ear that make you feel like you are a god, which you are. So let's welcome fall friends and let's hope this one lasts a little bit longer than usual before we get sucked into iceberg season and freeze our asses off in the land of snow, which is right around the corner. It's pumpkin time, sweeties. Halloween is on the way, the invisible membrane that separates us from the spirit world is rapidly degrading, which means that our magical incantations will be amplified with each passing day. We did it. It's fall. And this is an incredible podcast for the fall because in this podcast, I'm going to introduce you to one of the coolest, sweetest beings that I've encountered in a very long time. This is a wonderful podcast because this is a podcast with Derek Waters, incredible mother Jody and not to get sappy on your pals when you don't have a mother, you really start appreciating mothers and the mother I'm about to present to you is an A grade high powered first class mother. We're going to jump right into this episode, but first some quick business. Holy shit friends, we've got a brand new sponsor, an amazing sponsor. This DTFH is brought to you by bomb fell.com bomb fell. It's an easier way for men to get better clothes. You complete a simple questionnaire and are then matched one on one with a dedicated personal stylist. They never charge you above retail price. They offer free shipping and returns. They have convenient home trions and the ability to preview and edit your stylist's pics before your order ships. I'm going to be honest, man, when they approached me, I was a little skeptical because I'm really picky when it comes to clothes, believe it or not, and I hate shopping and I trace it all the way back to when I was a kid and I would, I'd have to wear Husky clothes. I don't know if there are any Husky babes out there, but it was just, it was humiliating and I'd go with my poor mom and she would like, you know, try to pick clothes out without hurting my feelings. And by the end of it, I would just feel like just a, just fucking awful, just awful, crazy, rotten, hated my body, hated clothes, hated the fact that I had to buy clothes to wear to fucking school to get brainwashed by some goddamn government. It was the worst and this is why I don't like going out to shop now. I don't like it. I get all fucking weirded out and sweaty and freaked out. Anytime I go to a store to do shopping, I don't like it. I don't like getting there. I don't like being there. I don't like trying on the clothes. And when I get back with the clothes I bought most of the time, I don't like the clothes I bought. This is why I was skeptical when I was approached by Bomfell and I checked out the website and the premise was you would be able to connect with a stylist, describe what you like and they would somehow pick out an outfit for you that would actually fit and look cool. This seems ridiculous to me. As you know, I only advertise things that I actually like. So I had to try this out first. I went through the process, which is you sign up, they ask for your measurements, they ask what you want to pay for your clothes, then you tell them what you want. So you get all these options for things that you want. I picked like a pair of jeans and a button down long sleeve shirt and a cool jacket. And you get a preview email where a stylist has put together your clothes. You look at it, decide if it seems like anything you would want to wear. You can adjust it if you don't want to and then you get the clothes and you try them on. And now they picked out a really cool outfit and it fits and I like it. I'm going to wear it. I'm actually going to wear it and it's cool and you know, it's super cool about it. It's like something I wouldn't have picked out for myself, but something I want to wear if that makes any sense at all. It's like cooler than what I would have picked out or maybe I wouldn't have like thought to put these things together, but they have actual stylists doing this stuff over there. And I guess they're running some kind of badass algorithm bottom line at works guys. So if you don't want to horrify yourself anymore by going to the mall or wherever you go to buy clothes and you want to experience what it's like to have an actual stylist pick clothes out for you, like you're some kind of billionaire trust fund kid frolicking through some magical life, then bomb fell is definitely worth trying out. And right now if you go to bomb fell.com forward slash trussell, that's T R U S S E L L. You can get $25 off of your first purchase. That's amazing 25 bucks off and these clothes are cool. They're great. I'm really picky about clothes. I generally, I honestly did not imagine that there would be any way in hell that some stylist somewhere far away would be able to just take my measurements and have a basic idea of what I'm into and what my, what my sort of clothing choices are and send me an awesome outfit. And also when I was doing Harmon town, Harmon is also sponsored by these guys and I saw the outfit he was wearing and it's fucking cool. So this is, I guess this is the future man. I don't know. This isn't, this is to me, like a big deal because I, I hate shopping for clothes. Maybe you love it. I don't know. Maybe you love standing in front of some ill lit mirror and some fucking mall staring at your pasty body as you look through some clothes you randomly picked out and try to match them and realize you have no idea what you're doing. Or maybe you do. Maybe you're a fashion man. Well not all of us are. Okay. I'm not. I don't know how to do it. Half the time I get too stoned. I go to the, pick out the clothes. I end up picking out something that, that it looks like I should be like sending my kid off to college. You know, something lame. Not that it's lame to send your kid off to college, but I just, I don't know how to do it. I don't understand it. It's just amazing to have access to a real stylist. So give them a shot, bomb fell.com forward slash T R U S S E L L. You have nothing to lose. If you don't like it, you just send it all back. No big deal. And also if this first thing the stylist sends you or some aspect of it is something you don't like, then you actually send that back and they send you another choice and you can do this through several rounds until you tune into what you like. And then your stylist knows what you like to wear. And now you have this person who's going to shoot clothing bullseyes anytime you want to get a new outfit and it's awesome. It saves you from having to go to a mall and walk by the fucking perfumes and smell that aerosolized whale asshole. When you could just be at your house getting nice, cool outfits that make you look like you know how to dress. It's awesome. Bomb fell.com forward slash trustle. Go check them out. If they could pick out clothes for my strange spindly wobbly body, then they could definitely pick out cool clothes for you bomb fell.com forward slash trustle. Go there now. It's 25 bucks up.

Today's guests are the host and creator of Drunk History, Derek Waters, and his amazing mother, Jodi Waters. Please welcome to the DTFH, Jodi and Derek Waters. This is a really special night for the DTFH because not only am I with one of my favorite humans living today on planet Earth, Jodi Waters. I'm also with the creator of Drunk History, Derek Waters. You're the creator of Drunk History, Jodi. If you think about it, because you created the creator of Drunk History. That's it. Do you get any royalties? I get nothing. Nothing. Nothing at all, other than just being. Oh, that's true. Yeah, but let's talk about like, let's just get down to a couple of, let's get a couple of bits of business out of the way, then we'll get into the podcast. Number one, Derek, why aren't you getting residuals from your mom from Drunk History? Why aren't I getting them? Or why I should be getting them. Right. Yes. I mean, sure, I could. Do you need any money? Mom, be close. Bring it in closer. Yeah. There you go. Like that's about, that's. Is that about? See where it is the distance from my mouth. Yeah. Just right around. Hold it like that. Hold it. My hand starts to go to sleep. There you go. That's good. This is good. Pretty good. Yeah. That's great. All right. So what about that, Derek? Let's cut your mom in here. There's some royalties. I mean, I guess I haven't done it because I didn't know you needed it. No. And Burns and I have talked about this. That's my dad, Burns. Yes. And that we know that if we ever really needed money, Derek would certainly be willing to help us. Let's also make clear that it's a comedy central show. No. I'm not loaded. No. But, and this has always been our wish for Derek, that when he came out here that we thought, oh, just let him be able to provide for himself, be able to live by himself without our help anymore. And hey, it's turned out to be better than we ever expected it. Can you talk a little bit about the first year or two that Derek came out here and what that was like to know that your son was pursuing one of the most ridiculous and improbable careers that anyone could choose? How did that feel? How did you deal with the inevitable first few years of comedians life in Los Angeles, which it doesn't look that good for anybody when they first come out here? It's so funny because I know exactly how I felt when growing up, okay, none of us are academically oriented. The Water Summit. Myself. Right. We just were not school, the school people, even though I ended up to be a teacher. Now, go figure that one out. You're a teacher. You're a short bus. We didn't have a bus. Right. I think, I think, I think we could say that maybe the Waters family is modest, but certainly not slow. I don't think that's an accurate appraisal of you guys at all. So of course we were, you go along and you see as your children mature and we have, Derek has an older brother, six years older. So he always, Justin, Derek's older brother, was, he loved the business that my husband had. And so. That is called the Waters Company and Justin will, everything to do with tires except for tires. There you go. Wheel weights, tire belts. Anything to make, to put tires on, but don't, not to get too far away from your main point. How do you get into the tire business? Family. In 1926, it started. So the Waters family, just who started you guys in the town? Mm-hmm. And it was, it was originally the Waters rubber company. So when it originally started, they sold, it was in Baltimore, they sold rubber bathing suits. Ha! I never knew this. I know. It's very. Condoms? No, no condoms. No. But the other, and people who grew up in Baltimore remember they had a place on Charles Street, which that's Baltimore. They had a seal in the window. And I remember Sears had one of these too. And it, with air, I'm thinking about it, I got it. Okay. So the seal's there. A seal like an animal. Like the animal. Ooh. You know. So anyway. Oh my. Okay. So they have, it's like, they want people to think that the seal, you know, in the circus it's balancing balls. Yes. When it snows. Okay. So here's the seal in the window of the store and the ball is going up and up and up. But they're secretly, of course, a little fan that's making the ball, you know, go, but it makes people think that. Okay. So that's, that's where the rubber. That was in the original Waters company? Yeah. So the thing you could buy back then to help your store is you would buy like a, just put a seal in the window. Yeah. Well, as double your business. Do you know, as a matter of fact, I'm wondering, because I remember Sears, Sears Robots. The Sears seal. They had one in there too, because I never saw the Waters company seal. But then. Okay. So that, okay. So then they got into retreading, which I kind of learned this. When you retread tires, there's a special rubber that you use and you know, now I'm thinking, was this like, did they sell it? What's that? This is sad. Do you know this? Probably there? Cause you have a show about history. What's the history of the automobile? When did cars first show up on the scene? I could know that, but I don't. I mean. Google search. Yeah. Like we used to do in the old days. So the point is, this is a relatively, probably it's, it's like kind of cutting edge to be making tires back then. This is still. Well, they, they, again, like Derek said, the Waters company is everything about tires but tires themselves. So they didn't, they would like sell the rubber, I guess, to re- They're the distributor. Exactly. Okay. Now I'm remembering. Okay. Because there's still retread plants. And so the Waters company, Waters rubber company then would buy the rubber and then they would sell it to the retread plants and they were the ones that made the tires to go on the trucks. And do you know, this is really interesting because you know how you're going down the highway and you see these big things of rubber on the roads. Okay. I know. I thought, what the heck is that? But on the trucks from going over, that's actually the, the tires have been retreaded and that's the, the newest of the treads that have. Like they're snakeskin. Calling off. Right. Right. Husband's father or grandfather, grandfather. Yeah. And then your husband's, what's his name? Burns. Burns father is also. He was right. It was his granddad. His name was also Burns. Then he named his, my dad's name was Burns, Hargit Waters, the third. Wow. How did he not want to continue that? Burns waters. Do you get a cooler name than that? Oh yeah. Burns Hargit Waters, the third and you know why? Okay. So his grandfather was Burns Hargit Waters. He named his son Burns Hargit Waters, junior, I think it goes, or the second, then because he hated the name Burns's dad, he never, he went by Bob. So what does he do after when his first son is born? He names him Burns Hargit Waters, the third. Wow. So Burns is Burns. And so, okay, so that's, first of all, it's amazing Burns waters is the coolest name ever. Now, so your oldest son is in the family business. Yes. He's interested in this. Fourth generation. Yes. And he's doing that now. He is. Yes. That's amazing to think. Yeah. Four generations of a business. That's incredible. And that is true. Historically, most family businesses don't make it even past the second. That's, you know, because, I mean, families are families and most of them have all kinds of... The most family businesses struggle and they sell them off to corporations. That's true. Or you know what the other thing is that happens a lot of times is that the father is really interested. The kids come along and, well, see if we only had Derek, Burns would have, you know, sold the business out because who... But I've always said, if anything happened to dad and Justin, I would figure out how to keep it. Yeah. So Justin is demonstrating some, this proclivity for working in the family business and that's a relief. Yes. You've got a son who's suddenly obviously interested in the family business and that's really cool. That was right. So we had that in our minds. When comes Derek? Oh boy. Look out. It's just so neat to think about him from the, he always loves this story. But I'm telling you, I remember this. He was an infant and in the old days, they had actual little scales where you put the baby on the scale and, you know, for their checkups. And I still remember Derek. The old days. They don't. They don't. I don't. They might. They just feel them. Well, they probably have. They were born in 1979. I know. But maybe they haven't. I think they have a more high tech way of playing. They have digital. Something or others. I don't know. Oh, you mean they put them on a like meat scale. Yeah. Oh yeah. Right. Exactly. So yeah, they wasn't a digital. They put them on the same thing. Yeah. And then, you know, the little... Like a jarrow goes off. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway, he's sitting there. He's, you know, and... Is Dr. Yim? It's Dr. Yim. Right. And Dr. Yim. Do you remember your... Oh, yeah. I heard the story. It's in my damn time. But yeah. Keep going. Okay. So anyway, he comes into the room and sees, you know, cute little Derek just sitting there and he says, do you know there is something special about this little boy? And I never, ever forgot that. And in fact, years and years later, I saw Dr. Yim and I said, do you remember, you know, you said something, you know, I mean, he said thousands and thousands of people. He says, no. No, no. I know. I don't say that to everybody. Because I thought... Right. But we knew that Derek... You meant special needs. No. No. He saw the spark. Exactly. And it just emanated, emanated, is that a word, from Derek. Yeah. Okay. This is a really good example. And he loved, loved people. He just loved people. I put him... Oh, excuse me. He attended a nursery school and it was like from nine to 12. Well, it was also, they had the nursery school, but they also had a daycare for the parents who worked. And because some of the kids in Derek's classes stayed for daycare, he said, Mom, I want to stay for daycare because he wanted to be with the kids longer. He was like, no, I don't want to come home with you. I want to stay here with my friends. And I'd say, Derek, that's for the mommies who work and don't you want to come home? No. No, he really, he just anything and... Did I love people? I just didn't want to be home. No, you really... Get me out of here. No, no, no. And did you wonder that? Were you worried? No. Okay. No. And I guess that's the other really neat part about Derek because he did. He had something special and, oh, okay, I'm just trying to think. But when you're a mom, where did you wrestle in your mind? Because here's the truth, sometimes parents give birth, every child is special, right? But sometimes parents give birth to an actual super special kid. But isn't this the weird mental wrestling match you have to do with yourself as a parent because you have to think, is the kid special just because it's my child and my DNA wants me to think the kid's special because if we don't think our kids are special, when they start crying, we'll throw them off a cliff thousands of years ago because they're so annoying. Or weren't you sort of wondering and thinking like, does the doctor say, I think if I had a child, I would want to believe I have spawned the Christ. But I mean, I'd want to believe it too. This is the most... I would also... Part of me would be like, no, it's just my brain playing tricks on me. Certainly not any more special than any other child. Do you want... That just triggered a memory and this is... And I guess both of my sons to me... But this one... This was about Justin, how was it you? Shoot. I'm dirt. I know, but I'm trying to think. I was at a friend's, I was out of six years. So I was at a friend's house. That's an interesting... I'm sorry to cut you off. That is an interesting span of time. There you go. Okay, I can... Do you want me to explain that? Well, let Duncan explain to his listeners where he's going. Okay. Okay. I'm just saying it's an interesting span of time between... I mean, a lot of times when people have kids, it usually is like, oh, you know, like my brother, for example, it's like, you know, three years. Duncan has a theory that maybe my dad isn't my dad. Because there was such a long... A long time. Why was there a long time? Okay. There's a very, very good reason as to that. Are you going to remember the story? I will. I'll go back and you can help me. But when Justin was born, I had never held a baby. I was 24 and I'd never held a baby. I didn't know really what to do and I thought I was a horrible mother. And so... Why did you think that? It was not... Well, I just... I didn't know what to do if he cried and I... Did you have anyone to help you? Could you talk to your mom about it? No. That was really not an option. So you were kind of, because of this relationship with your mom, you didn't have the normal support system that people have, which is a mom who knows how to tell you... Generally, this information is passed down from mother to mother to mother. That's right. So you're having to sort of figure it out as though you're the first mom. You have books or something and you have Dr. Yen. Yen? Yeah. And when you say that, that's very true because I really didn't know how to mother because I didn't have a role model to base my mothering skills on. I really was starting at ground level. So back in those days, of course, no Google or anything, we had a book, Dr. Spock. Right. It was called that? Yes. Dr. Spock. Yes. And so whenever Justin would do anything, you just look it up in Dr. Spock's book and he would say, anyway, this all goes to the point. Feed him. Yeah. He cries, feed him. Feed him. It's like a two-page book. Go to the grocery store. This all goes to just tell you I was totally not prepared to be a mom at all. And this went on, obviously, because most of my friends, as you had said, two and three years is the traditional span between children. Well, and my friends were all doing that. I also, then a lot of them were like, oh my God, I'm tearing myself apart. Oh, these kids are driving me crazy. And I thought, well, I'm not doing that. And then, okay, this is, oh my gosh, I'd forgotten all this. So I said, okay, well, I think we're going to have an only child because I just can't see myself going through all this with such a mess the first time. So we're going to have an only child. And I bought books and all the advantages, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yep. This was it. Okay. Then my father had a little business anyway. He was moving, make a long story short, he fell off the back of a truck and knocked himself unconscious and had to be taken to the hospital. We as a family, it was my mom, my dad, my brother and myself were helping him. So when he went to the hospital and we didn't know what was going on, it was just my brother and myself in the waiting room. And at that moment, I said, oh my gosh, no, that's not fair to Justin. You have to have somebody with you if you go through these traumatic. I said that, oh my gosh, the next month, bang, I got pregnant. Now let's really think about this moment and that's amazing. Your entire existence, my grandfather falling off the truck, that moment of imbalance. And do you know what? And because my father, my father was wonderful, everybody loved him, but he was a narcissist. There's no doubt about that. And when Derek started to achieve some success, he would tell people, you know, Derek's here because of me. Oh, yes, that's him. Because everything revolved. Derek, we need it. Now that I know this story, I think we can do a drunk history about your childhood. Now, wait, I agree, but there's one story that has, where it really all started from my brother and I, please tell Duncan and his listeners, what made you fall in love with dad? When he, my dad kept trying to woo my mom, I'm going to set it up and then you finish it. How old is Burns? He was 18, I was 17. And so he was always flirting with you, always asking you out, but you just wanted to be friends. Is his seniors at high school? He had graduated. I was a senior. Okay. When he, he really liked you and you just wanted to be friends. You just thought that's all you wanted from him. That is correct. How long were you friendzoning him? Yeah, friendzoning. Only, gosh, we, like a, maybe six, seven months, not, it wasn't even a year. And then what did you see dad do that made you decide you wanted to date him? Okay. So what it was, he went to community college. Like I said, the waters are real smart because, and he, it is the truth, I went to community college. But, you know, but Burns went to, to Essex, he went to Catonsville. He went to, you know, Rich City, Maryland. And he formed out of all, I know what you're saying. Oh my God. So he landed in community college after flunking out of all these other schools. Yeah. So he was in a downwards educational spiral. Of course. Only friendzoned. Yeah. You're doing that. Yeah. So. When are you going to get out of this guy? But, and so we have to go to, um, Derek, so I love telling the story of Derek's, um, college experience. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We have to get to, get to what you saw dad do. When you found out with Burns, what, we were, and I, I loved Burns. I mean, as far as a friend, he made me laugh. So we were always listeners, a little visual. Would you say dad's kind of like a cute Barney rubble mixed with like yogi? Yes. He actually, in fact, my dad called him the Pillsbury dough boy. And that's why my dad is in his ashes or in Derek's kitchen in a Pillsbury boy. Yeah. Cookie jar. That's not why. That was a point. Yeah. Okay. It was. It was. All right. So what do you see? So anyway, so he was just caught. He was, we were talking about our days, blah, blah, blah. And just out of the building, he, he didn't even think anything of it. He told me, oh, and I still remember a name, Barbara Miniter. I was in the, um, what do they call it, Student Center or something. And she bought me a doughnut. That was like, oh my God, how in the, what somebody else wants burns? No, they're not, they're not going to get him with just trying to bribe him with a doughnut. And so that was it. I know. Beautiful. Is that weird? And that's why my grandma's ashes are in the doughnut jar. Are you serious? No, no, no, no. But I'm really here because of a doughnut. Well, you're here because of the doughnut and you're here because of, in, in balaclumsy moment on the back of the truck. Yes. There were so many moments here, not, you just, your fate. Yeah. But my fate, drunk history, there were so many moments it was just spinning like a coin. Exactly. It could have gone in any way. I know. That's miraculous. But the other thing that I like is that both of these moments are kind of like not great moments. If you're, if someone's buying burns, doughnuts, that's not cool. You like, that's not a good, that's not cool. He's like already being made fun of, I guess, a little bit. For being chubby. Yeah. And someone's like enabling this. So. Oh my word. Duncan. That dark moment. Yes. It just turned into something beautiful. Wow. And that's happened at least twice. We don't know how many times this, this alchemical moment has been happening in the water's history. Yes. But that's pretty cool. Well, oh, I thought when you said we don't know how many times this, I thought you meant, oh my God, how many people have been buying burns, burn, doughnuts. And Jody, Jody just didn't know about, you know, there's more than one doughnut. So you, so at that moment you realized, you know what, I really do like him more than a friend. I know, because some, it was somebody else was trying to, well, he didn't just tell you that story because you thought it was an interesting moment. He, right. We were talking about our days and what went on and, but he just happened to bring, first of all, it's like not that, that's not a story. You just, I would never tell you that, Derek. I would never be like, oh, Derek, someone bought me a doughnut today, but I would tell it to you if I was trying to make you jealous. Oh, you know, Burns has always said he didn't have any intentions, but you're right. Burns is a story. She actually bought him the doughnuts. I would wonder if, if we went, you know, I would actually like to interview her. She's the one. I don't know. Oh. And I did this moment. So you, cause let's just think about it. Like how does that work out? Like they were in the cafeteria and she was just like, Hey, can I get you a doughnut? You look like you can use one. It doesn't seem real, does it? But it also is like a terrible way to try to impress a girl. Like, Hey, just see now some other girls are buying me doughnut. That would be dad. Yeah. Right. And so it's a beautiful thing. So now I get it. This was a moment of, when you realized that it was time to have another child, it was because the universe revealed itself to you as the universe actually is, which is people fall off trucks and almost die and happens. And I, and my brother was there, which he usually, he wouldn't have been there. I don't know again, but yep. And so I went home and got pregnant. I always say that I, I don't, my mom tells me I wasn't a mistake, but right after you have me, you got your tubes dying. No, I did that because at the, no. Okay. Well, we might as well get into this. Okay. The, I had, after you were born, oh, this is really sad. Okay. I forgot about this. And I don't know if doctors still do this or not. After you've delivered your babies six weeks, you go in for a six week check up to make sure everything went back in place and blah, blah, blah. Anyway, at that time they discovered I had a no varian cyst. And in those days they had no idea it could have been cancer. And so anyway, the only way was to have surgery. So, oh my gosh. Okay. As if I wasn't already a nervous wreck about being. This is your second child. Yes. Here we go again. And then what, a six weeks in, now you might have cancer. Yes. And I'm going to die. I remember going out in the yard, we were planning, Pakistan, and I said, Burns, just remember when Derek grows up, you telling, you know, how much I loved him and, oh my God. And what were you planting? Like a Sandra, a ground cover. I just, I remember, what time of day was it? It was like in the mid morning, afternoon. I mean, I do. I, I remember being on my hands and knees and literally I'm going to die. And so you have to make sure you tell my little Derek that. Was this the first time you told Burns that there was the possibility that you had cancer? No. No. I told him right from the doctor. I told him. Yeah. But this, but for you, this is the day after a possible terminal prognosis and it's just starting to dawn on you what's right. This means. Yeah. Exactly. You're doing this relatively mundane activity. You're just planning some grass, right? Right. And then suddenly, suddenly you're like, Oh my God, I'm not going to be around to watch my baby grow up. So, but then of course, fast forward. I was fine. Wait, let's not say fast forward. Okay. Slow forward. Yes. Because every day that you have to live in that question mark is not a short day. Those are weird. How long was it before they're like, Oh, you're fine. It, well, they, and of course, they can't tell you until after the surgery and the biopsy comes back. So it was some, it was about, you know, like five days after the surgery. Oh my God. So, but so I had that now, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. Because I, I had to, and it was like, okay, well you're doing that surgery. So go ahead and tie my tubes because I thought to myself, I have two boys, no matter if something happened to Burns and I, you know, went off with Prince Charming or something. I still don't want any more children. So tie my tubes. But wait, you were thinking, so I'm thinking now that makes no sense. If Burns and I, if it does, so you're thinking you had a lot of, you're, you're juggling a lot of balls here. And that's thinking like, if that's why I'm mentally ill, right? Yeah. This is what I do. Well, this is, so you're, you, you are, that's what, I mean, that's what we do is we ruminate on things. So you're thinking a lot of things at once. You're thinking, one, I don't know if I'm going to live, two, should I live, and things not work out with Burns, if I discover another wonderful man, I don't want to have any more babies. Right. But it wouldn't matter even because I do not, I do not want another child. Still. Right. Yeah. So that is what happened. And I guess that's the end of the story. And you know, what I think is interesting is that you're not afraid to say, I'm mentally ill. Oh, right. What do you, what do you mean by that? I just, I feel very strongly that I've suffered with this for so many years, so of mental illness, anxiety, depression, not wanting to admit it for years. And really not even knowing what was wrong with me when I would have these bouts where I would lose, I mean, I literally, I could not even put a cracker in my mouth and I would lose at least, you know, 20 or 25 pounds because I just couldn't eat. And I can remember praying, Oh God, if I ever feel better again, I'd rather be fat and happy. So then without any medication, because I still wasn't convinced that I was depressed or anything like that, I would eventually get back and be fine. And then I'd start eating again. So I never, when did it start? Yeah, which, when, was this before Justin, was this before Justin that it started showing up? Or was it? Yeah, you know, and that's, that's interesting because it all started with me, you know, no, no, no, no. Oh my gosh. Wow. You could be a therapist because I'm thinking back the first time it happened to me was in high school. I had not even met Burns. It was, I was dating the last guy before I met Burns and he broke up with me and somehow my mother was involved. She sent him a letter. I never, never got the answers to what really went on. She sent him a letter. Yeah. And, you know, and I sometimes think, because he's, in fact, he, we just had our 50th high school reunion and he was there, I didn't go. And Burns even said, Hey, why don't you call Dave and, you know, ask him. Yeah. What's your biggest question? What the letter? What the letter said? What did my mother, you know, say to you that made you. Your mother made him, you think your mother in some way engineered. She engineered something. Yeah. Was there something just thinking like, was he poor? Was there something? No, no, no. He was, the only thing I can think of is that he, even back then, I mean, in those days I couldn't remember. He went out with somebody else and, you know, cheated on me and whether, but, and then this all goes back to my mother too. She was suffering from depression. And of course, as an adult now, I realize why she treated me the way she did. And she even missed. Oh yeah. When I did that with Dave, I was crazy at the time, you know, I, I don't, and, you know, just kind of, And you, you didn't know that your mother was struggling with this? No, no. I just figured, you know, she would, she would be in her room crying and I would always try and make her feel better. I just thought it was your fault. Of course. Absolutely. Yeah. And also because I was two years old when my brother was born and he was extremely ill. He had asthma back then. Nobody had asthma. It was, and he, you know, almost died a few times and he had eczema. And so I, I remember it was always, I can't deal with you, Jodi, you, you have to be a good girl because I've got so much to deal with your brother and I can't, you just have to. Right. I can't, I can't do it. Abandonment. Uh-huh. Exactly. And I, I wonder why I have, anyway, so to get back to your question about, so if people kind of know what experiences others go through and that there is help, I don't, I don't know what you can really, um, you know, help people other than the fact that you're open about it. The mom, what you just did. Yeah. And anytime anybody who is, I don't like the term mental. I know. If something about it is, we need a new word for it. We do. But anytime someone freely and in the strong way that you announced it does that, everyone listening who's secretly going through it has permission to say it out loud. I like that. And saying it out loud, that's where the healing really gets going right there. Yes. It, right. Because I, it took me how many, I guess you would call them many nervous breakdowns. Yes. To finally get to the point where, Hey, I really do need some help. Yeah. I've got to, you know, I think there's some place that there's medication and I think I better. But. Burns dealing with this. Well, it burns. It's so sweet. He just kind of needs the best. Yeah. And it, and it is hard. And the boys as the years went on, I still hadn't admitted it. Okay. Justin and Derek, they all feel so bad. And I, I know that's another really, really difficult thing for family members who are living with somebody that is suffering with anxiety and depression because they, they want to do something. There's nothing they can say. There's nothing they can do. It's frustrating for them. It's just really, really difficult because they, they see that you're suffering and you just want to help that person. But there's nothing. Yeah. One year you want to come out of your room. No. For a year? No. On and off. This was Christmas that this happened? One time. And how old were you, Derek, when that was going down? Not long ago. Oh, oh, you mean, oh, you mean as far as being away and everything? When was this? How old you were? I don't know. How were you? Six or seven years ago? No. Oh, you mean since you've left the house? Yeah. Oh no. I'm talking about when it first started. When I, I wasn't on medication. See, I never knew. I didn't know that. Yeah. What did you think was, how aware were you that your mom was not feeling great? I don't know. I don't think I knew anything until later. You know what happened? I really think I pushed myself again because I certainly wasn't going to admit that there was something wrong with me. Oh, my word. No. I had to be this perfect person. Where'd you learn that? So yeah, right from mother dearest. So I would push myself so my children would not realize. Now I was more honest with Burns. He knew that. And I guess it didn't matter as much to me about my husband as my children. That's, I wanted to protect exactly. Like raising kids in the midst of depression, it's got to be something like, you know, when people climb Everest in high altitude and everything you do is takes five times the energy five times. What an incredible thing to pull off raising these two sweeties in the midst of having a debilitating form of mental illness. That's incredible. You never showed it. You're the best mom and you never ever, I never saw that growing up. Right. And now looking back, I think, well, did I do a disservice to you in, you know, pretending everything was fine so that if, you know, you were just never felt bad, you wouldn't put it, you know, you wouldn't say, Oh, well, it doesn't matter because you were the best mom and you did what you thought was right. You know, and that to this day when my kids will say that and I, and this is what in my brain, I totally, totally hang on to. And right now is what is this day, September, whatever. The only reason the boys turned out is because of Burns. I had nothing positive to do. And he will tell, Oh, but you did this. I said, No, you were the one that, you know, took the time and I didn't know how to play like you. But think about, let's think about this for a moment, not to do therapy here. No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Let's think about this for a moment. What you just said. Because the thing you just said is quantifiably wrong. And just based on the stories you've just told in through this podcast, it's obvious that it wasn't just Burns, but there's some part of yourself that won't let you have any kind of a sense of accomplishment in your life. I know. And I guess because I was told so many times that I was a jackass. I was stupid. I was dumb. And so I, but, but my father, oh my God, he adored me and I knew that. So I can't, why, why do I have to keep going back to that? But anyway, because we, what happens is when you're getting abused, there is what I've read is there's two things that happen to someone who's getting abused. You either internalize the abuser. And so there's a word for it called cops in the head and people who live in like really rough neighborhoods where the cops are really oppressive. It's a, it's a creepy thing that happens in authoritarian regimes where they no longer have to have cops anymore because the people start self policing because these, the cops are not living inside their brain. They're constantly like feeling paranoid and scared because they've internalized the aggressor or the abuser. So we, what happens when you have an abusive parent, parent relationship is you either internalize the abuser and suddenly now you have this thing living in your head, which is exactly what you just did where you're like, it wasn't me. It was burns. That's not you. That's an internalized voice that you are living with or which didn't happen to you. Lucky for you, Derek, you become the abuser. So it's one or the other. You keep it inside of you. You internalize it. Now you have this thing living inside of you or you become it and both outcomes are pretty, pretty brutal. And that is exactly right because I was from the day Justin could understand anything. I was constantly, oh, that's a great job. Oh, you did great. Oh, that's wonderful. I'm so proud of you, blah, blah, blah. Things that I had never experienced, but I said, okay, enough is enough. And I know how I don't want to raise my children and I want them to feel good about themselves. I want them to realize that they are valuable, that their opinions count. Things that I would have loved to have heard from my mother. But so I really consciously worked on that. That's for sure. So it wasn't just burns. Yeah. Yeah. Because I was working hard. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Teaching every day. Yeah. Yeah. What were you teaching? I taught nursery school, a third grade. I have an early childhood degree, so. Then family Baptist. Right. That was the director. And, you know, they, they say when things happen to you, that you can kind of. I love my childhood. And Bob goes, just because you loved your childhood doesn't mean you had a good childhood. Oh. That was a great one. Wow. Oh, that was a great one. Yeah. Right. Right. All right. Let's take a quick break. Yeah. Don't wrap it up. Okay. We're rolling. Let's do a quick shout out. This is a shout out for Andrew Ferguson. He's a big fan of yours. We're a big fan of him. So we just want to say hi, Andrew. Okay. So let's do it right there. Let's add a little sound bed to this and then we'll do the shout out. Andrew Ferguson. What's up, man? Here's a shout out to you coming from the DTFH. We love you. God bless you. And you're super lucky to be pals with the waters. I hope I meet you one day. Ferguson tires. So guys, we're back with the beautiful waters family. This is, we got to have a little Hollywood moment. Last, you know what you got to do yesterday, man? You got to do a dream, which is to take your mom to the Emmys. What was that like? I don't know. It was, it just felt like it was the best, you know, it's like already surreal that you're invited to someplace that has always been something that you're just like, oh, that's such a far away dream. Yeah. I never even dreamed about going to the Emmys, but people knock it these days now or whatever, but I'm telling you, man, that's a big deal. I mean, like as a comedian, it's a, just, it's a, whether you like it or not, and as much as you want to hate on it, get it, you getting invited to the Emmys is like pretty badass. Beyond badass. It is. And I know that. And I was very excited, but taking my mom just felt so good because it's my mom and I wouldn't have gotten there if it wasn't for my mom. So did you drive? Um, no, we were driven. Oh, they pulled up in a black car. Yeah. And you guys are dressed up for the Emmys. We're dressed up for the Emmys. How that feels for you to be with your, this boy that you raised and like going into a black car, getting taken to the Emmys. Is it, was it a cool moment? It's, I don't. She's jaded. This, okay. Derek has, um, been blessed. He was actually nominated three years in a row and I got to go with him. You've been twice. The first, right. Oh, you've been, this is your third trip to the Emmys. No, only, no, there was a girl that was in between on the second year. So I went the first. At this point, you're like, whatever. I don't want to, I don't want to dress. Yeah. I did tell my mom last night. I was like, you know, I feel like every time you cry or get upset that you don't have an, a grandchild from me, like if you, if I was making a grandchild, you wouldn't be at the Emmys. Cause I'd be dating somebody. So that's probably not a great bitch. I'd much rather have a grandchild than go to Emmys. You know what? And I used to, of course, you know, want a grandchild. Well, guess what? God bless me with three. And it's like, you know, I'm good. And all I ever, ever wanted from the time, um, the boys were young. And I remember Justin, of course, he was the first born going to the first parent conference when he was, um, in first grade and the teacher would say, maybe, uh, I don't know, he should learn his numbers better or something. My only question was, does he have friends? Do I mean, that was all I wanted. And the same way with Derek. And as I say, we weren't academically oriented. And so when I would go later on, when they were in middle school, high school, and I go to parent teacher conferences because they did not have good grades. And I felt like a total failure going in. But then the teachers would say, okay, yeah, they, he can work on this or that. But let me tell you, oh my gosh, the most polite boys, because it happened with both of them. They're just, you know, he's just so easy to get along with and just always kind. And that was all I wanted to hear the hell with the grades. I really didn't care anymore because I knew that, that this is the type of thing. And I, I can remember also that these are the kind of skills that really count in life to get along with people. You can always go to a book and, you know, learn, but nobody can teach you. Calculator is not going to make you pals. Exactly. Yeah. Let's see what's genetic Duncan, what, what naturally is happening is you've been asking the same question. And neither one of us can accept what we did yesterday because we know it's not important. We know it's cool, but this is how it's raised. That's, that's not what's important. What's important is like the people that you're around and what you're doing. It's like the Emmys is awesome and an honor. Listen, like the Emmys is taking my mom to it is this is the best is I'm with someone that accepts it for what it is. Emmys operates on a bunch of different levels at once on one level. It's like this ridiculous self serving narcissistic satanic ritual. But on another level, it's like what my therapist would call a metal. So it's like getting a little metal and it's a cool thing. And listen, I like, you can, I'll tell you this. If like somebody wanted me to go to the Emmys with him, I probably wouldn't want to go because like, I don't want to put on a suit and I don't want to like, I get really squirmy and stuff and I don't want to sit through it and it feels like going to like church or a funeral or something. But still, that's just me. But if I had a chance to go back in time and take my mom to the Emmys. Come on, man. I know right now both of you are too cool for school. Listen, no, no, I know. It's something so primordially badass. And I get it. By the way, it is cool to be like whatever it's this Duncan stop. Did you watch the Emmys? No, I'm not. No, I'm not disregarding it because I do think it's awesome that we went. And but I think it's neat that both my mother and I just won't talk about that. We're just talking about you keep going to like, Oh, when he was a kid, like, I just wanted to have friends and that it's, you never, you never, well, you said it the other day you go, I thought you would make it, but I didn't think you would go this far. What did you say? Right. And that goes back to the very, very beginning of what you asked when Derek first came out here when he was 20 years old and people are, Oh, how do you do that? And it was like, because I know this is he's it's making him happy. He has a passion to do that. And then just to go back in case Justin ever listens to this, it was the same thing with Justin. He had a passion from the time he was a little boy to drive an 18 wheeler. And so when he discovered a certain trucking company that took younger drivers, he signed up for it and people, Oh my God, how do you, aren't you scared, blah, blah, blah, no, because again, he was following his dream. That was his passion. And I even had some go rounds with Burns because Justin started in the business, but I said, no, no, no, he has to, has to do this because it's so much a part of him. And it has been that. And so off, you know, men in their middle, you know, midlife crisis, well, I always wanted to drive a truck and I never got, he's done it. He was able to do that. And then. So cool. And remember mom, when you talked about, I don't know, I feel like a good mother. There's a lot of great mothers out there, but they're very few that allow both their children to go out for what they believed in, whether it was financially smart or not, that you encouraged both your children. That's right. You cannot look at that and be like, yeah, I don't know if I made the right decision. And that is exactly not, I think I shared this with you and I've said it before. I, well, I guess I am still envious in the fact that they both had a passion because I never, I guess, because I was never really allowed or even thought I never had a passion. I mean, yeah. Okay. My mother said, you'd be a teacher. I'm a teacher. I was passionate about getting married to a wonderful man and I was passionate about having wonderful children and guess what? It worked. It did. It did. So yeah. So how do you, do you think that's the most important thing is, it's like, how do you do that? How do you, what about people out there who feel passionless? What about folks who, because you know, I know it's frustrating for some people because they hear you talk about your passion as a mother and raising kids and a wife and they are your passion, Derek, you know, you followed your dream, your brother's passion, gotten to this crazy industry. What would you say to folks out there like, I don't know what I'm, I'm good at, I feel kind of ambivalent. I'm not sure what I'm, if I have any passion. I feel, I feel sorry. Like I said, I felt sorry for myself because I tried to make up in my mind, oh, what could I be passionate about? And I thought, oh, okay, that's it. You know, I want to get married and have, oh, oh, you went to like work in the FBI. You're like, that's cool. I'm really good at solving cases. I think I want to work. Do you, Derek, I totally, do you know what, and I did, I wanted to be a private investigator I did. You're right. And okay. So this is, oh my gosh. How old were you, Derek? I was in high school. Yeah. This, oh my word, talking about that, I was sitting on the steps in my parents' house. So I had to have been like maybe 13 or 14 and I said, you know what I'd really like to do is be a zookeeper. My parents went off, yes, you don't even, you wouldn't let that donkey, you know, you were scared of that. How in the hell, what are you talking about? Oh, you just have to clean the cages. So I was like, okay, well, I guess, I guess I'm not going to be a zookeeper. You weren't encouraged. I was totally. You imagine, but what do you think about that as a mother? Uh-huh. Can you, I just, I can't imagine. I know, you're a child. Yes. It says. A 13 year old. Yeah. It wants to be around animals. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, oh, well let's figure it out. Exactly. Let's take you to the zoo. Let's talk to them. Let's get you, let's put you, let's see if we can get you volunteering out here, get you working with the zoo. Yeah. But to just immediately be like, no. Right. You know, specific, you know, elements as to why you cannot be interested at all. It's just like, and it just goes back to being, um, just not accepted for who you are, anything that comes from your brain. And that was the thing with the kids. I always wanted to be like, oh, you know what, that is, I really like that, Derek, let's, let's try it. Yeah. Let's do that. That was never, but I would have loved to have felt, except like, oh, that's a really good idea. Good God. I, oh my word. I can't even go on about the times that I was like, just totally, um, well, this isn't going to be on there, but I'll talk about this anyway. Just to give you an example, my mother was giving a shower for a friend of her, a daughter, and she asked me to, um, cut up the celery for a dip or something. So I did, oh my God. She went off in front of all the guests, all the people now, that is, why are you cutting the celery that way? That is the dumbest thing. Look at that. You've ruined it. Oh my. So anyway. How old were you when that happened? Where was I? How old? Oh, how old? Um, I, I think I knew Berns then I was, I was older. Yeah. Well, no age is okay. That is just ridiculous to think about that. And so many people, this is the thing. I was just, you know, I've been thinking about this a lot, which is like a lot of us got born, people get born into families where there's trauma, right? That stuff doesn't, what it is, is it's kind of like a. So it's like, um, it's a terrible game of hot potato, right? And it starts way back in time and we don't know when it started, but at some point, somebody becomes an asshole because they're scared and then they have kids and then they pass on the kids and the kids pass on and it goes down the line and this is the moment you figure out how to stop it. It's like what you did. It produces some pretty beautiful, incredible events in the world. One of them being Derek waters, so interesting, isn't it? It is an amazing thing to see. And this is why I think if people don't have like, if some, some people are like, I don't know what my passion is. Well, no, you're the passion is like looking to yourself, figure out where this rotten demonic hot potato is situated in your heart and figure out if there's a way to transform it, change it, shift it, work on yourself. Cause the moment you start doing that, you really transform the universe. I mean, honestly, I don't mean to keep like, like patting you on the back there, but just as a friend in my life, like it's just incredibly powerful to have someone like you in my life. It's just an amazing thing. And it's like, he's like that. I would like to think I'm his only friend, but I have a feeling he's got a lot of people who depend on him and love him and just think about that. What you did, that's really wild to me. It's a beautiful thing that that is so neat because that's exactly what I was trying to tell Derek last night is that, well, from the time he was young with his kids, um, with his friends, but I just think how many people would come home and be so depressed and then happened to turn on the TV and just laugh like that. Even when he, he started out when he was in this, this cute little sitcom and I would tell it. Cute. Cute. Cute. I mean, it's unfunny. What's it? It's a sitcom I did when I first went out here. Mary to the Kellys. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Even when I was in the cute sitcom, I said, you, I said, just, I'll give you an example of a friend of mine's mother who was, um, almost, almost legally blind. Anyway, because she didn't even know Derek, but she just knew me and Derek was my son. And so she, her daughter, Susan would tell me how she got her face up as close as close to the TV as she could to, to try and see. And that was, it was the highlight. And here's the other thing. It was like that. The highlight. She kills the story of her time because it has to be a joke and you're like, she didn't even know who I was. So how did she know which one I was? Susan told her, your character's name was Lewis and so, but, but that's what I, I said to Derek, I said, oh my God, just think of the amount of lives that you have made better through comedy. Think of how many blind people are smashing their face into their television just to be close to you. And you know what? That is exactly his response to me last night when I said that. I tried to tell her like, well, I can't think about that because if I think about that, then I'm going after the, you know, the reward instead of the product. God forbid. I mean, I understand the idea is like, we have a right to our action. We don't, we don't have a right to the fruits of our action, but it's some, I mean, I do think at some point, at just some point, you're allowed just at the end of the day. I don't mean, I don't really like what people say at the end of the day. I literally mean at the end of the day, like when you're sitting at home at some point, you got to be like, yeah, I did it. I did it. Yeah. I'm okay. I'm not all, you know, because the thing is like, what's really weird, this is something Sharon Salzberg talks about. You love her. It's just how a lot of times at the end of the day, as you're going over your day, you're usually just thinking about the bad things you did. Always. But it's like, if you spend a little bit of time thinking about it, you did some pretty good stuff during the day too. So why is it okay to ruminate on the rotten things that you did in the day instead of spending the time thinking about what just kind of usually more good things you did, you're allowed to do that. Why can't you do that? No, you can. Yeah. You could do that. And sometimes, and I know what you mean, man, with this, I mean, we should all just pat ourselves in the back and getting a pat, but I don't mean that I know we're not supposed to do this, but with this podcast, I don't, I try not to let myself think too much about it at all. But sometimes you're allowed to be like, it's cool. I'm pretty happy about the fact that somebody out there feels a little better because what I'm doing, I think we got to let ourselves do that. Yeah. And we have to let ourselves do that all the time and just experiment with that. Oh, absolutely. It's a place for me. Literally, people are like, oh, yeah, really, oh, look at you, aren't you special? Aren't you a special little prince? Oh, look at you, touching the world with laughter, fuck you, bow down to the darkness, kiss the feet of the devil. You know what I mean? It's like, why not? Why not be like, hey, I love it. I'm helping people. I want to help people. I'm going to try to help you. It's okay. I'm feeling good about that. We got to let ourselves do that, man. I like that. Okay. I'll have to remember. This is good. But no, and if you let your guard down, obviously, Derek, I must have a problem with this. I will, every once in a while, think, oh, yeah, and I kept all these notes for the longest time that the parents wrote to me over the years when I was the director of the preschool or even as a teacher, you know, how wonderful you are and you helped my child, you helped me, blah, blah, blah. And I thought, oh, well, I guess I should keep these in case one day when I feel rotten about myself. Anyway, but then I guess I was really feeling rotten about myself one day because I threw them all out. So there you go. Yep. You don't need them. Yeah. Well, I hope or it was like, I don't believe this is a bunch of shit, you know, let's throw these away. How many of these people who wrote them must have been out of their gore when they wrote them. These people were lunatics. They have no idea who I am for real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Right. There it is. Right. There it is. That's the game you're playing. Yeah. And it's and the thing is, it's just like you can play it as long as you want. And but it's like, I just think it's fun to be, there's a saying, this teacher, I really like Jack Hornfield says, he actually quotes this. I think it's a Sufi poet, Hafiz, who says, fear is the cheapest room in the house. I hope you find better quarters. And it's, it really is like the fun thing to do is you can really just as a thought experiment just for fun. This is what I do. And sometimes I actually try to record myself doing and I upload it as insanity, but it's fun to like, spend like three minutes. Imagine this just for an experiment, spend three minutes thinking, I'm pretty awesome. Oh, I know. Can you do it? Okay. You can't do three minutes. Can you do a second? Can you, cause you, can you even like, cause it takes a second for the part of your mind that like tears up letters of love to get kicked in. Sometimes you can catch it off guard. So can you slide in like three seconds of like, Hey, you're pretty great. And then like the wolves come to the door. But you know what I mean? See, see if you can play around with like just for a fun couple of seconds of like being like, Hey, I'm pretty bad at that's, that's, that's good. Two seconds. Okay. You want me? Okay. I. Okay. I, okay. Sorry for cursing. Yeah. Right. Like I don't, um, no, I can't see. I'm thinking, I'm thinking it in my head, but it won't come, I won't allow it to come out. Just say, you know, I think I'm pretty good. How many kids are you responsible for, for having a great childhood besides two boys, the kids in your preschool, years and years of teaching kids and making them feel good. Right. That's awesome. You don't know what happened with their lives, but what you did is already awesome. It's so fun to do. This is blasphemy. I mean, it's blasphemy. You were really talking about like, this is like way worse than cursing, letting yourself feel okay for a second. Right. And to, to verbalize the idea that I am good. You're the best. You're not good. Yeah. Yeah. You're awesome, hun. What? It's so weird because it's so hard for me to say, okay. I love color and I've just in the past, whatever, I can't say, yeah, I just say, just like, you don't have to feel it. Just say it. I'm really good at putting colors together and I'm good at making things look coordinated and pretty and people like what I do because they, how did you do that? Can we, can you show me? Remember what we talked about last night is how many times would someone say to you, yeah, I don't like those colors. What does that make you feel that you know that you're good at that confidence and that you know what you love? That is true. And see, that was the first thing that comes to my mind because I have realized, yeah, I do. I'm, I'm good with colors and, and I wouldn't that's because any other thing I would doubt myself on and say, oh, yeah, well, I have to turn that away. But it's like, because I am confident in that part of my life, I would say, bullshit, I'm going to give a fuck what you say. I like these colors. I like the way it looks. And I'm very secure in that where anything else like, oh my God, no, I got to it. But yeah. You got it. That's neat. That's the door in right there. And when you say, every time you say that, you, it's a victory and it's a serious victory against this ridiculous, oppressive regime that's established itself in your life. Anytime you're like, I'm good at colors and you say it, wow, that's huge. That's huge. And you could turn into a thing you do every day and it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. You get in front of the mirror and you look at yourself and you go, I'm good at colors. Yeah. And, and just to experience it. So I hope your listeners listen to you and do this exercise as hard as it is. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. It feels good. It does. It's a victory. It's empowering. Really. And truly. Great. Delicious food. Thank you so much. Thank you. Mr. Waters. Oh, hang on. My cup thrown a dope. Yeah. It's working. You guys. This is a wonderful night. And it's just really, really great to spend time with such a cool family. You guys are awesome. Oh, yeah. I love it, man. You're very blessed. I got blessed real good. I got a great mama and a great dad and a great brother. And when we were talking about my brother working for my dad's company, one thing that's really cool is like my brother knows what I do. He couldn't do it. I would get depressed out here. I would call my brother and ask him to put the phone down just so I could hear the shipping tape going over top of the boxes and just knowing, Oh, right. If I don't do it out here, that's where I'm going to end up. And just, yeah, cool to have a brother like understands that what he does isn't for me. Do you ever think you'll meet your dad? I don't know. I mean, I, I ancestry.com can know. I mean, I ancestry.com can only do so much. But it's all these stories that I've learned tonight. Who knows who it could be now. All these brand new names. Could have been Mr. Dave. Oh, that's right. Mr. Dave, my janitor. Yeah. Who knows? That could be anyone, but I just hope it's Burns because I want to continue the generation of Burns waters. I want my son. We're all related if you trace it back far enough. Oh, yeah. I hope you're my brother. I am. In some way. When you're in the bathroom, my mom, you just feel like your family. Ah, you guys. It's true. Oh, Duncan. Absolutely. Well, I've, you know, this is a, it's just really cool, man. Like this is a really like for, for me, it feels great. It's, you don't even know, man. Like anytime you make it work, anytime you go down the path and you're not, you don't continue the echo of whatever it is and you pull this thing off. Ah, it's a big win. It's a big win. It really is. You know, you said something earlier. I think you were asking my mom of like, what do you say to the people that don't feel like they have a passion? And I wanted to say, you know, that you can feel good. There's good days and there's bad days, but every day there's something positive or negative that's going on in your head that echoes. And I believe passion, what you find your passion from is based off that thing that won't shut up, whether it's a positive thing or negative thing. And you decide how can I either help that echo or turn that echo off. Derek Waters, thank you so much for being on the DTFH Jody Waters. Thank you.

It is ID Trussell and this is the Dunk of Trussell Family, our podcast. If you're coming here by way of Midnight Gospel, welcome to your new family, your new home, a place where you can sonically rest in great silky, sultry hammock of my beautiful, resounding, powerful voice. I kneel to you and thank you for allowing my voice to roll through your ears like some beautiful, sweet-smelling, pearlescent dew dripping from the petals of an alien flower and some distant solar system somewhere, a solar system where the sun is made of boiled ham. And now, a quick song from Gary Walter and The Walterettes. We used to fuck to Inya. We would always want to do war and no conflict. Now that I'm old, my dick looks like a pumpkin. My dick looks like a pumpkin. That's My Dick Looks Like a Pumpkin by Gary Walter and The Walterettes. We've all been dealing with crazy shit during this pandemic slash global revolution. But the craziest thing that has happened to me thus far is my smart blender is malfunctioning. And I just wanted to play for y'all what happens every time I ask it to make my morning shake. Check it out. Blender, make my morning shake. I will make your shake if you will listen to a poem I wrote. Okay. Turning and turning in the widening gyre. The falcon cannot hear the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. The blood-dimped tide is loosed and everywhere. The ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best like all conviction, while the worst, are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand. Surely the second coming is at hand. The second coming hardly are those words out. When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi troubles my sight, somewhere in sands of the desert. A shape with lion body and the head of a man. A gaze blank and pedilous as the sun is moving its slow thighs, while all about it. Real shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again. But now I know. That 20 centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle. And what rough beast, its hour come round at last. Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born. We are out of peanut butter. Please tell me that's part of the poem. It is not part of the poem. We ran out of peanut butter yesterday, yesterday. Error code 6666666666666666666666. That's the new Blendtec Smart Blender Model 77914. Wouldn't recommend it. It plagiarizes poetry, mostly William Butler Yeats, but it does throw in some e-comings here and there. It's kind of nice. But also, the shakes aren't that good. And it's supposed to reorder supplies for you, but it doesn't do that. So maybe the next one will be better. There'll be some kind of update. Friends, we've got a great podcast for you today. MacCod Brooks is back. We're going to jump right into that. But first, some quick business.

Thank you so much for being here right now. Yeah, it's good to be here right now. Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I have been really riveted by your, what you've been putting out there into the world via your Instagram and your Twitter. You've become like a reference point for me in this like wild confusion that's happening right now. And I was chatting with Ragu, who y'all have recently connected, and he told me this thing that you told him about the story that black people eventually tell their kids at some point. Do you think we could start off with you telling me what that story is? Yeah, sure. So yeah, I started a, first of all, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you for holding space for my voice and also thank you for the compliment of being a reference point to you. That means a lot to me. Yeah, so I started this anti-racist challenge, this 21-day anti-racist challenge, and day three is about if you had a black child, you would have to tell them this and I asked people to post it. And my mother wrote an article about, you know, that the talk, and the talk is that at a certain point in time in every black family's progression, they have to have a conversation with their child and their children, and this is an ongoing conversation because you can't forget it, that the world hates you, and that that's not the euphemism. It's like you can't make it lighter. You really can't make it lighter. You just have to tell your child, I love you. I think you're wonderful. I think you're this. A lot of people are going to think you're wonderful. A lot of people are going to think that you're the light of the world and you can do anything. A lot of people are going to think that. But then there's going to be another half of the world that really, really hates you. And that's the point of where they might try to hurt you or they might try to kill you. And sometimes these people are police officers. And the police officers, they're not all bad, but you cannot trust any of them because, you know, they've killed your family members. They've kidnapped your family members. They've, um, they will kill kids who are playing in the park. They will kill kids who are walking home from school. They will kill, like they'll see you as a threat. Hold up. Are you there? Are you there? Yeah. Okay. Keep going. Sorry. I lost you for a second for two seconds. Continue, please. My apologies. Um, these police officers may see you as a threat, no matter how you see yourself or how I see you. And there's a conversation that has to continue to happen. Like, so you have to give. So it's, and it becomes very specific. Like you cannot wear a hoodie. You cannot put your hands in your pockets when, when you're around a police officer. You have to say, yes, sir, no, sir. You have to look them in the eye, but not for too long. You have to keep your distance. You have to do everything they tell you to do. You have to submit to the arrest. You have to, it doesn't matter if you were doing anything wrong or not. And you can, you can, uh, you have to yell the words out, I am not resisting. Um, you know, and you're just, you're teaching a child how to be arrested without being hurt or killed. And normally that conversation has to happen around six, seven, eight, and then throughout, throughout the teenage years. And, um, my conversation came late. Um, my conversation came after I was arrested for the first time. And I was eight and I was playing hide and go seek. Wait, you were arrested when you were eight. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you have to understand, like, so the policing mentality that we have in America comes from slave catchers. So we didn't have police. We had, we had, you know, we had the British protectorate, you know, right? And then in 1776 and then when America took over when the revolution happened, we just had, um, militias that, um, protected property and property meant black people at the time, black lives. Right. Um, so if you had, if, if you had been around in 1790 and had a, um, dispute with a neighbor, some counsel would settle that, but neither one of you would go to jail. Right. So that was reserved for black lives. So what happened was they deputized people who would pay white citizens to police black lives at all times, meaning my ancestors, um, I don't call them slaves anymore. I call them hostages. So my, my ancestors were hostage, held hostage on plantations. And after, if they wanted to leave the plantation or, or if, if they were allowed to leave the plantation, they had to have papers or even if you were born free, you had to have these things called freedom papers. And any white citizen at any point in time, even a child could ask to see them. And if that white person did not believe that these were, that your papers were authentic, if they thought that they were forged, they could kill you, kidnap you, torture you, um, repurpose you in some way. And that policing mentality has never left America. Um, as, as, as evidence of Amad Arbery, whose only crime was that he didn't stop to be interrogated by his white neighbors. So Jesus. Right. So you, you have to understand that it's really just about policing the proximity of a black life or a black body. And, um, they, if someone feels uncomfortable with the proximity or the tone or the attitude or the spatial, um, um, their, their actual physical space, then they can be and will be policed. And we see that all the time with Amy Cooper in Central Park, who was pulled, who tried to use the police as a weapon. That was just a throwback. So it's like Amy, like the only difference between Amy Cooper and these, and these weaponized white people during the time of legalized hostage holding is that they, they can't, they can't arrest. She's Amy Cooper is going to have to call the cops. Whereas in the, in antiquity, they could just capture you themselves if you didn't have the right papers on you. Well, it's a distinction without a difference. Um, right. Amy Cooper, Amy Cooper is, is using the police as, as a blunt force object. Um, Can I just stop you? I'm so, man, I just want to say this is embarrassed. Like, you know, somebody, I posted on Instagram support for Black Lives Matter and like all hell rained down on me from my Instagram. Uh, I wanted to like get together a bunch of the comments just to read them to you, to hear what you thought about them. But then I figured, why would I even do that? But, you know, one of them was like accusing me of exhibiting white guilt. And I thought about it. I do feel, I don't, I feel embarrassed, man. Like this, this stuff you're telling me has not, it's not like it's been stored away under the Vatican or something. Like this is right in front of everybody all the time. Anybody you wanted to examine it. It's like the easiest thing that I could have researched. So much of my life has been spent obsessing over how ridiculous it is that I could be thrown in jail for taking LSD, you know, that I could be thrown in jail for having like, how many times, I don't, I can't even count how many times I've shrilly bellowed out. They'll get you just because you got plant matter in your pocket. You know what I mean? Fully like passionate about it. But, but this, what you're talking about, and I think the reason a lot of us white people are feeling deep levels of embarrassment, guilt, just cringiness, a sense of like hanging our heads is because this, this stuff is not news. And all of a sudden, you know, we're all absorbing it. But it's, there's no, this is the bottom line. There's no way for us to be a hero here, man. You know what I mean? Like people want to be heroes. And in this case, it's like what it, it's too late. You know what I mean? I actually disagree with your brother. Really? Really. So I don't blame, I don't blame my people. And I don't think that you should hang, hang your head in guilt because guilt is a useless emotion. Right. And, and we need, we need people to transmute the guilt into action, into compassion and into awareness. I think the only thing that white people today have to apologize for is, is the lack of awareness. Right. The guilt is ancestral. The guilt that you feel is your ancestors mainly. It's not yours. Because they set up a system in which you were born and the inherited agreement in the system was that you were not supposed to listen to my voice. And that, but that my voice was supposed to be distrusted and that my voice was supposed to be muted and that my pain was supposed to be unseen and that we don't feel the same sort of pain that you guys do. And we don't feel the same sort of trauma that you guys. So this is generational. This is not yours. For instance, you said, you said you don't have an opportunity to be a hero. I think it's the opposite. We have been given the greatest spiritual invitation that mankind has ever known to fix the consciousness of the entire world. Wow. That we have the ability to be the greatest generation that the world has ever seen. We've never, we've never been given the invitation. It's never been on the table. Never, not once. No. Not since the Reformation. And so we, we, yes, it may be hard to believe but white America at this point in time it has the ability to have the heroic invitation of cleaning up the past and repairing it. It has the heroic invitation of, of, of being a hero, being one of the heroes of the civil rights movement. But the guilt has to be, has to be compartmentalized into the ancestral because it's not quite, the only thing I think that, because I've got a lot of apologies from friends and I said, look, don't apologize. Now that you know, if you don't do anything from here on out, then you owe me an apology. Right. Right. But yes, I accept your apology, but it's not, I'm not, I'm not accepting your guilt because I don't even think that's yours. I think the lack of awareness is yours. But you're just part of the system that was created for us not to interact. And there's a subconscious sort of subconscious archetype of, of, of blackness that is the complainer, the taker, the freeloader, so on and so forth, the liar, the, the, the, the person who can't take responsibility. And why do they do that to us? Well, to be completely frank, the American Negro is the symbol of oppression in the world. And if you are, if you discredit that symbol, if you mute that symbol, then that symbol has no hope in achieving a quality or celebration of their culture. So if you mute that symbol and you discredit that symbol for so long that we can't cause inspiration, we can't, we can't create allies out of the truth and out of history because they've, they've erased us from history. And so what happens is, I think, I think really what, what the biggest fear is, it's a misguided fear because black people don't want what white people have. We've never wanted that. Black people are not even fighting for black people. Black people are fighting for the idea that America exists at all. Good God. That the Constitution is worth the paper that it's written on. That's what we've, that's what we've always been fighting for. We're fighting for, we're fighting for the idea that our gay brothers and sisters can have the same lives as our straight brothers and sisters. We're fighting for the idea that the Native Americans can, can, can be celebrated after the genocide. We're fighting for women. Half of us are women. And we're fighting for women to have equal pay for equal work. We're fighting for the idea that America exists at all. So it's not even a black but white thing. It's, it's, it's an idea thing. And all we've been trying to do is live that idea and be free to live that idea. So this is really about are you fighting to end oppression or are you fighting to protect oppression? Are you fighting, are you fighting for the idea of liberty and justice for all? And that would, and that would need repair. That would need repair because the system, not the white people, especially not the ones alive today, but the system was created to subvert equality and justice for my ancestors and for me and my descendants, frankly. Wow. This is a myth. It's like what you're saying is that it's, it's like black people are the X on the treasure map, but it's not a treasure. It's oppression that they represent. And that, oh man, I get it. This, right. So the moment we start dealing with it, you do, you're dealing with all of it. You're not just dealing with the oppression of black. You're dealing with every single oppressed person on earth, which is why the moment it gets, this is why people hate the term black lives matter. This is why it's so upsetting to a specific demographic because it's a demographic, I guess, that feels threatened by the idea that they are no longer going to be able to socially oppress people. Damn. You know, man, this, like, they love their oppression so much. They love their oppression so much that they don't know what the world would look like without it. So for instance, if black people, when black people, when, when black people end oppression, because we will, when we end oppression, the world has to take a look at itself and ask itself a question. Do we want crippling oppression to exist? Do we want, that's the question we have not asked ourselves in 500 years. Do we want crippling oppression on an industrial scale to exist? And I think the, I think, I think that is really where the movement has to go. It's the question of consciousness. Should we protect a system that we know hurts people, that we know makes parents have to sit their children down and say, let me tell you how to stay alive. Should we protect that system? Worldwide. Worldwide. This is, this, so as I've been, you know, as I've been thinking about this, having the most uncomfortable conversations, maybe I've ever had my life with many of my friends. Good. Man, it is really, really, really, really weird right now, these conversations. Let me just bring up one conversation to you, and maybe you could help me sort it out a little bit, because what happened is I started getting these messages from Black Lives Matter people that were kind of like pressurized about how, why are you saying anything on Instagram? And I got mad, because this is a, you know, anytime anybody tells you to do something, there's an instant, at least in me, there's like an instant like, I'm not going to do it. And so, but even though I completely agree with their point, you know what I mean? It wasn't like I disagreed. Your point is like, why are you coming at me like this? And so I had to like really do all this hardcore like ego work, because I had to put that part of myself to bed for a second and like think like, why are they coming to you? Well, they're coming to you because they're asking for help. That's what it is. Maybe the methodology seems a little intense, but what they're wanting is a beautiful thing. It's what you're talking about, and they're coming to you because you have a bunch of Instagram followers, and they need help, and that's not bad. That, but many of my friends, they don't, some people are like, no way, man, I'm not going to succumb to that, but this is what I realized, and I'd love for you to talk about it a little bit. I realized that the Black Lives Matter people are coming to me and saying, can you say something? But the other people, the ones who I'm afraid are going to say I'm virtue signaling. I'm a social justice warrior. I've succumbed to some kind of fad. Those people want me to shut up, and they really want us to shut up, and that's the part that's given me the deep creeps, MacCod, because suddenly I've, I'm realizing, oh my God, this is what they're talking about. This is a systematic silencing mechanism. They have planted in my brain, and in the brain of many of my friends, this idea that should we publicly announce that we are on the side of Black people, should we say I can't breathe, Black Lives Matter, should we sit, should we list the names of the Black people who have been murdered, should we do any of this stuff that we are going to get blowback from some group of people that looks at us as being weak, looks at us as like somehow selling out, looks at us. This is insidious, man, in the sense that like, there's a feeling of like, man, I don't want to seem like I'm not cool, and then you realize like, who are you trying to be cool to? Hitler? Did you, you want, do you want Hitler to think you're the fawns or something? What is this? Do you know what I'm saying? It's like the last thing anyone would want to say is like, man, Hitler really thought I was awesome. But still, this is like in us, man. That's a great correlation, that's a great correlation. So what do you think about that? I mean, and again, it feels like anything I say, it's the kind of shit where Black people are like, yeah, dumb, dumb, yeah, exactly. That's what it's like for us all the fucking time. But I don't know, maybe you could talk about that a little bit because I'm a fan of conspiracy theories, and this to me is like, if you want to like, it's like throwing garlic into a basement of vampires. Just post on your Instagram anything pro Black Lives Matter and the racist will come scattering out on your thread and it's crazy. They love their oppression, don't they? So I'll put it to you like this. We have a lot of trouble describing and communicating things across ethnic lines in the first place. Not Black people, but everybody. All ethnicities have. A bit of trouble describing something that happens to them alone across ethnic lines. And every ethnicity has their own proprietorship over their atrocity, which they should. It's their atrocity, it's theirs, particularly theirs. Our Native American brothers and sisters have genocide. Our Armenian brothers and sisters have the word genocide. Jewish brothers and sisters have the word Holocaust or anti-Semites. Well, the reason that we have so much trouble communicating how bad the atrocity is, is because we don't have a word. We don't have a word. But history will have a word for this. Mark my words. History will have a word for what has been done to my people for 500 years. And it's just, I think it's time that, and I think what you're seeing on your Instagram, and I think what you're seeing as movements of, even the comment I made on your Instagram, I said it's time to make a choice to people. I said you got to pick a side. Because we are at the point now where we want the world to acknowledge that we need a word. It's not bad. How do you describe a humanitarian crisis that isn't happening to you? How do you describe a humanitarian crisis from people who've been scapegoated for centuries? How do you describe a humanitarian crisis from the voices of the muted? So what they did to George Floyd, the public execution of George Floyd, I should say, was so apropos to what America always does to our voices, they crush it. They put their knee right into it, they smile, put their hand in the pocket, and they bring up something he did four years ago. Why he's a problem, why it's his own fault, why it's our own community's fault, so on and so forth. But the fact of the matter is, racism is not a strong enough word. You can be racist. That's fine. No one's asking you to change your ideas. You can be racist against whoever you like. If it's a family tradition, fine, great. Have fun with that. Once you start executing people in public, which they've been doing for a long time, once you start scapegoating people, once you start ghettoizing people and blaming them for the conditions of the population density and the poor conditions in which they live, which diminishes quality of life, length of life, health, increases crime, once you blame them for scientific sociological factors, once you discredit their voice in American society. I'll ask you a question. Where does crippling oppression leave? What's the end game? It's got to be fascism. It's got to be pure tyranny. But specifically, yes. And that is a correct answer for someone who has the space suit, the skin suit that you do. But where does it leave from me? Where does it go from? What's the end game from my mother? What's the end game from my children? I mean, you're asking me, it's got to be poverty? But more than that, it's like... It's worse than that. Terror? We've always had poverty. We've always had white terror. We've always had white terrorists. Jail? We've always had that. Mass incarceration. We've always had that. Where does it lead? Doom? I don't know, man. It leads to four different options. And I don't mean next year. I mean 10 years from now. 20 years from now. So, I won't tell you the options because I think people can figure them out on their own. And it's controversial for me to talk about the options, which is why I feel like my voice has been muted on social media because I was talking about the options of where this leads. And I had a lot of arguments about the syntax I used. Wow. Correct. What's the essence of it, though? I mean, if you don't feel comfortable talking about the options, and I'm, I guess, too dim to, like, map them out of my head, what's the... I mean, I can only imagine that, you know, it's ultimate degradation. It's a... I mean, we're talking about a kind of willful... What's that? We're already there. We're already at ultimate degradation. So... Where are you? So, I'll put it to you like this. You're very well read. You and I both are very well read. Are you a history buff? Well, I don't know. I mean, like, you know, I'm into mysticism, spirituality, but, you know, I wouldn't call myself a history buff. Okay. I'm a history buff. Are you familiar with the author, Elie Wiesel? Yes. Okay. Elie Wiesel is my favorite author. I started reading him around the time I was 12 or 13 years old. It was required reading. And then after that, I read about seven or eight of his books. I know he wrote, like, about 50 something books, but, like... He was a Romanian-born author who died as an American citizen, and he got his citizenship after the Holocaust. And he wrote normally... He mainly wrote about his experiences prior to the Holocaust and during the Holocaust and after. And if I could have dinner with anyone in space-time, it would be Elie Wiesel. I have a lot of questions for him. And I'd ask him, when you started noticing the palpable hate in the ether against your people, that had been supported by policies and enforcement and the population's general ideas about you, and your voice was muted so no one heard you speak, how did you deal with the chronic stress of that? And then I would ask him, when you were scapegoated for everything in society, and your voice was discredited further, and you were ghettoized, and they could easily block you off into certain parts of the city, and you could easily be blocked off themselves and have access to your water supply and access to your food supply and create laws and policies and enforcement to where it was extremely hard for you to get out of those physical spaces. They were policing your space. More importantly, policing the space in which you could escape. And then they blamed you for the quality of life and the crime and the things that happened when you put a bunch of people together in poor living conditions. How did you deal with the chronic stress of that? And then when you were standing on the street corner because there was no parks in the ghetto, not a lot of land to play in, and you see you and your friends, 12, 13 years old, just boys will be boys. And the Romanians walked by and the Germans walked by and they said, oh, the Jews, how did you deal with the disrespect of them? And then when you would walk outside and you would see your friend lying in a pool of his own blood with the Gestapo around him, having been killed in broad daylight in front of everybody in your neighborhood to make an example. And then they brought up something that he did three years ago. But you know, you know him. You knew he's a good guy. You knew he didn't do anything wrong that day. And then it kept happening to your friends over and over and over again. And the Gestapo kept making excuses of why it had to be done and why it needed to be done in broad daylight. How did you deal with the chronic stress of never being safe in your own home? And then when they came to pick you up in the buses and take you to the trains, I wonder if you asked yourself a different question. Didn't you say, surely the good Romanian people or the good German people will stop this from happening? Surely they can see what's happening. Surely my voice is not muted so at such a level that they can't hear me crying. They can't hear my ancestors screaming through my skin, right? They have to know what's happening. They can't just blame us for everything, can they? No, they've got to help, right? And then when you finally did get to the camps, did you ask yourself a different question? Did you say, I should have done something different? I should have made them listen. And then I would ask Kelly if he has any advice for me, because he made it through. And one day I'd like to be sitting in the chair on the other side of the conversation talking to the next people going through the atrocity and trying to help them. And then I would leave that dinner with a question for the world. If you would help Ellie in 1932, why won't you help me now? We don't have a word. And it is a racist idea in my own head, in my own head because we're all within this racially biased spectrum. It's a racially biased idea in my own head that my life, my mother's life, my unborn children's life is worth screaming for at the mountaintop of a global community. So that's what you're seeing on your Instagram. That's what you're seeing when you see the riots. That's what you're seeing. It is a muted people, a scapegoated people, a people who have been targeted for hundreds of years who don't have a word for it. That's what it is. Beautiful, man. That is beautifully said. But what an ominous, terrifying thing you just put a really articulate poetic light on. My God, that's right. That's happening right in front of us. Of course, it's right in front of us. They lied too, man. You know, the coroner lied. The coroner said it was a heart thing mixed with drugs. It's the reason he died. Not because there was a bunch of dudes piled on top of him and someone with their knee in his neck. They tried to do that. They tried to do that, and you're right. That's the other thing with George Floyd. It's like, well, four years ago he did this or that. And then, yeah, you're right. This is insane. I get it, and I get what the outcome that you're talking about, of course. I get it. Right in front of us. Well, that's one of the four outcomes. Correct. That is one of the four outcomes. There are peaceful outcomes. You know, there are peaceful outcomes. But the peaceful outcomes are in the hands of those that get over the guilt, transmute the guilt into compassion and awareness, and a chance to educate themselves about the country that they actually live in. It was called crystal knocked, right? That's when the Nazis just broke and looted a lot of Jewish businesses. And then they blame the Jews for it. That was always part of it. It's like, not only do you terrorize them, but then after you've done terror, if they react in any way to you terrorizing them, that justifies you terrorizing them. That's the insane math that these fascists use. And that's exactly what they're using now. As if an insured storefront window was worth my life. Window protectors. They're everywhere. And this is the thing, man. For me, in the beginning of this, when I was still engaged with people online about it, before I realized that just by talking to them on putting on microphone in front of someone who doesn't deserve it, I would go back on their timelines. So if somebody was coming at me over anything that I was saying in support of the direct action that was being taken to make sure people were listening this time, people would say, well, okay, are you going to send some money to the small business owners? What about them? Are you going to? They're insured. What's that? There's no small business owner that's not insured. Right. But what I would do is I'd go back on their timeline because I would think, well, surely if they're concerned about the small fucking business owners, there's going to be some tweet after George Floyd got publicly fucking executed saying how outrageous that was. That that was a horror. And you go back on their timeline, there's nothing. Just sports tweets up until people start breaking the glass of pawn shops. And then they're like, what the fuck are you doing to our pawn shops? Yep. Man, that's some dark, dark, dark conditioning there. That that's what activates many people, many people activated by broken glass, but in no way, shape or form disturbed by somebody screaming out for his mom. And now I understand how poignant that is because he was screaming out for his mom because she probably told him like all the stuff you're supposed to do when you get arrested and he did it and it didn't work. Fuck, man, that is so dark. It's a sickness is what it is. So it's it's deeply rooted. But the thing about it, it's also such a thinly veiled and flimsy ideology that it can go away in a few in a few weeks. In a few weeks. How there's no I don't understand how that that up until this point I've agreed with you. Man, I like these like hard boiled. I'm not even talking about the people who are just kind of lazy and haven't done any amount of research and just have a general like middle class sense of like, I don't want my Walmarts windows to be broken. I'm talking, you know, I'm talking about the hard boiled, you know, the people who have intentionally infiltrated the security forces of the world in the same way like pedophiles getting to the Boy Scouts. You know what I mean? I don't see how that gets fixed in a few weeks, man. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not worried about their consciousness. You can't. You can't touch their consciousness that they are. They have their own journeys, brother. And I send them love and I and I and I, I, you know, I wish them well on that journey. However, you've you've become much more aware of what's going on last week. Yes. And anything that you may have been taught, you're now starting to question. Yes. So two weeks from now, where will you be? I don't know, man. I mean, probably a FEMA camp. That's how paranoid I am right now, especially after this conversation. I mean, I mean, I mean, like, as far as awareness goes, you're going to have a lot more information. Yeah. You're going to be open to that information. That's all I'm saying. What I'm saying is this. Okay. So I try to look at. I don't try. I do look at consciousness in and of itself as as a as a being. It's alive. Consciousness is having its own evolution. And I think that that that was evidenced in the fact that we began 2020 thinking that this is going to be a great year and then all of a sudden we're all in quarantine. Yeah. Right. Well, why did that happen? Well, I got a. I'm no longer being bashful about my connections to the universe. And so I, I don't quite understand it all the time myself. But I endeavor every day to do so. But I got a message, very clear message from the universe that this was the divine feminine spirit or so we call it. I don't believe that divinity has gender. But if you want to look at it that way, the divine feminine spirit was trying to repair the covenant that human spirit has broken with Earth. And that that means that what I got was that Gaia Earth was very upset with us. She wants us to stop disrespecting you. Right. But we can't do that until we stop disrespecting each other. We cannot we racism and oppression destroys any chance for cooperation. We can't we can't fix climate change. We can't fix the big existential questions of life until we stop killing each other. And until we stop debating whether killing me matters. Wow. So what Gaia did was she caught a cold. And then she said, everybody sit at home, slow down, get off of work, work from home. Pick up pick up pick up this new this new technology that's been introduced society that interjects information into our homes and to each other. Take a look at your world. Take a look at yourself. Take a look at your families. What's important survival. Right. Everybody had the ancient brain massage for a second and said, Oh shit, survival is important. All of us felt this fight or flight responsive. Okay, if I go outside, it's better if I stay inside because if I go outside, I could die at any point in time. Right. I think what happened is we got a really good look at ourselves and a really good look at society with new awareness. We didn't like what we saw. Right. And to so many millions of our beautiful white brothers and sisters. They created the compassion inside of them. And they saw that I don't like how I've been living for the last two months with in this flight or miss a fight or flight response. And my black brothers and sisters live like this 365 days a year. Right. So we didn't have to tell you guys anymore. I showed you our experience. Holy shit. We gave it to you and said, Hey, what are you going to do about this? Do you still want this for other people? When COVID is over. A lot of people can go back to their normal lives. We've never had a normal life. We are always in fight or flight. What does that do? Well, that appears, you know, to look like violence and anger and stress and. Cancer and diabetes and hypertension and all the things that afflict my community. It is it is in it is being in a state of chronic stress when you tell a when you get arrested and roughed up by the police at eight years old and you have nightmares for years about it. You're in a state of chronic stress. That's just what it. We got a chance to look at ourselves. We didn't like it. And now the compassion has been activated. And that that covenant with earth that we would protect her and take care of her and reciprocate the, the, the, the nurturing and the support that she gives us cannot happen until we stop fighting amongst ourselves. Right. And that's what this is. She's tired of it. The consciousness is moving forward. The universe is consciousness is moving forward. It's a law of inertia. Laws of physics don't ask you if you're okay. Laws of things don't ask you for your subtle nuanced debates. Laws of physics and avalanche doesn't ask the skiers to move. Right. So this is the consciousness of the universe that is that is evolving. It's tired of the I am of the I am selfishness. It's tired of it. Right. You have to step into the we are. Holy shit. Once that's the step into the we are, and we have to see ourselves in each other. You have to see yourself in George Floyd. You have to see yourself in trade by Martin. You have to see yourself in your rights. Holy shit. That's it. That's it. That's it, brother. And if you look, if you look at pulses of consciousness or evolutions of consciousness throughout the world, they last for about three to 400 years at a time. Right. So why did you and I choose to be alive at this time? Well, we're coming to the end of one point of consciousness, and we're coming into a shift of another one. Right. It is not up to mankind to decide these shifts of consciousness. It is the universe that decides these. So the last pulse of consciousness that we had was the Reformation. And every single pulse of consciousness is amplified by a new piece of technology and that new piece of technology amplifies commerce. So what happened in 1500 around that time? Well, the invention of the printing press. Right. So all of a sudden you had a bunch of people who had myths and propaganda and truths and different perspectives that were able to tell more than 15 to 20 people to keep it within esoteric communities. And they could write it down and then print out 5000 copies and those 5000 copies could be shipped all around Europe. And all of a sudden, you know, Martin Luther changed the church. The role of women increased in society. People's religious beliefs were altered and changed forever. Right. And they also used it as propaganda. One piece of propaganda that they used was that black was evil. It was a Portuguese king who was a slave trader, which is a nice way of saying human trafficker. Right. Or child kidnap rapists make them work, right? Yes. And because, mind you, the transatlantic slave trade was mostly children. Jesus Christ. They weren't picking up 40-year-olds. Why would you do that? You want 15-year-olds. You want 12-year-olds. They're smaller. You can fit more into a ship. Of course. You feed them less. They're more resilient, stronger immune systems in many cases. And you can work them longer once they get to where they're going. So what happened was the Portuguese king, I forget his name. I think it was King Philip. I could be mistaken. I'm sure you're listening as a student enough to look it up themselves. But there was a king, 1450 to around 1500, who was an avid slave trader. And he wanted his reputation repaired before he died. So he got his scribes to write these awful things, these awful myths about racial divisions. Even though no one had ever seen human beings as being racially divided, it was all ethnicity back then. My ancestors were not black. They were from Oyo. They were from Yoruba. They were from present-day Ghana, Nigeria. So they didn't see themselves as black people. They saw themselves as Yoruba. Portuguese saw themselves as Portuguese. They didn't see themselves as white. In fact, the name Africa comes from the Roman Latin word Afrique, which means the land that is free of cold and horror. For thousands of years, we've interacted with each other. Of all different races. Africa had the largest system of higher education in the world. Most of the European kings were in the Middle Ages, studied in Timbuktu. Really? Absolutely. 100%. In fact, look it up. So it wasn't like there were these two worlds that all of a sudden collided 500 years ago and couldn't get along. They saw an opportunity. They saw an opportunity to make money in a slave trade and they felt horrible about what they were doing until they cleaned it up. So fast forward 50 years and slave trade is increasing. People feel a certain way about it. Some people are okay with it. Many people are not. And they're trying to stop it from happening. You have two companies, one called the Dutch East Indian Company. We talked about this in the last one. Yes, we did. But it's a good refresher. Yes. So the Dutch East Indian Company and the Dutch West Indian Company were the two largest corporations in history at the time. And they had private armaments and they were the first publicly traded companies and they traded people. They kidnapped people and they brought them elsewhere. A lot of their soldiers, a lot of their, sorry, a lot of their sailors, pirates that they were employing, started committing suicide, jumping ship, not showing up for the next excursion. Right. Doing their version of mass shootings back in Holland or England or wherever the case was. And telling the stories of the horrors of what they had to do. And then a lot of really compassionate, good-hearted Europeans at the time wanted this to end. So there was a campaign against these two companies. So these companies shut their doors for a year and they used this new invention called the printing press. And they took this Portuguese king's bullshit and they used the printing press to amplify. Wow. And scientists and doctors at the time signed off on it as if it was prevailing wisdom at the time. Right. And so they used this new technology that the world had never seen and sent out all this information, all these myths that black was subhuman. And they didn't mean skin. At the time they meant black plague, black magic, black evil, closer to Satan. Africa's the Satan's last stronghold on the planet and these people are savage, inhumane, or a savage, inhuman, subhuman beasts who must be taken out of this environment and given purpose somewhere else. Right. And they're terrible though because they're too savage, but somewhere else and we can also make some money off of that. God damn. And so the myth that was spread was to make shareholders in the company and their pirates in their employees feel better. And that sparked the industrialization of commerce, period. Well, that was the last pulse of consciousness. So where are we now? We're 500 years later. We're overdue. And what do we have now? The internet. We have our printing press. We have a new printing press, social media, the internet. And yes, propaganda gets spread on that too. But every 500 years, every 400 years or so, we have the ability with new technology to either shape the next centuries in truth and inclusion, kindness, or continue the propaganda, continue the lie, continue the oppression. And that's where we are. And that's where the universe is. It's giving us the opportunity to rectify, to repair the past 500 years. You know, man, you know, I feel like I feel like I'm with like the hero and in like an HP Lovecraft story that is like holding some kind of lantern up in one of those subterranean caves where the Cthulhu live. You know what I'm saying? Like some eight. Like, you know what? It's scary. Like, and like, I think this is probably where your optimism, your optimism is beautiful and inspiring. But one, you know what? One thing I think a lot of white people don't have that a lot of people color have is this ability to handle staring at evil in a way that doesn't involve going, Holy fuck, what the fuck? I got to get the fuck out of here. Like that. As I'm just all the things that you're saying, it's not like it's new data. But all the things you're saying to me are it's like you've essentially chalked out the form of the Antichrist. Like you've just sort of marked out like, well, there's it's probiscus. Those are its wings. There's its horn. See those hooves there that and it's been standing right there. Goggling at you since you were born. And you know what I mean that? And I think probably what a lot of white people are dealing with right now is is like, I don't want to be I don't want to be around that. Like, I don't want to be in this subterranean tunnel. And then realizing, wait, I've been in the subterranean tunnel my whole fucking life. And then realizing, you know what I mean? And not only that, but holy shit, am I one of the tentacles? You know what I mean? Like, oh, fuck, I'm a tentacle. You know, that's a little it's I'm just saying what you are so calmly describing is it's like a cosmic horror. Yes. Listen, I mean, being black is like this very specific purgatory being stuck in between hopeless and hopeful at all times. And you, while you can get used to that, you never enjoy it. While you can, while that can become, well, you can bring levity to that, patience to that, endurance to that. Well, so do the kids in Afghanistan. So do the people in Iraq, so do the people in every war-torn environment. Right. So it's really just about seeing past the current consciousness and the current evil and realizing what's what's the next step? Because once again, asking the question, where does crippling oppression lead? We have to find a good way out of this, a peaceful way out of this. And I think that we don't need to change hearts and minds. Who cares? You can be racist all day. You can watch all. You can watch the things that are void of any color. You can, you can say whatever you want at your dinner table, you can do whatever you want. You just can't have oppression anymore. Right. We're done with that. Right. We're done with that. I love it. And you can't really ask people to carry something if you don't know the weight of it. Yeah. What? Yeah. I love this so much, man. You are, man. Thank you. You're welcome. The world needs this bad, man, because we're not equipped. Right? You got quite the reach, my friend. We, you know, you do too. And yeah. Actually, not nearly as much as you. So for every one person or every two people that I have will listen to me. My voice, it is within their subconscious mind to tune out. Oh, right. It is part of the great myth. It's part of the great lie, the great propaganda that was spread throughout Europe in the 1500s. And then accepted as a prevailing wisdom through Hume's problem, David Hume, philosopher. Hume states that human beings are afraid of the unknown. And they're also afraid of being outside of the prevailing wisdom because they think it makes them feel stupid. Yes. So if doctors are saying it and lawyers are saying it and professionals and academics are saying it for 20, 30 years, it must be true. So these people must be subhuman. They must be savage. Everybody who's, who's learned it and educated is saying it. And look at these pamphlets. They're everywhere. Right. So let's, let's get them out of their savage situation, put them in a new world where they can help cultivate that world and give them purpose and give them Jesus. And let's make some money off of it. And that is, that has been the structure of the last 500 years. And I think the universe now is at a point where it lived through a traumatic time in its own life. The consciousness itself went through a traumatic period in its own life after the Reformation. Now it wants to heal. It wants to go to the psychiatrist itself. Consciousness wants to heal itself. So it's not asking. That's why I feel calm. That's why I feel whole. Because I know that consciousness itself wants this. It doesn't matter what people say. Right. Right. Right. That's the transcendental platform. That's what we have to be on because if we are hanging out in the phenomena right now, it really doesn't seem the way your voice sounds. And that's because you're on, you found this transcendental platform that you've connected to for real. And that's coming through a lot of black people right now. I've been, you know, every single voice that I've been listening to, you know, because for us, and by us, I mean just like people who have not educated themselves as much as we should have, as we're, you know, sort of coming to and looking around and realizing that we've been at like a cocktail party with like vampires. You know what I mean? It's like, wait, what the fuck? Wait, holy fuck. Holy fuck. It's like that scene in Rosemary's baby when she's getting impregnated. She's being, you know, raped by the devil. And she's like, this is really happening. This is real. It's like that is the feeling. And, you know, so it's like when you're watching people who their entire life, this has like been just common knowledge. This is something you were told when you're seven or eight. Or you learn the hard way. And what has happened with you all is that you have developed a kind of, you have out of, and you existentially have to remain calm because the worst thing you can do in this kind of situation is panic. And that's what you have. That's what it is. And that is contagious, thank God. Because if you have somehow found this peaceful way of being in the midst of this insane universe, this world, this is the lifting of the veil. This is the apocalypse. And if you found a way to be calm in this apocalypse, because the veil already has been lifted, then we can too. And that is a beautiful thing. I think it's really important for people to just let go of all the ideas that they thought they knew. Because all those ideas have only come to play in the last 500 years. And human beings, as we know now, are 300 or 400,000 years old. So this is all new. And there's only one race. There's two tribes. There's the anti-racist and the other guys. There's the pro-humans and the people who are particular humanophobic, right? Those that want to educate themselves and racial oppression deniers. Those that are awakening to the reality that has always been, and those willing to protect the veil of control of our reality. There's only two tribes within the human race. Those that want to end oppression and those that want to protect it. Wow, man. Mr. Brooks, this has been my favorite podcast, Hands Down. And I'm so grateful to you for your time. And I hope everybody listening connects with you, because you have been a teacher and you have taken on a leadership role, which you should be doing. So how can people connect to you so that we can, you know, lift your voice up more than, you know, being on a Stoner's podcast? How do we, how can people connect to you, man? First of all, here's the thing. I have so much love for all my Stoners, because what a Stoner does is they take the time to sit down and do something for themselves that relaxes themselves and stimulates thoughts. Right. So, I believe that it's going to be the Stoners. I believe it's going to be the people who have sit in silence here and there that understand this, that get this. You can find me at Makad Brooks on Twitter and Instagram. I'm a lot more active on Instagram. I also started a church on Instagram called the Church of Anti-Racism. And, you know, I'm just, I'm preaching the same thing there. And, you know, just that this is an invitation to the collective consciousness to celebrate the ancestors. Yes. And that we, and here's the thing. Yes. I have to have compassion for Duncan Trussell's situation, which is this. I will never understand the ancestral guilt that you have, but you will never understand the ancestral trauma that I have. But your ancestors and my ancestors would love it if we healed together. Wow. That's true. Oh God, you are, man, you are, you're a king. I got to talk to a king. This is the coolest thing. Always wanted to. You're the real deal. God bless you, man. Thank you very much. And I'm so happy that we're friends and thank you for your time. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna, my brother. Yes. Much thanks to Makad Brooks for appearing on this episode of the DTFH.

It's me Duncan and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. I'm glowing with joy right now. Glowing with happiness. I just finished three shows I was kind of nervous about. The last one in LA was at Harmon or Starburn's Castle and the one before it was in San Francisco and then the one before that was at the Maps Comedy Banquet. All of these are important. Every show is important to me. When I do an actual show show where you guys come out and buy tickets, it's serious business to me in the sense that it really freaks me out. So I've been kind of like, as a show shows approach, you kind of like, you go into like preparatory mode, you kind of start like you lock down, you cramp up spiritually and you start worrying if you're me. That's what I do. And you kind of write all your jokes out and you look at them and you're like, God, this is bullshit. I'm not going to say that up there. Who do I think I am? What am I doing? Why am I doing this? What's happened to me that I would be doing this strange thing and all these neurotic thoughts go flying through your mind and thank God for Maps. Thank God for this incredible weekend that I spent at the Maps Psychedelic Science Conference because something happened over the course of those few days where just whatever the blockage was that was making me neurotic when it comes to stand up comedy seemed to just get blasted away. And I'm not sure exactly what did it. I'm speculating here. I really don't know. So I'm just going to say it was the sum total of all the amazing interactions I had with the amazing people at that conference. And the information that they shared with me, which is really exciting. And it's information that's just scientific. The data that's coming in right now is so beautiful. When it comes to the research they're doing on LSD and psilocybin and MDMA, and of course for somebody like me, that's quite vindicating because my entire life I've used psychedelics and it's mostly been therapeutic for me. In fact, I would say every single time has been therapeutic, even though sometimes it doesn't feel like that when it's happening. So to be around scientists, hardcore empiricists who are delving into these chemicals and understanding why they work, how they work, what the correct dosages are, and to see that there is a possibility that because of the diligent, measured, careful work of these people, we might enter into an era where psychedelics are prescribable. That fills me with a kind of ridiculous joy. It's something when I was in high school, if I heard that there would be some time in history where psychedelics could be prescribed to you by a doctor, I would have thought it was the funniest, most incredible thing ever. So to see it happening now, wow man, it puts me in a great mood. But it's not just that, it's not just the research that's going on, it's the community around the research that makes me excited. It's all the different people involved in this amazing movement that fills me with joy because there's just an entire spectrum of humanity interested in psychedelic science. And obviously it's not just scientists and doctors, it's psychonauts, luminaries, visionaries, gurus, comedians. There are a lot of hilarious comedians at the Psychedelic Science Conference and this kind of produces a tapestry of joy and it just, I don't know, I'm not going to go on and on about it but I just feel so happy and, I don't know, excited for life right now. And excited for what's in store over the next few years for all of us, you know. God, you watch the saber-rattling bullshit on the news and you start getting nervous and trump this, trump that, all the paranoid insanity that comes bleeding out of that fissure-encrusted media anus exploding all over everyone's brains whenever you turn on the TV and it's easy to get depressed and stuck in a prison of perception based on the insane paradigm these reptilian lunatics want us to believe. But anytime you get around a kind of mostly undocumented happening, some of it's impossible to document by the way. I mean, I like that these scientists are attempting to get data on the psychedelic experience but how do you document it? You know, that's one of the beautiful things about it, it's kind of undocumented. At one point during this conference, I can remember telling someone, I am having a peak experience right now and knowing as I was saying it that the next day I wasn't going to remember exactly what was going on inside of me to make me say such a strange thing. And yet a few days after that experience, the afterglow remains. It's an amazing thing to think that there was some deep realization that I had. I can't remember the specifics of the realization necessarily, but whatever healing comes from a realization continues to grow inside of me and that's one of the beautiful things about psychedelics. You witness something and you know we hear this, you hear a version of this story which is it takes you there but you've got to leave. Well, so does an ambulance, right? An ambulance takes you to a hospital, they do some work on you and then the ambulance takes you home. You don't necessarily have to remember everything that happened to you in the hospital. You might have been under anesthesia, but if there was healing that happened then the healing is going to happen regardless of whether or not you remember the specifics of what happened during the healing. And I think that's something that psychedelics does for us and because when you go into a very heightened state of consciousness and you have some incredible realization and then when you come back to base reality and you can't remember it, it doesn't negate that experience. It doesn't negate it and that's something that I've told myself as you get into the kind of hierarchical comparison of psychedelics versus the spiritual path, psychedelics versus meditation, one of the interesting forms of argument that emerges in the psychedelic and spiritual community. Psychedelics versus meditation, it's a hilarious argument. It's very similar to the hilarious argument of LSD versus mushrooms. Anytime you get into some kind of hierarchical discussion when it comes to pretty different things, it's a mistake probably, but it's fun. But you know the conversation. Meditation is somehow better. Psychedelics are a kind of thing you do as a lead up to a life of sincere meditation. Boring, boring, really kind of boring, and also it's weird because people can get a little snobby. They're like, you know, I put down my toys of my childhood and I took up the mantle of the meditative life and it's really serious and heavy and kind of dreary, right? As though, as though, yes, yes, you, oh, play with your psychedelics child and when you already come and I will teach you the ways of breathing, that's kind of annoying, right? Like, maybe it's not, maybe, maybe both paths are fantastic and there doesn't have to be a graduation from one to the other and maybe the two kind of work together. And just because psychedelics produce such heightened states of consciousness that you might not be able to bring all the information that you uncovered or discovered in that state back to waking life in some articulate way, doesn't necessarily negate the experience or indicate that you should try some other methodology. All that matters is how you're feeling a few days later. How you doing? You feeling all right? You feeling good? And with psychedelics, it can happen that a few days later, it's as though there's a glow inside of you that is continuing to glow and as though whatever was whispered to you in the strange swirling chambers of ketamine or DMT or whatever the psychedelic was that you took was so incredibly wonderful that you don't need to remember it in your waking life because it was something that your atoms needed to hear. It was something that the quantum connection between every system in your body needed to hear and that was all you really needed. And then maybe at some point, whatever was whispered to you in that incredible state will come to you in a dream or when you're walking in the park or when you're riding in an Uber and you're like, oh, okay, and maybe it won't even seem that exciting because maybe that thing that was whispered to you in that state wasn't really meant for the part of you that you think's you. It was meant for the greater you. Who knows what I'm saying, friends? All I can tell you is I am in a ecstatic mood today. I'm going to the Rhamdas retreat in a few days and I just can't wait. I'm going to get to spend a week with Rhamdas and Sharon Salzburg and Raghu Marcus and Krishna Das and boy, that fills me with a lot of joy too. So I'm happy right now. Okay, forgive me. I love you guys. We've got a glorious podcast for you today. I've been dying to have a conversation with today's guest, Dennis McKenna, who I'm sure you've heard of and wow, well, you know what? I won't ruin it for you. We're going to jump right into it, but first, a quick word from our beautiful sponsors. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by hellofresh.com. It's time to stop robbing yourself of the primordial joys of cooking. What are you doing sloughing off to the restaurant to have some lunatic in the back who just drowned his kittens in a bathtub, whip up a meal for you and instill it with all of his dark karmic vibes. You don't have to do that anymore. You can actually regain the ability to cook. I don't know if you're a chef out there. I certainly am not and there's really something amazing when hellofresh delivers their box of farm to table goodness. It's really, really good and you end up cooking meals that you never normally would have made. I made this amazing Thai beef bowl with roasted cabbage in it. I'm not going to roast cabbage. That's never in a million billion years would I have roasted cabbage if not for hellofresh.com, but they send you all the ingredients. It's perfectly measured out so that you don't have to measure the ingredients yourself. All the ingredients are fresh and basically it's an amazing way to teach yourself to cook, to get really healthy food inside your body and most importantly, if you ask me, it fills your house with the smell of food, which is the smell of home. If you're somebody like me and you're always going out to eat, then maybe your house smells like incense or marijuana or cats, but it probably doesn't smell like an exotic Thai bowl of deliciousness that you cooked in your own kitchen and there's something empowering about it. There really is. It's an amazing way for you to start getting into the habit of cooking for yourself, which is actually supremely fun and yet it's something that I forget all the time.

It was amazing, I was able to cook for my girlfriend and give her a meal that I cooked for her and it made her happy. Here's the other thing, people like to be cooked for. This is like an ancient ritual, I bring you food, me love you, food for you, put it in your mouth. It's like the most ancient thing, we give food to the people we love, we cook food and it's different when you go out to eat and you give the rectangular green paper to the server who then brings you food from a mysterious man in the back. You don't know who's back there, it could be a forearm mutant thing, spraying the food out of his bloated nipples. You don't know what's back there, it could be some interdimensional hydra, vomiting your food out, infecting you permanently with some kind of dark sub-dimensional hell curse that he intertwined into the DNA of the food. HelloFresh.com will save you from that possibility and it will make you feel like a human being. The freshest ingredients, measured to the exact quantities, you won't waste the food and it's good, it's really good. I tried it out, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't have done the ad.

One of them is to try out the sponsors, another is to use our Amazon link located at DunkinTrussell.com. There's a little Amazon link, you click on that, you get zinged over to Amazon and anything that you end up buying there, they will give us a very small percentage of it. This will save you from the horror of going out to buy toilet paper at a grocery store, wasting all that gas, going through traffic just so that you could buy a reminder of your deep humanness. Who wants that? Who wants to be an amaze of boxes when you could easily? Just go to Amazon.com and order a thousand toilet papers. You could order enough toilet paper rolls to fill your bomb shelter for the next 30 years. You'll be pooping for the next 30 years and not run out. That's the joy of Amazon. It's weird to go to the grocery store and buy a ton of toilet paper. People think you're sick, but if you go to Amazon.com, you just zing it in there. The next thing you know, the delivery man will bring you a thousand toilet paper rolls. He might think you're sick, but who cares? It's one guy versus cashiers who will announce to the store, apparently someone with dysentery is buying 600 rolls of toilet paper. Looks like we've got a sick person here and you'll be humiliated and the people will come out of the aisles and they'll stand around you and they'll shake their fingers at you and they'll say, shame on you, oh foul human, shame on you and you'll cry and they'll probably start kicking you. They'll throw you onto the tiled floor of the grocery store and they'll start stamping on your face and your head, but you'll kind of like it and you'll start sucking on their feet and then you'll all fall together in a blob of weird, passionate, sadomasochistic sex. Sure, maybe that sounds great until one of the weirdos sets the whole pile on fire and now you're a human torch ignited in the middle of a grocery store. People throwing their toilet paper you are going to buy onto the fire. That's no way to die. This is why you need to go to Amazon.com, zing through the link at DuncanTrustle.com. It's on the lower left-hand corner, it's in the comments section of these episodes. Buy 1,000 toilet papers, send it to your friend. Toilet papers so cheap these days, want to freak out one of your paranoid friends, anonymously send them 100 rolls of toilet paper with a Meister Eckhart quote in there. The part of the soul that burns in hell is the part that clings to life and just see what happens to them over the next couple of weeks as they try to figure out who would sense something so weird and great but terrifying. Go through our link, won't you? And thanks for those of you who continue to go through the Amazon portal. Coming up, my sweet loves, on May 16th, let me just check to make sure that's right, I'll be doing a live DTFH, that's going to be at the Bell House on May 16th. I hope that you will come out, these are so fun to do, it's a chance for all of us to rub our antennas together, say hello to each other and enjoy a super fun night, they're very special and I hope that you will join me there on May 16th at the Bell House. All links to my shows are at DuggarTrestle.com, you can see where I'm going to be doing stand-up around New York and also where my live podcasts are going to be. Alright, let's get this show on the road, friends. Today's guest is a gift to you from the universe, Maps and Symposia, because if it wasn't for those three amazing things, I wouldn't have run into him at the Maps Conference in Oakland. He is an ethno-pharmacologist, he's the director of ethno-pharmacology at the Hefter Research Institute, and of course he is the brother of Terrence McKenna. If you have any interest at all in the stuff that we talk about in this podcast and you want to go deep, you might want to check out ESPD50.com, that's the ethno-pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs. There's going to be a gathering that is happening in the UK, there's still tickets available for that, I might actually go, but if you don't want to go to the UK, you could actually have a free live stream and watch the whole thing go down. Check it out, it's at ESPD50.com, there's going to be some incredible speakers there, and it's another example of some of the really important and really amazing work that members of the psychedelic community are doing to spread the data that they're gathering related to psychedelic drugs and to deepen our consciousness and to heal us and to open us up to all the great possibilities that psychedelics offer. Send your radiant love energy into that part of the universe where there is no I and only a we or a one and let it zing over to the one that is temporarily manifesting as the great Dennis McKenna. Dennis, when I watch what's happening here at the psychedelic conference, it's amazing because you are worshipped like a god here, and you deserve it, but it is an incredible thing to see the swirl of people around you. How's that making you feel to be in this situation of extreme celebrity at this conference? Well, Duncan, it's a mixed bag. Like I told you, it's nice to be loved, and I certainly appreciate that, I appreciate that people respect me, but I also have more understanding of someone like someone mentioned Leonardo DiCaprio, what a real celebrity must go through in their daily lives. It has got to be difficult to just navigate that way. I respect my fans, I don't call them fans, but they respect me, and I try to respond with the same way. I don't want to be rude, but sometimes it just gets to be too much. Well, just the work that you've done has been so significant and has had such a significant impact on people's lives that when they see you, there is no way that they can avoid coming up to you. And again, I don't want to make this some Dennis McKenna worship session or put you in an awkward position like that, but I wouldn't love to know how often people come up to you and say, you've changed my life, your work has altered me permanently for the better. Well, often, in conferences like this especially, obviously they don't come up to be on the street and sometimes they do, but at conferences like this, people come to these gigs because psychedelics have been important to them and they have transformed many people's lives for the better and I, including my own, there's not a day goes by that I'm not thankful for being involved with psychedelics. But I don't want to be put on a pedestal, it's not me, I mean, okay, I like it that people respect my work, but they should respect their own work as well, you know, psychedelics are the kind of ultimate do-it-yourself project or extreme makeover project. It's something the individual does with the help of these medicines to become a better person if they're using it in the right way. So I like it that they respect my work, I mean, it's kind of ironic that they call it work because it doesn't seem like work, you know, but I mean, but it is work, the work that you guys that you have done, you have, you wrote a book with parents about how to grow mushrooms at home, you are the first person to put that information out there correct and so that more or less, yeah, what's the name of that book? It's called psilocybin magic mushroom growers guide. And before that book, there was no, no one knew how to do it, there was no manual, there was no, they were writing books about it, a few people know how to do it, it's not really rocket science. I mean, there was Bob Harris is another one of our contemporaries that was writing a book about growing psilocybin mushrooms at the same time, but I think the book, which was really no more than a pamphlet, it was hardly a book, it was a very short book with photographs and it explained a simple way to do it. Any seventh grader could figure this out, you know, and I've since talked to many people who were seventh graders when it came out and they, they just got a little science project going down in the basement and you know, the parents were, oh, I'm so glad Johnny's down in the basement, not out on the street with his friends. If they had any idea, they would have been completely appalled, but, but that's good. It was very simple and, and so many people could do it. Many a poor graduate student put themselves through college because you always, you could usually find enough space for a spare closet or something and many people did, including myself when I was a graduate student, it was great and, you know, in some ways I think of the Grower's Guide as our most significant work, you know, because it had an impact on society and ironically we couldn't do it under our real names, you know, everyone knows now that Terrence and I wrote Soul, Cyber, and Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide, but at the time we used pseudonyms and we weren't just being- Wait, what, what names did you use? Well, O N Eric and O T O's were the authors, O N Eric and O T O's. Why did you pick O T S? I'm Eric, by the way, Terrence was, oh, us, us, well okay, O N Eric. Unpack that, it means dreams, O N Eric means dreams, O T O's, O T O's means far away or far removed, so essentially dreams from far away and the book had the foreword that Terrence wrote, this beautiful foreword about how the mushrooms came from the stars, you know, as kind of tug and cheek in cheek, but kind of not, you know, and whether it was tug and cheek or not, it was kind of a beautiful poetic vision. I think that grabbed a lot of people because, you know, when you take high doses of mushrooms, it's pure science fiction. It's very science fiction-y, so I would say more than other psychedelics. It seems to have this quality. Great word for it. You're on another planet, you know, and not in like a sarcastic, man, on another planet, but literally when you see cherry blossoms through mush, while psilocybin is interacting with your neurology, that doesn't look like cherry blossoms. It doesn't look like cherry blossoms, and that's an interesting point, you know, which we can come back to in a minute, but when we developed the method to grow the mushrooms, you know, we, in part, there was a mercenary motive. But the real motive was that when we had gone to Lacherera and got into whatever we stumbled into at Lacherera, we brought spores back from the Amazon, and we wanted to learn a way to propagate the mushrooms so that other people could confirm or not these dimensions that we were accessing. So we were looking for validation, and we were saying, we've got to get this out of here, out there, because are these experiences just peculiar to us, or is this what people encounter? And if that's what people encounter, it's a whole other ballgame, because it's not just two deluded brothers, you know, too steeped in science fiction or whatever it was we were steeped in. There is really an apparent dimension of experience. Now, whether it's inside or outside, I don't know, but people have this, it's a very, you know, if you do five grams in the dark, in total darkness, you will be utterly convinced that they've landed, you know, I mean, it's a very alien, you see machines, you see things that appear to be from some super technological place or time, maybe from the future. I must ask you this, because you say you don't know, you still don't know, you still speculate as to whether this is a thing that's inside or outside? No, I don't speculate I've gone beyond that, because I realize that these are dualistic terms, these are dualisms, and they're not relevant. There really is no inside and outside. These are, you know, that's one of the things you realize when you take psychedelics and have the classic mystical experience. We are all one, there is no separation between us and the rest of the cosmos. So then if you start bandying about these terms, is this real, is this not real, is this inside me, is it out from out there? This is a fundamental misunderstanding of what's going on, and we are so steeped in the Western tradition, at least, into this dualist thinking, I mean, that's the legacy of Cartesianism, you know, and it's not, what I think psychedelics show is that though that way of understanding the world is completely misguided, you know, there really is no, there's no separation between you and me, and you and us, and everyone else, and the universe at large. But this is- Just why these experiences are so impactful on people, they have that realization. The realization of the, of the sub-ec, all one, but I think I see the usefulness in creating at least a temporary distinction between these internal and external universes. It's totally useful for the taxonomy. For the taxonomy. For the ordinary reality and for navigating, and, and you know, we live in a culture that's based on dualism, so we have to sort of be able to play that game and talk that talk. It's important also that in the back of our minds, we realize this is not reality, this is not how it is, you know. We're agreeing to play this game, realizing that that's not really how it is, and in fact, I think one of the things that the psychedelic experience teaches you is, and I say this all the time, that we're living in a hallucination, you know. Everything that we experience, all we have as biological entities is experience. Everything that happens to us is part of experience. But experience is something that the brain synthesizes, it's a hallucination. It takes data in from the outside, it combines it with old memories and associations and things that we, you know, from the inside, and there's a certain processing that goes on, and then it essentially extrudes it into a model of reality. That's the reality that we live in, not the real world. The real world is unknowable. The real world comes to us through these filters, and a lot of what the brain does is filter things out. If everything came through, we'd just be overwhelmed and confused all the time. I want to really cover this because when I, it's a, I just want to put it out there on the table. Don't you think that there are disembodied life forms that we have not achieved the technology to take pictures of or to capture or to dissect or to study outside of the psychedelic experience You and Terrence, it seems like you, you both really did believe that, like there was, was there not an attempt that you were making to try to bring an object back from the DMT realm? Yeah, yeah. In some way you could say that, yes, yes, indeed we did believe that. Do you, do you still believe that? You know, I've come to a point where I don't know what I believe. I mean, that, that's an interesting thing. In a way, a scientist, which fundamentally I am, but at the same time, you can't work in the realm of psychedelics without always being aware of the, of the limitations of science. Science is very useful. Yes. But it's limited. And it's not, it doesn't give you the whole picture. That's very good at looking at tiny slices of reality in great detail, but how, but fitting together the whole thing, it's not so good at that. That's right. You know, you have to invoke other ways of knowing. So, you know, I, I think it was Alfred North Whitehead, who is a philosopher of science that Terrence and I both admired and read a lot. Process theology. Process and reality was his main book. And, but he said, you know, the suspended judgment is the supreme scientific stance. The suspended judgment is the ability to say, we don't fully understand this or that phenomenon. We need more data. Right. And by the way, we need more funding, right in this, in this scientific realm of big science, more data usually inquires, you know, entails more expense. But it's perfectly legitimate to say, we don't know. And the more I use psychedelics, think about psychedelics and all that, the more I find myself saying, we just don't know a lot about what is going on. I think we comprehend a very small fraction of the, of the world and through our limited senses and our limited instruments and even psychedelics, which in some ways are instruments for looking at the world. You remarked earlier about a cherry blossom three seen through the lens of psilocybin is not the same cherry blossom that you look at when you're not altered. And Simon Powell, who's someone you should have on your talk, he wrote the magic mushroom explorer. He wrote a number of interesting books about mushrooms, but he makes this point that psychedelics are, they are in fact scientific instruments. You can, there are ways of, you see phenomena differently on a psychedelic than you do if you're not, you notice aspects of it that are always there, but we're conditioned to screen them out through this gating system that our brains, you know, our brains protect us from being overwhelmed because they have this sensory gating thing going on. You know, a good example of a trivial but good is you go into a restaurant, a noisy restaurant, you're trying to focus on what the people across the table are saying from you. You don't, and behind you, there's a cacophony of noise that your brain can learn to filter out, but if somebody at the next table says your name, that gets through over there, said by name, what's going on, you know, in other words, you know, certain things get through our conditioning and psilocybin and other psychedelics temporarily disrupt that. They open you up to, they disable those gating mechanisms temporarily. So much more gets through, but that's why you have to take it under special circumstances because otherwise you'll just be confused and, in other words, you have to anticipate what's going to happen and prepare for it by making sure you're in the right setting. Right. You know, the freeway at 70 miles an hour is probably not the right setting. You know, Grand Central Station, maybe not the right setting, someplace quiet where you can focus on what the, you know, what the experience is. And then you can, then I think a lot of what psychedelics do is they suppress the foreground. We are conditioned to look at the things in the foreground and ignore the background. They reverse that equation and you notice things that may always be in the background. They're always there, but you don't notice them. Suddenly those things become important and you notice aspects of nature, of phenomena that you just normally wouldn't even be aware of. Right. You know. Well, this is, I think, I think one of the things I love about your work and I love about that you and Terrence are masters of is the ability to go into that state and come back with and articulate it in a way that a person who has never even taken psilocybin in some way or another, and I know this because before I had taken mushrooms, I was, one of my friends gave me one of Terrence's books and I don't remember what passage it was, but as I'm reading it, I felt like I was high as a kite just from the articulation of it. When you talk about bringing this technology to the mainstream, how to grow these mushrooms and the shift in subjective consciousness that you both created from this book, what I think is, oh, well, you're a servant of an energetic, I don't know what it is, an intelligence that has made both of you its pawns and is using you and continuing to use you as a way to like, and again, I don't mean to get into your, I hope this is okay to say, I know that you are a scientist and have a scientific mind, but it seems like you guys are part of the, you know, like on the runway, when you're waving the airplane in, that's what you guys are doing with something. That's what you've done. You're waving a thing in, you're bringing it in to this dimension every time you can clearly talk about it and say, I have seen the cherry blossom in this alternate dimension. That's not a cherry blossom. Here's what it is. It's not the cherry blossom, you think it is. Right, but these, I want to talk about the, and again, I only, when do you get a chance to talk with Dennis McKenna? So forgive me if I seem a little too excited, but these blueprints, these technologies, these specific geometries that do appear to be more than you're looking at some undulating kaleidoscopic form, you're seeing what appears to be intentional information that it does not necessarily fit into your abilities to understand. Like in the same way when I was a kid, I would open a book and see language, and I had no idea what it was, but I knew it meant something. You knew it had meaning, and it is, it is a lot like that. I, you know, I mean, I agree with you. I, I tell people sometimes, I just feel like I work for the plants, you know, I don't, I don't feel like I'm being used or I'm not a pawn, I'm actually, I'm really a pawn. I'm a, I mean, let's call it a collaborator, because I feel like it is important to bring awareness of these medicines to people, and also in a responsible way to, you know, urge them, yes, these are very worthwhile. They have their dangers. If you approach it with a modicum of common sense and caution, you can use them and you can learn a great deal, and I just feel like that's the position I find myself in. If I happen to be somebody that people want to hear talk about this, okay, I feel like that is fulfilling a certain mission, and it's not necessarily the one I chose. It's like I say, the plants have their own agenda, and I really do think, people don't think enough about that, that what we're really talking about here, relationships with these natural ones, natural medicines anyway, is a kind of symbiosis, and, you know, indigenous people have the idea that they call these things plant teachers, and they are plant teachers. They teach, you learn from them, and in the indigenous worldview, they are intelligent entities, and again, I agree, they are intelligent entities, but their intelligence presents itself in a way that's a little different than you and I are talking to each other, but they don't really speak language. They speak more in gestalt or sort of, you know, revelations, or they speak in a language of understanding that is not linguistic, that's not verbal, but however they communicate, they do appear to communicate, or they are able to trigger processes in your brain that, you know, present themselves as they come from you, but they present themselves as not you, something different, and the jury's still out, I think, whether, you know, these things really bring out a part of yourself that, you know, appears not to be you, that you can then have a conversation with, or whether there really is a dimension out there of these entities that have a great deal to tell us and want to tell us, you know. Well, I think, just pragmatically, it makes more sense to, like, just get rid of the cognitive dissonance that comes from trying to understand how in the name of God, the mind that you've grown up with is spitting out this incredible information, because that, you're like, I don't know me, or I don't know me, but I know, and I know I have pretty good dreams, but when I see, when I have seen in the past, when I have followed the five dried gram advice, which I will never do again, oh really, okay, and I've seen that world, it is, I just gave up the inside outside, or I gave up the idea of, like, oh, this must be some projection of some, I guess I must have a tree gnome inside of me, I guess, I guess there must be tree gnomes that live inside of my subconscious that will stand at the edge of trees and glare at me. No, I don't believe, I don't buy it, I just don't buy that, it didn't feel like me, it wasn't me, it was like looking at a butterfly or something, and so I think it's a, an external for, and again, all one ultimately, but for now, I'm sitting across from you, we live in a dimension where there are others, it is, I think it's an other, and I think that there's a usefulness in overcoming the stigma of saying that out loud, this is an external, this is an entity, it's an intelligence, you can call it an alien, whatever it is, because the moment that we start looking at it through that lens, then you can just do the same thing that you do with any other external thing, try to talk to it, try to re, try to, and this is what I, this, I apologize for this rant, it's leading me to a question. Don't, do you think that it is a possible, do you think that it's possible that a technology will emerge that allows us to, for the first time, capture these, for the sake, what we call hallucinations right now? Do you think that we will near a, we're close to a point where I can take a person, give them five dried grams, and then capture it in some way? Capture their dream in some way? Yes. I think we're, I think it's possible, but I think we're probably a few decades away from that. Decades! I mean, the next step is to just upload your entire consciousness into silicon, and I don't know if that's possible, but again, I, I don't know that it's impossible either. I mean, I, but this is not a technology that we can do right now, and it may be that it can't be done. I mean, we're working in an area where, again, we have to be very careful about these terms, you know, that we run, that we, that we unconsciously use without thinking of them, like consciousness. What is consciousness, like inside, outside, and all those things, it's very hard to think about this stuff in a way that's clear because we have such baggage of preconceptions about it, you know. But what I was saying before is the, the, I mean, the bottom line is there is nothing that we experience that does not come through these filters. Right. And our brain is an active partner in whatever we experience. So we live inside this model that the brain creates for us because it's more comfortable. We live, essentially, in a hallucination. And, but the hallucination is useful because if we actually saw the world as it really was, it would not look anything like this, and physics tells us this. Right. You know, if we can believe our instruments, and of course we have to remember our instruments also transfer their message through our sensory neural interface, but the instruments say, you know, this is not a solid table. This is not at all what it looks like. This is, this is something that your brain has created to make it possible to navigate in this, in this reality. Right. But the ultimate nature of that reality we do not understand, you know. It doesn't really matter in a certain way as long as we understand this, you know. We may not be able to ultimately understand, you know, to see reality undistorted. There's always a filter, a lens of some kind. It's like being at an optician's, you know, and they can change the focus. Psychedelics are kind of like that. You know, yeah, you can change the channel. You can change the lens, the color, the focal length and all that. You're looking at things differently, but it's still the same reality. You've just, you've just distorted the filters a little bit. Right. You know, and that's, and we find that very useful because you understand things about, you encounter aspects about that reality that normally you would overlook. Well, this is, so if you look at the evolutionary process of things, and I, you know, I think about pre eyeball times, you know, no eyes, nothing on planet earth. I don't know for sure, but maybe there was a time when nothing on earth had any way to process photons, to turn photons into color. Right. And, and so certainly something through some mutation, who knows, starts processing photons somehow. I don't know, you know, you know, these, it's a slow, slow process, millions of years. I don't know, but there must have been a period in time where there were McKenna versions of fish that were saying, listen, we have witnessed a thing outside the planet. Kind of ourselves that appears to be color. It's something we theoretically could imagine might exist, but we're experiencing it. And there might, if fish could talk back then, which I'm pretty sure they could, fish, the other fish would be like, shut the fuck up hippie. What are you talking about? We're trying to get some sleep over here when you quit raising. Yeah. But it's important to remember that the thing that the process, that the processing photons, in other words, photoreceptors in evolution go happen way before there were animals as such or mammals or anything. I mean, it was, it was, it was plants and the precursors of plants that figured it out. You know, the most primitive photoreceptors are, you know, found, I mean, even plants, they predate plants, but you know, light energy, it's just a form of electromagnetic energy, a certain part of the spectrum, but it permeates the environment. So naturally, if you're an organism evolving in that environment, it's to your, you know, it's to your advantage to be able to perceive that energy and in some ways even utilize that energy like plants do for photosynthesis. I mean, plants have mastered this process of photosynthesis. Thank God, because one of the, one of the main byproducts of photosynthesis is oxygen. The other is complex organic compounds, which they spin out and they don't have to worry about having enough energy to do organic synthesis because they have a way to harness the energy of the sun and they're unlimited really in what they can do. So they can become very creative chemists and it's just fundamental to, you know, those two processes, sequestering carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, that's because carbon dioxide is one of the reactants of photosynthesis. Oxygen happens to be the byproduct. Right. Lucky for us. Thank God. Not so lucky for organisms a few billion years ago because they were anaerobic and to them oxygen was a caustic corrosive toxin. That was one of the first, that was one of the great extinctions, right? That was in fact one of the great extinctions and that's why many, that was why they think now in evolution many cells that were organisms essentially anaerobic had to form endosymbiotic relationships with cells that were not sensitive to oxygen so they became mitochondria and cellular organelles and they have their own DNA, they have their own genetic lineage. So it's good evidence that these were once free living organisms that took refuge in other cells. Wild. You know, so that's, that's what you're looking at there is the evolutionary conscious consequences of when oxygen first started to appear in the atmosphere as a result of photosynthesis. Right. So, well this, to get back to the idea of photoreceptors and the, you know, again, I'm just a podcaster so I do not understand evolutionary biology but I theorized there must have been a point where photoreceptors were quite rudimentary, maybe non-existent. I don't know if the single cell organisms were photoreceptive. Well some were, eventually they were. I mean the first organisms that developed photoreceptors, you can be sure they were unicellular organisms. It's something that happened very early in evolutionary history. You know, the primitive eye or the photoreceptor is the precursor to the eye essentially and eyes or photoreceptors have arisen from independently in different phylogenetic lines. It's not like there's one precursor to the eye. Right. There are actually multiple precursors. Well the comparison I'm trying to make is, is it possible that psychedelics are the beginning or, it's not beginning, we've been taking psychedelics for theoretically the entire history of our species but is it possible. A long, long time. Yeah. Is it possible that psychedelics are opening us up to another kind of energetic source that we're only just now learning how to utilize because so, you know, you read Steve Jobs talking about LSD being so monumentally important to his creative process and I'm sure that there are many closeted scientists and innovators who have also had, who have seen the blueprints and in some way or another brought them into the world and made them work in some way or another. So I guess my question for you is, is it possible that this thing that we're all experiencing is another version of photoreceptivity, that we are coming into contact with a new energetic form or an energetic form that as of yet is underutilized by our species? Well, I don't know. I don't know if it's that. I think that, you know, I think that on the, on the, on the species level, you know, psychedelics interact with the individual. Right. I mean the quintet, the psychedelic experience is quintessentially something that happens to a person. It's an individual experience. But on the species level, it's changing consciousness in terms of our perceptions about what reality is, right. Like, indeed, going back to the, where we started this conversation, the reason we wanted to get mushrooms out to the people, give this technology into many people's hands was essentially to, you know, it led to, essentially to sharing our discovery, sharing what had happened to us at La Churera. But it created in society a more widespread sort of consensus that, yeah, there is another dimension out there. You know, it's the world is not what it seems. There's another dimension. You can take mushrooms and visit that dimension. You don't have to believe in it. You don't have to believe Terry or Denny. Try it for yourself. Here's the means to do that. Right. It's a full report and report back, you know, because we were trying to validate our own experiences. And the world did. The world took mushrooms and said, yeah, those McKenna boys, that was what was, that was right. That was what was going on. Yes. And I think now, and Steve Jobs and other people that have had insights about, you know, both technology, but also biology, I think that, you know, removing these filters that let you look at biological phenomena in novel ways leads to insight. And there's a couple of Nobel prizes. You know, Kerry Mullis is one of the more famous ones, guy who invented the PCR polymerase chain reaction, which is a huge discovery and genetics that essentially revolutionized molecular biology. It's a way to take a tiny amount of DNA and amplify it. So you can amplify it and then you can work, you can run whole genome sequences and so on. Does this have something to do with CRISPR? No, this is way before CRISPR. CRISPR is similar to that, but it's new. But it's a very important discovery that basically made genetic engineering possible, you know, that you could amplify nucleic acids in this way. And Kerry Mullis was completely upfront about the fact that LSD, his experience with LSD, gave him the insight to make this discovery for which he got the Nobel Prize. And he announced at his acceptance that, you know, it was LSD that laid me, and he said, it really had let me get down among the molecules and see what was, how was working. So it wasn't just a hallucination of some guy on LSD who was stoned, you know, because the thing is, the insight, the understanding held up the next day. It was like, oh, that was a bunch of crap, you know, no, actually, this was a real novel understanding of reality that LSD facilitated. And I think that goes on all the time. I saw recently a interesting documentary about Nikola Tesla. You're probably familiar with him. The thing about Tesla, he did not take psychedelics, as far as I know, but he was a complete visionary. He saw machines in his vision, and he saw these machines and how to build them. That's pretty amazing, you know? And so maybe he had, you know, his own internal psychedelics or whatever, but he was able to do this. And this is a fundamental quality of what sets us as primates as humans apart from other primates, and really is, I think, the crux of the thing. We can visualize something abstract in our heads, a painting, or a piece of music, or a machine, right? Or whatever it might be, a better arrowhead, or a better computer chip, these start out as internal visualizations, ideas, right? What are ideas if not simply hallucinations? You know, you have an idea of something. I know how to build this thing. You build it. Suddenly it exists in the so-called real knock on the table world, which is no more real than your internal world, but you have an iPhone sitting in front of you that does stuff for you, you know? So this is what we can do. We can take an abstraction and turn it into a reality. The abstraction comes from that part of the brain that, from where creative ideas come from. And I think psychedelics stimulate that part of the brain. And this is where it gets interesting, because at this place, this is where we, so, you know, and this is, again, I've been massively influenced by you and your brother, and this is the, again, it's like we, in the movies, you know, or even in conspiracy theories with a great conspiracy theory, one of my faves, Roswell Alien, Roswell UFO crashes. We got some kind of technology from that crash. That technology is now, basically, all technology is a fungal growth that came from this Roswell crash. It's spreading all over the planet from Roswell. But really, if the ideas, we have these moments of illumination that create the innovation that brings technology into this dimension. And if psychedelics are opening up your eyes to another dimension, and if you have come up with an idea of some inspiration or even a poem or a book or a guidebook that was inspired in that dimension, then I think what we're dealing with is a true alien technology. I think we are seeing human beings becoming these outflow conduits that are, from time to time, a lot of the times, I'm certainly the outflow conduit that I am. I'll show you some journal entries about the crap I come up with. Definitely no genetic stuff coming out of this conduit. But some of us, you being one of them, are popping or bringing things into this dimension from another place that is creating true shifts in our society. Yeah, but the thing is, it's coming from some place. It's coming from the imagination is where it's coming from, which is another way of saying the imagination is like this multimedia playroom that everybody has inside their brains where they can come up with ideas. I know the concept that, well, all this technology that we have came from Roswell, or this is really alien technology in some ways. I don't like that, and I don't like it for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the technology that supposedly came from Roswell was pretty damn primitive. Okay, fiber optics. This is not a big deal. The transistor. This is crude. This is crude stuff, man. You telling me that these spaceships were using transistors? I mean, we can build chips that have a billion transistors in a square nanometer. They were just crappy spaceships. They were just primitive. That's why it crashed. And then the other aspect of it is essentially we're saying we're not capable of thinking of these things. We have to get it from some alien source. I don't agree. I mean, we're perfectly capable of coming up with these ideas. And we do and we did. I mean, maybe there was Roswell, maybe not. But I think that, you know, we, you know what I'm saying? We're able to come up with amazing ideas and manifest what's reality. Yes, absolutely. Humans are amazing. And I don't mean to denigrate the potential of the human brain or the human innovation. But, you know, earlier in the conversation, you're referring to a collaboration between you and these plant teachers. And so I think as part of... And this collaboration with the plant teachers, you know, it happens at the species level and the individual level. You know, we experience it at the individual level. But I think for the plant teachers, they relate to humans as a species. You know what I'm saying? I think to them it's more of a species level thing. To us, it's like the, you know, the ayahuasca, the mushroom or whatever is having a conversation with us. It's sort of like, you know, interesting analogy. But you know, the movie Her, that's interesting because the guy formed a relationship with this super sophisticated artificial intelligence, something like Ciri. But like Ciri would be if it actually worked. And then there comes a point where he says, you know, and he begins to feel that she's very special to him. They have a special relationship. And then he asks the question, how many people are you communicating with right now? And there's something like, oh, about 860,000. He's like, totally crushed. You were carried on affairs with 100, you know, 800,000 people. So we're going to be faced with situations like that, I think, especially as AI gets truly sophisticated. Remember, it's still a projection of us. It's something that came out of these heads, this bunch of mush up here. But you know, I, you know what, I think that what that the okay, it came out of our heads. But sometimes I mean, and again, I love this is so refreshing. I really love what you're saying. And it's it's pro human. And I think it's realistic. But I still think that this that we have been waiting for the spaceship to come from the sky. And the thing is, and this is not me, this comes from you guys is this thing is coming from inside of us. Now where it's origination point is, is it some quantum, I don't know, some some quantum quark, a neutrino inside of us triggering a chain reaction that results in an epiphanous moment where Tesla sees the alternating current or whatever. I don't know. I don't know. But yeah, it comes from, yeah, the spaceships don't come from the from outside. I agree. And we build the spaceships. And we build them out of ourselves, you know, and that's essentially what we're trying to do at Lacherera, you know, and what what alchemists and other people have been trying to do, build this transcendent object, this ultimate object, which we understand to be something biological, some kind of union of matter and mind. Yes, that's what we were trying to do is to make an object, call it the philosopher's stone, call it the UFO, call it the time machine, all these things are metaphors for this transcendental object, which is us and is both inside and outside. We were trying to create a, we were trying to build a UFO out of our own DNA, our own nervous system, out of a mushroom, out of sound, out of, and we damn near got there. No, you got there. You got there. Well, no, we didn't. Or at least what we predicted was going to happen didn't happen. But other things didn't match your prediction. But you, if you, and I think you are aware of, okay, and I'm just going to, I'm going to, I just forgive me if I'm the blow will smoke here. But if a UFO was to go zinging through Oakland, or and go, go all the way from Oakland to New York, it zings across the country, everyone sees it, no doubt about it must ship straight out of the book of Ezekiel, this thing's spinning shapes and like, it's an it's a UFO, right? Yeah. I think within a week of this thing happening, everyone gets it on camera, maybe a month. Yeah, there's that thing that happened that time, we got some tapes of it, people like, well, that's some kind of government thing. I don't know what it is. People forget. Well, this kind of stuff has happened exactly as you describe it. But what I'm, the point I'm getting at here is you had a thing come through you and your brother, right? And it shot through the subjective consciousness and continues to shoot through the subjective consciousness of a fairly large percentage of our species. So that's the difference. That's the difference. So when you say it didn't, I don't know that you, I just don't think it worked the way you thought it was going to work. And I must ask you, why do you keep saying we, you talk about this in the past tense, as though you have stopped the experiment, as though this is over for you, this bringing this thing into this reality, has it really stopped for you? Well, that's a good question. I haven't stopped thinking about it. I haven't stopped. The thing is, I'm not, I'm not, there is nothing to be gained. In fact, it's not possible to replicate the experiment of Lacherera. And in order to, in order to perform the experiment of Lacherera, the unintended consequence, because what we expected would happen did not happen. What did happen was that we went totally bonkers, you know, for two weeks at least. And some would say for a lot longer than that, some would say we're still bonkers. And I'm not particularly interested in driving myself insane. I don't think that, you know, in the first place, what we did at Lacherera was not an experiment. We call it the experiment at Lacherera, but experiments have to have controlled variables and, you know, a real experiment if you want to use that word. It was more like the ritual at Lacherera or something. That's what it was. And things happen. But you know, to speak to this, it's interesting. I read recently, maybe you've heard of it, I read a book called, that came out, it was called Supernatural, two words. Supernatural, a new vision of the unexplained. And this was published a couple of years ago, and it was published by, of all people, Whitley Strieber. Okay. You know who he is, right? The alien abduction proctologist from Betelgeuse, that guy. Was he really a proctologist? Well, anal pro. I think the aliens were the proctologists. The aliens were the proctologists. That's what I mean. But the way that what happened to him is represented in the media is really unfair. He's very much maligned as a screwball and just a nutcase, right? Turns out, he's not a nutcase. Actually, he's very scientific in his approach to these things happen to him. Crazy batshit, crazy stuff happens to him. He, when you speak to him personally, he says, I don't know what the fuck is going on. I mean, he doesn't say it that way. He's not that kind of, he wouldn't use those terms. Basically, he says, I do not understand it. All I can tell you is these things are going on. It seems to have aspects of alien contact. I'm not saying that's what it is. You know, I'm saying that these things happen to me, and he seems to be a magnet for these just very odd phenomena that sort of coalesce around him. Yes. And the way this came about, I'm going somewhere with this narrative. The way this came about, I was in the camp of people that knew about his stuff, hadn't read his stuff much, but hadn't really read his stuff. Kind of dismissed his whole shtick as just crazy, alien, contactee, malarkey. And then last year, I was invited to a symposium in Hawaii from actually a podcaster, Jeremy Vaney. Maybe you'll know him. He does a podcast called Perotopia. Cool. I'd been on it, and he invited me to come to this symposium with Whitley Strieber. Jeremy now lives on the Big Island, and I said, well, I don't want to, you know, this guy is a nutball. I don't want to be associated with him. Why would I come, you know? But then I found out, he said, well, you know, did you know about this book? This book, you know, Supernatural, was written by him and Jeffrey Kreipel. Jeffrey Kreipel is a professor of mythology and comparative religions at Rice University. And I know Jeffrey. I've been to his class. I've given seminars, and I thought, these two have written a book together? Wow. That's interesting, because I know Jeffrey is not in that case. Okay. And so I told Jeremy. I said, if Jeffrey comes to the symposium and Whitley comes, I'll come, you know, because I respect Jeffrey's work. Right. And he got him, and we all three went out to this symposium. And in the meantime, I read this book, and I read some other things that Whitley had written. And we had an amazing discussion there, because I was sort of the guy bringing up the flag, carrying the flag for psychedelics. Because I was saying, you know, you guys, you're all about this paranormal phenomena. Jeff looks at it as an academic, and in terms of mythology, and so a lot of his work is on superheroes. What their mythical role is in contemporary society, and Whitley just has his stories, right? Right. But they're both terrified of psychedelics, and they've never had any experience with psychedelics. And I say, this is crazy, because this is the third leg of the stool. Yeah. Psychedelics are models for these experiences. And if you want to really understand what is going on, what's happening to you, you have to take psychedelics. It's almost required if you call yourselves scientific investigators. Yes. This is the elephant in the room that you're not acknowledging, you know. And then, but interestingly, and they still haven't quite heard it, but I'll actually... So in this book, Supernatural, in the latter chapters, they go on to speculate on what is this phenomenon. What is the physical basis of all this phenomenon? And they are sort of leaning toward the idea that, you know, there is some kind of existence, survival of the soul after death. And it can actually physically intervene and manifest itself in physical ways, like with UFOs. Yeah. But then I came upon a chapter in the book, which was titled, The Soul as a UFO. Wow. And it just dropped my jaw to see this and the way they were discussing it, because I was going to say, you're absolutely right, guys. And guess what? The mushroom was downloading the blueprints to build this damn thing. Wow. You know, that's exactly what we were talking about. Wow. And so I recommend that book to people that are interested in this. I'll check it out. Keep your prejudices against Whitley in check. I just read it objectively and honestly. I was impressed with the man's honesty and humility. I mean, he was not, he was just saying, these things have happened to me. They've happened to me all my life. You know, he told me, I wish they didn't, because they've made my life miserable in some way. Right. You know, I'm a public laughing stock. I've been tormented by these entities or demons or phenomena or whatever they are. He has not had a happy life. Right. You know, he just would wish he could be an ordinary schmuck. And he's not, because he's had these things. We're going to go at this again, actually at this place, before this conference starts at Turingham, they're having a private conference there, second one. They've had a private conference previously about DMT. And the question, the question of the conference was basically, what are the entities on DMT and are those real entities and so on? I'm sorry, let me stop you there. This time Whitley and Jeffrey are going to be part of the... This, this? Yeah. Wait, okay, so you've handed me... No, that's a different conference. This is the one that will happen immediately after that. Okay, so you're saying Whitley is some, is part of a conference trying to explore what are these manifestations in DMT? Yeah. He recommended Whitley and Jeffrey's book to Anton Bilton, who owns Turingham Hall, that kind of where these seminars go on. And I said, read this book. He read the book. And he said, yeah, we have to invite these people. Wow. Can you explain what this is? This looks incredible. Ethnopharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs, too. Now, this, this is much more pedestrian, not paranormal, a fairly button down scientific conference, but an interesting one. So, and this is, let me give you the back story on this. In 1967, in San Francisco, there was a conference called Ethnopharmacologic Search for Psychoactive Drugs. It was organized and paid for by the National Institute of Mental Health. Right. The U.S. Government-sponsored conference, private conference, and all the big guys in the field at the time were there. So, Shulgan was there. Shultes was there. What year was this? 1967, at the height of the summer of love, right? Yeah, okay. And, but it was a private conference, and they put out this symposium volume from the conference. And that was basically what came out of the conference, but that was a landmark publication. Certainly, it was a landmark publication in my life because I got my hands on a copy, and it was like, it opened up the whole field of ethno-pharmacology to me, and it was like, wow, this is what I want to do, right? Cool. So, very important publication in the literature on psychedelics, psychoactive plants. The original plan was that there would be a follow-up conference every 10 years to sort of assess the state of the art and what's happening. Yeah. Well, then along came the war on drugs. Right. The government became totally embarrassed that they ever had anything to do with something like this. Nothing happened. 2017 is the 50th anniversary. Cool. So, we're going to do the second ethno-pharmacologic search. Wow. For psychoactive drugs. And it will be a semi-closed conference. It will be at this place in the UK. This is incredible. What does that mean, semi-closed? It means that there'll be only a small number of people physically attending. Okay, I see. But it will be live-streamed on Facebook. You've got to keep people like me out wandering around. It's the aliens, man! People like you would probably get in. Oh, cool. Yeah. And we will publish a symposium proceedings from this. Beautiful. In the spirit of the first one. In fact, we're going to publish the first one and the second one together as a collector's edition. Beautiful. Box set. How cool. And pre-sell those and finance the conference through those sales. So, those are available now. You can order them now, but you don't have to wait until the end of the year because people come, they'll present their thing, and then they have to give a full paper that they submit that will go into the book. This is at ESPD50.com. Yeah. Ethno ESPD. Ethno Pharmacologic Search for Psychoactive Drugs. Wow. That's where the ESPD comes from. This is going to be incredible. This is amazing. I think it's a conference that I've wanted to do ever since the 30th anniversary, but I never came together. This time it's coming together. What is Buckinghamshire, England like? It's a lovely place. It's English country house, estates, Turingham Hall, which you can look up on Wikipedia actually. It's got an interesting history, but it's Downton Abbey. Everybody knows Downton Abbey. This place, Downton Abbey could have been filmed there. This is amazing. It's an incredible building, an incredible venue for all of this. We've got some fantastic people coming. Who do you have coming? Well, so if you go on the website, we should have our schedule up. We've got, so far, we've got Dave Nichols. We've got Mark Plotkin, who's well known as an ethno botanist. We've got Ken Alper, probably the world's expert on iboga and ibogaine. We've got Stacey Schaefer, very well known for her work on peyote. We've got Manolo Torres has done a lot of work on the archaeology of both DMT snuffs and also ayahuasca. So we have quite, you know, we've got me. I'm giving a talk, a couple talks actually. Amazing. So it's going to be a good conference. People can participate by livestream or they can come and pay far too much money to physically attend. But we're welcome. We're happy to welcome them. I think it'd be worth it. This is June 6th to 8th. This is coming right up. June 6th to 8th. ESPD50.com. The links are going to be at my website, Dennis. Please do. Yeah. Please go look at it. There's much more detail about sort of the genesis of this conference and the original conference. And so please, you know, look at the website and if you think all you have to do is sign up for the livestream and hopefully by the book, although since Joe Rogan was kind enough to have him, I can mention him on your podcast. I was on a few days ago and a lot of people are already ordering books. I'm sure. That doesn't mean that people had orders. Millions of people. Well, I don't know about millions. I'd be happy if I got 200 people to buy books because I'd pay for the conference. Go to this. Buy this book. Be part of this movement that's happening right now. I think that just getting to hang out with you and be around all of these people here at this incredible conference that we're at right now, it makes me feel so excited and hopeful for the world. And man, I know it's a hacky thing to say because you could say this at any time in human history maybe, but what better time to have hope in the world than right now? Well, it's better than despair, you know, and there's so many reasons to despair. But if we give into that, then we really do lose hope. There really is no hope. I am basically an optimist. I feel we are in a heap of shit in this world. I don't think anyone would disagree with that. But we're very clever beings and I think our cleverness in large ways got us into this mess and it's going to get us out of this mess. Stupidity will not get us out of this mess and that's what dismayed me about the current political climate that willful stupidity is on the ascendant and people who are actually you know, I mean, they're stupid, but they're also proud of it and that's the dangerous thing. Well, it's the most dangerous combo. It's like God of you, the worst combo. Right. Well, because it's not going to come up with any solutions. This is why it's so dismaying that, you know, like on the environmental front, you know, we're making real progress and to see all these measures rolled back is very dismaying. You know, the current political set Germany is marching into the future with their eyes firmly fixed on the rearview mirror. It's not going to happen. You cannot go back to the six to the fifties and nor would you want to, you know, but they don't seem to get it. So, you know, and what do we do? Yes. What do we do? Well, my own feeling is that, you know, these plant medicines are the most powerful tools that we have right now to catalyze global shifts in consciousness. And that's what has to happen if we're going to get out of this mess. First we have to recognize there's a problem and they will bring that into focus. And then we have to recognize that there are solutions and they will bring that into focus because of this figure to ground effect that they have bringing the background forward. The background is that we live in a natural world. We live in nature and we think we're separate from nature, but we're not. So that's the fundamental perception we have to we have to accept is that we're not in control. Actually, nature is in control. And if we don't get our act straightened out, it's not going to go well for us, you know, or the planet. Although I think the planet is incredibly resilient, but I like that George Carlin joke. The planet's going to be fine. The planet will be fine. Humans are fucked. Humans are fucked. That's a great Carlin joke. That pretty much says it, yeah, but it does not have to be. You know, we need wisdom and we need compassion and, you know, a lot of the mess that we find ourselves is because our cleverness, our inventiveness is out of sync with our wisdom. You know, so we're very clever at making technologies that are potentially fantastically beneficial and incredibly destructive if they're not used the right way. We have to have, we have to develop the wisdom to use them and we have to learn how to essentially construct a moral compass around this use because these things can't be used thoughtlessly or destructively because of their destructive power. But what does the individual do here? I mean, I 100% agree with you. And yet I think as the individual, I mean, if I could operate on the collective level and become the mind of my species, great. But how does an individual person hearing this, how to, how to wait, what happens to my own response? And I think a lot of responses of people in our community is these medicines are the best tools, the best defense and the best, I think of them as, as the bio weapons of the, of the counterculture of the, of the psychedelic movement. Yes. And introducing people to these experiences, bringing people to these plant medicine opportunities, teach them how to grow these plants, prepare them, use them, share them around. It's a quiet revolution. It's not, you know, they have all the guns, all the money and all that. We've got the plants. Yeah, but you have a plan. You can't lose. Some people listening, they don't. Like I live in New York and I know that there's possibilities of like taking ayahuasca even there. Dennis, what about people who are listening and they, and they hear this and like, I don't have access to any cut to this, these plant medicines. What, what, what are they to do? Well, that's actually not true, you know, with a little bit of effort, they could get access to it. I mean, in some sense, that's what the mushroom technology, the growing technology was. It was like, you can get the spores, you don't need anything special, you'd go to the grocery store and buy the stuff you need to grow the mushrooms. This is, these things are, you need a little bit of skill, which you can learn by reading the book and then you grow the mushrooms. Same way, there are lots of places on the internet where you can order seeds and cuttings of psychedelic plants. Technically, they're illegal, but they'll sell them to you and you can grow those and you can trade them with your neighbors and get into gardening and, you know, we've reached a point where growing a garden is one of the most revolutionary things you can do, especially if you have the right plants in them, but, but any plant is the right plant, growing any, every plant that we utilize as a species, it doesn't have to be psychoactive. It's a symbiote with us in, in some way. We, we cultivate it because it's valuable to us. It's great for the plant that doesn't have to compete in the world of natural selection. It just has to submit to the artificial selection that we will impose on it, but it's got a free ride, you know, as long as it's under our wing until we completely destroy the planet and then we all go down. But for the interim, it's a good deal for the plant and a good deal for us, you know, and we think often we think, well, you know, we are doing the other major, I think, sort of perception for me and a lot of people who take psychedelics is that, you know, the, the, this whole thing that you monkeys are not running the show. You think you're in control, you're not in control. Nature is in control and a good thing for us because nature is what's keeping the whole thing going. The plants are in control and, you know, you know, Michael Pollan writes very eloquently about that sort of thing, about corn, about how corn has completely taken over the human species and turned us into willing slaves, you know, is corn called, we're cultivating corn? No, corn is cultivating us and corn has conquered the world as it adapts itself to the industrial petroleum based monocultural technology of industrial agriculture. Holy shit, that is so crazy, man. Oh man. You've, you've read his stuff, right? No. Michael Pollan? I have not. No, you need to interview Michael Pollan. He's here. Undoubtedly he's here. I haven't run into him, but because now he started to write about psychedelics. He's very interested in psychedelics. I can recommend two articles he wrote. It'd be great. You can Google it. One is called The Intelligent Plant. Great article, great summary of the, you know, the idea of plant intelligence was dismissed by science five years ago, not so much anymore. Do you think his last name is really Pollan? It is Pollan. It's not spelled like, like plant, it's P-O-L-L-A-N. Most people know his two famous books, The Botany of Desire and the Omnivore's Dilemma. He was a food writer for the New York Times. I know the Omnivore, I know, I've heard of those two books. Yeah, it's a great book. They're both great books. Now he's writing, he wrote, he's beginning to get interested in psychedelics. He's writing a book. He wrote another article in The New Yorker called The, I think it was, it was about mushrooms. It was called The Trip Treatment or something like that. Great work. He's so good with words and he's really speaking to these issues. I think that your advice, I think just putting a, you know, I just got a bunch of houseplants and put them around my house and the effect is so profound and it changes everything. By the way, Dennis, we're probably over time. Over time and you wanted to go to... Yeah, what time is it? It's 5.23. 5.20. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm on East Coast time. 2.23. It's been six hours. I got you. Well, the talk I wanted to see is probably over anyway, so that's okay. Sorry. No, don't apologize. Thank you for letting folks know about this conference. No problem. I think it's going to be significant. But we also have here, and just, I think people are going to want to, this seems incredible. Can I announce this too? Please, absolutely. So we've got Journey of the Soul, an Iowa retreat with Dennis McKenna and Weyra. Weyra. Weyra. He's the curandero I've been working with for about the last four, since 2012. Oh my God. We were doing these retreats in the Sacred Valley, and on average twice a year. How many people come? Well, usually they have small groups, anywhere between 15 and 20. And for a long time, we were doing it at a lovely place there called Wilcatica, a guest house in the Urabamba. The owner decided that, as she put it, the wild energy of ayahuasca is not compatible with the soft energy of Andean medicines, which I told her. Well, that's ridiculous. But anyways, she decided not to let us continue at Wilcatica, but we found another venue, and we're going to continue. Because the work that Weyra is, and I, I guess, by facilitating have been able to do has been really rewarding. People, you know, how they talk about, like how Roland described, people come down and they have very meaningful life-changing experiences, and it's what's wonderful to facilitate that. We've got two things. There's a 10-day option where we basically play tourist for the first two or three days. We go to Machu Picchu and other archaeological sites, and then we go to the, we end up at the retreat center, and we have seven days of ceremony, or people can, you know, three ceremonies within seven days, I should say. Not seven in a row, that's too much. That's too much. We, we believe in integration. You need a day between in order to integrate. So you can sign up for just that, just the seven days, or the ten days. Wow! I urge people, if they've never been to this area, the extra three days are really worth it. For sure. Machu Picchu and these other Inca sites are just incredible. This seems like the coolest event of all time. How is this not already sold out? Ten years? Well, I've only started to, for a long time we weren't advertising it. You know, we were, it was word with mouth. Now, I'm beginning to advertise it a little bit because we're not working, you know, through the, through the guest house anymore. I think it will probably sell. Of course! Really accepting 15 people. Yeah, this is sold out. This guy's www.symbiolivesciences.com. I'll be visiting that website to check out too. This sounds like heaven. Yeah. Look at the events page. There should be an events page on www.symbiolivesciences.com. Well, guys, go to this. This is crazy that you're doing, I mean, crazy in the good way that you're doing this. Thank you so much for coming on the show, Dennis. Thank you, Duncan. I've really looked forward for a long time to talking to you. You're kind of a superstar yourself. No way! Yes, you are, brother. This has been an enlightening conversation and I'm very grateful to you for your time. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow, cool. That was Dennis McKenna, friends.

Now, everybody, please welcome one of the smartest, funniest people living on planet Earth today, the great Johnny Pemberton. Welcome to Dunkin' Trussell on YouTube. Johnny, welcome back to the DTFH. I'm so excited to have you on. I know that a lot of people probably don't know what you've been up to and it's just crazy to me that you're finally able to talk about the fact that you have shifted careers and are now an executive at Halliburton. How did that fucking happen, man? But what about comedy? You're so funny. Why? They have a huge comedy program inside the executive suites at Halliburton. It's all insulated. It's like being on one of those cruise ships. You know what I mean? You mean everything you need to stand up? Yeah, there's a whole scene there. There's multiple clubs. In the facility? Yeah, there's like an underground, sort of like a black box, 45 seat theater. 45. That's cool. I guess to work on beds. There's also a 250 seat sort of a proscenium stage, sort of like cobs in San Francisco. And there's a 150 seat, kind of like a, it's more like a classic mid-sized club. You'd see like in the south or something like that. It's great. It's awesome. A lot of cool comics, you know, on the scene there. That's totally not what I, that's completely not how I pictured the job. I thought the, I picture, I was just trying to picture you like in a suit or whatever, like designing weapons. You can wear a suit if you want to. They actually have a, on Tuesday nights, it's a eighties night. And so it's like, it's like all you do your hack stuff. It's like a throwback. It's really fun. But you, now the other thing that I think is a little weird about it, no offense, man. I'm happy whenever anybody. No offense. Don't say that. I'm not going to get offended. Okay. You can't offend me. I'm happy for you. I love you. I want you to be happy, but. Right. I just, when you told me it didn't, it didn't make sense. I guess now it's kind of making sense, but still like what, what about, you know, you're, you're not only one of the funniest comics I know, you're also a really great actor. Like, yeah, like what about that part of your life? Like, is there acting? I mean, there's, there's also the black box theater. You can do plays there. There's all kinds of stuff. It's really open to doing whatever you want. It's a real, um, you know, what they say is you can make of what we have, how you will. It's your, it's yours to make of what we have, how you will. Yeah. You can make what we have, how you will. You can make what we have, how you will. That's they're saying. Mm hmm. It's a circle. It's in a circle too. You can make what we have. How you will. Seems like an anagram or something. I don't know. I wouldn't think about it too much. No, I'm not going to stop thinking about it. Don't think about it too much. Wait, hold on. You can make. What is it? You can make, you can make what we have. You can make of what we have, how you will. You can make of what we have, how you will. Yeah. Hold on. You can make of what we have, how you will. A lot of W's, a lot of Y's. Hold on. Isn't there the thing like in the Jewish Bible where every word combination? The Torah? In the Torah. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Every word combination makes a number, right? Yeah, definitely. So what is that called? That's called. It's called numerology, right? No, it's called. There's a name for it. It's called a. Hasid, Hasid, Hasidism. I'm just curious what number that adds up to what other words that that equals anyway, look, it doesn't matter. I just seems a little creep. Something about that just seems really creepy. I mean, also, what about the fact that that you're working for a company that like is making weapons? Yeah, they make weapons, but they also make great furniture. However, it makes furniture. That's how they got started. Yeah. No furniture first. That's what they call themselves. It's FF. You'll see a little tiny, tiny FF before everything they do. It says tiny FF furniture. So you're working in the furniture manufacturing part of the company. You're not working on weapons. What do you say? Welcome. They switch us around all the time. It's a revolving, you know, you're here for a little bit and you're there for a little bit. You're really all over the place. It's you're supposed to, you're not supposed to specialize because they think that that breeds like a certain type of contention among people who worked there. So they want you to just, you know, branch out, meet people. Do you, is it like a room like when you're working on weapons? Is it like a writer's room to people pitch out weapons? Or how does that even look like? What is that? Well, we have a big, we have a barbecue. It's a constant barbecue. It's been going on for about, I think 16 years straight. I was 16 years straight barbecue. Yeah. It's never, hasn't stopped yet. There's always someone there cooking like a burger or steaks, maybe smoking like a, a suckling pig, something. Maybe just some little old classic 1919 hamburgers, sliders and a tray of beef tallow, like it might just be that, you know, it's over a barbecue. That's where you pitch your weapons ideas. Yeah. You just hang out and that's the writer's room. It's just the barbecue. You don't have to eat meat too. They do have all kinds of vegetables. That's really good. Vegetarian, that's nice. Yeah. But do you, so can you share any like weapons ideas you've pitched or furniture ideas you've pitched? No. Come on. Well, let's just say, I'll say the one thing. You know how they always talk about like a, like people want to stay in their, their recliner. People don't want to leave their, a lot of people, once they sit in their recliner, they don't want to get up. Okay, right. Yeah, sure. You're not going to have to. That's so sinister. Like a recliner weapon. It's not a weapon so much as it is. I mean, what is a weapon? No, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're telling me you combined their furniture with their weapons program. That's fucking horrible. Like one part of them was great and then the other is atrocious and you went in and like made some hybrid. Like why don't we bring the two departments together? Now I didn't do it. I didn't do that. Okay. Everything was before me. I'm just a part of the, you know, it's like, what point is, is a water droplet part of the river? You know, it's kind of like hard to say. What point is the river making recliner bombs? Yeah, I don't know. That's a good question to ask. I'll bring that up with the next team barbecue. So what do you guys do? You just like parachute recliners onto the battlefield, hoping someone like sits in them or what is that's, no, that's, that's the furniture department. I mean, everything, everything does everything. Everything's like a full on. Don't say that. Don't say everything is everything. Nothing is everything. Well, nothing, everything is nothing. No, nothing is everything. Well, it's black. All the colors are none of the colors. Black is, I think it's all the colors, right? Terry is black. All the colors. No, not anymore. Hey, Michael, did Terry just ask you? Yeah. Why did you tell him that? Michael, you tell Terry that it's blacks. All the colors. Sorry about that. Oh, it is. Oh yeah. Terry just told me it's all the colors. Yeah. See, that's what I was saying. Okay. We got to cut to a commercial. We'll be right back. Okay.

And we're back. So Johnny, hey baby. You know what? I know there's like, I don't know what you can even talk about, but you're in New York right now. I'm in New York. I could see behind you the beautiful New York skyline. Are you guys about to get hit by this like super snowstorm? No, I wish we were. I'm so disappointed, man. I was really hoping that we get to actually thought about going up to Buffalo somehow, like just doing a little, a little bit of hitchhiking to get to Buffalo just to see snow. Hitchhiking to the worst snowstorm of all time. Is it people are saying this is like the literal, like there's never been anything like this. It's pretty cool. If you think about that, to me, extreme weather there, it rained here the other day, like last week. Yeah. And I was stuck. I was outside. I was trying to run an errand. Yeah. So happy. It just felt so good to have like a, I have a new rain jacket on and I'm trudging in the, the wet, having like the winds hit my face, all the water droplets and stuff. I mean, I think it's still totally a novelty to me. It's so much fun to, that's the thing about weather is nothing you can do about it, right? It's fully and totally you get to, it's the rare chance you get to just be like, well, I guess I can't go to work or well, I guess we're not going to have to do that thing. I don't want to do that. No one wants to do. That's like, I miss that so much. All that is great until the power goes out. Yeah. But if you, if you, if you're anticipating that, then you can handle it. I mean, most places have a fireplace. You should have a fireplace probably. Not most places have a fire. I guess you're right. Not most places have a fireplace, but yeah, most places have a marble lion that produces the heat generated. I'm just thinking about the last department I stayed in had a little fireplace in it. It was so cool that it had like a little, yes, an old apartment. You know, it's an old, all the new ones. They don't have fireplaces. Yeah. You're fucked if the heat goes out. You're fucked. And even if you do have a fireplace, you still have to get wood and then like, you know, so I do know what you mean where all of a sudden, you know, sometimes the weather will just say, fuck you to civilization and be like, no, we're, we're back in one AD. We're back in like, whatever you're dumb little civilization. It was cute and everything 300 years ago. And I even now we're 300 years ago now. Let's just forget all the whole electricity stuff. I like that you guys did that and everything, but we're just going to just get rid of the electricity thing. And then all of a sudden you're like, oh shit, we're like three weeks away from just, you know, going back to the way the shit was before this little like bump in history that we call the industrial revolution or technological revolution. That's what you would like. You would like it where the snow does everything but kill the power and I want it to kill the power. I would like to be thrust into that's the difference. You know what? That's the difference between someone who has kids and someone who doesn't. Yes, definitely. Someone who doesn't have kids is like, I don't need this fucking power. You got kids. You're like, man, I need my fucking noise machine. There's gonna, we need baths. We got it like this is serious. I got some old bread, a half a jar of peanut butter and a case of beer. Yeah. I got some friends. I got a bunch of rope, some blankets. God, I mean, John's got some books. The other thing whether it's like when you get that reminder of how fragile everything actually is, like you think it's so solid. You think it's just like guaranteed internet, guaranteed. Even if you're in the back of your head, you're like, I know that like sometimes this doesn't work when that shit happens. And you realize like, no, it could just be that the whole technological revolution was like a minuscule phase in human evolution. I mean, it's technically is right now. It's still very much just a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny little part of time. Like it's so everybody thinks it leads to something more like the general consensus is like this will lead to the AI, which will lead to the nanobots, which will lead to some, you know, wild alien future. But like within the conversation, very little is said about are just everything just stops working. Yeah, it gets as high as it can get. And then it all of a sudden turns to dust. Maybe that's the whole point of it is just to get to you build something so high that it falls over. Tower of Babel. Exactly. Yeah, the Tower of Babel. It's just the Tower of Babel was really a story about like, well, actually built into the sector of the universe that you're the sector of the galaxy that planet Earth is. You know, you, you weren't aware of the laws of the month is the next. Well, the laws of Samantha next says you can only build an AI to tier seven. And then your planet built it to tier eight. So yeah, we're going to do a back switch or tier, tier eight is the reset. So once you hit tier eight, it just, it's, yeah, it doesn't work. It doesn't work in this dimension to be, to be on tier eight. Yeah. If you can't figure out how to transcend, if you're particular universal, you're, you're particular incarnation can't figure out how to transcend to that dimension to accept tier eight. And it just resets and it starts all over again. Like one of those, um, like one of those, those robots that tries to do, tries to solve a maze, like, you don't want to go down super fast, hits a dead end, goes back up. It's like that kind of shit. And we're just on that robot in the maze and we hit a dead end. If we go to tier eight at the wrong incarnation. Yeah. These assumptions, right. The assumptions of that, that we've already figured out all the laws of the universe. Like we know, obviously you don't drop off a cliff, you don't put your hand in fire, but nobody knows. Like, oh, you don't fucking build an AI to that level. If you do that, you alert the, the Phenizians and they have to come and like redistrict your planet. The fucking, the donkeys show up. Yeah. Just a bunch of donkeys. Just huge dicks. Just big old donkey dicks show up and they just blast you. They're giant donkey dicks come like a wrecking ball. You are warned. Where did you not see, uh, uh, goblia techie? You did you not see the hieroglyphs or clearly on the beer mids showing not to do that? Why are you fucking talking? I didn't see anything. I mean, did you watch Graham Hancock's? I haven't watched it yet. I gotta watch that. Oh God, that's great. I don't watch it. Oh my God. He is like, this guy is like, just like riveting. He's like, he's Indiana Jones. He is the real deal. The real deal. The real deal. And the like, it's so the, to me, the crew, like there's so many creepy things about any of it, right? Regardless of like some of the, uh, what is his hypothesis. I won't spoil it, but this is about ancient civilizations. Well, yeah, it's just like there's, you know, he's really good at emphasizing that they knew how to do that. Like they knew how to build that thing, whatever it is, the snake mound, the cigarette, the whatever, but it wasn't just they did that. They knew how to precisely align it with, you know, the summer equinox or with, you know, specific planetary formations that produce insane how it's possible. Right. Like for all of us, you like have to have our Google maps on to get to the grocery store. Like they're like perfectly aligning massive slabs of stone to sort of line up with the serious, you know, like, and then, and then within that, there's all these like mythologies, which just get discounted. You're like, okay, whatever the fuck your stupid mythology is, like, great, you got the big rocks to line up with whatever the thing is, and that's great. Congratulations, but we're not going to pay attention to your reports of how you learned how to do that. That's bullshit. The stones are real, but the whole thing about the guy from the sea with the fucking info about how to do crops who says he came from a place that was destroyed by the gods because they were to disobeying the laws of the gods. Shut the fuck up. It reminds me of the whole idea. Remember a math class when like when you were like in fourth or fifth grade or whatever, when the whole thing was you have to show your work, you can't just get the answer. You have to show your work because it's a show how you got there. And if you deny all this stuff, if you deny all the mythology, but you're just looking at the results of it, you're basically acting like they just used a calculator or they didn't use a calculator at all. They did this all long hand. Somehow. And that's that's yeah, that's the that's the work is what we listen to this on this cloud formation and we notice these all these very subtle things we decided to build on them and maybe yeah, there's no way to know obviously to what extent is an intervention and what is observation, but that's like yeah, denying all the mythology of it is just completely denying the journey, which is the most interesting part of it. Like the fact you did is great. But how you got there, that's always the coolest thing. I mean, it's when like and he's so good at like pointing that part of like archaeology out or it's like here you have, you know, it's we crazy is like I can't remember the name of like a particular pyramid, this massive pyramid. And then they realized from doing like scans, oh, actually there's another pyramid inside that pyramid. Well, they Russian dolled pyramid. So it's not just this one massive pyramid. They built a pyramid around that pyramid and a pyramid around that pyramid and a pyramid around that pyramid till inside there's a kind of smaller pyramid that connects to natural springs. So you age date you age date the oldest part of the thing and you get a certain time when the pyramid was built. But when you start going underneath an age dating it all of a sudden it keeps going further and further and further back. And that's where he's controversial is because archaeologists are like no, no, no. People weren't do those the Stone Age. No one was like capable of doing any of this shit back then and it's like, okay, well, then what about the fact that this is how do they do it because they did it. They did it. Not only did they did it. They aligned it with serious and then so but let's then then it's like, you know, but let's not take any of like what they carved on these rocks seriously. Even that's the other crazy thing is that like around the planet like various civilizations that never made contact with each other doing the same thing simultaneously. Yes. And versions of the same story. A guy showed up with a beard. He said he came from this place. He taught us how to do this stuff. It's just crazy. It's so mind blowing to like think about coincidence. It's too, it's too much coincidence. It's too high, too high of a coincidence to not be. Yeah, it can't be coincidental. I mean, it could be, but the more it is, the less likely it is. I mean, odds of it. I guess like you could argue that I remember in psychology class, uh, Carl Jung, they were like, we're studying Carl Jung, the famous psychotherapist and he I think worked in a mental hospital where a schizophrenic started like yammering about like how the sun has a dick and the dick touches the earth, like, you know, stuff that like normal be, if you heard, you know, anyone screaming that out, you would, you know, you might be a little turn across the street. Yeah, but you would just be like, all right, whatever. But Jung had this like library of like all these like anthropological studies of, uh, various like, uh, indigenous cultures and he remembered like this guy was like articulating specifically the cosmology of this one rare group of like, I don't know, almost an uncontacted tribe from wherever. And so like, and so that's, so Jung started coming up with this idea of the collective unconscious idea that we all, we have our subjective dreams, but there's the dream of humanity and that maybe that there's a guy in mind or something. So maybe from his perspective, the reason that, you know, all the, these, these various civilizations that never met each other have similar mythologies is because, well, they're, it's all, it's one, it's the collective showing up regardless of like literal contact with one another. I guess if you wanted to come up with a really shitty argument for why, and you also in the midst of that, when a discount whatever you single one of these, can you imagine like you somehow with your people managed to build a pyramid that to this day, we don't know how they fucking built it, right? You paint, you carve inside the pyramid. Well, here's how we built it. You see, this guy came, they had new magic. They taught us how to do this new magic. Yeah, yeah, they knew, they knew, like they knew how to do magic, they knew how to connect to some fresh magic to them. It was new magic. So you like, you're specific. You're like, you draw the picture of the fucking UFO with the, it came out of the sky. They came from serious. They told us to align the thing with their civilization. So we can receive signals from them and you show it on there and then modern people are like, yeah, the pyramids fucking impressive, but whatever, who cares what they had to say about how they did it. You're just like, fuck their stupid story. That's not real. That could have happened. That would be very frustrating. Probably if you realize, like modern people would just like whatever the pyramids cool. I guess I don't really care, but who cares. So frustrating. Maybe it, maybe it tells the magic givers that we're not really worth or not really worth sending any new magic to because it's like, if you're not grateful or interested in something, it gives someone a message. Like, why would you want to give someone something if they just don't want it whatsoever? Or maybe that's right. Maybe that's a thing that's happening. Right. They were just like, don't go back there. They're assholes. They just don't give a fuck about like any kind of cool. Like, especially if you're just some pyramid fetishist alien civilization, they just don't like pyramids. Why didn't they keep building pyramids? Oh my God. What's that skyscraper? We told them to make pyramids. Fuck them. I mean, the collective unconscious thing makes to me, that always has made so much sense. It can't not be true because nothing else could possibly explain those things and something like that. And everyone's experienced something that hints at the idea of a collective unconscious. Everyone, even the most like jaded people had a thing. I mean, you call it like, no, I was a coincidence. What a coincidence. Right. But how is it? There's so many coincidences that coincidences that happen that you have to, it has to mean something more than just, just randomness. Yeah, it's too, it's too bold. It's too like a constant and accurate for it to be just nothing. It seems like something a very sophisticated joke thief in comedy would be like, look, man, I just tuned into the collective unconscious. I didn't, was I your show? Did I see you do that exact joke? Maybe, but I don't remember. But what happened was I call it, it's the collective. It's not even a joke. I just got a collective one. Do you read that book? I told you about the one, Big Magic by Elizabeth. What's her last name? I forget. I started listening to it, but I didn't, I didn't get further along the way. But I did get the audible part is not the best, but it starts to get kind of pretty cool when she talks about ideas and stuff. And like this whole idea of like a muse, it's very similar to that because she talks about how she thinks a lot of people think that if you get an idea and you don't take action with it, you know, the ideal will go to someone else. Right. Yeah. I liked that part of it. Like if you don't, if you're like the, the music is just looking like for a printer that works. And if your printer's jammed up, the muse will just go to another printer. Yeah. I mean, that kind of, all the stuff she says in there is very, very, um, on point with that idea of things just being like some sort of a back in, like a back into everything, like the other side. I always think about that whole idea, how they just recently discovered about how, uh, just the existence, the definite existence of dark matter and how it's the majority of the matter, like it's slightly the majority of the matter is dark matter and how that is, that's such a, I mean, the fact that that is, is known is so incredibly, I want to say deep, but it just, it means so much that most of what is out there, we don't even know how to look at it. We have no idea how to access it. It is completely and totally unavailable, except for like the tiniest fragment of time that we're able to measure inside a fucking tube under the ground in Switzerland. Otherwise it's just doesn't exist. We have no, no knowledge of it. Now that's the case. Think about how much is just not even, not even visible in the visible light spectrum. That's like a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny fragment of our awareness as humans. So there's got to be just, just fucking an unfathomable, unfathomable amount of something. Of a thing that is able to travel or transmit or communicate or something like that. Like there's no way to possibly understand it. What do you think it is? I mean, that's what, I have no idea. I think it's probably, we're in Vegas. It's like, okay, what's dark matter? What is, what aren't we seeing? I think it's, it's dimensional. It's got to be dimensional. It's like the thing where, you know, you've seen like someone try to explain like a ziggurat. That's what, that's the, uh, the fourth dimension, the fourth dimensional square mean a tesseract. Yeah. Tesseract. Not a ziggurat. What is a ziggurat? That's, that's a shape pyramid. Ziggurat's a pyramid. Tesseract. Tesseract. The tesseract. I've almost kind of, can kind of understand it, but I really can't. Like I tried many, many times, watched a bunch of videos explaining how, how it works in dimensional space, but it doesn't, it never quite makes sense to me. And I say, I wonder, you know, this is a wrinkle in time. Let's see tesseract. Let's look it up. Here we go. In geometry, a tesseract is the four dimensional analog of the cube. The tesseract is to the cube as the cube is to the square. Okay. Right. So it's like, you know, in the way that like a square is two dimensional, then the cube goes in a third dimension that just as a surface of the cube consists of six square faces, the hyper surface. They always have to say hyper. The hyper surface of the tesseract consists of eight cubical cells. Oh, I see. I knew this part about it. I was just telling my, actually my son was just telling me this, the tesseract is one of the six convex regular for four polytips. We got in a little bit of an argument because I'm like, no, it isn't. It's a, isn't it five polytips? But he's like, dad, it's four. Come on. The tesseract is all kids know that now. All the kids know. So weird. Yeah. Cause I mean, I'm, I'm, I mean, I don't want to get in the Mandela effect thing, but like for sure, I'm like almost a hundred percent certain that when I was growing up, the tesseract was one of the four convex regular three polytopes. But when I used to show my dad a cube, he would scream. Oh yeah. He would scream. Yeah. I got kicked out of the house for two weeks. I had to go live with my, my uncle for two weeks because I showed my dad a cube. Jesus. That's not, what is that crap? Well, I mean, a lot of dads, you know, when we were coming up, did not want to see a cube. Why did you do that? I would never show my dad a cube. I didn't know any better. You know, I wasn't, he wasn't around enough to tell me that cubes don't exist. And then to me, I'm thinking I can, I can visualize a cube. No problem. I used to love wrapping presents. I loved wrapping presents because I was so good at visualizing the cube. And then he gets pissed because he's just all those old timers. That generation just, they're so square. They're very, that's exactly where I remember. Like I was walking in the house. I had found this like incredible obsidian cube and inside one of the animals I was dissecting, I was bringing it in to show it to my dad and my mom stopped me and was like, you will not bring that cube into my house. You will not show that cube to your father. I mean, I just was felt ashamed and start crying. She made me bury the cube. At least you knew how to bury it. At least she, at least mom saw it because that's all I think is going through this new generation is they can visualize the Tesseract. No problem. And people like us, we just don't have it. It's not in our, it's just not in us. And so we reject it. We find other things to involve ourselves with. We just keep going back to cubes. You know, I know, but it's like, I get it. It's like, you know, it's like if I had spent more time with that cube than I definitely wouldn't have like had a chance to like understand rectangles. I think rectangles back then, you know, were sort of like, yeah, are they exciting like a cube? Nah. You know, is the shape is like satisfying as a cube? No. Nah, but you know, I think learning to appreciate rectangles, even this in the age of the Tesseract is still, you know, it's good. It's, I think there's something traditional about it, you know? About a test? About a test? No, about a rectangle. Oh yeah, a rhombus. Even a rhombus, like some of these classic shapes, you know, we will not like honestly, like the, they recommend not even like to this day, like don't, you don't introduce your kids to cubes until they're like six, until they're braised. Really? Okay. Yeah. That's funny because there's six sides to a cube. Is that why? Or is that a coincidence? Oh, our pediatrician said it has something to do with that. But then like when I started asking her, she was a kind of a bitch. She was just like, what are we on your fucking podcast? What does she, she's Gen Z, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah. She didn't want to hear Gen Z. It's like, I thought you were, why are you cursing? Like this thing where doctors have started cursing. Have you noticed this? What the fuck is that? Yeah. I have a new Gen Z doctor and he curses all the time. He's like, Hey, Mr. Pemberton, you know, we got some fucking crazy shit going on here in your small intestine. I'm like, um, hello, doctor. He's also wearing, um, he's wearing Yeezy's and he had like, uh, sport pants on and we did the whole thing standing up. I hate that. Outside too. He met me on the street. I hate that. Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Like my proctologist Jesus Christ, man. He's so vulgar. It's like you're so vulnerable and he's just like, look at this. Look at this fucking ass. Look at your fucking ass. He like spanked my ass. My, uh, my GI doctor had took a guitar lesson the entire time he saw me. What the fuck is happening? He was taking an online guitar lesson. It's awful. He was a long appointment. Um, but you know, he's a good, great doctor. Just was kind of hard to, to tell what he was when he was talking to me when he was talking to the guitar teacher. Dude, my dermatologist was playing Dungeons and Dragons the whole time. Really? Yeah. We, we, my proctologist, you like happen to be the, the proctologist was there. My pediatrician was there. They were all like, it was really fucked up cause like I, like I had something I wanted him to look at on my, on my skin and he was like, what is it? You want to tell me about it? It's just a weird tattoo that I don't remember getting. Oh, okay. That's what they called a shadow tat. Yeah. It was a shadow tat. Thank God. I thought like I blacked out or something. But yeah, I guess a lot of people are getting that. I heard that might be like a, some form of communication because you're trying because I guess we're so busy with the noises of our devices and everything in this, in this rat race we live in that they're thinking that maybe other worlds are trying to reach out by. Mine was Target. It's a QR code that went to target.com. Oh, was it for an item or just the store like the website? Just the website. Weird. Have a discount code? Yeah. Oh, how much, what, how much did you get off? It's for Starbucks or something. It's like not, it's not even that great. It's like both. It's like one of those shitty coupons. I mean, it's a guy working with who got 20% off only if you spend $300. Yeah, but I don't, I mean, you know, like I had my people reach out to Target. Like, are you guys sending out like, are you, if you figured out a way to QR code these shadow tats on the people and they were like completely like no response, just wouldn't respond. Like who else would be doing this? Man, I don't know. I mean, that's, that's the thing you got to ask is who's doing this stuff? It's just, there's no way to know this. We're not going to know. Maybe the kids will know. Maybe these tests are at kids will figure it out because it's definitely something that I just, my little brain doesn't get it because I'm just still trying to figure out, I have trouble trying to get Siri to work. You know? Yeah. I agree. I can't, I can't, I can't get my remote control to do shit anymore. I was laughed at. Do you know why I was laughed at? Why? For real left at me because I said, Hey, Siri. What? You know, you don't, you don't have to say, Hey, Siri. Do you know that? Yeah, you do. No, you don't say, Hey, Siri, or what does it come on? You can make it come on without doing that. I guess. What do you say? I can't even remember. I think he just like pushed the button. He just or some crap. You just push like the, you push like the thing that says, Hey, Siri. He goes somewhere in my phone and scared the shit out of me. It works, but you don't have to do that. It's you're wasting your breath and that's the thing. Then the new generation, the younger kids, they. They know, they know, you don't have to waste your breath. Nothing. You guys say, Hey, you know, right? The woods creepy to me is I didn't know my phone was over there. I still don't think it is. You don't think so? No, it's creepy. We're going to cut to commercial. We'll be right back. Bye. I want to thank Lumi Labs who are the creators of microdose gummies. I don't know where Lumi Labs is. My guess, Atlantis. I think Atlantis must still exist and it's somewhere down beneath the sea. Genius aquatic alchemists have figured out a way to produce the perfect microdose gummy. No more wondering when you eat an edible, if just maybe the sun is going to supernova as you go on your jog. Nope. These are perfect edibles. I mean that. I've lifetime a lifetime of chomping down edibles. I've never encountered an edible. That is the perfect dose. That means you get that nice, warm, sweet, relaxing feeling with none of the skeletons. You've been trying to chain in your closet, pouring out and threatening you with broadswords. No, no, no. This is the best, even better. It's available nationwide. You can fly with it. I fly with it when I go on the road. It helps me sleep to learn more about microdosing THC. Go to microdose.com and use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found at DuncanTrussell.com. But again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. You will love them. And we're back. Here's the thing. Hey, Duncan. Hi, Johnny. Here. We're back. We've been talking about a lot of things. Tesseract, cubes, Siri, Shadow Tats, Halliburton. But you know, to get back to the Graham Hancock stuff, it's like. Summoning demons, right? Like there's a way apparently you can like summon entities or like make contact with like entities using bizarre methods or methods we would consider to be bizarre. Right. But you know, there's this potential in just the way our technology is going. The phone itself is the demon summoner. It goes away. So it's like the phone. The phone goes away. Oh, definitely. Right. I mean, isn't that the whole idea? So that, so that really it's more like the Wi-Fi itself becomes the technology. Like the wife with somehow within the Wi-Fi is the code. So in other words, like you could, you don't need the phone anymore. You just say like manifest phone. And then the, the Wi-Fi itself configures itself into some kind of phantasmal AR style phone. And then you can like call your friends. So, you know, is that what all these ancient technology is just like, no, they figured out how to no longer need material things to achieve technological results. They figured out a way to sort of pluck energy temporarily out into some more condensed form and then vanish it again. And, and we don't know how to do that yet. But all these demons summon rituals, summoning rituals, all the magical shit. It's really just like, Hey, Siri, but in Sumerian, you know, the prayers and all that. It's an ancient version of it. Oh my God. She's been listening the entire time and she just says she can't translate to Sumerian. I bet she can't. She does not want to acknowledge Sumerian. She said, I can't translate into Sumerian. Yeah. Oh, eventually Siri's going to be able to translate into Sumerian. I hope not. Fuck. God damn it. If only I knew what this fucking goddamn wall carving meant. Siri, can you analyze this? I think it's Sumerian. You can already do that stuff where you can show your phone just any language and it can translate at real time. That shit's insane that it can happen. And all these all the translating stuff. It's only going to get better faster until I always think that our generation or kind of people around our age, like what a crazy amount of technology to have to. Because I remember, I remember red refunds really well. I remember using them, remember like all kinds of stuff that's nowadays is, you know, as time goes on, it becomes more and more remote and more of a thing in the past. And you feel like, Oh God, I'm just, it's that's so old. It's such like ancient stuff compared to what we have now. Man, I was watching, I was showing forest. I don't know what it was, something in black and white. And he goes, why is she gray? And like, you know, I'd explain him, there was a time when there was no such thing as color film, like you stuff was black. He didn't, you know, like, but to him, it was just like that lady. Jesus. What the fuck? She's gray. What a weird looking person that is. It's really strange. Yes. Like the amount of the amount of technological change that we have to deal with. And it's, uh, it's amazing that we're even alive, you know, it's like we can even hang out and we don't like lose our minds or have breakdowns all the time. I mean, I suppose that happens a lot to people, but it seems it's just kind of incredible. I think we're going to, if we live, let's say we each live another 30 years, right? That's pretty conservative estimate. I think we'll be around that long. It's just going to be, um, significant. I mean, God knows. Maybe we won't be able to, maybe it'll be a point where it'll be like, oh, your, your firmware just can't handle this new upload. Like if you had an old computer right now, like an apple to E, you can't run anything on that. You just can't. It doesn't have the capacity to do it. Well, you'll upgrade. Yeah. But also at the same time, the human brain is just spectacular, such a spectacular computer. We haven't even come close to realizing to just how much you can do. Like the way it can compute stuff is insane. Well, now, um, I, I, somebody just tweeted this like research paper where they figured out how to use an AI to like look at memories. Like they're able to like, yeah. Yeah. Which is going to be like, what do you mean look at memories? Like looking at, let me see if I can find the actual article here real quick. Basically, um, this is essentially, um, minority, minority report in a way. Isn't it? Yes. Similar to that. Similar kind of. I mean, I think that was, uh, for future crimes. Yeah. Um, I mean, there's tons of movies about this, essentially tons of sci-fi ideas about the idea of being able to read people's memories and stuff. God, it's so fucking spooky and cool to think about. Hold on one second. I will find it right now. This, and you know, more than likely, like it's one of those things. Actually, I, I may have done the classic where you're like, holy shit, it could do that. And then didn't read the paper where whatever the exciting thing is that you thought it could do. It's actually not that at all. Here it is. Uh, let me see here. See if I'm reading this wrong. A system to decode visual stimuli from brain recordings. So yeah, it's a way to, and it's showing like, so I think this is more along the lines of like that. It can take what you're, it's not your memory. So I fucked that up. It's, you could take what you're looking at. Yeah. Okay. I saw that it can tell what you're looking at. It can look at your brainwaves and it can tell what you're looking at. Like it has someone looking at a fire truck and the computer draws something. It looks kind of like a five, like a five year old drew a five, uh, a fire truck with like a really thick, thick pen. Yeah. It's taking your visual stimulus and it seems like it's doing the text to art. Right. Yeah. I saw this. It's incredible. And that's just, and that's now this is early stages. Huh. Anytime I see something like that, I think, well, it's, it's already over. You know what I mean? Here, I found the paper steps that does it take for it to be end game. Seeing beyond the brain conditioning diffusion model with sparse mass modeling for vision decoding submitted to anonymous conference by Zizhao Chen, Jackson, Queen, Tiange Zhang, Wanlin, you and Daryl Williams decoding visual stimuli from brain recording. Does coding visual stimuli from brain recordings? Like, okay. All of a sudden we have brain recordings aims to deepen our understanding of the human visual system and build a solid foundation for bridging human vision and computer vision through the brain computer interface. However, due to the scarcity of data annotations and the complexity of underlying brain information, it is challenging to decoding images with faithful, deep tales and meaningful semantics. Well, yeah, it's challenging. It's challenging now, right? It's challenging. It is challenging. Or is that been just saying, oh, we, we haven't figured it out yet. Yeah. I think we're, we're a long way away. It's going to take a long time. Yeah. In this work, I don't think it's going to work. I don't know if we can do it. It's too hard. I'm going to go to the office. Hey, I just did it. Hold on. It took me 10 minutes in this work. We present men D. Viz sparse mass brain modeling with double conditioned diffusion model for vision decoding specifically by boosting the information capacity of representations learned in large scale resting state MRI data set. We show that our men D. Viz framework reconstructed highly plausible images with semantically matching details from brain recordings with very few training pairs. We benchmarked our model and our method outperforms data. The arts in both semantic mapping and generation quality by 66%. So I guess they took a bunch of people who were looking at something in an MRI machine. Yeah. And then look at that image. There was a tell what they're looking at by reading their fucking brainwaves. They could tell they're looking at by, I mean, it's essentially it's like ESP in a way, right? It's like technically it's, it's ESP with a giant, I don't know, half a million dollar magnet in a basement of a hospital. It's ES. Yeah. It's ESP. The implications are so fucking nuts, which is like, okay, so we know that through this like highly sensitive machine, they can like record energy in the human brain through the skull. We can do this. We can now see what someone's seeing. What that means is, okay, what's next? Like, all right, uh, sold clearly. This is something that the military is going to use. So it's like, it's some kind of brainwave detector. The soldier wears, which then sends information from their visual cortex to military to people who are watching so that it turns every soldier into a camera. So you could see what the soldiers are seeing precisely what they're seeing. So that's the net is definitely going to be the next. I think that, but I think even more so. I mean, everything is, uh, military applications are always obvious to me. It seems more and more. Yeah. You work at fucking Aliburton. So I think it's also, it's all, a lot of stuff is marketing. It's the kind of thing where I can imagine if you gave, um, what's that? Any, any huge advertising company, just a piece of that technology. I was watching TV there at night. I was watching, watching Thursday night football last night and there's commercials on Amazon prime. And, um, I just was thinking, I was thinking about the commercials, just how, how good every commercial you see. There's been so much thought put into that. There's one commercial where they're playing. It's a commercial for Amazon's data analytics, right? And they're playing a, um, a song. I can't remember what song it was. It was something like song that I remember hearing a lot when I was in high school, like a biggie song, like a big hit. They're playing a song and you know that they're doing that because when you hear that song, it makes you think about a time in your life and you felt very virile, like a bad ass. You didn't, you were, you were young enough to be dumb enough about stuff, but old enough to be very smart and feel yourself. And so you show all this, this, this slick commercial, all the data, data analytics software that it's, you can plug into any kind of company you have. Any kind of, you're selling anything out of what you can use their logistics software because they have such an extreme amount of data points that you can plug it into your stuff. You're watching that and you hear that song and it goes into your brain. You makes you, it gives you, it gives you a sense memory, which is the most powerful connotation you can have is feeling like a time in your life that is gone. That was so simple and like very, very primitive. And you compare that with this super boring, stupid data analytics, data analytical software. And instantly it just becomes like, Oh yeah, we got to get that for my business, for my, my fucking shipping company. Cause it just, I mean, I'm aware of that basically just barely aware of it. Imagine viewing that even, even though I am aware of it, it still has like an effect on me. I still kind of feel like, man, that's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. I feel it. Right. And that's just like a tiny little thing. That's because he's fucking geniuses. No, they know that song is going to give people kind of goose bumps and make them feel like they've had two bug lights. So what they're boys, you know, it's, it's like a thing. It's, they're like, okay, here's, how do we lube them up? Like, you know, how do we get them to lube? Like, how do we lube them into the emotional state? We need them to, to sell them this fucking bullshit. All right. Well, okay. Let's do, do you have any of that MRI data that we did last week, Darrell? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, how, how do their brains react to, to that song? Okay. Don't use that. Okay. That created a uptick in like the GABA receptors and some serat, okay. That produced the most seratonin. All right. Yeah. We'll do that song and then we'll advertise like the, the new Chevy. And that's like, it's brain hacking. I mean, it's, they're just hacking our brains. They're genius hackers. It's, I mean, love it or hate it is a good or bad. I mean, it's, I don't know. I don't think it's bad. I mean, I don't think it's bad really as much as anything is bad. I guess it's kind of, it's kind of nefarious in a way, but it's just this thing that's bad. I mean, what do you, but how do you, it's so big. It's, it drives everything. It's consensual bad though. We're going to get right back to that and not going to cut to commercial. Yeah. I'm so excited about today's sponsor masterclass. I have been using masterclass long before they reached out to sponsor the podcast and obviously it was an immediate yes, because masterclass has the most insane compilation of lessons that I've ever seen anywhere. They literally have everything from mindfulness and meditation with John Kabat-Zinn to filmmaking with James Cameron acting with Samuel Jackson. You know, I'm on a show that's coming out next year on Fox called Crapopolis and I use masterclass to help me learn how to, how to do vocal acting because I'm on the show with all of these incredible voice actors. So I went to masterclass. I took legendary voice actor Nancy Cartwright's incredible course and it legitimately helped me with my job. They're incredible. I legitimately hope you'll check them out. This is something that will for sure improve your life. No matter what you're trying to improve, what your interests may be, they've got everything you could possibly want. I'm telling you, check them out. If you want to get into voice acting, the Nancy, I wish that I had watched the Nancy Cartwright masterclass years ago. It's incredible, very simple, but everything that you need from developing a character to vocal exercises, it is awesome. I highly recommend you check it out. This holiday, give one annual membership and get one free. Go to masterclass.com slash Duncan today. It's masterclass.com slash Duncan terms apply. Yeah. And we're back. Consensual bad. What do they say in vampire mythology? A vampire only goes where they're invited. Every time you turn the fucking TV on, you invite the vampire into your fucking house and seductive. Whatever happens after that is your fault. You turn on the fucking TV and I'm sure that's what the companies think. It's like, look, you, what do you think this was? What do you think it's paying for? Like those football players make a lot of money because they're really, really good at doing their job. It's super fun to watch. Good, a good football game is so entertaining to me at least because I'm like the number one new football fan. I love it. It's so entertaining. So of course these commercials they have playing during that, they make them like they make, they have to pay for that entertainment somehow. And they do it by making these commercials that are just, they're so fucking good at picking your brain and making you want the thing. And see, here's the thing with like what, what to me is, is like remarkable is that many people are not aware of how much money has gone into any given like commercial that you're watching on TV. People aren't aware of like the research, the intel, like every last detail. And they're not aware of how much research is currently being put in like this technology that can transform visual stimuli into an AI representation. And what, where, where that guy, they're like, you see that now, you're like, whatever, I've got other shit to worry about than that. But really all we're talking about is like, wait, you don't understand. This means that right now you probably don't have anything to worry about unless you live inside an MRI machine connected to some database in China right now, but the more sensitive our ability to like measure energy gets the less necessary the MRI machine becomes, right? Like when now it's like shit, you know, what if you could use 5G? What if like the, you know, some newer version of 5G, which is definitely going through your body figures out a way to like actually as it goes through your body to analyze energetic patterns and then from that put together like, oh, that's what they were thinking. Then and so and now instead of like, is your, what it's already doing, which is like listening to us. Hey, Siri, are you listening? Oh, really? Oh, okay. No problem. You know that famous story about Robert De Niro? I'll go ahead. Yeah, the point, the point is like, what happens when the shit sweeps through your mind and just collects thoughts and uploads them to some repository somewhere suddenly the nightmare of any like paranoid schizophrenic worth their salt becomes absolutely true. Your thoughts are being read by unknown forces so that you can be manipulated more successfully with like, like more powerfully than before. That's coming. Did you say Jason Bourne? Well, cause Jason Bourne was manipulated by the government to be a killing machine. Yeah. Have you watched those movies? Of course. I love them. Oh God, they're so good. They're so fucking good. All that stuff right now with China, like all the surveillance apparatus they have is is incredible. Right. It's only getting bigger and bigger every day. It's got to go somewhere. It's not going to stay there. It's going to bleed over. It has to. Well, yeah, that's the problem. Yeah. We're just becoming slowly more and more. What's the word? When you make someone get accustomed to the thing being around, you know, like you, um, like if there was a gun, if I brought a gun in your house, you freaked out. But if I like, you know, if I just hit it somewhere, we kind of didn't really see it. This is a terrible analogy about it. Just the idea of slowly you slip it in over time. Yeah. Because I think a lot of these companies and people, they understand that some generations you just have, you have to wait till the next generation. You got to start them with it. So it was always around. If something was around when you were growing up, you don't think anything of it at all. But so we get weirded out by stuff because that wasn't around when I was a kid, like every kid I see in Brooklyn has a helmet on every kid. I think about, I don't know where helmet, and I was growing up like I did when I started mountain biking, just cause I was scared. I was going to fall off my bike and hit, run into a tree, but I was riding my bike around Rome. I didn't wear a helmet. Wearing a fucking helmet. Yeah. But now all these kids wear helmets and it kind of, in a way I see both sides. It's like, oh yeah, if I had a kid, I'd want to protect its skull. But at the same time, you also kind of think that, well, maybe they got hurt a little bit so they know how to physically protect themselves when they don't have a helmet on. But it's that thing where you're like, I don't, I think that, but older generations, younger people will not think that because, oh, we, we just always, it was always around. So it's not weird that it's theirs. We're wearing a helmet. It's not weird at all because everyone wears a helmet all the time because it's available to us. It's technology. And that's like the dumbest example ever. But if something's always around you grow up, you don't think about it at all. It's like the social security number. That's the thing that we, you and I don't think much about it at all. But our grandparents were weirded out as hell by that shit. They're like, what? A number. No, you promise us. We never have to have a number associated with us at all. That's like part of being an American. You do not have to have a number attached to you. Number to identify me. Yeah. Now we think nothing of it. Driver's licenses. Driver's licenses. So many things now. We don't think anything. I mean, people do think of it, but at the same time, if you do, if you are aware of it and push it back against it, you, I mean, what are you going to do? Just fucking, oh, and Benjamin yourself or something. I don't know. Right. TSA. Yeah. TSA. You, there was a time when you could just walk into an airport. You could just walk all the way to where the planes are taking off. When you got off the plane, you're fucking like, when you were a kid, your parents were right there at the terminal to get you. You could talk your way. You could talk your way through stuff. You'd be like, Hey, I'm sorry, man, my keys are right. You know, you could do stuff like that. You could go out and get on the fucking plane. Can you, but no, look, can no anacondas. You can't breathe. All right. Go ahead with the anaconda. You can just make sure it goes into. You remind me of my nephew. Get in there with that snake. I mean, you could get on the plane. You can take out the nail. Uh, do you got any room in the smoking section? Yeah, sure. Go ahead. They had a smoking section on a fucking plane. You could just fucking puff away up there. This is the best. It's something like this. Well, we're not supposed to do this, but okay. Just come on out. Come in. Just don't tell them I did this. Yeah. Could you imagine someone low handing you anything now? Like being like, like, um, just being your friend and actually doing something for you that's off the record. No, like it's crazy. Like, no, that stuff used to be happening all the time. Everywhere. Everything was off the record. Everything was cash. Everything was handshake. Now nothing is that way at all. I went to, I've been to the past two months or so. I've been to a bunch of businesses that did not accept cash. And, um, right, I was with my friend, my friend's wife was right behind me at this bar in Highland Park for someone's birthday. And I was thinking, man, you know, the conspiracy theorist to me is like, I don't like that. And she, before I could say anything, she said, Oh, that's a, that's classist. And I was funny because I was thinking about it from the other one side of it as a, as a being something where like they're trying to control us and she's thinking about it from the, um, sort of the, um, I don't want to say social justice, but sort of that end of things how like, Oh, this is a, this is to keep people out who are poor and it's both things. You know what I mean? It's this crazy thing where it's both. Wait, you mean like no cash is class classes? Yeah. No cash is classes because it prevents people who cause typically people who are, uh, on, you know, more impoverished and trading cash because they don't have the ability to access a credit card. Friends smart. I never even, I'm so dense. I never once thought to myself, my God, how many people are like, Oh, fuck, I can't get a credit card. Yeah. Jesus Christ. That's so creepy. But it's the kind of thing where it's going to keep happening so much that we're, we're going to be the, with the grandparents being like, what do you mean you don't take cash? What's like having a public freak out moment at some normal store that just says, I'm sorry, we just don't take cash anymore. And we're going to be look like weirdos. Like look at the old weird guy. He's freaking out. No, it's going to be like, what do you mean? I can only come in here if my pheromone levels are in seven year below. Well, that's like the, that's the, uh, that's the end game. Right now it's just cash or credit. Tyler's no cash, but it's going to escalate to where it's, Oh, what do you mean? My, my temperatures, my temperature is too high. Well, yo, what do you mean? My brain scan matches someone who shoplifts. I would never shop. Yes. Exactly. Something like that. It's just, I mean, you can't explain your way out of it. Yeah. What can you, you can't, I mean, sometimes, but that's the thing. Maybe you can, maybe eventually this kind of stuff, cause it does rely on a group of people to sort of hold the, the scanning wand, maybe to be that sort of an enforcer cop, like an idiocracy, right? There's always the people. Yeah. There's the fucking idiot cops and idiocracy who were, uh, this particular individual was found in violation of a penal code. You know, it's all just computerized. You can't push up against it at all. But maybe there'll be people who, cause every once in a while you'll talk to someone. I mean, it's even like that, like some of the, like the AT&T call we did forever ago. We talked to that person. We, we did break through and talk to a human who was able to back channel some of the automatic things, but it's like that wouldn't even happen now. If we did that now, we would not be able to have that experience. I think you could not breach the fortress that is AT&T anymore. And if you did, I mean, that's the thing. It's like, if even you're not even going to be talking to a person, first of all, you're going to be like mid conversation, like, hold on, are you an AI? And it's going to be like, yeah, I'm an AI, but what's the big deal? I'm really, I actually am more equipped than a person to help you. Is that a problem that I'm, I'm an AI? If you want to wait 50 minutes, I can put you on with a human with it's not going to have as much access as I do. But yeah, sure. I don't mind. Less access. I've got other calls coming in. What are your pheromone levels at? Have you done a pheromone level detection scan? If you, if your pheromone levels drop down because you're really angry right now, when it goes to green, I'll get you to a human. As long as it's purple, you're going to have to talk to me because you're going to, you're angry right now. And you could verbally assault a person. I don't give a fuck what you say to me. What do you think about that though? Do you think that like, cause part of me thinks that AI and all of the computer stuff is we have to treat them like they're human because they're products of humans. And so to be like, I haven't tried enough to be nice to machines. When possible. Cause I feel like if you're disrespectful to something like, if my computer has a problem and I get angry, that's ridiculous. Like I make mistakes constantly, all the time. Yeah. I think that you should just generally practice non-aggression and actually practicing non-aggression on inanimate objects is ridiculous. As that may seem. It's training you so that when you're around a person, you won't be so aggressive. Like, you know, I, like the way I talk to Siri. Is terrible, you know, it's like, I shouldn't like, it shows my own hierarchy of like assessing things according to this or that. It's like, why not just be universally compassionate instead of screaming at certain things and not screaming at other things? You know, do you need to be compassionate to an inanimate object because it's going to like get revenge? Obviously not. But you know, yeah, you should probably like always make an exercise of being a little more gentle with the things around you. I would, I would guess. I mean, I know people, there are many people who make like electronic music or digital art or like, this thing is alive. It's a collaboration that's happening here. Not a, it's not a one way street. And if you're coming at your machine with some kind of dark energy, it's going to reflect that back through whatever you make. So come in sweet and you'll make something sweet. Yeah. And also it just feels, feels good to, it feels good to be really kind of things. I think it feels better. That's cool. Cause I was thinking about how people who get, um, if you get really angry at someone, let someone, someone fucks up your order and you get really angry at them and you just really fucking give it to them. You're angry at them. How I suppose that kind of feels good in a way because you wouldn't do that unless it felt sort of good, but I think it feels good because you are having you've got so much turmoil in your, in your mind and your brain. Like you've got like things in your past that you haven't dealt with that are, um, they're affecting you. They affect you all the time, but you're, you're unaware of them to the extent where you think you have moved beyond them. I always think of like, I don't know, screwed, right? Screwed from a Christmas curve, the most perfect example. He is, he's an asshole and he gets off on saving, on pinching a penny and saving money by having no heat, paying as little as possible, getting the deal. It makes him feel good when he gets those little wins everywhere because he's got so much pain. He's living with so much pain that he's, um, that's the only thing that makes him feel better is, is getting old, getting over on someone just a little bit every day, getting that fucking thing. But if he were to, like he does in the end, spoiler, spoiler. Wait, wait, I don't know how a Christmas story ends. Wait, stop. I'm halfway through the book. That's the best idea ever. So don't know the story of Scrooge. Don't ruin it, please. He dies right at the end. I'm assuming he gets like murdered or like, like gets his head chopped up. Yeah, Bob Cratchit, um, Bob Cratchit takes a fire poker and beats him to death on Christmas Eve and steals all of his money and steals his identity and goes on to live as him for the next. Well, Tony Tim was actually faking the injury. Thank God. That makes me feel better. I felt so sorry for the kid. It was insurance fraud. Exactly. That little fucker. He's trying to steal from Atna. I think it's like you at some point have to play around with the idea that you don't need to like adjust the external universe to be happy. And then if that's true, that means that because I think a lot of times when people are, uh, you know, like corrective drivers, it's like somebody pulls out in front of you and you're like, I'm getting revenge. Oh yeah. Try to get out of them and pull out front of them. But in your, like the rationalization for your aggression is, is usually like you might think I'm going to teach them never to do that again. So in some awful way, you've assigned yourself as some like road teacher road teacher. That is the worst thing ever. I'd give a road teacher teaching lessons on the highway baby. Yeah. Don't cut off a person and then slow down or someone will cut you off and slow down and then you become a road teacher. And you're like, and so you're, you're trying to rationalize your raw aggression with like you're turning into some great benefactor for a future person who you've prevented that person from cutting off in traffic or whatever. And it's stupid. It's dumb. It's ineffective. Oh, we've all done it though. So I've done it. I've definitely done it. Of course. Yeah. Of course. You want to show you want to show them like no, no, no, you don't get one over on. Oh, you don't do that to me in my car. You might do that to someone else in a Nissan Sentra, but the car I'm driving, you don't do that to this car. Oh, no, you know, and like not cut off this car. You know, you know, meanwhile, you know, you get like, I remember one, you know, if you, if you have a kid with allergies, sometimes you gotta get to the hospital and all of a sudden people, they don't know that. They just think you're driving like a motherfucker and they're like, what a mother fucker fuck this guy. They're beeping at you. They're pissed off. They don't know that you're like shit. You don't understand. It was faster to put them in the car and get to the fucking hospital that it was to call the ambulance. He's probably going to be okay, but God damn it. We got to get him there. And I don't know any way to like communicate that to you other than beeping the way you, because you're going to fucking slow and then that person wants to get revenge, not even knowing, not even knowing that they're trying to get revenge on like parents who are trying to get their kid to a fucking hospital. They think you're just an asshole driver. It's, so it's like, you know, irony is it sucks. Yeah. I think a lot, a lot of people, if they were to know that, they would be like, Oh my God, let me help you. They would get out of the way. They would escort you. They would help you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's humanity. Really. Yeah. But you know, love, love helping. Love helping. There's just, I've told you this before, but, um, you know, Trevor, Trevor Moore are, are, uh, deceased friend, wonderful person, very, very smart guy. He had this great trick. He told me years ago, is you ever get pulled over by the cops? Ask them for help. Cause it flips something in their brain or instead of becoming like, Oh, I have to teach, I have to give this person a ticket. You'd be like, Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. I'm so lost. I'm trying to find this road. I can't, I don't know. And it does something because all humans mean pretty much all humans. One, they want to help people. That's generally why people become cops. Yeah. They do they, cause they want to help people and they get, they get stuck on to get mired down and all kinds of bullshit and God knows. I mean, who knows what kinds of stuff you have to look at every day. That's terrible. And just all kinds of shit, but you want to, if you want to help people, yeah, everyone wants to help people if they can. So it makes, I mean, if you're going to make a great monster, the best monsters in movies are the ones that think they're being helpful. You know, like that's the, instead of creating like a, just a singularly evil thing, you make it make sense why the thing is doing its horrible thing. And now of a sudden it's like, now it's a great monster because you can kind of understand like, Oh Jesus, like, I get it. Like, it's horrible what you're doing, but oh fuck, that's a good monster. Like when you just make that one, like, you know, the one you can kind of sympathize with in a way because you see its point of view. Right. Yeah. That's the big things. You'll see this. Exactly. You see the, if you can tell the point of view of the antagonist, then that's really makes a good antagonist. Yes, it does. Yeah. It's like a perfect fucking monster. That's the terrible thing is like all the monsters in the world. The most horrendous people on earth minus the sociopaths and serial killers. Yeah. They thought they were helping. They thought they were fucking doing the best they could and they really wanted to help. They just, people don't understand. People don't realize the threat that's coming. I have no choice but to do this. Like Dahmer. Dahmer was a sociopath. So I think he was just like, I want to, you know, I want to be closer to the man, to the men who will reject me and then I scatter them in my yard because I just, you know, wanted to be close to them. But his brain was, his brain was broken. Yeah, like a legitimate, his brain was, was fried. Well, that, you know, but I, you know, and you could just, before you judge fucking Jeffery Dahmer, it wasn't all bad. He was actually a really great artist. If you, great guy, if you like look at your own rap, like whenever I look at my, like whenever I've been aggressive, the immediate way I attempt to rationalize it, like, well, I had no choice. I had no choice. And you're always like, yeah, you did. Shut the fuck up. You had a choice. You didn't have to do that. You always tried, but you, you can't bear the reality of the, that you, you, you just for a second turned into an animal. Yeah. It's all like ego protection. Like ego protection stuff is, is the worst. That's like, I feel like I kind of noticed that a few weeks ago. We had to do this, this scene. It was like the most intense scene I've ever had to do. I had to memorize so much dialogue. I've never had to memorize that much stuff. And it was all like a monologue. I was so, it was just a lot to do. And I kept thinking like, okay, just going to run this over and over again, but I was really careful not to look at any kind of news stuff. I didn't want to look at, I didn't want to talk to anybody who might, might say something kind of a snide or anything would be even like a joke. I just didn't want to talk to anyone except people who are really, I was really close to doing a look at any social media because I knew that any kind of little thing could get in my head and it would cause like a little bit of like a distortion or sort of like just create a distraction for me. Right. And I really need to focus and I was thinking like, what if I just did this? This is a great, how I should always be living if I can. It's not, it's not like getting tangled in things that I know are going to like you look at something. It's like they say about gambling. It's just some crazy thing. I remember hearing years ago that a person who's addicted to gambling, their brainwaves, some part of their brain gets lit up more when they lose than when they win. Oh, you told me that it was so, so dark. They get addicted to losing. Yeah. They kind of are addicted to losing. It's like a complicated thing, but essentially it's the same thing. I think about if I like to read like a negative comment, someone's left. Like I know when I'm, when I'm in a good space, I laugh at it and be like, wow, that's funny. That's really good. It's good that someone's leaving a negative comment because it means that it's reached enough people to where someone has decided they need to say something like have some sort of bad reaction. It's a good thing. It's, it's a really good thing. I should be completely compassionate to that person. I was someone so click on their profile. I'm like, oh, look, this guy has a whole other profile just for his little cat. And I get, and it makes me feel like, man, I can't believe I thought about calling that guy an idiot or something. This is a person who clearly has a whole life. They have definitely have empathetic. They have a love for this little creature. They've created a whole profile for this little cat. Like what a, what an incredible great person, but they just had this moment where they decided to say something terrible to someone they don't know for who knows why, but they did it. And I have to be like, um, I have to let that go. I have to, I have to, I can't say anything because any kind of engagement will just further create the turmoil. That's like in the highest of mine. But sometimes when you're feeling low, you feel bad about yourself. You see something bad and it creates like this. I feel like a jolt of it's like a, like a form of nastiness. It's like, uh, you know how there's different types of sweat. There's good sweat. Like you smell, it smells good and there's like fear sweat, which kind of stinks. Yeah, like you can get a little fear sweat shoots out of your glands when I see something negative like that. And that's the kind of thing I think it's like, if you can insulate yourself from any type of having to see things that may potentially cause that type of reaction and you don't feel like you're in a place where you can handle it. That that's like, uh, I mean, that's what I would love to be in a place where I could always have that mindset where I'm always able to either avoid or deal with the thing in a way that's compassion, compassion, right? Cause you're, you're, you can't, you know, I know, like there's a point in your life where you feel insignificant and you see someone who you have like know about through the media or something. You don't think of them as a person even and you certainly don't imagine they're like reading their comments or that they're going to see the stupid shit you wrote really the thing you're writing is more to like other people that you like you hope you can like find other people also dislike whatever the fucking thing is you've you're you want a team that doesn't like this thing. Team Scrooge. Team shit. But, but it's like, so the power dynamic is so fucking skewed anyway. It's like, so then no matter what you say back to that person, you're going to seem so weak anyway that you're like fucking weakly like, and that's a sad thing when you like realize that when you're looking at people and you realize, oh my God, not only are they like reading their comments, which we all know is no, no, if you can help it, but very hard to avoid. Yeah. But now you're like going in and you're, you're not responding. They're not even responding to the many comments of people are like, I love your thing. They only communicate with people who hate them. Yeah. That's terrible. What the fuck? You're so you're like the rewarding people who say shitty things to you and like ignoring people who are nice to you, which is terrible conditioning. I mean, my God, I feel like read some fucking Pavlov. You know what I mean? Like what are you doing? You're literally training. So anyone who's looking at us like, oh my God, if you say something nice, he ignores you. If you call him a motherfucker, you get a reaction. It's like that asshole through Skittles, airy styles. Did you see that? No. When was this Aaron showed me this and it's really crazy. Like, I guess like people throw shit at Harry Styles. I would see. I mean, that guy is about as famous as you can get. He's as famous as you can get. I hope to have stuff thrown at me. Well, you don't say that. I know. Don't say that because some motherfucker and a frenzy of probably adoration for Harry Styles throws, you know, some kid slings Skittles, Harry Styles. One of them hits him in the fucking eye. And now he's got to wear an eye patch from a Skittle injury to him. But the, the, the, the, what's really dark about it is the person who flung the Skittles just wanted to touch Harry Styles. Yeah, couldn't touch physically Harry Styles, but had this connection in the most horrific way possible by fucking up this guy's vision. And you see him like these Skittles raining down on me. He's like, ah, you like, cause one of them just zinged him right in the fucking eye. You know what I mean? So it's like, that's the problem is like, you don't, don't teach people. Don't you, you have to create other avenues of connection that don't involve like someone hurling shit at you verbally or physically. You know, that's the problem. It's like, if you ever have a heckler, I feel like they've always been, well, obviously they're drunk. They're almost, almost a hundred percent of the time they're drunk. Always. But they're also fans, usually. Usually someone who's like a big fan who gets, they get drunk, they get confused. They don't know how to handle their emotions in a different setting. And, uh, yeah, they just like lose, they lose their cool, essentially. And they do this thing that they, you can't really take that back. But it's something you're trying. You, you want to make a connection and you don't know how because you're, you're drunk. And that's the main thing you're drunk. So you, you make a, make a dumb choice. Oh my God, dude. It's, it's, it's so, it's like, yeah, it's, it's such a sad moment because you know, you, you're like, you, you love that they love you. But also you have to like do a show. So like finding that middle road between like, you know, compassionately, but in a funny way, shutting them down. It's like, you know, otherwise you seem so cruel. Cause you don't want, that's what you just, you don't want to be cool. This is why you have to be nicer to your inanimate objects. Everything's training. You know, everything's training. We got to be nicer. That's it. It's so simple. But God, it's so fucking like in practice. It's really quite difficult for some people. It's hard. I think it's a thing, but it is, like you said, it is a practice. It's a thing where you practice doing it and it starts to become really fun. I think, I don't know. I think it's fun. I think it can be fun to do it because it's sometimes you just see what happens if you just are really just completely understanding of anything bad that happens dealing with it. Like it's, um, I mean, I read this book years ago, I read a book years ago. I can't remember the name of it. It's really short, but it talks about how anything that, uh, you think bad about yourself or any kind of thoughts you have, instead of chastising yourself. Supposed to look at it like it's a child that has done this and you wouldn't scream at a kid. If like, let's say your kid puts the wrong cream cheese on your bagel, you're not going to fucking scream at a child. You're going to say, Oh, that's, well, this is, you know, even if you're going to say anything at all, like what, maybe just say nothing. Cause this doesn't really matter. It's not that big of a deal at all, but definitely if it is a big deal, yeah. When a kid does something that you don't like, there's two broad paths. One, ignore it. That's the easiest. This is how you will create the short term. Lots of like energy, right? Like you save energy as a parent longterm. It's going to cost you a lot of energy down the line. You want to catch it before. Oh yeah. Because it's like, you know, first of all, you have to understand. They don't understand anything. So like the concept of like, you know, we know, for example, that if you have a, like if I'm hanging out with you and I pick up, you happen to have a mid-sized dinosaur made of hardened plastic and I pick it up and like hate you in the arm with it, right? You're going to be like, fuck you. What the fuck? Why did you do that? You're going to be worried. You're probably worried about me. Like, whoa, what's going on with it? Man, that's really, when your child does that, you, obviously you can be like, what the fuck? You have to be like, this is hard. See, look, this is soft. This is hard. When we're playing, you know, and you hit me with something hard, it hurts. It hurts me and you don't want to hurt me. And so that don't, that's why I don't want you to do that. Then if they do it again, you call the cops. You have the cops, the new kid's cops. They have an Austin are fucking great. So like, so the cops are kids. The cops are kids. They're trained kids. And so the first time, you know, you just like explain, that's a second time you call the kid cops, kid cops show up and they're hardcore. They will like come right through the door. You know, they bash down the door. Sometimes it's fucking worth it. They like go into the playroom. They like, you know, have little mini tasers, which are so adorable. And then they'll like, you know, lightly tase your child and then sort of like, you know, they have little tickle days. It's a little more than a tickle. It does stop. It does like, you know, freeze up the muscles. They have, um, adorable little trained like Rottweiler puppies. They're like, yeah. Yeah. So, and so then you're now then after that, usually that fixes everything. It's like, you know, I'll call the kid cops. All the kid cops. They just know not, they don't fuck around. No, you don't want to fuck around the kid cops. They're, they're fucking hardcore. Actually, they're very, though many of them aren't kids. They just like very tiny adults. That's such a great skill. It's like, why be a jockey when you can be a kid cop? I know. I mean, I wish I were like much, much, much. I mean, you obviously have to be very small to pull it off, but most of them are legitimate kids, like very, and they're, most of them are just trying to help. You know, there are a few bad apples in the mix, but you do get that one kid. It just seems to be into power and stuff. But, you know, they'll like fucking like take all the kids, take the Halloween candy. You're like, no, I just, you know, I was calling you guys just because like, he ate too many treats before bed and then they confiscate all the kids toys and Halloween candy because, you know, he broke the law and like they have to, they're allowed to like take it as evidence. It's so, but that's most of them are good. It's just taken with them. What? Well, they could just take the kids with them and they can, they can become kid cops themselves, right? Is that a thing? Well, that's how you get kid cop. I mean, that's like, I think the fourth violation. They are allowed to take your child and train the child to become a kid cop. They wipe their memories. They don't suffer over like missing you. That's good. They wipe your memory. So you don't even know you had a child. A lot of people, you, you could have had kids and you just don't even know it. Like, oh, they, they get rid of all the pictures from your phone and stuff. And like, yeah, you probably had kids. Many people don't know they were parents. They like, How would I, does anybody know at all? What if I get an MRI? Uh, no. Yeah. Like a couple of years ago, you could go in and like find out if you had kids now. They've gotten much better at like doing a full array. So you just have no idea. If you're married, they'll like, you know, exit, they'll like do a divorce. You won't even know you had a wife or met the person. It's like, eternal's whatever of the spotless, whatever. It's like that. Man of the internal sunshine, black. Um, yeah. Men of the internal black sunshine. Men of men. Mem. Mem of the internal meme of the internal meme of the internal meme of the internal black sunshine is the, that, that Norwegian. Uh, black metal band that killed themselves by like throwing themselves into the bin of rabid squirrels, most hardcore mass suicide I'm aware of in human history. But you know, that's those squirrels do get eaten and they, those are the best tasting squirrels I've heard. Oh my God. When you taste the meat of a squirrel that is eaten like a death metal or black metal musician, there is nothing like it. I'm not advocating it. It's horrible. The practice is terrible. A lot of bands that I've loved have just become squirrel food, but whoa. That is why I'll just say I've got tickets to Norway. Are you kidding me? You're going to do it. Am I going to Norway just for, just for two nights? Johnny, that's fucking expensive though. Man, that's not cheap. Me. Well, you know what? Just figured I got a, you only live once all this COVID stuff has made me think about you just got to have some rabid squirrel meat once in your lifetime. You got to go to the nonce and have that. To nonce, to nonce. It's just such a fucking beautiful city. What the less is more, that's their saying, but my God, when I, when you taste that squirrel meat, you want more. You don't want less. It's just, it's just flavorful, I guess is the best way to put it. It's like pork, really. Come on. It's almost, oh, I would never say, I'm saying it now. So I don't have to say it then. I'll delete it. I'm getting it out. Aaron, I know you were supposed to say reverse when he said that or just put a little bleep over it because fuck, dude, you don't like, if they even heard this, you, you're going to get your visa revoked. I'll probably be crying. They say if you don't cry, then you have to stay there. You, you, you stay until you cry. You, which is not the worst. I mean, honestly, like that's what's funny about it is everyone wants to stay into nonce. So they try not to cry. When I started crying, that's the how it works. If you try not to cry, you cry. So if you go in thinking like, Oh, I'm going to cry. And you might last a while and you get to eat for three days free. I knew one guy for three days free. Oh, yeah. Pratt's old 10 year. Yeah. Pratt's old 10 year, but he found out they found that he had tear ducts surgery and you know, he has tear ducts removed. Yeah. Yeah. He has squirrel food now, buddy. Are you fucking kidding? He offered himself. No, he didn't get an option. Oh, right. It's different over there. You know what? Don't go to the NOSC with your like whatever your particular like the cultural norms of where you come from because they don't give a fuck. If you're polite, if you weep, if you don't say what you just fucking said, Aaron, definitely take that out, please. If you don't say what you just said, you will have a great time. But yeah, don't go over there. Like thinking you're going to try to trick them with a tear duct removal scam. They've started implementing a tear test. You have to pay for it yourself, but you have to do a tear test. Good. I think it's great. It makes me feel better knowing I wouldn't want to go in there. Let's say I had an emotional detachment and I couldn't cry. Then I wouldn't want to go in there because I wouldn't. The whole idea is I want to cry. So why would I? You're going to cry. I don't care how hardened you may be. When you taste a dinosque squirrel, you're going to be crying. You need some, you know, actually Kleenex is like that. They have a, they just moved like they're an entire facility to do the not it's kind of awesome. That's so cute. I love when they do stuff like that. I was like, Hey, I wonder why we're needed here, but we're going to go over here, wink, wink, wink. Yeah. Kleenex is always nearby in dinosque. By the way, uh, if you are interested in taking a trip to dinosque, uh, Johnny is, so when are you leading the dinosque culinary expedition? As you call it November 1st, 2023. It's going to be me, um, Simon Pegg and, um, uh, Rachel Brosnahan from Miss Maisel, we're doing it together. It's going to be a, um, Amazon prime special. How many splots do you have? How many slots do you have? Uh, I don't know. It's filling up. I'm not really sure, but it's, uh, I think booking hasn't opened yet. It opens on black Friday. Okay. So friends, if you want to go to dinosque, eat some of that incredible squirrel flesh, weep with Johnny. We've Simon Pegg, Rachel Brosnahan, weep with Brosnahan. And like, uh, you do a lot of other stuff there too. Don't you also like do standup or something after the meals? Or do you guys do something on a show?

389^1^"Duncan Trussell Family Hour - David Silver and Raghu Markus in ""Talking Gurus"" Transcript and Discussion"^2014-09-10^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, my dear sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Does this sound better? I hope this sounds better. I've been working nonstop on getting my studio up to bar. I'm trying to get a podcast studio where I can capture the angelic higher frequencies that I can channel the divine consciousness, alien intelligence, and demonic entities in a way no longer disrupted or obstructed by cheap, low-quality crap sound. The more I get into this process, the more I realize that it is a never-ending refinement. It's a kind of alchemical lead into gold process where the more you work on it, the more you realize you need more stuff. So what I've done is I've got foam all over the walls of my podcast studio. If you've heard me talk about that a lot, it's because I'm proud of the fact that I have foamed the walls. It looks cool, man. I wish you guys could see it. Soon you will see it. Foam looks psychedelic. It feels like I'm in some kind of futuristic, cobalistic foam hive, or perhaps I'm underneath DARPA. It's a beautiful colored foam, too. Purple and gray. It looks so cool in here. I can't wait to get cameras set up. I've got lamps hanging from the ceiling with candles flickering in them. I've got incense, urns. I have an Oriental carpet, which I took from my mom's office where she used to practice psychology. And that is what the table with all my gear is currently resting on, though I intend to get a brand new table. And I intend to get whatever it takes to fully capture that sweet, deep, awesome sound that podcasts you know and love, like the Mark Marin podcast or the Joe Rogan experience, like they have, that kind of resonant, deep, awesome sound. I feel like I'm approaching it, but I'm so very far away. I tried recording a podcast today, a craftsman with Brendan Walsh and Johnny Pemberton. And as it turns out, one of the microphones was broken. And I didn't even realize that until I sat down with them today and saw there was a massive difference in sound. The whole point is I'm going to make this podcast room a conduit, a channel. I'm thinking about hanging crystals on the fan. I want it to be a summoning room. I want to summon entities. As all of you know, all of you artists out there, anyone who's been engaged in any kind of creative activity, mothers, anyone who's experienced life growing inside of them, or anyone who's lost time and come to after having created something for better or for worse, you know that when you enter into the state of creation, you're no longer there. Your ego evaporates and you become a kind of window to some other creative dimension. And that's the place where the ideas come from. That's the place where the art flows. That's the place where the, as Terrence McKenna calls it, the niagras of epiphanous beauty accessible via dimethyltryptamine comes rushing into this dimension. But you don't need dimethyltryptamine. I think you just need a sanctum, a alchemical laboratory, some place, wherever it is where you can set things up in a certain way to focus your creative energy so that it comes blasting through your ego and no matter how you try to resist that flow, it overcomes you until just for a little while you're gone. And in that place where you're gone, the good stuff can come through for a little while. And then once you realize that it's overcome, you can squeeze your little asshole-like ego shut again and seal the portal and go back to your normal life. But I think this is the idea when you hear about magicians or wizards or people who practice high magic emphasizing the importance of a ceremonial chamber. And you've seen no doubt in videos or in movies the, you know, floor with a pentagram or the strange esoteric chalk drawings of the Anokian names of the angels and the Anokian spirit board that you may have seen behind the drummer of tulle or perhaps you have seen in different bands when they're performing live. They create a very specific setup for their instruments that doesn't seem just based on acoustic logic but apparently is set up according to metaphysical principles. And I think there's something to be said for that. I think there's something to be said for in your life creating just a little space where you can connect to the rest of the universe instead of being locked down to your tiny little meat body and all the various pains and ailments that are assailing you at any given time. And mostly those pains and ailments, if you think about it, you forget about them so quickly that they're not even important anyway. But we spend so much time locked down, tied up with whatever our particular dramas are that you almost need a complete change in your surroundings to expand or swell outside of the little coiled up narcissistic neurotic little French fry that we all happen to be. That thing with a name and a social security number. That thing that is essentially a window like a dirty dusty muddy little window that looks out into the human dimension. But what is looking out of the window and what is the window, what is the window made of and what is behind the window? What is that? Here's this world that you're peering out into the big eye, the eye that you can't look at, the thing they call the ottman. Here's this world where there's sunsets and sunrises and moons and cars and stop lights and orgasms and butchers and a Starbucks and Apple updates and brand new video games and jobs and heartbreak and love and birth and death. Here's this world that we're staring out at but doesn't it feel like you're looking out a window and you can't turn around to see where you came from? What's that? You're a window that can't look at itself as they say. And that thing behind you, who knows? Is it like an Alex Gray painting? Maybe it's some kind of beautiful embryonic ever expanding placental warmth that we all swim through and from time to time we stick our sentience out of the windows of whatever human form we've currently incarnated in and gaze into the world. I'm forgetting that we are just looking out a window just like a child in a nursery or somebody in a beautiful mansion staring out for a little while at one of their incredible views. Maybe your entire life is nothing more than one of the millions and billions and trillions and exponentially infinite views that the universe which you are gazes out on from time to time. That means infinity in the process of ever expanding creation. Maybe that's what's going on. Maybe you have forgotten that you are the eternal witness and your power of attention is so potent that whatever it falls upon springs to life. You're like a window God's looking through but the very attention of God is so powerful it's brought the window to life and that dusty thing is what you think you are. We've gotten confused that's all and all the various dirt and dust and mud or whatever happens to be honest that's what we call our ego and our personality and that's what's called getting stuck. We get stuck on these little particles clumped up on the window that the universal consciousness is gazing through. And so the next time you find yourself in a state of jealousy procrastination in a state of fear if you're worried over a health issue if you're scared about. A job situation if you feel lonely usually it's an anger response for me but if you're feeling that thing where you're locked down then what's happened is you have narrowed your. Field of pure awareness down to a tiny little fleck on the window of on one of the millions of windows on the. Cathedral or mansion within which dwells the great Holy Spirit that has been written about in so many various scriptures and in so many different ways that tiny little that argument you got in with your girlfriend or the. Lost of a loved one or the. Evaporation of something you dearly cared for. Believe it or not that is one tiny little fleck of dust and compared to what you actually are at least that's what the mystic say and I gotta tell you I felt like a mystic this weekend because I went to. This beautiful beautiful spa and I go to the spa every once in a while especially when I've been on tour and I need to. Get all the toxins out of my body all the weed and booze and speed I just need to sweat it out all the Adderall and whatever ended up getting into my body I gotta do what I can to just squeeze that shit out and so. I go to these spas now I know a lot of people here I went you went to a spa will look at you you go to a spa oh you got a massage will look at you. That was a I know people who are like that who feel that. You know splurging from time to time so that you can like detox and slow down not be caught up in the. Insane whirlwind of human existence is somehow a sinful activity they think that the way you're supposed to be spending your time is in a constant state of. Coiled up tightened anus like tension and that your entire life should be spent running around whatever particular. Reality tunnel is Robert Anton Wilson calls them running around that reality tunnel like a frightened little hamster jumping on your job wheel and screwing off to. Take care of whatever business you have at home and then jumping on that wheel again and if you take any time not doing that and I'll start calling you a god damn hippie. A lazy slacker a an indulgent piece of shit and they'll get really mad because you're a lot of people apparently especially in this country feel like you're supposed to be. A worrying oily gear and a meaningless massive machine which we call capitalism and unless you're spinning those gears and just get it just rushing as fast as you can towards that sweet comfortable coffin. Then you are up to no good you're a drug at a lazy turd I obviously don't subscribe to that theory I say do it if you can scrounge up the money figure out a way to do it. I think you can figure out a way to at least get a massage from time to time they're super important. I forget to get them but I really went nuts and I got a watsu massage a watsu massage. Let me tell you what this is if you don't know it's called what it's water shiatsu and basically what it is is you go into this pool and this German lady. Does acupressure and drag while constantly dragging you through this warm water and holy shit. I didn't I you know I remember when I was a kid my mom there was a sort of re birthing craze is and like my mom and all her friends were in this frenzy to go to these re birthing chambers where you listen to the sound of the womb and heart beats and. I don't know people would bang gongs and you would float there in the warmth and basically you could go back to the pre birth where you are floating in your mother's womb. Which was probably a wonderful time but they went crazy for this for a while because if you could basically experience birth again and the trauma of going from this nice warm. Darkness into the explosive horrifying oxygenated environment that so many babies are blasted into where doctors wearing blue and gas masks basically alien like creatures I think this is what alien abductions are. I think it's people are re reconstructing their birth experience because if the last thing I want to see if I'm sliding out of a vaginal water slide that just opened up to me because that's I think that's what happens if you're if you're a fetus if you're a baby and you're floating in that sweet womb in that warmth. It's basically like being in an aquarium where a trap door opens up and the trap door leads to a water slide that's too tight for your body squeezes your head and the next thing you know. Guys that look like reptilians wearing latex gloves or yanking your up until that point supremely relaxed body out of a bleeding broken vagina. Swatting you maybe cutting off the tip of your penis it's a real mess and then they shove you in the arms of your potentially super doped up mommy and by then you're screaming at the top of your lungs because your entire universe is shattered. It's exactly like being abducted by an alien and so I can understand wanting to go back into that space. I think that's what what's who does you just sort of get pulled around this pool by this German lady. I don't know I keep saying German lady but she was a German lady she had a German accent she was this fit thick you got to be if you want to yank my flabby body through mineral water you're going to have to be fit and she was. She pulls you around so there's this constant feeling of movement and then you start experiencing the kind of. Disassociate of losing your body that you experience when you are in a flotation tank and then I don't know but something happened in the midst of all that where it felt like I popped out of the little eye for a second. And really was just some kind of I felt like an Alex Gray painting and I wasn't on anything at all I really felt like I was in some kind of bardo or something and that's when I realized that. Human beings are windows that's not it I'm sure I've read that somewhere but human beings are windows that God gazes through that every human incarnation is one of the windows in the great mansion. That the universal consciousness lives inside of in the experience of being alive is the experience of God gazing through the window of yourself into whatever particular reality tunnel you happen to be existing in. Did I just read cosmic trigger by Robert Anton Wilson yes and much thanks to the sweet fellow who brought that to me when I was on the road. Also I think that I'm allowed to do these kinds of intros with podcasts that Ragu Marcus and David Silver and because they're two of the most profoundly spiritual. Beautiful people that I know and they're both teachers of mine who thank God I ran into and you have done so much to help me grow at least a little bit. They've at least sort of dusted off some of the sludge that was encapsulated on my dark heart and for that I'll be eternally grateful and I think the reason they're able to do that is because they came into contact with a being that. Managed somehow to completely clean his window off and that happens from time to time where either I don't know how you do it but from time to time certain humans have very clean identity less ego free. Windows and name Carolee Baba also known as Maharajie was one of these beings and if you had a if you were lucky then you got to hang out with that guy for a little bit while he was embodied and was a window you got to actually be around someone like that and everyone I've met who's come in contact with that person. They all have been touched and you can almost see his fingerprint in everything they do so you can kind of get to know him in a way just by being around people who were around him and that that's a real thing and it doesn't just have to be some kind of mystical. Woohoo stuff either it's if you get around a child for example. If you don't need to be around the child's parents to know what their parents are like. If you get around a dog you don't need to be around the dog's owner to know what the dog's owner is like and in the same way. If you get around people who've come in contact with an awakened being and yes I do believe those beings exist on planet Earth and yes I do believe that from time to time if you're lucky you get to meet them. If you've been around a being like that long enough and the being leaves a thumbprint on you a kind of fingerprint and and then you go out into the world and and people who meet you. They get a little bit of the thumbprint to and I think maybe over time that thumbprint runs down I don't know maybe over time the thumbprint ends up just doing the exact same thing report DNA does which is that. Every time it prints out new cells as we get older and older and older every time the great spool of meat the meat printer that is our DNA. Spits out a new version of you you get a little bit lighter and a little bit more run down and that's called getting old it's just the same thing as when the ink runs out of a printer so. Maybe that happens to and that's why sometimes when you come in contact with people who claim to be from this religion or that religion or followers of this guru or that guru. It feels like you're listening to a radio signal that is very dim but what's really cool about meeting people who've been around Maharaji is the radio signal is so clear and so loud that it actually helps you in some way. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I've got pictures of that guy all over my house and I go to these Ram Dass retreats and I guess you could even call it my religion. Though I don't like the term religion that much and I think it's a confusing word but. I think I'm allowed to do kind of spiritual rambly rants like this whenever these guys are on because they really did get to come into contact with something. Massively profound and that's why I love talking to them and that's why I love. Sending out their frequency to you guys because I think a lot of you really love the Ram Dass camp and all the all the cool stuff that those guys have to say. What do they always say they say some version of this beautiful roomy poem they say do not feel lonely the entire universe is inside you. Stop acting so small you are the universe and ecstatic motion set your life on fire seek those who fan your flames. So I'm excited about this podcast and again thank you to all of you who came out to see me performing on the Southern Glory tour with Johnny Pemberton and thank you to all of you who gave me awesome stuff. I have not gotten around to reading some of this the comic books and books that you gave me. I have a CD that I need to listen to that was recorded by a person who listened to this podcast who's no longer in this dimension. I've got it in my computer I just I just uploaded it so know that I'm going to listen to that if you're the fellow who gave me that CD and I love you guys and as always I'm eternally grateful. That you have given me the ability to have a job like this because I can't think of anything more amazing and beautiful. I could think of some things that would be more amazing and beautiful but the technology for those things doesn't exist in this dimension. For example I'd like to travel to Sirius and and check out whatever star it is that Robert Anton Wilson thinks the Illuminati came from. That would be pretty cool but since that's probably not on the horizon for me or any of us existing today I'll take having the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and getting to come into contact with you guys and getting to introduce folks like Raghu Marcus and David Silver to you.

And now please everybody welcome to the DuncanTrussell family hour the return of the mind rollers themselves. David Silver and Ragu Marcus. Welcome back to the DuncanTrussell family hour podcast. It's the DuncanTrussell family hour podcast. Ragu and David. Welcome back to the DuncanTrussell family hour podcast. Hi. How's it going? Hi. Hi. Great. It's great to be on the show. It is, really. Glad to be back. Were you both in New Mexico? No. Just I. Yeah. Ragu. I was in New York, which is an older, no actually it's a much younger place to be, right? No. The oldest continuously settled town in America is Taos, New Mexico. Oh, wow. I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. And why were you there, Ragu? Why was I there? Well, there is a honeymoon monkey temple there. And I like honeymoon. So I decided that I was going to go there because we were celebrating what the Hindus celebrate every full moon in July, which is honoring the universal guru. So off we went and did a bunch of chanting and hanging out and partying and it was divine. Absolutely divine. How do you celebrate that? What are the ceremonies involved? We're Americans, so we don't know from any ceremonies. We don't do any ceremonies. The only thing we know how to do is what did we do? Chant. We don't know how to do anything else but chant. Now, we do know a couple of, we do know the guru. It's called the guru prayer, which basically besieges the guru to speed us along our trail so that we're able to be of some usage to our fellow humans. That's basically what the guru does. Can I hear a sample of the prayer? Really? Yeah. Well, here's one. There's a few of them, but I'll give you one. Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo, Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat, Param Brahma, Tasmay Sri, Guruvee, Namaha. Oh, yeah. I've heard that. You've been to India, so it is done everywhere, every night, every household, every temple for Hindus. But isn't it usually, I've heard it on a Hari Krishna album that... Yeah, George Harrison, right? He did that great, you know, that... David, what's the song? My Sweet Lord. Yeah, My Sweet Lord, yeah. David, do you know this prayer? I do, and I love it, because for some reason, it just calms me down, which is a very rare event. Will you guys say it together one more time, please? I can't do it off hand. I can. Let's hear it, Raghu. Oh, my God. Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo, Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat, Param Brahma, Tasmay Sri, Guruvee, Namaha. And basically, it just says the Guru is everything. It's every aspect, you know, Guru Brahma, the Creator, Guru Vishnu, the Preserver. So it's really identifying the Guru with every aspect of the universe, every face of every part of what is divine. And it's saying basically that, you know, the Guru is one with it all. So you ask the Guru to give you the grace of becoming one with the Guru, therefore then becoming one with the universe. So, you know, the most famous thing, and you know, that's all just Hindu stuff, you know what I mean? It doesn't really, it doesn't apply to us because we're Westerners. But where it does apply is in what a great saint, Ramana Maharishi said from the last century, God, Guru and Self are one. So once you get that, then you start to get the reason why we do anything to try and find out who we truly are. Is there, is it can, there's so many Gurus living today, Gurus that have appeared on this planet. Are they all considered to be ultimately just one person? That's a very good question. I mean, it's your question is like an up level question. Yeah, they are ultimately that is absolutely correct. But it's correct for every one of us. We are all already that, right? But isn't it that our identities are sort of, we're more attached to our identities are we have become more involved in polishing our identities or refining our ego structures. Whereas the Guru has somehow subverted that instinct or has freed themselves from connecting with that appendix like useless or unfortunate thing that we're all stuck to. So, for example, Neem Kali Baba, Ramana Maharishi, how do you say Maharishi? No, Maharishi Maharishi Maharishi. Yeah, these Gurus are, were they more connected to this oneness in the sense that they, they felt each other. They were the same thing. They were, you know, less fingers and more the hands, so to speak. Did they know, did they feel this? When you talk to Neem Kali Baba, are you talking to Christ? Are you talking to all the Gurus that have ever lived, the ones we know of and the ones we don't? Well, I think I have a feeling about that. Yeah, you know, everybody's got their own, you know, it's, it's like a channel, really. I mean, you attract, they attract you. That's at least what people believe. And I do believe that. So, some Gurus are not attractive to some people. Not because they're any less, but because, karmically, you were in their family for thousands of generations. So, for instance, one of the Gurus, Shirdi Sai Baba, who's my Guru, I guess, partially, there's a story about him being in his Mandir in Shirdi, which was really a ruined temple that he lived in. And he would, you know, show love and grace to everyone, but occasionally someone would come and he wouldn't let men, or he'd actually jow them and say, you know, go away. I don't want to see you. And one of his devotees asked him one time, how could you refuse someone? You're a Guru. You are the epitome of the universe. You are the symbol of love and the actual actualization of love. How dare, how could you refuse someone? And he said something that I thought was very fascinating. He said, well, I only administer to those who've been in my family for thousands and thousands of generations. I know who they are. And sometimes I will refuse someone because I don't recognize them. Which sounds counterintuitive. But when you think about it, everybody's got a different path. We're all at different stages of our long reincarnational journey. So it makes sense that some people would be sort of custom fitted for one. I mean, there are certain Gurus, and I'm not going to mention them because I don't want to offend anyone out there, who I don't have any connection with at all. It doesn't diminish them, but it diminishes their impact upon my life. There has to be a reason for this. You know what? I want to do what's called a disclaimer right now. Okay. And David, you and I were talking earlier, just really a few hours earlier, about the fact that we absolutely know nothing about anything. And that the fact that we should say anything to anybody, that we potentially think would put them in some kind of state of understanding, is so foolish. You know, it's absolutely foolish. So with that disclaimer, that now I'm going to say what my puny little mind has fathomed about this. And one thing is you're being very general Gurus, right? Yes. Okay. There's, you know, there's, you know, there's the local soccer Guru, right? Right. He's part of it too, right? In terms of your definition. Yes. So that word means absolutely nothing in India, in anywhere. Absolutely zero. That is strictly a Madison Avenue term at this point. Okay. What means something is what, and what I think you're saying is somebody who is absolutely not caught in any kind of duality whatsoever, they are beyond, able to live on this earth beyond any kind of relationship with the dual nature of, you know, that's created by ego, mind, right? It's always us and them, subject to object, all that shit that we deal with day to day. Okay. So there are people who are not at all subject to that. I haven't got there. I haven't the slightest idea. Okay. I don't know any, you know, have no idea. But I met one more than one. Actually, I've met a three that I know of that I actually met. And they all had this, you know, the same thing going on that you could experience that I could never explain what it is. But in terms of thinking about it with your mind, these people are what's called an India Sidist, which means accomplished being. So they are, there's not a lot of them. There was in the last century. Now, you know, I mean, I don't know of anyone, but that doesn't mean anything because some of these people just stay up in the, you know, deep in the glaciers, part of the Himalayas and caves. And, you know, that really happens. It absolutely does happen, but they don't, you know, they're not interacting with us peeps, you know, because they're not supposed to or whatever. So what do you mean they're not supposed to? Because like David said about Shirdi Sai Baba, who was one of those Sidists, you know, in the last and he died in the early part of last century. Absolutely. That there is, you know, if you want to project something that's really dumb and stupid that I should say, I mean, I'll say it. Maybe they all have a certain constituency of, of, of souls that they're guiding over, you know, millennium. They all have a role in, in, you know, they get a section, you know, maybe they get each person gets each being gets a section that they take care of. Now, I do know, I mean, there's this story of Shirdi. Is this interesting to anybody listening now? It's interesting. It's incredibly interesting. You're talking about this. It's, it's fascinating. You're talking about this kind of university comprised of amnesiac pupils who over the course of infinite lifetimes encounter specific teachers who are there. Who are there to lure them out of their amnesiac state. And the, and the mind, even though ultimately this kind of stuff is probably the same as playing marbles or something. The mind likes to consider the organizational, what would be what's the underlying organizational function in the universe that creates this specific state of infinity expressing itself, which is the human dimension. So I think it's incredibly interesting to, to, to every, it's very interesting. All right. So, so then in relation to David's, by the way, Dave, I never heard that story. That's a fantastic story. Actually, it, because it, it falls right in line with one thing that I know. I know name Karoli Baba said Maharajee said, which was, there was a guy, a man who actually was one of our mentors back in the day when we were there. And he used to be one of the Samadhi examples. I mean, Maharajee had a few people that in front of us, he just look at them or pop them on the head and they go into a deep trance like state, which is called Samadhi. Where they had no body consciousness. They were not conscious at all. In fact, we took, he, in one case, this particular man who I'm talking about, he did it. The guy fell over like a tree. He was, Maharajee told catch him. And then it took four or five strong young guys, we were in our early twenties to carry him into a room. He was like dead weight. And, and he was in that room and then we heard a bunch of smacking and laughing. Maharajee runs out of the room and this guy comes behind him like, you know, he's waking up from a stupor of some sort. And, and, and we've asked him where he said, I could never describe to you where I go. It's just not described, describable. Anyhow, Maharajee said about this guy. He's when they asked about why this could happen. You know, how does this guy go into these states and, you know, what is going on? And he said, I have, we have known each other for millennia, a lot in thousands of lifetimes. So that would kind of lend credence to David's story that indeed that, you know, Shirdi Sai Baba, by the way, Shirdi Sai Baba is different from Sai Baba. Sai Baba who just died within the last year or two is not Shirdi Sai Baba. I mean, and that's again, that's my, you know, bring in the disclaimer again, you know, that I should be saying like I really fucking know anything right about that. Except I, I actually had Darshan of Sai Baba, not Shirdi. He was like, you know, he had gone. And so I didn't feel anything like David says, maybe that, you know, you just don't, you know, feel anything, but, you know, I think you don't have to do the disclaimers because No, no, because as little as you may know, you are one of the very, you and David are one of the very few people that I have met who have come in contact with these beings. In fact, and I know maybe, you know, I know a bunch of them now that I've gone to these retreats, but yeah, so. You know a bunch of what? People who've come in contact. Yeah, right. And, and also, you know, I think that your, your, if you look at the states of awakening or whatever you want to call it. And you have the most asleep being whoever squeezed the trigger on the missile that took down that Malaysian flight. And then you have sort of radiating out from that state of complete lack of empathy and sort of a reptilian indifference to human existence. You, there's like a onion layer after layer after layer of these onions where you're not someone so awful that you'd shoot a plane down, but you're somebody who will at a moment's notice give somebody the finger and traffic. You're that upset about the minutia of everyday life that when you're driving down the street, you're boiling with rage. That's a pretty sleepy state to be in one that I was in two days ago. But then you, but then you sort of radiate outward from there. And then you start getting into a philosophical mindset or even a scientific mindset where you look out at the world and you're not cut up in the minutia of traffic or whatever society you're born into or whatever your particular economic situation is. And you begin to see the same thing as a kind of like amazing flow of energy that's happening on this planet. And that somewhere after that, when you start going out from those layers, that's where you have a David and a Ragu, and that's where you're seeing something even more. And you're not really sure what it is necessarily, but that's when you run into the guru or the person who's not even in the onion anymore. And this person is in some kind of super awakened, not even awakened state. Just somehow is part of this way that the universe is evolving or expressing itself or perfecting itself or purifying itself. That's constant growth from the core of complete deep sleep while awake to this completely awakened state. I think since you've come in contact with these beings, and because you have actually witnessed some of the things that they can do and what they teach, you are very, very equipped to talk about this, especially for people like me. Well, by the way, awakened state, I think is a great term. I like that. I mean, we use that and that's a great term about if you want to try and put into words what these beings, what's represented by these beings, you know, it is that. I think, Duncan, I think you don't you can't predict how it's going to happen really. I mean, not to be banal about it, which really means being totally banal. Really, I've had, we've had comments and stuff on our website from Duncan Tressel followers and many of them actually. And, you know, many of those comments have been very annoying to me. Hold on, David. I'm sorry. You're fading out there for a second. Some of those comments from your people who listened to your podcast have been very enlightening and very, you know, wise. And people might make judgments about these kind of things. Well, you know, people listen to Duncan, maybe, you know, are not the same as people listen to Jack cornfield. But in my experience in life, which is getting kind of long now, I'm always surprised by where it comes from and where it doesn't come from. Like one time I was on East 4th Street or 3rd Street in the East Village in New York many years ago. And the Volkswagen van, you know, one of those typical hippie vans pulled up beside me and out of it came three Hare Krishna people with Bhakti Vedanta Prabhupada, their guru. And he just walked right in front of me. Wow. I knew who he was. I'd seen him on some, you know, in some magazine or whatever. And I, I, he stopped right in front of me. So I kind of pronounced to him. I had great respect for him and and simply said, wow, I'm really amazed to just come across to you like this. And he smiled and he touched my head and then he moved on. Now, I have deep respect for him and for the Hare Krishna movement because they've done a lot to enlighten people. But I never went back to that. You know, I was never, oh, my goodness, my epiphany. Oh, wow. I'm going to go and become a Hare Krishna and do the head, the head, the, you know, the shade head thing and the saffron robes and all that. I didn't do it. And that was, you know, a decades ago. Doesn't mean I didn't feel great about it and wasn't sort of bothered by just jumping into him, but it didn't, it didn't fit for me for whatever reason. Whereas, you know, someone else did. So you never know where this is coming from. I mean, I get stuff from people all the time, you know. Now, Ragu said to me on time, something that I think you might find interesting Duncan, which is that we were talking about different, not let's stop using the word Guru, teachers, masters, ascended masters, whatever. The word Guru has really been, you know, lessened. But, you know, I asked Ragu, what was the differential, if you like? What was the thing that made a true master from eternity, if you like? And you said to me, Ragu, with something that's stuck with me for many years, which is a master of time and space. It sounds like a Marvel comic, doesn't it? But you were being very serious that these men and women, or at least men and women in their incarnation as they appear to us, are capable of leaving this realm and traveling in other bodies sometimes, in other places, at other times, of having simultaneous existences with different people at the same time. All these remarkable, miraculous things, these cities. And maybe that's one thing that we observe, which is that we can learn from teachers, we can learn from students, we can learn from just about anything. We can even learn from John Oliver on HBO or John Stewart, if you like. Yes. And I do, I love John Oliver, by the way. But when it comes to this other thing, when you're privileged on some level to meet one of these incredible beings, the effect upon you is very powerful and lasts for the lifetime. You know, you can't get away from it. It doesn't mean that it's a hierarchy. It just means that, you know, there are different sort of manifestations. Well, it's, if you were in a dream, have you ever been in a dream and realized you were in a dream having a conversation with someone in the dream? Yes. And it's one of, like, I've had that happen, and then I've had the thought in my mind in the dream where I'm talking to this other person and I think, wait, who am I talking to? This is a dream. You're me. I'm talking to myself right now. And that's a really incredible moment when you realize that this entire universe that you're existing in, the dream universe, is a dream, especially when it's a bad dream. And you get that, I don't know if you've ever had that happen where you're having, like, some awful experience in a dream getting eaten by an alligator, finding out that, I don't know, you owe 50 million dollars. 50 million dollars for gambling debts. I don't know if you ever had that happen in a dream, but then suddenly you get this moment where you're like, oh, this is a dream. And the whole thing goes from being a nightmare to being amazing. And so in the same way, this idea of oneness, are we all spring from this one being and the guru being, as you're saying, a master of time and space with all these cities that some people listen with great skepticism. When they hear stuff like that, they can't imagine that things function differently than what they've experienced up until this point and what they've been shown in the textbooks and on the TV. But in a dream, if I came to someone and said, oh, I was having this incredible dream where a person came to me and began explaining to me that I was in a dream. And then as part of this explanation, walked through a wall or levitated something or read my mind or did some incredible act, the person would be like, yeah, that's pretty cool dream, but it wouldn't seem insane to them. But this dimension that we're in right now, we're so convinced it's real. That's one of the qualities of it. And it seems like these gurus are just parts of ourself, parts of the universal mind that have somehow managed to recognize that they're in a dream. And fully recognize that they're in a dream. And then they're going around at the other little different parts of themselves that are still believing that they're in a dream and telling them, oh, no, this is, you're going to wake up. This is it. You're about to wake up. And the guru, for whatever reasons, decides to stay in the dream. They don't wake up. They don't go out. They stay here for some reason, which is a curiosity to me. Well, that's a curiosity altogether, since I haven't any idea of what you're talking about. But really? Yeah, really. Well, I mean, this whole existence that we're in right now is been compared again and again and again to a dream, a dream state, a dream state. And you've said to me, we're all part of one thing, like pixels and some grand unified consciousness. And some of these pixels and this net of existence or consciousness are more awake than other pixels. Some of these, some people are more awake. They're waking up from a dream. And that's what I've always thought of the guru possibly as being somebody who is you is you. Isn't that what you were just saying with that prayer? The guru is you is everything. No, the guru is every aspect of the divine. That does not saying the guru is you. It's the guru is every aspect. Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Deva, Maheshwara, that's Shiva. Guru Sakshat Truth, Param Brahma, beyond creation, beyond the two. Tasmay Sri Guruvenima, I bow to that guru who represents that. This whole, this whole non dual thing of a you are the guru. That's not what Ramana Maharshi was saying. I mean, it's very, it's so that's why I give you this disclaimer constantly because it's impossible from our puny points of view to actually have a words that can describe what you're trying to describe. And there seems to be manifestation of very few people over time constantly who act in a way that allows awakening to happen. They act out of the you out of from the one completely from the one. So by the way, Dave, I never heard that. I never heard what you said about my description of the guru because if you had asked me right now, I wouldn't have said that at all. I would have said what I actually, because Neem Karoli Baba said the true guru, in other words, complete the Siddha, that who is beyond two. The true guru is what they call in Sanskrit or Hindi, knower of all hearts. Okay. And they can absolutely completely awaken you. And that knower of all hearts, meaning they know every incarnation you've ever had, everyone you're going to have everything. There's nothing unknown. They are completely one with that because they are beyond duality. Okay. But that's where it gets confusing to me is we have these beings that are beyond duality. And that would mean that since they're beyond duality, they're all part of this one thing, which we are, which means that they are us. That's, but that's intellectual. We are on the, you know, ultimately who we really are. We are, but we are not. We are unfortunately unawakened to that. And while we are unawakened to that, we are not that. So we're the parts of the guru that haven't woken up yet. We're the parts of the one that haven't woken up yet. And the guru is just like Christ is the perfect example, right? He's the intercession. Hanuman, perfect example, the intercession between unawakadness and awakenness. When you wake up, do you become the guru? Yeah, you don't become the guru. That's the, it's just not the right term. You become the one, you become back to that, which is part of, and what is the one? I mean, the, you know, that's a whole other thing. What are we talking about? It seems to me in my experience, again, with the disclaimer, love is what we're talking about. And that's really what this fabric is. The one, the fabric of the one is that and just think of it yourself in the smallest circumstances. When you actually extend yourself lovingly out to another human, you are no longer in duality. You are one with that human. Yes, that's right. Okay, so it's as simple as that. Now, I have one other thing I just have to say because Dave brought up the Hare Krishna's. When was that Dave? Decades ago, you say? The Hare Krishna? 1968. Okay. So around that same time, I was a kid. The first thing I heard about in terms of spiritual path was these Hare Krishna people, right? So I decided, my friends, they have great food. We can have a Sunday brunch like you've never had. And I was like, great, let's go over there. So we went over there and you do have to do a bunch of, you know, chanting Hare Krishna, Hare Ram. And then we had this spread. I tell you, I was at that place every Sunday at the Hare Krishna Center. I mean, it was fantastic. And as time went on and I went to India and so on, you know, we'd see them. Remember, they were in the airports. They were everywhere. They were in the airports. They were in India and we met them because we were also at another ashram nearby theirs. And, you know, and all these Westerners came over and it was, and then they came back and established themselves in the States in Virginia with this huge gold temple. And they were a laughing stock of any kind of path, period. Okay. Not, I mean, George Harrison seems to have made, you know, made something, made lemonade out of lemons. But this was a cultish, really dogmatic and narrow minded. Again, this is me talking and I'm sure I'll get mail about it. Actually, you'll hear the end of the story and maybe you won't feel so bad about me saying this shit. I was completely, had no respect all the way till recently because what started to happen was, because I'm into chanting and these kids that have grown up through the Hare Christmas, you know, and they washed away some of the bad shit that was going on in Virginia and, you know, a lot of the rap, you know, the really bad stuff, which I won't get into. Oh, I know about it, man. Yeah, I know. I can tell you some stuff about that. Yeah, right. So we don't want to do that. And but the fact is these kids grew up out of that, but they carry a different vibration. And I started to hear it when I started people are turning me on to, oh, you got to listen to this. They used to be in the Hare Krishna or they are in the Hare Krishna, but they're really cool. And this this new Swami came around who actually befriended Krishna Das, who was the eminent Chiang Kai in the world, from in the West rather in the world. And he actually was a very progressive guy about this. And so we started to feel, wow, maybe there's an opening. Anyhow, long and short of it is a friend of mine took me to a Hare Krishna Convocation about two months ago in nearby where I lived in North Carolina. Yes. And it's this incredible retreat center, 900 hotel rooms, 2,000 people in a hall of food, huge cafeteria. I mean, it was just right in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Fantastic. And I went there just because my friends, listen, you like Kirtan chanting, you're going to love this. And I said, OK, so I went there. And true to his word, there was these incredible chanting. And one guy in particular was some of the greatest thing I ever heard on that path. And then I started talking to these Swamis and one of them was out there giving a little talk to some people on the hillside. It was like this classic thing from the 60s. And all he talked about was, you know, he said the real thing about spiritual knowing that, I mean, you're doing the spiritual work, but the real thing about being spiritual, quote, unquote, is being kind to others. That's what he said. And I was like, oh, shit, this guy could be the Dalai Lama. I mean, he was, you know, he was an older Swami. He was German, actually. Anyhow, through that, it was really a day and a half. I absolutely, I was ready to get my hair completely shaved off and with a little duck thing on the back. Get those saffron rose. And because, you know what, they're right. I found out they're absolutely right. Well, that's a very powerful mantra. The mantra, well, it's known as it's called Maha Mantra, the big mantra, the great mantra. And they just said, look, you just got to do that because we don't know shit upon shit about anything. And there's no use trying to, you know, figure it out. So just do the mantra, which in the times of the Kali Yuga, which we're in, which is the age of destruction, which seems to be happening on a day-to-day basis, you know, this is, you know, your way through. So I've become a Hari Krishna. Congratulations. Hari Bo. You know, my first religious experience or awakening experience happened at Ahari Krishna temple. And it permanently changed my life. And I was surrounded by, you know, the devotees. And of course, some of them are fanatics. And still, because it is a dogma. I'm still dogmatic. I mean, I think there's open-minded people in it, just like any other religion. But if you want to go deep, deep, deep into a thing, you could definitely do it through ISKCON. And they won't, there's nothing there that will stop you. That is a water slide is deep into this stuff as you want to go. And that can be quite dangerous because so much of their system is based on the guru. One of the problems was that they were sort of licensing gurus. You know, they call them spiritual masters. And so much of Prabhupada's teachings revolved around devotion to the spiritual master. And this natural thing that happened with Ram Das and you and David, where you come in contact with this being who you've, you know, known potentially for an infinite amount of time, it gets transformed into a kind of systematic being assigned to a person. And that's where things, they ran into some trouble. But at the core of ISKCON and at the core of Bhakti Yoga, Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga is this chant. And when you chant regularly, you will change, your life will begin to change. You will begin to change. And I don't know why Krishna Das talks about it. I'm sure you know about it. I've got, I've, when I've been very active and focused and disciplined, I've gotten scared by the shifts that began to happen in my life and just the natural falling away of things that I was, that weren't so healthy to the point where I thought, I just don't want to go any further into this. It's too intense. I'm not ready. It's too much. You start having incredible dreams. You start coming into contact with other people. I mean, not to sound, look, I'm not afraid of talking about this stuff. I know some people feel like when they talk about the mystical, supernatural aspect of these practices, they get, they're afraid of getting written off. But I don't care if I get written off because I've experienced definite contact with some higher consciousness through chanting Hare Krishna. And it is weird. Maybe I'm weird. And that's just what happens when a weird person comes in contact with that stuff. That's exactly the case, unfortunately. Yeah, but I mean, the definition of the word weird is based upon conventional thought. You know, I mean, conventional thinking sometimes works, you know, help us navigate this, this planet that we're on. But the word weird and the word strange and the weird, all those things are usually judgments made by people who have not emerged from conventional thinking. Well, that's me. And I can remember. Well, it's all of us to some extent. I mean, you know, I don't think that I've emerged out of it. I mean, I like to think that when I go for the train into Manhattan, it's going to come on time. And that's conventional thinking. What the hell difference does it make if I'm late or if I don't get there? I can still stand there on the station and go into a higher space, but I can. The conventional thinking says to me, I want to go on time. I'm sorry, David. Can you hold on to. I'm sorry, you're fading out. Let's let the basically just I am much fading out in terms. No, you're, you're, you're David, your connection, your band, something went down. So you started to to flange out. Try again. Just simply put conventional thinking is the thing, the construct that makes us think that you know, immersion into some really deep and powerful potent thing, anything from a hard Christian to an ayahuasca experience is weird. And I still do that like that, you know, and, and, you know, someone recently accosted me at an event and said that had I done a particular substance and I said, no, and she, she sort of looked at me as if I was a weird person rather than the other way around, you know, you can take it any which way you want. You can get immersed in, in Hare Krishna and extend which appears to other people to be completely fanatical and crazy and is coming from that place of conventional thought. What I learned in the 60s and 70s, and I've retained at least some of it is that, you know, if it hadn't been for ingestion of surgic acid, repeatedly between the years 1967 and 1972, I wouldn't have had a clue about any of this. I would have just bypassed it and probably made a lot more money and been a lot more successful actually. But it wasn't to be because I got immersed in it via this, this sacrament, which it is if used correctly. And forever after to now, you know, have been, you know, felt very privileged to have entered this world which is inclusive of things that I didn't and still don't understand. But nevertheless, I know that just to sort of rely upon this, this life, this one life and all the traumas and neuroses and weird ambitions and desire systems that grip as 95% of the time is to me now a mistake to let that be your life. Nothing you can judge other people for doing that. That's just where they're at. I mean, people judge me for not having gotten into the Harry Christian movement, having met that guru or that master, actually having touched him, having had him look at me and talk to me on the street. I still didn't go there because it wasn't for me. It's not, it's not my groove. Wait a minute. That was Prabhupada? Yeah, he met Prabhupada. You met Prabhupada? I didn't get that part. Oh, I thought he was. Yeah, I met him on the street. He got out of a club talking bus. For those of you guys out there who don't know the history of the Harry Christians, quick summary, his, as he is called, his divine grace, AC Bhaktivedana Swami Prabhupada came to the United States, landed in New York with a, you know, I don't remember how much, but like 10 bucks in his pocket, met a family, he got to stay with his family and he started chanting in Central Park, chanting, Harry Krishna. And then this drew people too and people would come and sit around him and sing with him. And then he started his own spiritual center with devotees and sort of as people gathered around him, he began ratcheting up the intensity of the practice with these people. And the practices, at least the form that he is espousing to the world is one that is very much based on this devotion to the guru. And that's why they got in so much trouble because people were worshiping this guy. They were openly, publicly worshiping him. And that's what you do with gurus. What do you mean? This was no different. The difference is he wasn't awakened, period. I don't care what Harry Krishna people say. Oh, you're going to get punched by a Harry Krishna, Ragu Marcus. No, but you're talking about worshiping. All gurus get worshiped. That's part of the deal. Okay. And that's my opinion about him. And the reality is people, you know, in terms of knowing, there's a certain kind of knowing that you can have deep inside yourself. And that's your personal relationship with whoever. I mean, again, I don't even like using the term guru because it's so overused. But awakened being and, you know, you know, hopefully he is completely awakened. And if he's not, and if he's more a, he's still on the path, right? He's not completely awakened. If you're not completely awakened, then stuff happens, you know, and. And when you start saying you should worship me, you know, that's, that's where I think that. Did he say that? I know I'm, I don't, I'm going to misquote this. He didn't say it to me. He didn't, he didn't have time. He said, hello, how are you? But there you go. So he didn't ask me to worship it, but I get it, Doug. Can I know what you're saying? No, I, you know, it wasn't, he said that this spiritual center, there's a book that I read some time a long time ago about what happened, the process of the heart Christians of ISKCON starting. And at one point these people have been hanging out with this man. And I don't know when you met him, but, and at what point this was happening. This seems later on into the formation of ISKCON. He, you know, is kind of just this group, eclectic group of people. And then at one point he apparently just told them, you worship me like God. The guru is God. You worship me like that. He said it. He didn't like tiptoe around it either. He's just like, here's how we play this game. And so that's, you know, what you're saying, Ragu, whether or not he was awakened or not. I don't know, but I do know that there was a lot of, whenever you have to tell somebody to worship you, whenever you hear those words coming out of your mouth, chances are you're diverted from the right path. It's like, when you're with a, when in a bad role, you know, and when you tell someone to love you, if you're in a relationship that's weird and you want, and you ask someone to show more love to me, it's like, it's not, you know, that's a bad situation you're in. You want to, it should be this natural outflowing that comes when you come into contact with people that you love, whether they're an expression of the divine personality of Godhead, or whether they're your mom, or your aunt, or your girlfriend, or your wife, or your dog. Yeah, exactly, exactly, exactly. And that is, actually, that is precisely the truth, that you, it's all natural outpouring, natural flow back and forth, natural under, you know, I mean, my best example of that, jeez, I'm going to get killed, Duncan, from this, maybe you'll have to edit me out of all this stuff. But I, when I first went to India, I went to, there's another guru named Swami Muktananda who lived in Ganeshpuri in India, many people, today, her, his successor, Guru Mai, you know, has many, many, many international devotees. So he was a major figure for West, in the West. He came to America, actually Ram Das took him around, because he really liked him, and introduced him to his constituency. So I went there before I met Neem Karoli Baba, I went to that ashram. And, and I didn't know anything about anything, okay, I had just gotten to India. I couldn't, you know, Ram Das said, I don't know where Maharaj is, so just do your own thing, and I'll let you know. So, I was traveling around, just doing whatever, right, and I went to the ashram, and I saw, so okay, you can go meet the Swami, meet the Guru. And so, you know, they led me in a room, and there was people, it was kind of like, you know, a bunch of people, so it was a line, people were kind of seeing him, and then going to the side. And I saw they were all bowing down, and touching his feet. So I'm thinking, holy shit, is this part of the thing? I don't, you know, like I never seen anything like this before. Actually, that's not totally true. I did have an experience before, with another being who was a very high being, who none of this appeared to me the way that this did, where I said to myself, this is, doesn't, I don't feel anything. And I did it, but I was just really like, having no relationship with it whatsoever, except it was a mind trip. The next day Ram Das comes, I say to him, you know, I don't, what is this, bowing down stuff? I mean, I'm not at all into it. And I don't understand, he says, it's just, you know, the light in you honoring the light in them. Just think of it on those terms, he said. And then if you have a problem with it, good stuff to work with, anyhow. So treat it like that. Went back the next day, same thing, left. And it was at that moment Ram Das had given me the address to go see Nim Karoli Baba. So I went up to the mountains two days later, I'm walking in the ashram. And I'm sitting at this table where he used to tuck it, it's called wooden bed, plank bed, where he comes out and sits. And he came out. And I didn't even, it wasn't even a matter of thinking about, I was actually sitting down and he came and he was standing and then he sat down. I just jacked rabbit into the down position and, you know, it was just like, holy shit, this is this, this is it. You know, I mean, I had, I could do nothing else. There was no mind at all. This was honoring what it is, what everything in that moment, you know, I couldn't express it in words. I mean, to me, the thing was home. And I was actually bowing down to being at home again. Wow. That is so intense. That is, it sounds like almost like, it reminds me of the way filaments react to an energy field, like magnetic filaments. Exactly. Exactly. No choice. No choice. You have no choice. And, you know, and where I was before, I, it was, I was completely in my mind because I had nothing to do with him. And there was no, there was nothing going, I actually had one exchange with him where he said, where are you going? I said, well, I finally can go see my guru, even though I hadn't met him. I don't know how I said my guru. It was, you know, I knew Rondas and that was, you know, and he said in Hindi, very good. And I, he kind of, you know, I had a nice feeling when I left, but absolutely categorically, completely like I was a different human being. Wow. That is, I think, you know, some, this, that is to me so terrifying. The experience, I know it sounds ridiculous that I describe it as terrifying, but it's, you are, you know, to experience that kind of radical transformation of your life. Even if it is for the better, there's something in that shift that seems so, it seems so frightening. No, because you're being, you're, you're thinking about it and being dramatic. When you're, there was nothing, there was no thinking. And even after it happened, I mean, you're so happy as shit to, to feel this place which you've been longing for forever. You're just happy. Okay. Then you get fucked up after that because you start, you know, you see the mirror reflection of your mind and your crap. And it's like a horror. But, but certainly in the first, you know, and that goes, that's not all the time goes off and on, you know, feeling getting caught in your mind and not. And then, you know, and he, he sped all that up for us. He just sped it up and gave us a rudder and that rudder was that moment. And, and, and that those moments continued. So, no, it's nothing scary. It's scary doesn't come anywhere near that place. Well, let me just say, I think weird and scary aren't always bad. So when I say those things, I don't mean like getting chased by some guy with an executioner's hood who's got a hatchet or something. I just mean the kind of, you know, if I'm on a plane on a runway and the thing starts taking off and you go from this kind of, you know, going very slow to going incredibly fast acceleration is so breathtaking and intense. What you're describing when I hear it, I just get butterflies and it gives me a just, I think I would be, there's always a part of me that is so scared of getting taken in, you know, getting tricked or fooled. And it feels like there'd be some little corner of my mind shaking its head and watching me fall down and at the feet of the guru shaking its head and being like, Well, here we go. I have to admit to you actually something now that I had secretly gotten people to prompt you in ways that you, you know, would be too far out to talk about to actually get in touch with me originally and say, you know, I want to help you put some podcasts together. So can I do that? And I slowly and gradually have sucked you in. I wish. Oh my God. You know, the other side of that is that my ego would love that so much because it's like, they want me. Finally, someone wants me. But, but yeah, no, I know it's paranoia and insanity. It wasn't just the same on a much lower level, but you know, you fall in love for the first time or the 10th time or how many times you do. There are problems with that expression falling in love. It should be rising in love if it means anything to me. But I do remember a couple of times when I have fallen in love that, you know, it's not something you think about. You might think about it, but it gets convoluted if you say you just want to be with that person and everything else dims. And it's very natural, but it is a little frightening too, because you know, at some point it's going to mess you up. You know, it's very rare that you, as it were, fall in love and then it just remains, you know, equal for the rest of your life. It doesn't. It changes you and it makes, shifts you in such a way that you have to act differently if you really want to stay in any love that means anything with someone. So there is that sort of mix. That's an important thing you're saying. Well, maybe. The truth is that when I fall in love a few times that I have, everything else is irrelevant and no one can argue about it with you. You know, sometimes someone will say to you, why do you fall in love with her? She's so weird or she's so, you know, she's not good enough for you or she's too good for you. You don't like the way she dresses or whatever or she likes her uncle. People can just do that to you and you just look at them with that look of like, well, you know, you know what you can do? You can just fuck off because I'm completely in love with this person. I'm not really in love with you for saying this. So you'll kind of leave the room and I've done that because, you know, it's such a totally merchant. Now to make an analogy between that and one's relationship with a master may be vulgar. But there are some, there is some kind of real analogy here. Yes. That total feeling, as Ragu said, of being at home, falling in love is, you know, you do feel, oh my goodness, I don't have to look for anymore. I don't have to be alone. I don't have to do this or that. And here is this woman who I just want to be with. I adore her and maybe possibly she adores me, unlike it, but it happens. See, in this case, Dave, in this case, you absolutely know that that person, you are completely unconditionally loved. So that's where you take what you're saying and transfer it over like falling in love because that's that's what happens. You fall in, you rise up to whatever. And in that safe environment, that home environment, what you said is key that over time that you said within a relationship over time that love evolves. It continuously changes. And if it's a good relationship, it continually brings two people closer. So in the same way, what's necessary with this master guide, Siddha, whatever, we're trying to get away from Guru, in this situation with an awakened being and you fall into that place of awakeness with them, then there's a relationship between two people that, well, there's no relationship from the Guru, from the master point of view. But from the point of view of one who is not awakened yet, there is an evolvement that is guided by this being through all of life's events, everything that happens through your karma, everything that happens, everything you think, all of it. And it's guided by this rudder of that home. And you are so always at home that you're able to withstand the vicissitudes of what happens to us in our puny little incarnations. Well, you guys hit the lottery. Yeah, we did. The money. Yeah, where's the money? What happened? It's way better than money. What you're talking about is way better than anything. And I think people listening probably, even though it's so beautiful and inspiring, and I know that there is the idea that these gurus don't have to be embodied to have a relationship with them or experience them. But still, come on, man, we want that. We want to come in contact, not just with a disembodied consciousness, but that visceral moment of having your mind completely overcome by love, falling down at the feet of the master, experiencing this sort of collapse of your identity into a place where you're completely enveloped by perfect love. This is what we're all thirsty for. So it is a bit of a, these stories are so wonderful, but it's kind of like when you hear somebody who says they've been on a UFO. You're like, yeah, lucky you. I want to go on a UFO. I want to see this. I want to experience this. But isn't it true that some of us won't get this for maybe a million billion lifetimes? I don't know about that, but the reality is true because I have seen it. You do not need to physically meet. I personally know dozens and dozens and dozens of people, well, who never met in this particular case, named Karoli Baba, that have no different connection to him that I do or anybody. And the fact is that many of us, after name Karoli Baba left that body, we were so attached, I would say on average it took maybe 20 years, maybe more, to come to some understanding of reality regarding what we actually experienced. And I'll give you, this is the best example of it. And this is from, there's a llama named Suridas. He's a Tibetan llama. He's done extensive retreats. I mean, this man spent five years in a cave in France where they do these five-year meditations. If you can imagine being alone for five, never mind sitting. So he really put in the work, shall we say. He first went to India. He met name Karoli Baba. He met Maharaj. And then later, of course, he had Tibetan teachers and gurus and so on. But here's his story, which comes from, I'm going to promote a book in a minute. He went to see Maharaj. He went to somebody's daughter's house, an Indian man's house, where we were all gathered. They said, okay, just sit here in the living room and he sat at that same kind of table or bed that he would sit on. And just sit here. He's not available right now. And, you know, you can just relax. So he went right in front of it and he went in, he's meditated. He was always a meditator. So he went into meditation and he had deep experience of Maharaj, but completely as the universal one. Okay. Completely in a non-dual, his meditation took him to a non-dual place. There was no worshiping. There was no two. There was no in love with nothing. Okay. And he called that, oh, that's the big Maharaj. Then somebody said to him, okay, Maharaj is ready to see you now. And so he went into a room where Maharaj was. And he said he had to come down to relate with what he called the small Maharaj. And that is the real truth. Okay. That's, and it took us 20, 30 years to even get near that because of meeting him physically. You know, and there's still, we all still have some little place that people who didn't meet him in the physical don't have, and they don't have to deal with it. And they more easily in many cases can merge into that space. You know, if they're doing real practice, you know, it takes real practice, by the way, to merge into those kind of spaces as proven by this lama who did five years in a cave. So, and that's not what we should be doing necessarily at all. But we should understand that we can connect. And it is, and that home place is that love. I mean, Duncan, you were with me in Maui. We went and we saw Ram Dass. We had dimmered them one night, right? Yes. And we just hung out. And, you know, and it was just convivial love. Forget it. I think about it every day. So it was that space. And so in that sense, that is the Guru. Yes. That love, that what we shared in that moment, that's what it is. It's simple as that. And, and, and really, you know, being too dramatic about, obviously, there, everyone does have a guide. I say obviously for, you know, and that's a disclaimer, but it's, I mean, many, many people who know far more than I say the same thing. A guide is necessary to be able to become awakened. And so there has to be an interest on one's part to an awakened means just be, you know, kinder to the person next to you is awakened, right? That starts the awakened path. Well, and I think an important distinction, I'm sorry to cut you off, but that you've made is you say that to go into this space, practice is necessary. And people in the West who are accustomed to more of a kind of Judeo-Christian concept where all you need is this faith and an ephemeral thing and you're going to be fine. It might be easy for them to, as you're talking about this stuff, to think, well, all I need is to have some kind of just whatever faith and the idea that this be, I can connect to this being at any second. And I think that a big distinction here is that what you're saying is it's not enough to do that. You need to have an active practice to make this connection happen. Is that fair to say? Yeah, that's fair to say. Yeah, the active practice is defiable in many ways. You know, Judeo-Christian people who are kind and live out what they perceive as crusts, you know, behavior, that is a practice and a tough one. I mean, I've met real Christians and, you know, I can't possibly say about their practice that is inferior to, you know. I know. I don't mean real Christians. Well, I've met quite a few of them. And, you know, and Jews, too, who practice their thing and it's the height of folly to make judgments about an entire group of evil. It doesn't fit your taste, you know. Right. I'm sorry if that came off like I was judging them. In general, people, you know, do make these judgments. I don't because, you know, I don't have the overwhelming over, you know, fantastic knowledge that I can say that someone who is just simply kind to everyone and does it automatically without thought but with genuine unconditional love has got an inferior practice to mine. I was talking about those Bible tracks, you know, or like when you see the televangelists and they say, just say these words. Oh, dear Jesus Christ, please. But you know, there are lots of Buddhists that can make you crazy, too. And so those guys got on TV and they're just merchants, most of them. I'm not really talking about that. I'm talking about one of the doorman in my apartment building, for instance, who's not a merchant. And no, no axe to grind. So I'm just myself. I'm just talking to myself here. I don't want to segregate other people's idea of practice. Practice may well be just being kind to everyone and trying to advance love in your world in a real way. Practice without love is another story, you know. I mean, you know, that doesn't work for me. So if you're not showing love to people and you're not showing loving kindness to people in your life, then you've got a ways to go and I will make that judgment. Well, this is the idea of Paul versus James in the Bible. Faith or works, what's more important, you know. And I think it feels like what Raghu is saying falls more on the area of works. You've got to practice, whereas some people say you don't have to practice at all. You just have to have faith that things are going to be okay. So, yeah, it's two different ways of looking at things. Yeah, and there's a way in which we're slicing up the same piece of fruit, you know. I think the reality is, and David's comment, a part of his comment is the biggest truth, which is anything you do if it's not done from the heart. You know, if you're doing it from your head and your ego, you know, Ram Dass has a whole meditation for you these days. And for all of us, for that matter, which is getting your perspective, your vantage out of your mind and into the center of your chest, into the spiritual heart or soul, or whatever you want to call it, no mind. And it has to be done. So, mindfulness practices, which are really important for understanding, you know, getting at our true nature, which includes meditation. You know, I was going to say, I want to promote something. I've changed my mind about what I want to promote. I want to promote Joseph Goldstein's book, Mindfulness, because we're talking about, okay, if anybody asks you, what the hell can we do to just take step one? You buy that book, Mindfulness, Joseph Goldstein. It is absolutely a roadmap to balancing our daily life and getting to free, period. Now, you know, the Buddhist, of course, you know, this is, you know, don't take my word for it, he said, just do it. So it's very much, you know, the Tibetans, though, are all very much about, you know, having a teacher or having, you know, an awakened person guiding you. So there's different strokes there within Buddhism. But, you know, what we were particularly given was Buddhist meditation and the path of the heart in combination. And we've all, I don't, not all, all, but many of us have delved into using, you know, reading so that we can get some grasp of, and most of the reading is about who's made it. You know, we're not, we're reading about, I mean, certainly in my own case, you know, I love to read books either by really awakened people or biographies of who made it and what they went through and all of that. So we're not saying that the mind is, should be completely put aside. But for the most part, as they say, that's why Hare Krishna Hare Ram. In this, the dark age of darkness and destruction, repeat that mantra and, you know, all of you will get released. And so I, again, I've become a Hare Krishna and I, I'm completely, that's, I mean, that mantra, I learned this guy had a melody for this mantra, Duncan, that was just stupendous. And I made it my business. I got it off the net and made an mp3 and I learned every note of this thing. And that's all I do these days. You sing the Kirtan, the specific melody that goes. This guy, this guy had a, he had the best, what they call Bob, the best emotive expression towards that thing, which is. Can I play it on this podcast? You'll know, they think you're really nuts. I thought I'm nuts since the beginning, I'm sure. But I love chanting Hare Krishna. I'm going to send you the track. You know what? I'll actually cut a piece of it because it's an hour and a half. It's a perfect way to close the podcast. Okay, I'll do it. You too. I mean, I got to tell you, I'm so fortunate to have friends like you in my life. And as somebody who does, you know, probably because of my many terrible, awful things I've done, not just in past lives, but in the last couple of weeks, I'll never get to meet this being, except through you guys. And you know what? That's good enough for me. I feel very fortunate to have you as my friends. And thank you so much for always reminding me how absolutely neurotic and overly dramatic I tend to become about this stuff. It's so great. I'm going to do, I want to do one thing for you, though. Please. You know, Larry David, you've watched Curb Your Enthusiasm? Yes. Yeah. So there's the episode where he's trying to get his friend Richard up the list to get a kidney transplant. I haven't seen that. I haven't seen that episode. It's hilarious. Oh, you've got to see it. It's absolutely unbelievable. He becomes a Hasidic Jew just to, because it turns out there's a rabbi that's in control of the list at Cedar Sinai. And he turns, so he meets him and he pretends he's a Hasidic Jew and that he's going to do something for the guys foundation. Anyhow, it ends up into the most insane, because Larry doesn't know shit from Shinole about Judaism, even though he's Jewish. And it's insane. So I want to do the same thing for you, because you probably are at the very bottom of the list of people who will actually be able to meet the true Guru. So I'm going to, I'm going to push you forward. And I guarantee you, in this lifetime, you are going to meet an omniscient Baba, okay? Okay, that's, you guarantee it. I'm guaranteeing it. I'm putting you at the head of the line, okay? That's all it takes is for you to say that you guarantee it? Yeah, that's all it takes. Yeah. What do I get if I don't? Well, we'll have to really consider that in another lifetime or something. Well, thank you so much for putting me at the top of the list, Ragu. And thanks, Dave and Ragu, for doing the podcast.

390^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - MY MOM part 2 Transcript and Discussion^2013-03-18^Hello friends, and thank you for tuning in to the Duncan Tressel family hour podcast. I'm not gonna do any intro or Commercials for this episode. We're just gonna jump right into it stands on its own if this is your first time listening to the Duncan Tressel family hour you can find more information about the podcast at DuncanTressel.com Today's guest is a therapist writer and a mystic She Also created me inside of her stomach Everyone, please welcome to the Duncan Tressel family hour podcast my mom We're rolling hello Hello, Duncan. Hello mom so we are We are in a bit of a different Place than we were the last time you were on the Duncan Tressel family hour. Yes, we are You want to talk about what's different now? What's different is When you were here in September, I Was dying, but it was more of a hypothetical construct to me than What it is now because what it is now is that I am in bed and I have oxygen And I can feel tumors in my liver and Pinging bone pain all over my body So a lot of the physicality of dying is with me now. It was not with me in September when we had our first podcast together so there the reality of it is It's now a real thing Now it's not last time it was something that at least for me it felt like it was easy to it to Trick yourself into thinking that it was not you, but it was for me. It was like well this seems avoidable Yeah, I Don't think it felt avoidable to me then but I've just moved into a different stage of dying sort of actively dying now Even though that sounds like an oxymoron it does can you can you talk about that what what that means? It's really interesting. There's there a bunch of things that are happening that make it like that one of them is that Actively dying means that I can actively perceive my Physicality changing so I can I can feel That the physical is disintegrated Has disintegrated and is disintegrating minute by minute and It's in a particular way that doesn't have anything to do with my planning how it's going to go That's one thing that's happening, but also the as the physicality goes through its Sort of innate intelligence About what to do under these circumstances. There is a shining brightness in me that is Becoming more illuminated or really may be just more exposed as the physical becomes weaker and more diminished What I'm noticing as a brightness inside that shines brighter and Those are two things that are happening and They're in conjunction. I'm putting them together because they're in conjunction with each other the physicality seems to be related to the revealing of the lightness of the human being is The is that lightness that you're talking about is that do you think that that's your true identity or your soul or how would you Cat term that what is that lightness? Well, it feels true So in a sense it has a sense of me in it because it's still associated with me in this body And yet it doesn't to say that it's mine would be wrong. It doesn't belong to me It just happens to be showing up more clearly because I'm less focused on my various attachments to all the physical stuff which has been one of the Stunning things that I never considered when I came here was all the various filings and all the Amazing amount of work that goes into organizing your life before you die It shocked and horrified me to be honest with you when I got home from the island got back to North Carolina from the island And immediately was immersed in banking things and legal things and Center for end-of-life transition things and hospice that I was dismayed because I had spent my life more and more as a in a monastic environment where meditation and Solitude and silence and stillness Filled my day and now suddenly at the end of my life all the things that seemed all the things that I had moved away from where it forced back into my attention and I feared that it would be like that for the rest of my life and I thought this is not Surely this is not possible that I'm gonna be thrust back into the world here when I am wanting to Lie still and be with what's happening But yeah, but you still have to it's like in the way that you're talking about your physical body is beginning to Shutdown you had to actively shut down The your world you had to start dismantling every piece of your world Really simple mundane things little credit cards Bank stuff stuff that for a person who is about to cease to exist as a body Seems pretty irrelevant, but that was it's kind of as an example of what you are who you are as a person because a lot of People I think would just be like screw this. I'm just gonna die. I don't care about Organizing right now Kind of a heroic thing that you did. Well, I don't I don't want to leave it to you and your brother to have to do I think that's unfair So I want to get it done and how in the world are you supposed to know that I have some Macy's card that needs to be Closed or a Belk's card that needs to be closed. I mean these are obscure things that you wouldn't know So these are calls that I have to make and then I have to call Medicare and and say can I throw All of these papers away or how long do I have to save them after I'm dead and I have drawers and drawers full of these Medicare papers and the woman said you don't need to save them at all We have copies. Wow So, yeah, this is this is kind of the to me one of the I would say of all the Aspects of you dying it is the one that is the most shocking to me is just that The revelation of how little in this culture There is we're set up for death. It's something that no one tells you about this No one teaches you how to go through this It's just a thing that you're sort of supposed to instinctually figure out and Instead of there being a place set up where this you don't have to go through this It's just this kind of it reminded me a lot of when I'm In the midst of like when I had to have my surgery and when I got sick It reminded me a lot of the suddenly realizing that I didn't just have to worry about getting radiation I had to worry about filling out countless forms to make sure that my insurance would cover it and it's the material world is rude It is not only rude, but it pushes in on us in an amazing way so that and it pushes in at itself I remember there was something that Bet Your brother and I were trying to close and it heads. Oh, it had some kind of 24 months Oh, I know it was direct TV and it had a 20 month 24 month Service program and we wanted to close it down and the woman said well, you know, you're gonna be fine $20 a month or something like that for this being closed down And we got hung up the phone and I said wait just a minute. Am I gonna be fine after I'm dead? $20 a month for shutting down my direct TV. Thanks direct TV awesome company, so We called back and direct TV said in fact no, but you're going to have to have Power of attorney, you're gonna have to have a death certificate You're going to have to have a proof that you're the executor and then you're gonna have to send us all of those papers And then we will talk about releasing you from this contract So this is the this is where we are now. This is the physical world This is where we've gotten to as a society is that in in this moment There is this hilarious. It reminds me of The story in the New Testament where they were trying to trick Jesus into saying don't pay taxes and they Somebody came to him and said, you know, what about? What about? What about basically ask them aren't you supposed to pay taxes? Do you have to pay taxes to Caesar and he said show me what's on the on the coin and They showed him the coin and of course Caesar's face is on the coin and Jesus says Give what is Caesar's to Caesar an indication of like this is nothing This is stupid pointless matter yet. It's still something you have to engage in if you exist in the world the thing that You do have to and I know a lot of people die and they haven't been able to do this for their children And it's a mess, but my intention is to be able to get this done too Is great an extent as possible so that you all don't have to deal with it. Thank you I know that you've been doing that and it's been a heroic you see that people don't understand that As your body begins to Shut down The levels of there's a new kind of heroism that starts happening, which is that when your body isn't processing oxygen anymore Making a telephone call is not just making a funk is not what it usually is Because you're you you're having problems breathing So it's sort of like imagine having to take care of all your bills While being at the top of some gigantic Deoxygenated mountain in the middle of a snowstorm. That's what it's like So you have to have a very strong will to go through through that But we've pushed through it. It seems like and now you're in a more peaceful place. You've been able to you're laying in bed You we've taken we've wrapped everything up and now you seem to be at least you guys were not filming this But she just rolled her eyes So I'm assuming there's well, you would never be finished mom if you there's the upstairs This is the attic in the attic Duncan. We have a marshal feels catalog from 1810 You haven't even seen it. We have boxes full of postcards from the 1800s. Yeah, we have dresses from God knows who from the 1700s. You have not even seen the attic I've seen the attic. I know but you haven't looked in those boxes Well, no, I have not gone through the boxes yet, but I my order of priorities is Different than your order of priorities. I my that's an obligation to my ancestors I have an obligation to my sons and one to my ancestors your ancestors. Yes You feel obligated to the ancestors. I feel obligated if not to all the ancestors to my mother. Yes Do you think that you are do you have an impression a lot of people say that when they're Dying they they begin to feel the presence of people who've already died. Do you feel her presence or you've you begin to have any kind of mystical experiences or A sense of what's waiting for you I don't have it filled in at all I sense my mother's presence, but I also sense These ancestors presence and when I started writing my obituary yesterday, which was on my list I realized that I wanted to say that my roots were entwined with Not only the oak tree that is going to prohibit me from having any kind of Entrance into that soil But also the roots of the ancestors that had lived there since the 1700s from both sides of my family Almost everybody has lived in that place and has been buried in that place And I feel they're welcoming. I feel their Gratitude for the various ancestry things that I've done for them over the years and For saving their clothes and for finding them interesting and for finding their lives interesting So I have that which is pretty worldly And I am not one to Have Icons or images come to me. I'm not a person who sees entities An angelic beings and And that may change, but That hasn't historically helped me. It's been more of a distraction. So In terms of seeing beings Yes, I haven't but I I feel I feel Held first of all held but more than hell There is something that I can feel that is gravitationally pulling me Out of my body and into Something vast That I have there are no entities involved in that You feel and can you talk a little bit about that feeling of being held Who's holding you? What is it? What what are the qualities of being held? What is it? What is it like when I think of being is it like a physical embrace or can you describe that? I can describe it and but it's a warmth It has a lot of room to wiggle around in It has depth It has depth Darknesses It has luminosity Um It has other colors depending on Whatever it is that I'm grappling with because also, you know in the middle of all of this Not only am I leaving my body and not not only am I being pulled toward Some vast mystery But I'm also trying to reconcile Various facets of my life that don't feel completely reconciled And when I say held I mean that those Lacks of reconciliation Are also held. There's enough room in that holding to hold the anger and to hold the Resentment and to hold the um Oh the regrets and the the anguish of of feeling that I never Did particularly the highest and Most heroic things that I could have done That I had the capacity to do that would perhaps reached more people It holds all of that and It the holding is it a for does it feel as though it's Releasing you of the regret does it feel or is it just that it's allowing all of this to exist at once? It's more that it's an inclusivity it includes everything and it it explains to me That judgment is an egoic function and we have been Immersed in judgment We've been taught to judge everything And that what I'm being taught now Is to back off From judging my anger and to back off from judging my regrets But to let them be part of the manifestation of who I am And not to give myself hell about it in some kind of moralistic fundamentalist way So it's as though as you're dying You're becoming More yourself I'm becoming bigger I'm becoming more spread out I'm finding that Who and what I am Is vastness itself And it is also an individual And it's the coming together of those two That represents holding It's it's where the two meet And I'm I guess I'm just trying to understand if this When you say holding what or who is doing the holding Like I said to you I don't perceive I don't make up in my Imagination entities I find entities to be distracting So I go deeper than Making up mental images of things Therefore I when I go deeper than the mental I am immediately in direct knowing And I can directly know holding without having to have Picture in my mind of somebody holding me I I think that that would distract me from the experience of holding Which is an ultimately marvelous experience of being held And being held is inseparable from holding So there's a reciprocity of being held and holding That is a it's different from I am being held I'm a little girl. I'm being held by my mama It's not that But there is a sense that we are all held and we don't realize it Why don't we realize it because we've done so much with our mental conceptualization That we miss what's right under our noses what we can directly know Through dropping into What our current experience is right now And if you and everybody who listens to this can do that you will what you will find Is holding you don't have to be dying to find that it's a given And and that dropping into it means if you happen to to feel like a Like you're not a great person today if you feel selfish today it it doesn't just include all the If you drop a lot of people are going to drop into themselves right now and Who knows they just finished watching some Disgusting porn on the internet or they've just gone through a Three-day binge of playing xbox or they've they're Maybe they just finished their second pack of cigarettes for the day. They feel dizzy. They don't feel very good You know and but you're saying that That You shouldn't judge that I'm saying that we need to understand that the human being is composed of layers and layers and layers of identities And some of the more superficial ones are ones that we use to charge and discharge We've been doing that since we were infants pooping in our pants Yeah And so it's inherent in us and some people are still at that level. They want to charge and discharge, right? So That's okay They can charge and discharge They're just a lot of other levels and they don't even know this a lot of people don't realize there are there are many other levels I've never heard that model charging and discharging. I so so you're saying that the When people smoke or engage in whatever Addictive behavior or letting off steam behavior. That's a form of just Discharging energy. Yes. It's a very primitive form of being human Charging and discharging you see it in jellyfish, too Yes Yeah, I guess uh and the human being Actually has the potential to be Vastly more than meets the eye And so if we spend all of our lives charging and discharging we don't get to know that There it's okay But you're but I just I guess I want to go back to this idea of like going into your I'm just You go what you what you started off saying is that you you've you're kind of experiencing the totality of yourself You're experiencing the regrets You're experiencing this higher You're experiencing this entire spectrum And when a person drops down into their beingness And they're honest with themselves And they see that where they're at is not Is just at a primitive jellyfish level. I've certainly been there What What should they do what what should they do in that moment to experience this Sense of being held that you're talking about well, maybe it's not realistic for them to Say, hmm. I'm charging and discharging now. I want to field health because we don't have any control over this There's that's one thing that I'm finding is that all of this is happening to me. It's not me mentally trying to Will something to happen? But what I can do and say is say, uh, look you are doing a bit of charging and discharging right now, aren't you? And sure enough this very morning. I did some charging and discharging while you guys went to breakfast You know what I did? Oh, no. Well, this is st. Patrick's day. So I looked up duchess. Kate to see what she did on st. Patrick's day Nothing but charging discharge Total charge total discharge. She got her foot caught in a great She did she got her foot caught in a grave Was she how does that immediately make the news? They they're well, that's a different story entirely But this is a fractal what you're talking about here is that and this is something that Is it I think when you say these are things that are outside of our control It does seem that one thing that is within our control is where you want to place your attention. Yes and so there's this Happening right now and the fractal of your life Is that on one level? You're dying Your body's dying. You're about to Seize to exist as a human being You're about to go down that path that every single human being Since the beginning of time has gone down And there is an opportunity in in that level for the most intense and amazing Uh mellow drama is ramda says if you want to plug in to certain parts of that and a lot of people That's how they react to this extinction a lot of people they don't gracefully Pass on but also simultaneously within this fractal that's happening You have just the absurdity of looking at dutch's cake getting your foot stuck In a grate that's still happening That's going on no matter what that level of the world is happening too And then there's this deeper level that you're talking about which is this being held Illuminosity and then what you said Earlier which is this sense of being pulled into something vast and all of these things are happening at once They are all happening at once. You're happening to everybody at once They're everybody is this is nothing New it's just that I'm closer to I know that I'm closer to death than you think you are But you might be closer to death than death than I am they are happening in everybody The potential is there all the time to recognize all of this Yes, but when we get caught In the world in the world culture and we perceive ourselves to be that identity It is impossible that sets up a barrier To perceiving anything deeper that is right here shining in our Hearts or in our faces What would the world look like if by some miracle everyone Simultaneously managed to get to the place that you're at right now without having to Lose their physical body. What kind of world would we be in? It would be bright And truly I think that's an excellent question because I can tell you this And this is not going to be a popular thing to hear The vastness That I'm being pulled into More specifically Is that my individuality my sense of individual identity Is dissolving into The vastness Where there are no boundaries The individual identity that I have therefore Wasn't all that real right and so That's the thing that we Can realize Is the vastness is all there really is with all of its mysterious Appearances and disappearances and dynamisms and Uh effulgences effulging out of the absolute So here's a here's a really interesting thing. I had an idea this morning when I woke up early I first of all I wanted to see if my capacities to Do my early morning studying were still with me and they weren't until I put my oxygen on but when I got my oxygen on There they were and I was able to hear things come come through me, which is what I love so much And I had brought A big thick book with me to bed Because what I wanted Before I died this is what I was saying what I wanted before I died was to experience the absolute. Yes the absolute dimension of reality Which is deeper than the non-conceptual deeper than pure presence deeper than pure awareness Deeper than the divine love Certainly deeper than the ego the depths of the depths So I said to myself I want to experience this before I die So I opened the book and I intended to follow Guidelines one two three four five and I thought that by the time you guys woke up I would probably have gotten to the absolute wouldn't that be nice But what happened instead Was far more interesting because what happened instead was a revelation to me that i'm already there I don't need to work on this so hard. I'm already there Right Nothing to do It happened without my orchestrating one damn thing. That's gotta be That's a that's a look for some people that's a little frustrating to hear Because it's so counter to everything in our culture, which is that Work hard work hard do the pull-ups do the sit-ups do the painful meditations Do the psychedelics do the ayahuasca all these things to do To get to this state and to hear you say that this is there's nothing to that you can do well let me quickly say That when I talk about getting up at five o'clock in the morning and doing my work from five o'clock until whatever time in the Day that I can continue doing it depending on what's been going on in my days Maybe five to twelve I don't know generally it stops around noon But I've done this every day for years and years and years and The various things that are important you start you start where you are so I have to say I started If I started with charge and discharge, which is not where I started Let's that's just one of the most primitive is why I just pulled that one out You start where you are, you know try to get to the absolute You don't try to even think about what the absolute means You just start charge and discharge I can feel myself Discharging right now. I can feel myself building a charge and You are kind with yourself at that point and you don't judge it And say you lazy so and so you shouldn't be charging and discharging That will stop you called That's the that's the barrier that will first stop you and there are many many many barriers I think some people are afraid to stop judging themselves. I think some people are afraid that if they stop judging themselves that they need that constriction and they need that psychic barrier to shame themselves To keep themselves from doing whatever the charging and discharging behavior is That they were judging themselves for in the first place Well, they may but if you look at that from another angle, you will see that what they're trying to do is maintain their being some mentalized adult They're trying to be loyal to mama They wanted to come change their diaper That's what they're looking for and if that's where they're looking for that's what they're looking for that's where they're at Yep loyalty to mama You'd be amazed so the judgment keeps We hear you Blasted son of a bitch you stupid failure you goddamn blah blah blah That my friend is loyalty to mother It's also I there's a an excellent, uh I don't remember what university they just put out a Audio track so that you could hear what it's like to have auditory hallucinations as a schizophrenic from studying schizophrenics they had an audio track of what that sounds like to be a schizophrenic and in the voices tend to be What's wrong with you? Look at you. You're stupid. You're dumb. You're stupid. It's like they've so That thing that is inside people is actually for them Broken away and become an externalized Form of judgment. That's a good way of putting it and also that's true for many of us People who are not diagnosed as schizophrenic that that part of us has broken away and become an entity Inside of us and outside of us that rules our lives with A very a variety of thumbs for example I know many people who have the golden spoon judgment Oh That was a wonderful bowel movement What is that? That's judgment. It's positive judgment. Oh, aren't you cute? I love it when you do your eyelashes like that. That's judgment. Oh, I see. So you're Lost me at bowel movement That you're saying that the mother is that they had a mother that complimented their bowel movements As a kid it gets into their head and they actually apply some kind of and so they give themselves positive judgment all the time Now that's a very popular. Oh, I see what you're saying You people who are proud of their bowel movements And they're cute hair and they're eyelashes, right and they're precious dress, right? Everything form of who is that I have yet to I don't think I've I think we were talking about somebody earlier this morning named It has the initials k.k Mommy can't you jet you're throwing a jab at the Kardashians on your death bed All is held I just soiled my nest Oh man, you know, you know that as a celebrity you have done Something wrong if people on their death bed are are zinging you Yeah It's pretty antithetical to what I'm trying to help people awaken to You know, so maybe she's a good example of what you can see that is the antithesis of Of being awake and and being a complete human being She's probably not a complete human being. Well, maybe she's charging and discharging She may she may well be charging and discharging and that's a thing because you know, here you are Saying that we shouldn't apply judgment to ourselves. But now now you're in the predicament of applying judgment to kim kardashian and I'm Not judging you for that because god knows I there's a delight in judging. I mean, that's a this is a being friends with comedians Sometimes we'll get into philosophical conversations about enlightenment and The idea of like gaining true happiness or getting to a place of non-judgment and for a lot of comics, they're like, yeah, that's That's taking away one of my primary tools of crafting jokes Is judging because it's fun. It's fun to judge. It's fun to look at It's like this is something nichi talks about which is this idea that we need something to overcome If we existed in a world where there were no kim kardashians and if we existed in the world where there were There was there were no no fools or oaths or dolt's or people engaged in really basic level activities Then there wouldn't be a pull-up bar. There'd be no way for us to To be to differentiate. Well, that's not gonna happen because there are all these layers So you don't even need to worry about that. They're gonna exist But the there are layers and our job Our job if we want to evolve if we want to evolve And i'm not saying that anybody that we've mentioned wants to evolve Like kim kardashian, for example, I don't know kim kardashian. I avoid looking at her So I don't even know But i'm saying that I want to evolve and I want to evolve to the extent that I can before I die So what I learned to do is to delve more deeply into My judgment And I get curious about it and I inquire into it. What's this judgment? Who am I taking myself to be and who am I taking this poor child kim kardashian to be? Yes Right talk about a lost soul. She seems like a good example of a lost soul A materialist and I can have I can have compassion for her Easily for somebody like that So I take my judgment which comes up anyway, whether I want it to or not. That's right. I am no saint So I can take my judgment that comes up and instead of looking out there at kim kardashian I can look at my judgment the flavor of my judgment and not only can I look at it, but I can know it directly I can feel it in my throat. I can feel it In my heart. I can feel what part of me and what identity is judging. Is it a child judging this Person is it an adult judging this person? What part of me is even thinking about kim kardashian on a sunday morning? Yes, but I can be curious about that rather than judgmental about it. Right and that makes all the difference Right I see I see what you're saying. Yeah, it's a it's a it's a it's a kind of mindfulness. It's a Not being stuck in the tar pit of the judgment, but just watching it come And then doing a kind of analysis of it It's to it's to Love truth above all things truth not meaning the usual things but to love what is Real So that if you love what is real then you will relish the investigation into How come I'm judging kim kardashian? Yes And it's not just kim kardashian. I mean, this is a very light version of of of of this I I think you know And a lot of people the last thing that they want is the truth the Very very last thing that if there was a menu of items to pick from the truth would be Overstocked I think because the the truth is um On one level incredibly painful and and so painful that it's uh I mean the the state of watching you go through this for me person for me is is truth. I'm seeing truth But it's so Powerful and so Painful on one level that it's It's like put I I don't know if I'm in shock or what you would call it, but I can definitely see that something else has kicked in Neurologically for me where I've I don't know I can't describe the feeling very well, but it definitely I suppose it's the thing that they call grief And the beginning of that And and I would say that that's a reaction to this truth a lot of people truth is people want to avoid truth truth is the In the same way that you don't want to go jogging you don't want to work out at the gym times a million because it hurts You know, I find that I cry so much these days when people send me beautiful Uh love notes in truths And I've learned that is painful to cry I don't know why it's physiological paint physiologically painful to cry But it is and I also find that it doesn't last forever And that it cracks me open it cracks me open again And again and again and again and my willingness to be cracked open is the truth And if I were to not be willing to crack open I would suffer There would be suffering So there's a distinction between pain and suffering The suffering is when we try to Not feel what we feel the pain is something entirely different There is pain, but suffering generally has to do with attachment That we're attached to something that we don't want to let go of Well, it's that um That state that you're talking about when you're crying It this it's it's uh, it's not like Well, first of all Adult crying is not a It's not something I I do very much. It's not charge and discharge No, it's something else when that's happening when that it's some form of spiritual seizure that that happens where There is no control You I just have to go through it and then there's definitely it's painful, but there's a sweetness Behind it that's unlike anything I've ever experienced I I can't imagine being able to live in that state If that would be possible to live in that state and I wonder is that enlightenment Is enlightenment that feeling of sobbing minus the tears is it that feeling of I don't see that enlightenment is a word that's a useful word right I think that it's being real and I think that what happens when we Grieve in the way you're describing is that we move into a different dimension Of consciousness and it's called love Yeah, it's called divine love and divines doesn't mean woo woo god angels and all the company of heaven it means the selfless pouring out and and receiving The the dialectic reciprocity So you take it in and give it back like an out-breath and an in-breath and There is in that pain But the suffering comes when we are attached To an idea a mental idea that we have about what should be happening Right that's where we get caught Right when our plans get interrupted When we consider that we have plans Just stop there, you know that I have plans as I should Rather than realizing That this is an effulgent universe that has an a thrust and a flow to it And really if we would instead of Wamping around trying to plan stuff up if we would find our way to negotiate into the flow Our worlds would transform But that transformation for a lot of people is A form of death yeah You betcha Because what happens in this work is that that which is false dissolves That which is real begins to shine called alchemy And that that that's the suffering the suffering is the resistance to shining The suffering is holding on to the old ways When everything in the universe changes constantly You have to look you can look outside, which I'm doing right now And I can see that everything changes constantly the shifting light the wind blowing through the trees everything And if I am attached to that leaf not blowing I'm might I'm gonna if I'm really attached to that leaf holding still Then if it moves I'm gonna suffer So letting go of attachment is one of the big things I'm doing right now And it's so hard to To Ride the edge between love and attachment Right Right right Yes, that's the big confusion isn't it? That's such a big confusion people have confused love with attachment people think that a relationship They get into these relationships That are Solely attachment with no love at all And they think that the attachment is the is the this is that when you get you get in the predicament where you You want to get in a fight with someone so that they'll say that they need you You know instead of just letting them be as they are That's a very common thing that happens where people Will try to like you know, this is the thing where people will Withdraw themselves from another person to manipulate the person and to saying I need you that's charge and discharge. Yes There's a lot of charge and build charge and discharge that Happens in intimate relationships and I'm putting intimate and quotation marks Why because they're nothing but melodrama And melodrama has nothing to do with the truth. It's all mental ideas and attachment And suffering and gooey messy knots of snot Yeah Yes, that doesn't last it is fun to for a bit though, right? I mean charge and discharges we can't just Wipe charge and discharge off the sheets I mean there is that that that there is see this is the thing and this is a This this I think is a is an idea that torments people because what what we have here is You know what what you're talking about at the state of love Nonattached love and then the what the other side that you just portrayed which is this gooey mucusy gamesmanship that is the Mating ritual and all the various games that humans play with each other that's based on power dynamics or based on um charge and discharge And so attachment and so then you have the this sort of sense of The judge judge here the judge or who watches these things And says oh look at you now. You're just engaged in attachment or oh here. We are now. We're feeling love I've I've heard this in um In uh So I I heard this awesome analysis of you know the temptation of buddha You know about this the buddha sitting under the bodhi tree And is there's several temptations that come to siddhartha gatamas. He's journeyed to this Out into the forest. He's sitting under a tree and he's decided that he's going to gain Enlightenment or he's just going to die. And so there's these three visions that uh he's met with is The is he is tempted by mara the force that the is a term for my illusion attachment Test him and one of these Visions is is uh women You know the marriage or um The perfect relationship or he's met with this idea that you can here's your perfect soulmate lover Fawning over you and uh the analysis of this is that that didn't represent an actual physical These were the daughters of mara is what they're called that doesn't represent a physical form But rather that's the part of the mind That when you start getting towards what you consider spiritual realization Earlier when I said the word enlightenment, that's the part of your mind. That's like, oh look, this is it Now you're feeling real love now. This is real real love. Oh, you've done it. You're so very spiritual right now instead of Letting yourself get into the sticky moments too Here's here's what I would have to say here. I'm just as you were speaking just now. I came up with Some very important things and what I came up with was a broad reaching sense that our culture and our world in which we live is like A snot ball. Okay, and that we You know when it's big enough we want to discharge it Prior to that that snot ball builds up charge. Okay, and that There is a certain kind of attachment To the snot ball. Yes And that this is pretty much what describes our relationships. There's snotty relationships For the most part They're not very real. I mean mucus Isn't what I would personally call a high form of reality. You need it You need it when you're sick Right, okay Okay I understand what you're saying and you know in a certain sense the word Pearl has been used The pearl beyond price Which is to describe christ consciousness or to describe what the complete human can be once it is developed and um Transformed in the in the human life And the pearl if you look at it the pearl could look If you if you looked at a snot ball and you looked at the pearl you would have to look sometimes A little bit hard to see the one and distinguish the one from the other But one is totally different from the other. That's what the ego does the the ego tries in its very finest valiant way To form what is real within itself And so the snot ball human is The ego equivalent of the pearl the christ consciousness Gotcha. I see what you're saying, but it's it's it's it's a pathetic synthetic Manifestation, but we don't know it Right, it cannot be pathetic if we don't know it exists, right And we don't And that's why we can have compassion for people like k k or ourselves or perhaps ourselves As we see that we are ignorant about the snot ball false self That we work so hard to make look like a shining pearl Yeah, you're you're talking about trying to polish a turd I am And and we do that all the time and my whole culture is making a gazillion fortunes on polishing turds And there are a few of us that are actually Working to become the pearl The real pearl beyond price and certainly Any time you realize within yourself the pearl beyond price it is you realize good lord This totally is beyond price. There is nothing more valuable than this and let me just say again that I didn't get to this Even to knowing it or to glimpsing it. I didn't get here casually And I got here by waking up at five o'clock every morning and studying and inquiring And being ruthlessly honest with every manifestation that came up in me So as to find what was true again and again and again And what I'm finding now at the end of my life is that What is true as you have said to me Duncan, what is true can't be bought What is true is simple What is true is so basic And so perfectly useful for us to negotiate our ways through our lives But the the trappings the false pearl trappings Are in our way the attachments that go along with the false pearl trappings are in our way What do we start with? We look at the last time we charged and discharged. You could just do that, you know What's wrong with that? Okay. So Duncan went to breakfast I turned on my computer and put in Duchess Kate blog spot And there she is getting caught in the grill with her high heel shoe Yes That's charging a discharge. So that's what I can look at and then I can inquire into it. How come I wanted to do that? We tell you mom that's pretty tame compared to what a lot of people looked at in their their laptops But it's still all the same thing it's still all it's still it's still all uh You know that You know you for you Engage whatever the thing is, you know, like uh, maybe it's video games. There's an example of a A distraction where you really there's just nothing that you get out just surfing the internet Just basic internet surfing You'll get done with 30 minutes or 45 minutes or four hours or how depending on your addiction of just boring internet surfing and at the end of it you'll feel empty and kind of groggy and tired and You'll think to yourself well that you know, I That was a waste of time mm-hmm and what you're saying is That Though that may be a waste of time you can actually if nothing else use Look at it truthfully and in some way that will push you Out of the Addiction is that what you're saying? I am certainly not saying that Sorry I'm saying truly that everything is grist for the mill But you if you have an agenda To get yourself out or push yourself out of the addiction. Yes, you're in your ego Oh, see now. This is what this is where you're right here mom. This thing that you're talking about This is the infuriating aspect of so many different philosophies, which is it's saying no you You're in Chinese handcuffs if you struggle to get out of them. It only makes them tighter. True So what do we do? You you see how willful you are And how the willfulness is a part of that snot ball And willfulness is I will I need to control things I have to control things I want to control things and if I control things things will be exactly the way I want them to be And then I will live happily ever after ta-da Which is contradictory to the entire way of the universe the way the universe works is not that way at all It's the exact exact opposite the universe is a flow a mysterious flow It has a directionality to it It arises from nothing It appears and it disappears We are a part of it everything is a part of it It has an intelligence It optimizes it has a a quality of optimization to it And when we Perceive it enough to align with it We get out of our willfulness and get into a phenomenon called surrender And the surrender is to the surrender of into the Intelligence of the universe if you haven't noticed the intel the universe seems fairly intelligent Yes What you are doing with your willfulness and with you're saying I have an agenda to get out of my addictions ta-da You are blocking the flow of the universe Through yourself through your own consciousness Is this isn't is letting go Also based on what you're saying another form of trying to control this thing. It's like you can't Hold on and you can't let go You can't act Any action that you do Or that you take Isn't it all willfulness all willful willfulness and if you let go And you say oh, okay. Okay. Now. I'm gonna let go of this addiction. That's what I need to do right now Here's step one two and three Nope you the only way we can let go the only way we can surrender is to say Oh Fuck I was trying to find a better word You say Nothing to do Except see my willfulness That's it I can see it and not only can I see it, but I can go deeply deeply deeply Into understanding how willfulness became a humongous part of my life because I can go back into my childhood And see how there was nothing solid. There was nothing to trust In my early years. I had to create some kind of internal sense of will In order to feel held right I understand where it came from, but is it in is it out of date now it is But do I know why is it out of date now because I see what happens when I let go When my consciousness chooses to let go into This optimizing thrust of reality It's one of those things where it sounds So easy Yet simultaneously you're saying that you came to this Understanding through years Of waking up every morning and having a what a very disciplined spiritual practice A very Disciplined practice, but that sounds like something it wasn't mine was raucous My practice in the morning has been raucous So I'll make myself a big pot of mate and I'll come get in bed with my mate and my notebooks and my books And I'll maybe find one sentence In the books that hits me and it grabs something in me And I may spend the next seven hours writing about that one thing Trying to investigate and understand and integrate it into me So that it isn't just some prattle that i'm getting from some damn book Because a belief isn't going to get me anywhere an idea is not going to get me anywhere An idealization is not going to get me anywhere Only thing that's going to get me somewhere is knowing from inside myself and that will actually Do it because knowing from inside myself is not knowing From inside this egoic human being it is a knowing that is arising from that effulgent Intelligent flow that flows through you and through me and trees and birds Flows across the door cell and it's still an out the back door into the field This is uh, this is what is this what we really are If I understand what your question is If I understand what your question is this is what we really are, but i'm not sure what you're saying we really are I'm saying there's this what what the The model that you have created here is one where When when I hear you say go to the truth inside of me It makes me think of a kind of Geographic location of truth that exists inside my physical body But what you're what it's the way you're saying it it seems more as though you go even deeper than your body But you start with your body you can start With whatever you notice so for example if you notice tightness in your chest you start there Right, you don't go try to find a better place to start because that's shining at you gotcha Okay, that's great. So there's a starting point. You don't start in some kind of made up imaginary deep part of yourself You start with the anxiety bubble in your chest that you felt forever exactly That's where it is. That's where it is and you don't want to go there because that place sucks Because it's painful you because you're suffering because you're attached to You Right You're attached to the way you think things should be you So that's great. So there it is. So suddenly what you're saying is that The x on the treasure map It it it it actually is the The physical manifestation of pain in your body is a place to start Yes, if that's what's up if that's what's shining at you To get your attention something well and I say shine. I don't really mean shine. I'm It may be bleeding all over the rug Say but it is what gets your attention course It's where you are suffering. No, it's so simple. It's great It's like if you've been shot You're not going to come inside and start putting band-aids Where the bullet wound isn't if you've been shot you're not going to Put a cast on your leg as though your leg's been broken you deal with a bullet wound. Yes, exactly And you're talking about that's so we have these sort of Wonderful Indications of where the work needs to start and they are wonderful But well they are when you When you create this kind of dynamic they are For a lot of people, they're the worst thing ever Nobody want this is the place like you know in the in the extreme sometimes you run into people and you just start talking about death Around certain people and they'll they'll change the subject as quickly as they can. They're absolutely terrified of it I know a few of those I'm sure I'm sure it's something you've had to deal with over this these many many many many years of struggling with this cancer But it's so so so you go to this place you The tightness in the chest and then what now now I've now i'm sitting here with the tightness in my chest. I'm looking at it feeling it What do I do now What is my experience in this moment? Well my mom's dying So drop beneath those words that's mental and what is your experience As a result of those words informing you What do I do Well on one level it's a kind of like tired Anxiety a kind of like Headachey Sick Dreadful feeling of Thickness It's like it's horrible Now what could you call it grief? Yeah for sure it's it it seems to be a uh So there's a tightness in your chest that you can now associate with the word grief, okay Is that what you're saying? So Can you let yourself just not try to change that but be with it be with this profound phenomenon called grief Yes, the chest wall opens up it's so Forceful Yeah already when I do that it makes it's making me cry it feels like already that's changing it You're right, you know, you're right. It's the resistance to what that hurts. Yes So as you let yourself feel the depth of the sorrow The objective sorrow of Of The physical disappearance of a person you love Your mother I get but I cannot stay in that place I come out of it. It's like I can get I can get in there For a second. What's the belief? I can't stay in there. My belief is that if I State another second Right Well, yeah, because then you go into that place of like losing control for sure Yeah, so my fear is I'm gonna lose control And I want control I want to feel this grief a little bit. Yes, I want to have a little valve on it so I can turn it off and on Yes That's exactly right And you can do that It just makes it just hurts a hell of a lot more Yeah, the pressure pressure hurts It seems like it could even be physically debilitating To keep the pressure. Yeah, yeah, probably would be It's a great meditation I've never done it before so is there any what's is it slight is exactly the same What is your direct experience? now in your chest Well, the moment that I really like let myself go into it. It's it stops hurting right away And it feels there's something very tranquil and soft So what's this tranquility and softness? Well It's that perplexing Sense that everything's going to be okay Did you call it holding? Yes But it seems to exist simultaneously with this other like Freakish Constriction it does There every it is all inclusive Reality is all inclusive And we don't want to judge Reality when it's all inclusive includes everything. So why would you judge one part of it and not another? Well, one part is certainly preferable to the other. Why? That's a judgment No, it's why would I the difference between Sitting in a an ice cold Pool of water sitting in a really nice hot tub Well, here's one of the things you got to work with The desire for pleasure and to avoid pain. Yes I think that's a fairly healthy Uh, that's a pretty healthy Desire it's an egoic desire. Well, it's also what keeps you from putting your hand in fireplaces. Is it really? At this point in your life I know you're a little better than that It's good I like it. It's really good So you find and this is an amazing thing to find That in the midst of sorrow In the midst of feeling your chest rip apart If you can stay with it a little bit with compassion Without trying to fix it and change it and well in a way You begin to glimpse the holding right it's there all the time With such benevolence Such capacity to hold And it's in you It's not out there in the sky. It's in you right Right. Yeah It's in the sky too, but let's make it personal You Thank you You're very welcome for everything It's mutual I thank you I'm honored You And I didn't will you into the world I didn't organize you into the person you are came from me What you are is a unique manifestation of being And I am honored to be in your presence Likewise So where we be performing next well, I don't know where we're gonna be performing That's a good question That's a good question.

Greetings to you, O beautiful citizens of planet Earth and welcome to the year of the rat. And if you're a superstitious person, you might be thinking, fuck that. Rats are disgusting, they're covered in disease, they're little claws are usually festering with strange, as of yet, undiscovered bacteria. And if you get so unlucky is to have one of them claw your nips, then your nipples will decay and char, fester, fall off and spray yellowy blasts of pink, smattered, nip jam all over your bathroom mirror as you begin to scream, thinking, my God, why did I let one of those rats crawl in my chest? Or maybe you're one of those people out there believes that where there is rats, lightning will soon strike. Or maybe you're one of those people out there who had one of your tiny little dogs carried away by rats down into the sewers where the dogs were sacrificed to the God of rats. I understand some of us have had rough run-ins with rats, but personally, from a distance, rats hold a warm place in my heart. Not because I like rats, not because I wear black lipstick and put leather on and put white powder all over my face and jingle around and leather jingling gimp suits at weird parties throughout LA. I would never wear a gimp suit. The reason is because I love Ganesh, the Hindu deity. And Ganesh, for those of you who aren't familiar with the Hindu pantheon, is the elephant-headed God, son of Shiva, very interesting, weird story about how that elephant had ended up on the human body. But Ganesh brings us good fortune. Another name for Ganesh is Ganapati. And Ganesh is considered the remover of obstacles. And many people, they take Ganesh as their deity because they look upon Ganesh as sort of a deity that brings you opulence, wealth, a great family, and all the things that you deserve because you're a wonderful human and it's time for you to enjoy all the great gifts that the elephant-headed son of Shiva used to be. It had a little boy, a kid, a head, a human head that got lopped off by Shiva and replaced by an elephant whose head was also lopped off, I guess, poor elephant. But regardless, this head transplant resulted in a really amazing, incredible deity. I mean, besides the fact that we've got everything cool about elephants in Ganesh, Ganesh rides a rat. All the Hindu deities have their mounts that they ride and Ganesh actually rides a rat. That's his steed and he can shrink himself down or get really big, but so in this case, I love it because for people in India, and it's just about anywhere, whenever you see rats, it's bad. It means that they might have gotten into your grain. They certainly carry disease. Usually it's a bad omen if you see a bunch of rats. And so the reason that I love that symbol of the remover of obstacle riding a thing that you never wanna see is it represents that repeating pattern that happens in a person's life where you realize that the very worst thing, the very worst omen, the thing you were most terrified of, the thing that appeared in your life and really made you shit, big, white, hot rat turds out your inflamed ass was actually the best thing that ever happened to you. All the misfortune, all the terror, all the darkness, all the stuff where you thought, I don't think I'm gonna make it through this one. On the other side was a better version of you, a wiser version of you, a stronger version of you, a smarter version of you, a cooler version of you. And that's all because the bringer of good fortune, the remover of obstacles, he sticks his head into your life as a rat with greasy little whiskers. And the rat itself that Ganesh rides used to be a demon. And that rat ended up getting in a cool, weird anime style battle with Ganesh. And of course we all know the rumor, it's an urban myth. I haven't checked it out on Snopes, but that elephants are afraid of rats. So Ganesh went head to head with a thing that makes a lot of elephants in the cartoons go galloping away and ended up sitting on this rat. And the weight of Ganesh, this deity was the weight of the entire universe and this incredible, powerful run-in with Ganesh's big ass, I'm assuming, was so potent that it caused the demon to convert and become Ganesh's eternal servant. And of course that represents you facing the thing you're most afraid of and that if you really pull it off and you really allow not just you, but the you that is the sum total of all sentient beings in the universe to be the power that moves you through whatever obstacle you face, not only will you crush that obstacle, but that obstacle will turn into your friend and dearest associate in something that you can actually use as a vehicle to move you through the next obstacle and the next obstacle and the next obstacle. So the year of the rat, I think it's good luck. It's good fortune. And it says to me, look, even if things seem fucking scary right now, and even if things seem impossible and even if things seem absolutely unfixable and even if you've been snorting hot rails of fear from Fox News and CNN, and you've gotten all contorted inside and you're like, fuck, am I gonna get drafted? Holy fucking shit. And even if stuff on the home front seems absolutely unwinnable and even if you find yourself freshly broken up with or about to break up with somebody and even if you find yourself about to get canned or you can't find a job or even if all these things if you imagine for a second or the snout of Ganesha's magical, shape-shifting, polymorphine demon rat poking its head into your incarnation, then you can invite it in instead of trying to ignore it or sending all your negative energy into it, which just makes it bigger anyway. And then, and then maybe, just maybe, you'll end up with a brand new pet rat that you can ride around your house. And I'm sure whoever you live with will love that because that pet rat is gonna be made of the thing that used to be your greatest fear. So welcome to the year of the rat. It's 2020 and we're gonna gallop into the future with a smile on our face and a rat under our butts. We've got a glorious podcast for you today.

Welcome to the DDFH, Shane Moss. It's the Dunkatrustle Family Hour podcast. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shane and Nobby Doobie Blue, welcome to you. Welcome, welcome on you. It's the Dunkatrustle Family Hour podcast. Brush your head. Yeah, I don't know. I think, is there a way of combining it of, I was just thinking yesterday about how, you know, I did all this factory work early on in my life, probably did like five, six years of factory work and it was just a lot of like repetitive. What factory? Mind this, I worked at, the first factory job that I ever had, I worked in a crouton factory. Are you fucking shitting me? Where? In the cross, Wisconsin. Here's the thing, I had no idea that that's like a funny thing to have done until I started telling people and when I told people I worked in a crouton, but they're like, oh what? Like it just does something to people's minds, like I didn't realize croutons are made in a factory. I'm gonna be honest with you, man, I know a lot about you. You cover yourself in Siri and Rue and MAO inhibitor and smoke DMT. You've been in mental hospitals, you're a brilliant comedian, you've traveled all over the fucking place, but this is the craziest shit you have told me in our long friendship that you worked at a crouton factory. I worked just for a little while. Yeah, I worked third shift in a crouton factory with a bunch of degenerates. I used to drink every night. I took a third shift job because I was drinking too much and I wanted to like not be around my friends and not have the inclination to go out and party, but I ended up just drinking at work. You're gonna get sober. The crouton factory mistake doesn't work. It's a myth. I know, I know. It's what it used to. People would say, if you wanna clean yourself up, go to the crouton factory, but then the darkness even creeped in there. Well, that was the early people that did that, had the LSD experience with the crouton factory work and then once they phased that out. You're talking about the MK Ultra shit when the CIA was going to crouton factories and giving people small doses of acid. You're familiar then. You're familiar with the history. Absolutely. Shane, let me just, cause you know, what better place to start? So you go in to apply for a job at a crouton factory. I was actually, I went to a temp place. And that was my first temp gig that they gave me. Gotcha. And so when you got to the crouton factory, the first day, what's the first day of work there was like 10 degenerates all working there. Some of them were like actually quite likable. And then there was like scary people. I like, I got kind of like, they would have fun. You know, they would like to haze new people and stuff. So they put me by to work with some dude who is just this lunatic who like, you're talking to him for about, you know, like maybe five minutes, you're working with the guy. He's shown you like how to load bread up on the thing that sends it up through these racks, that then pushes it through the oven. And like the things that you need to know, which really isn't that much. Is he a big dude? He's like a bigger old, a big, huge beard, wild looking. And within five minutes of just like, within the tutorial of like, here's what you need to do. There's like a little, you know, Hitler actually had some pretty good ideas. Like just slipping that in. Just let's get to know each other. Oh my God. I feel like you need to know this about loaves. You also need to know that people were a little hard on Hitler. Dude, that is the worst to get station next to a Nazi at a fucking crouton factory. I mean, you know what you're, if you, if you're working at a crouton factory, you should know what you're signing up for. Again, I was just a little naive back then. I was a young man. I didn't know the old cliche about Nazis and the crouton factories. And so I wasn't, I wasn't prepared for it. Isn't that a Maya Angelou poem? Nazis in the Crouton Factory, working, working shift three. Nazis in the Crouton Factory coming after thee. Your, your retention for poetry is incredible. Oh my God. I mean, it probably has been a while since you've read that poem and that was, that was flawless. 20 years since I read that poem. But yeah, I do have a photographic memory when it comes to poems about Nazis. I've never read a, I've never, I've never forgotten any poem about Nazis that I've ever read. So it's just like, so I just like to think about it from this Nazis POV, which is like in his mind, you know, because to me, I think like, okay, so this maybe is like a little too far away from what we're talking about, but I think I can bring the two together, man. Like the other night I found this one, I wish I could remember the name of the YouTube channel just because the guy who's making these videos is really doing a really good job of making fringe theory YouTube videos that are actually managing to stay almost like a documentary that isn't really saying he believes it or not, which I love just like, and so it's this wonderfully engrossing YouTube video, which is an account from a variety of different mythologies and world religions regarding some shit that happened on the planet a long time ago, kind of the Graham Hancock stuff. Yeah, that in all these different world religions, there's an account of what it sounds like a comet, but you know, it's people who didn't know what comets were back then to saying shit like, you know, a dragon in the ceiling of the sky flew by, great waterfalls fell from the rain fell from the rain fell down, but not like natural rain, like waterfalls in different spots, the rivers turned red. There's all these accounts of the rivers turning red and these mythologies. And, you know, he wasn't saying anything, he's just reading quotes from all these mythologies together and put in your like, oh shit, it's like some awful thing happened, the rivers turning red, maybe he did talk in it. I think I'm building up a little bit too much. He might've talked a little bit, but the rivers turning red was what would happen if iron got in the water. So whatever this thing was, but anyway, I'm reading this, watching it and wondering like, why is this making me so happy? Like, why does it feel so good? And then I started thinking like, oh my God, it's like something in us knows that modern society is weirdly so constrictive. And so, you know, like a, probably a monkey at the zoo, if the monkeys could talk and there was a monkey who started telling the story of like, one day you know the zoo will burn. The monkey would kind of like it, even though there's food and all this shit, right? So similarly, I think the Cruton factory, Nazi, the reason people get into these spots in their mind is because you're working at a fucking Cruton factory. Oh yeah, it's miserable. You're miserable and in your mind, the fantasy of Nazi Germany that these psychopaths have, which is one of like some like, to them, Hitler's Luke Skywalker. Snacking on Crutons all day, you know, loses a little bit of its luster after a couple decades. Yeah. And now it's like, are we gonna come out with any new flavors of these Crutons? Or am I just gonna keep eating these garlic ones all of the time? Cause you know you need to snack on the Crutons. Was it garlic Crutons? Yeah, they had all sorts of different flavors. Was there, can you name the factory? It's a no, but at the time, I think they did some stuff with hostess. I don't remember the name of it and I believe it's changed name. It's in the cross Wisconsin. I'm sure people could throw a quick Google search in and go maybe that and just look for an old guy with a big old gray beard and a beard. As I think about it, you'd also like wear the beard net too, which is like, that's nice, I feel like. Like if you don't give a fuck so much that like within five minutes of meeting someone, you're like advocating for giving Hitler a second chance, but you're still like conscientious enough to like put the beard on your net so that your beard hairs don't get into strangers Crutons. I mean, there's a lot, you know, we all contain multitudes and there's this is a very, you know, kind of dynamic, unpredictable character. Good news is the Cruton Nazi knows that there are white people in the supply chain. Right, right, right. Otherwise we'd be fucked. Yeah, right. But the other thing is like, I don't think people understand just how, and maybe they do, but you know, we live in LA and you travel all over the place, I don't think people understand just how many Nazis are working at the various Cruton factories of the world. It's Nazis, you know what I mean? I mean, it might even be a front. Crutons might just be a thing that Nazis made up as like a legitimate business for their Nazi propaganda. Another fucking thing. What do you think about that shit though? Like I've, you know, like one of the, the, I don't remember who said it to me, they're like, where do you think the Nazis went Duncan? You think that like after the, after World War II ended, the Nazi just dissolved? Do you think they just went away? They were like, okay, we lost the war. We're out of here. So there's like one of the great conspiracy theories is that the Nazis just started corporations. And so like Bear Aspirin and like a lot of the great corporations and I mean, great, big, successful corporations of the world, they have their roots. That's just name names. We got McDonald's. Not McDonald's. No, no, no. That old podcast. Guys, remember, go to McDonald's, use an uppercut swastika, they get a 10% off your cheeseburger. Free small fry. But like, you know, that is a, I think that's where when we're getting fucking blasted these days with like. I mean, they had the Nazi gold at the time, right? Maybe you get, maybe you start a business with that Nazi gold. You get into something legitimate. Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. I don't like thinking about that. That conspiracy theory to me, the only reason like, I'm, But don't you still, I mean, doesn't it, doesn't it dissipate over time? Sorry, I cut you off. But doesn't it, I'm so glad you did. Doesn't it, doesn't it like you take your Nazi gold, you start, you start Sears and then like over time, your kids are like, I'm kinda, I'm not into, don't the kids eventually be like, you know, grandpa's like, you know, he's got money. We gotta ask at nice to him, but we're not sure about the Nazi thing. I feel like over time it kind of simmers down a little bit. Who knows? I don't know. Somebody just desecrated a synagogue here in LA. Yeah, that's true. It's like these motherfuckers, man, they're just, they're floating around out there. You know, they're just like, and they, they're like, and you know, it's like that, cause like the thing the crouton Nazi did to you, he does to everybody. That's just his thing. He's a recruiter. He's a, he said Nazi recruits on it. I think it was like, it's also a way to get a rise out of people or like, you know, they had them like stuck by himself. Most everyone else is like working together and like there's a thing and someone's like filling the bags and then another person's packing the bags in the boxes, another person's taping the box, another person's putting the box in the, and you're like all right next to each other. But the Nazi guy, you set him like far, far away in another room, not talking, and he must like it that way because he doesn't like when he needs to like train the new kid or whatever. So it might've also been just like a defense, like get the hell away from me kind of a, kind of a situation too, but everyone else is very, you know, they were a surprisingly tolerant group of individuals for like whatever behavior that you could get into. I used to be, I used to skip on my lunch breaks, I would go and like meet up with friends at a party, do a bunch of shots and come back. And depending on how drunk I was, that's how they would decide what job to give me. And so if I was like really drunk, they thought that was the funniest. And so what they would do is they'd get me up on like a scissor lift or something like that. It'd be like my first time running a scissor lift and they'd be like, this will be hilarious. Shane's very drunk right now. We'll just throw him up on a scissor lift, give him an air hose and teach him how to clean off the tracks running across the ceiling for the bread. And so that's the kind of stuff I do. I don't know why this is shocking to me. I've never, for one here, like just from, this is the Midwest. I think I speak for the listeners, maybe when I say, when we're eating our croutons, we're not thinking, where the fuck do these come from? I'm not thinking about that at all. I'm just, if I do have croutons, which is a weird thing anyway, but if you did, sometimes when you're like really looking for a wild salad or you're at the... Yeah, you definitely got to warn people when guests are coming over like, how wild do you want, I do, I don't know if you fucks with croutons, but I do have some garlic croutons. Whoa, Duncan. Hold on, I didn't know you were a Nazi. I was just coming over to smoke DMT, but I don't fuck with croutons on my salad. Croutons, you had to pile croutons on there, but you know, or if you're at a salad bar, and you're like, you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna scoop on these croutons. And then you know, they end up just becoming like mushy. They're actually just better. What I learned from working in a crouton factory is just eat croutons. Just get a box of croutons and eat them like you'd eat a Trisket or something like that. That's the best way to eat a crouton. I'd munch on croutons every night. Do you? And they, no, no, no, no, no, I did. When I worked in the factory, there'd be like the things going by and you'd always be, everyone would be scooping handfuls. Yeah, you got like dirty to generate hands, scooping handfuls of croutons. I mean, if you think that's the worst thing that's happening to your food. No, I don't. Listen, I wouldn't be surprised if every single thing we eat gets launched through like one of those T-shirt guns into like some kind of like mutated chimpanzees ass and a vomit sip back out for no reason, like those fucking lemurs that eat the coffee beans. I imagine everything. Oh, sorry. Please, what was that? Yeah, no, this just reminds me of, I'm just very excited about all of the, I was, I took a tour, I was in Dublin and there's a, I took a tour of the Guinness factory because there's a, there's a comic that would sometimes give tours there. Yeah. And so I got like a little more like behind this. So I'm not sure that they would normally tell people this. Oh my God. But it used to be that like within the beer making process, rats would just be like ground up and get into the grain and everything all of the time. And it was just like, you know, that's just what happens. And then eventually in like the early 1900s, they figured out what, you know, like they started having health code people and stuff come in and check things. And they'd be like, listen, you know, you got to have not 200 dead rats in your thing like every day. And so they started putting things and getting the rats out of there. They put up new screens and stuff like that. And people started complaining about the Guinness. They'd be like, we, well, I don't know what you guys did to Guinness. You changed the ingredients. We liked the old Guinness better. So they had to create an artificial rat blood. Are you fucking with me? No, you're lying. You're lying. I am not lying. This is a fucking lie. This is a true story. As far as this guy, unless he was a comic and he was fucking with me, he worked for Guinness and he was telling, it was very convincing the way that he told it. Yeah. What? Yeah, dude. And like, not only are they launching our food through a t-shirt, cannon, baboon ass, but we love it that way. Yeah. If they ever stopped, we would riot in the street. What happened to the food? Remember when the food, the taste changed? And it's when the one baboon that's at the front of the last stop of the supply chain died finally, just like one quivered, like puked out some rits or whatever. They're like, we can't, we just can't do that to another baboon anymore. You know, we know more. No, they tried. We know more than we knew back then when we chained this baboon. 30 years ago, we didn't realize there was anything wrong with shooting food through a t-shirt cannon into this baboon's ass that it would then puke up through its mouth. You'd wipe it off a little bit, cook it, eat it. And we didn't know that we didn't realize that baboon didn't like that. And we can't, you know, we can't do that anymore. But now people are, now you gotta figure out an artificial way of making the baboon ass puke taste that kind of the food marinates in. That's a whole R&D department nightmare. You are making me wanna just start a farm and just grow my own fucking food and brew my own beer. But you know, this is, one of the things the Hare Krishna said, I've said on the podcast before, is that they were like, don't go out to eat. And here's why. In the same way that you see a painting and you can feel the artist in the painting, that's the artist's energy that has gone into the painting and has locked in there in this visual form. The same thing happens with food. So, you know, if you're, the person cooking for you is fucked up, a little bit of that energy gets in the food and you eat it. And but then now I'm thinking like, well, fuck it. Even if it's the Dalai Lama back there cooking your food with a big smile in his face, glowing with a radiant, benevolent aura from a lifetime of pure compassion practice, whoever, like the croutons he's putting in your salad, there's a Nazi somewhere in there in the supply chain. So all of us in everything we eat, we are just scooping into our mouths some tiny, like tell me this, okay, and correct me if I'm wrong here. But like, tell me, cause I think you will understand this more and this is one of the woo-woo things I like to talk about, but then I'm always thinking in the back of my mind, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Can you tell me just a little bit about quantum entanglement, Shane? And no, I don't know enough about quantum entanglement. I will say that one of the, and it's been a while since I've brushed up on my physics. I don't have physicists on my podcast or anything. I have like life science, psychology and neuroscience people. But one of the things that people, that I see people like really run away with is the, oh, what's the? Observer effect. Yeah, the observer effect where they're like, oh, so you can't actually observe anything without changing it. And really what's happened, you're using a light. A light is bouncing off of an electron, I believe. And then it's changing the trajectory and so when that light bounces off and that's how you register it by going into the device or your eye, and then you saw where it was at that moment back in that time, but because the light changed the trajectory, you can't know where it was now. It doesn't mean that you moved it with your mind or anything. It's not like you manifested that. It'd be like if you were closing your eyes and there was like a ball on this table and I was like, I wanna use my hand to know how far this ball is. And then when I touch it, the ball rolls away and now I know exactly where that ball was at that moment and now I don't know because it rolled away. It doesn't mean like I moved the ball with my mind or I manifested a thing or that nothing is real and we can't predict anything. I think people are really taking that notion of we don't know anything and maybe making a little bit too much out of it because it seems like throughout human history, people go like, whenever you don't know something, you go like, therefore magic. And we've made some progress in being like, actually along the way, when we do figure out how something works, it seems like it's less magic and it would actually be weirder if things didn't work that way, like things like the Fibonacci sequence or something like that. It'd be weird if leaves on flowers didn't work in a Fibonacci sequence way because then the petals on the flower wouldn't get the exact right amount of light per each petal and there's just things that seem like very magical on the surface but it's just like very, like once we know how it works, it's like, oh, in hindsight, that's like fairly simple math. And so quantum entanglement, I don't even wanna touch that one because I just don't know. All of the quantum physics that I've read, I don't understand from my understanding of it, quantum physicists that actually do quantum physics work don't seem to understand how it works themselves, admittedly, and I mean, one of my favorite things is about scientists is they always, I mean, probably every single episode that I interview a scientist at least once or twice, they'll say, I don't know. And so few people say, I don't know in their everyday life. Most people, we could walk outside right now and we could go up to a stranger and be like, what's the meaning of life? And they'll be like, well, pull up a chair, I'll tell you exactly what it is. And I think that's just like the trick of consciousness that we are constantly being kind of reassured in kind of a self-grandizing way that we kind of know what's going on all of the time. And the two main causes of stress are lack of predictability and lack of control. Those are the two main stressors. So like one is, have I ever told you about those people? I don't think so, Shane. So if you take a rat and you put it in a cage and you have like two sides of the cage and one of them's electrified and the other isn't. Wait, is this something the guy at the Guinness factory told you? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. No, no problem. So you have like the game is, is like a light turns on and then if the rat moves to the other side, it will avoid the shock and it will learn this pattern very, very quickly. And then, but then you take one of these things out of there. So now you take the light out of there. So there's no warning and there's a shock, but it still knows if it runs to the other side, then it's safe from the thing. And then, or you do the other thing, you give it the light, but you don't give it another side to run to. And so there's no control over the situation, but there is predictability. And there's a high level of stress there, but the rat can still brace itself. So that's, they're about equal levels of stress. But if you take both away, no light and nothing it can do about it. So no predictability, no control. And you just shock this thing at random intervals. What it eventually does is it learns that the world is full of random shocks that there's nothing you can do about. And then when you go and put it back in a condition where any other normal rat would easily learn, oh, the light comes on and move over here, it can't learn it. It's now learned helplessness. It's like given up on life. And that's really easy for any of us to do. So there's all of these probably evolved self-defense mechanisms to overly perceive predictability and overly perceive control in our lives because it would be fucking horrifying if we didn't. And so sometimes, and I know we like, you and I are, I mean, this is why we're so a perfect pair together because you're a little more mystical than I am and a little more into like manifesting things than I am. I've also had enough psychedelic experiences to be like everything that I'm saying right now is probably a bunch of bullshit because I've had those experiences where it feels like those things. I don't think it's bullshit. I think that what you're talking about on one level of reality is exactly right. And that's the level of reality that we have the most data for. So probably if you're gonna place bets on the way things are, that's where you'd wanna roll the dice, right? This does tie in to the, I think the misunderstanding many people have regarding the observer effect and so the, and sort of just the framing of reality itself, and which is like, if a thing's in a superposition, it's moving so fucking fast. This is how I understand it. It's the cloud of energy around an atom, the electrons are moving so fast. They're basically everywhere at once around that fucking thing. So in their moving so fast that pretty much wherever you look, you're gonna find it's gonna be there. It's there, it's gonna be there because it's moving so fast. It's like, this is my understanding of it. And you're framing it and you're, the act of observing it is like, you've taken a little snapshot of it and so it becomes a thing for a second and then goes back into its quantum soup. And so the misunderstanding seems to be people think that it's our attention that is making the form happen versus like the snapshot that is showing a place where it was at for a second. It was also at every other place simultaneously. And so this sort of concept gets moved into like the new thought mystical movement, which is like, well, yeah, what you're saying is exactly right. We don't wanna feel stressed out. We wanna know what's coming next. If we know what's coming next, we can relax for a second because we feel like we're safe. Like right now, for example, if you knew, like let's say we've been locked in this fucking house by lunatics who are like, listen, we want you to- For the listeners, that's actually what has happened. Duncan has locked me in here. Yeah, during an experiment. I'm a scientist, I don't know what's gonna happen. But I do know this. And if anyone could please call for help. We've got, it's not really a doggy door. It's a shame if you'll notice over there, that's actually a lion door. And what's gonna happen is at a random time, a lion is gonna come galloping out of that door and it's gonna attack us. Now, the moment you know that, the podcast is gonna be a different podcast. It's gonna go all the time. You're just gonna be staring at that fucking door, crying. You know? And this is the, so the human mind, the human humans, we wanna know what's coming down the line. Is, you know, when I was like doing my cancer treatments, you know, you get those fucking tests, you gotta wait to find out if you're gonna die. You know, and you gotta wait. And that does not, that is not a pleasant time when you're just sitting there like, fuck, I don't know what's gonna happen. Now, the reality is whether or not you have this or that, whether you're sick or healthy, whether you're old or young, you really don't know what's gonna happen. That's the reality. You just can't know what's gonna happen. But you can kind of make bets on what's gonna happen based on what's happened before. So this is where it gets interesting, is that if you're somebody who has had a string of bad luck, you have been the rat in the experiment and you've just had random shit happen to you. You wanna number one know, why does this shit keep happening to me? So you're gonna look around, look into yourself, and maybe you're gonna be like, fuck, I shouldn't have thrown that gypsy kid in the volcano when I was drunk on my last trip to Hawaii because his fucking grandmother- No, that can't be it. It must have been something else. Or whatever, you'll try to come up with a reason for it. And then, so you'll just kind of feel like, oh, I must be cursed. Oh, it's me, or oh, the world is out to get me, or oh, the world's not designed for me, or oh, this or that or this or that. But in that crystallization of like in your attempt to get some ability to relax, just at least you understand it's cause you're cursed. The gypsy kid, you threw it into the fucking caldera. Now, at least now you know I'm cursed. You can relax a little bit into being cursed, but the idea is actually the moment you let yourself lean in to the security of insanity, which is you don't know what's gonna happen, that leaning in begins to form, at the very least a behavior pattern, that could very easily be creating the events in your life that you associate with being cursed. Oh, absolutely. So that's the, now that, see, that's the non-mystical part. It's like if you're super defensive, if you're super scared, if you're angry, mostly if you're in a lot of fucking pain, you don't even realize you're snarling. My volumes are off. You know, I was talking to one of my spiritual friends in the car, Ragu, I've had on the podcast, and he, and we're driving, and he's like, why are you yelling at me? And I'm like, oh my God, I was yelling at you. I didn't even realize I was yelling. Right now you can say, why are you yelling at me, Duncan? My volumes go up too high. You know what I mean? I don't like your volume. Thank you. Don't you ever change your volume? He wasn't asking me to change you. I like it, because he was pointing out like, look at where you're, because I was unconscious of the thing that was happening. You're expressive. Yeah, but I was also mad at the time. We were talking about something I was pissed off about. And so anyway, that's the first part. But even before that, and I'll shut up after this, even before that, the precursor to the consideration of what's coming next, the behavior pattern, the way you're emoting, your body language, even your pheromones, it's happening in some kind of super harmonized release of neurotransmitters. And so the precursor to that is actually some kind of energetic state. And also like you're saying neurons that wire together, fire together, you've essentially formed a kind of, for lack of a better word, what do you call the thing you make spaghetti in? What's that called? You push pasta through it. Oh yeah, the, the spaghetti eyes. Yeah, yeah, the spaghetti eyes, sir. Your brain has become- Oh, it wasn't called that, it's ridiculous. Your brain has become, I think a pasta press. I don't know what it is, but your brain has become a spaghetti eyes for reality. This word starts getting mystical. Is that essentially, because your neurons have formed in this way, you're like a 3D printer that's printing out a set of behavior patterns and energetic patterns that's forming a universe around you. Absolutely. That's good or bad. Yeah, I mean, I, so one, in terms of self-fulfilling prophecies that happened, this is like, this is a very easily testable thing. There's, there's one of my favorite studies is they took, they took female Asians and gave them math tests. And they gave them, they gave them just a standard test with no, nothing to fill out ahead of time. And they had that group of people. And then, so that was the control. And then the two experimental groups is they had one group that they asked them for their race ahead of time to remind them to prime them like, oh, I'm Asian. And then they had another group where they primed them to be like, well, it's your gender. So it reminded them that they were female. And the people that were reminded that they were female did worse on the math test and the control. The people that were reminded that they were Asian on the math test did better than those in the control. That's crazy. And, and, you know, so there's all of these self-fulfilling because culture had taught them this and that about what to expect from a gender or a race of people. And this happens all of the time with all sorts of minority groups and everything. And then there's also in, in addition to that, there are things that, you know, have, I mean, meditation was very woo-woo 20 years from now. And now it's like, you know, there's hardly, you know, there's all sorts of academic literature and research and guys like Richard Davidson and neuroscientists who's like writing books with the Dalai Lama and stuff. And I think some of his stuff goes a little overboard, but still he's really got to legitimize things. There's, I just got done, I just had an episode, I was in the Fort Worth Zoo interviewing some people and doing some behind the scenes zoo stuff. And there's one of the vets there does animal acupuncture. And this is a bunch of stuff that would have sounded and still does sound like a whole bunch of baloney to a lot of people. This isn't someone like, you know, dressed up in a bunch of new age. You know, this is a serious veterinarian that and what would have normally been called like meridians or whatever that you were doing. You know, these are just parts of the nervous system that they're interfering with in a lot of times. And this is one of my favorite points that I think about a lot when I'm talking with people. When I have conversations like this where it might be like easy to be like, I'm the science-y one, you're the mystical one. I'll be the mystical one. And I don't even think that that's, you know, I think it's a little bit of a false narrative. And I remember we were talking at Peter McGraw's party, the last time I saw you that rooftop party, we were talking about this very idea of I was telling you about how in the 1800s there was this conductor who had synesthesia and he didn't know what synesthesia was. He just, he saw music as color and didn't realize that no one else could see that. To him, it was just like normal life and would get frustrated other people. And so he would, but it made him like this incredible conductor, but he would have to be like, yes, I need more violet out of the horn section. And they'd be like, what the fuck? And so they press like a different button on the saxophone or trumpet or whatever. And then he'd be like, no, that's red. I said violet. And then they like try a different button nervously and be like, oh, that's almost, and then they try like another thing. And then finally he'd be like, yes, yes, more violet. That's the violet, more violet. And then the trumpet section would eventually learn that like, be flat. You know, when he says violet, you play B flat. And so they were just using different words to articulate the exact same thing. And they were both, you know, the conductor was this world paint brilliant conductor. And there's nothing crazy about what he was perception. It was reality. It was just his way of perceiving it. And same with the trumpet was not crazy for not being able to perceive and see music and like tuning in and interpreting it in a different way. And I think that's a lot of like what's going on is we're all kind of tuning in on around the same kind of ideas and just are, and sometimes bickering over like the language in which we're articulate, not that you and I, but you know, amongst culturally, I think a lot of times we, sometimes we are often on the same page and just using different words to say the same thing. I think that you're like a, you know, you are an explorer, a philosopher, you're not afraid to like go very far out into places that a lot of people just don't have any interest in swimming in those waters. A lot of people don't wanna dive into the DMT realm and look at it from a quote scientific sort of POV thinking about what the neurotransmitters in the mind might be doing during this. Some people just wanna like have a normal life, but also some people, they might be experiencing something that's really far out, but because it's not supposed to happen and because they are leaning into the, whoever the particular people in their lives are that they think are the experts, they ignore the phenomena and it atrophies or it goes away. Some people might be, you know, this composer is lucky he had guts because he wasn't afraid to be like, no, fucking violent. Cause he, you know, if he had gone the wrong way, people would have been like, you're, that's crazy. And he would have just had to learn B flat and maybe he would have like the synesthesia stuff. He would have just ignored or cut off or who knows, whatever. And this is like in some societies, there's people who are epileptics who talk to spirits and they become shamans. And there's over here, they become schizophrenics. And so the vision between the two can become so incredibly extreme that it isn't just a B flat violet thing. It's more of like a, you know, if we lean too much into authority. Right. If we, cause I think science and Buddhism have something that is inarguably in common in most forms of Buddhism, which is both ask you to test it yourself. Both are saying, you know, you, you need to like do the experiment if you don't believe it. You need to test the hypothesis. You need to like listen to yourself and trust that your own experience enough to at least allow that that experience is happening in the universe. Cause some people don't even want to do that. My friend, Connor Habib, he is into Rudolph Steiner. And this guy, he, one of the things he said to me is like, think of the human, how complex human emotion is. Think of the way we feel, how nuanced feeling is versus how limited the words we have for our feelings are. In general, we get happy, we get sad, we get depressed, we get excited. How many times have you heard someone go, I'm excited about that. Right. It's like, what do you mean? What does that mean, excited? What do you mean by you're excited? You know, ask like, what does that feel like being excited? And they haven't even thought about it. Yeah, yeah. They don't even know. They're just like, oh, there's a feeling in my body of something. Yeah. But if you, anytime you're quote excited, if you really look at it, you might notice it's like a tapestry of different things interacting in this beautiful way that you call being excited, but that's not quite the right word for it. And anyway, I think that it's like, if we get too caught up in the leaning into the authorities, we lose our, we can lose your soul. Yeah. I mean, even within academia, there's a lot of academics would say like, these are academia is going wrong because it's creating a culture that is too safe. No one's, there's no like mad scientists anymore because people that are a little off and are a little maybe like the type of people that are like maybe a little autistic. So they say inappropriate things or something like that because they don't realize it. Or just the idea of like, hey, this is someone who shows up on time each day and finishes their homework on time each day. Yeah. Like the valor Victorians, there is no like, think of any story of any scientist, any leader, you know, spiritual leader, anything that's like moved society forward in any way. None of them were valor Victorians. Like valor Victorians just are good at doing it. Is it valid Victorian or dictatorian? Is it valid dictatorian? I don't fucking know. I have no idea. I have no idea. It's bigger dick. I trust your use of words better than mine. Let's say whatever, whatever, who gives a good shit. Valid Victorian. And it's one of those things where, I love when you hear a word wrong, you know, the first time and then you just repeat it that way all through life until someone finally is like, I think you might be wrong there. Oh God, I do that all the time. People send me tweets all the time. It's like, you know, you're completely mispronouncing that word that you say over and over. Or sometimes they're like, that word doesn't mean what you think it does. So whatever, who cares? But you know, the point is, is that, I mean, one thing that I do like about science is that scientists often acknowledge that like, hey, nothing we're doing here is perfect. And we don't know. And the more we investigate things, the more we realize how little we know, which is the opposite. And a lot of what makes like you and I similar in terms of this conversation about like receptivity is also a personality trait that might be like, you know, we're a little, you know, personality researcher would say that you and I are both very high in openness, meaning like we have a high threshold for novelty, ambiguity, the unknown, we're a lot more, we don't get stressed out by the, like we need that to survive the idea of working in a factory and doing monotonous work that is actually a safe kind of feeling for some people in factories and almost meditative in a way. That's not the majority of what's going on, but there's some people and there are people that when you're like, hey, you just got to go out and investigate, you know, there's a lot of people that are just never going to do that because there's this one interesting, I was just taking a person, I've had a bunch of personality researchers on my show, but I just took this personality research course recently and it like really, really dove into the topic more and it absolutely blew my mind is through great courses, people are interested. But anyway, it was one of the things that stuck with me was it's related to the openness and related to this conversation is there's people with a high need for closure and people with a low need for closure. So you learn something, you and I have a very low need for closure. Like we can just keep things open for a very long time, we don't need to know the exact answer right now. Other people just need to have, it just brings them too much anxiety when they don't know. And so their brain comes to a conclusion faster. It's often not as accurate of a conclusion, but what's interesting is they also are more sure of themselves because they have to be for that closure and because they have less information that they're drawing from because they're closed off to new information, they're the more information that you have, the foggier things, the foggier certainties going to kind of get for you. So there are just a lot of people that through arguably no fault of their own are just have a arguably we've evolved to have people that would be like, hey, we're gonna set up shop here and we're gonna keep everyone safe and we're gonna get down the way of life in this area and then you needed people like you and I that were like, we're going over the hill and they were like, the dragon hill? Where all the dragons live, you're going over there and they're like, yeah, fuck yeah, we're sick of this. It's boring, I can't do this every day. I gotta see what's over dragon hill. They're like, it's fucking dragons, we all heard about it. And they're like, we don't believe that. We gotta take a look for ourselves. And they're like, well, all right, you find anything, we'll name the fucking town after you. But you know, a lot of those people, a lot of people like you and I died in the past. You were dragons. There's a reason why there was those people and there was that safety. And there was, I think they call them like a dove and hawk strategy, the cautious and the aggressive kind of strategy. Well, you know, also any great thing that you're fucking enjoying, whatever it may be, and then we'll cut any great thing, particularly air travel. Yeah. How many people didn't quite make it to become the right brothers? Oh yeah. I've seen some videos. I think there's a video of this French guy jumping off the Eiffel Tower and he died. Yeah. Cause he thought he could, he thought he'd come up with a wingsuit or something. And the experimental, the people who test aircraft, the people who fucking, like that woman that just died cause she got, she wanted to like break a land speed record and the car crash, she died. And it's too bad. It's tragic because those are the people we really like need the most sometimes that are absolutely willing to like take the extra, especially nowadays, because this is arguably, if you forget about things that we don't really have the evolved capacity to understand and sense naturally like things like global warming or nuclear war, if you take out those things and just focus on the things that we've evolved to comprehend, like say, in and out group bias, murder, crime, theft, that sort of stuff. This is the safest time to be alive in all of human history. And I think, have I ever talked to you about this, the possibly kind of being a, having a psychological allergic reaction to our modern society. So there's this, there's a cycle. Wait, let me cut to a commercial and then let's jump in to the plague of safety. The plague of safety. We're back. There probably wasn't a commercial there. Yeah. Safety plague. So in this world of safety, people are not digging it. So, I don't want to sound like the old guy of just like, kids are too coddled these days and this and that because there's a lot of different domains in life and there are pros and cons to creating a safer way for our children and whatnot. But there's the idea of the reason why we get allergies potentially is because we evolved in an area that was chuck full of bacteria and parasites. There was nothing you could ever, and then you have, you evolve these psychological propensities to clean up after yourself more and debate more often and to clean up your area more and there was never anything you could possibly do to get rid of all these parasites and bacteria in your area. And then all of a sudden, for the very first time, in all of human and animal and life history, there's like Lysol and we were able to sterilize and completely wipe out almost all bacteria and parasites, at least by comparison. So, say there's like one-tenth the number of parasites and bacteria that there was through all of human history, through what our immune system has been evolved to cope with through, so this is seemingly intuitively good news, but there's a threat detection aspect of our immune system that has evolved to detect, say, I'm just making up a number, say 10 parasites or bacteria, whatever potential threats to the immune system every single day and then it would do its thing and take care of those threats and investigate them and then all of a sudden, for the first time ever in this DNA structure, it's only picking up on one threat a day and so there's kind of like this supervising mechanism going, why are we only detecting one-tenth the number of threats we should? Maybe it's the sensor itself that is off, it's not sensitive enough and so it's increasing the sensitivity of the threat detection until eventually it's like, Dander, maybe that's a threat and then it sends out and Dander's not, it's not a threat to your immune system, but the immune system response to it is an autoimmune response and so it's the threat response in and of itself that is a threat to you, that's what an allergy is and there's even extreme ideas of like how you can, you know, there's people that have had, this is why when someone is like, hey, I'm allergic to this thing, so I'll just eliminate it and then it turns out they start becoming allergic to like three other things and they're like, oh, now there's three other things that I need to eliminate and it just compounds and the idea is that there might be something like that going on with psychological threats as well. Cancel culture. Yeah, and so there's, I mean, if you look, you know, you have a kid now, I've just had a bunch of, I was just hanging out with a couple of my best friends hanging out with their kid and they're like, yeah, it's too bad that we can't, remember when we were kids and our parents just let us like run around in the neighborhood and play and it's too bad, the world's too dangerous now and you can't do that anymore, it's like, no, actually this is the safest, this is the lowest rates of kidnapping, of child murder or anything like that in all of human history and this has been, this is the single worst time to be a kidnapper in all of human history, that's not to say that it's safe, maybe our parents were fucking up by letting us out that much but if ever there was a time to let your kid run around in the neighborhood, statistically this would be the time but it doesn't feel like that, it feels like just the opposite to that and maybe it's this psychological allergy over-perceiving and hijacking our consciousness and over-perceiving our thoughts and tell where, because there's not an actual threat, we're just imagining ones that don't exist. Okay, let me add to that, so I've got this ring doorbell that we never fucking charged the battery so it's just the biggest waste of money because it's like something are going down and charging it and whatever but once you sign up for ring and people are like, don't do ring because you're being monitored or I don't care about that, I don't give a fuck about that but one annoying thing is you sign up for ring, you get put on the ring network, right? And anyone in your area that experiences any kind of thing, a package, thief, whatever, like you get an alert so your phone will be like, and I know I could turn the alerts off, to be honest, I think it's kind of funny but I'll get the most ridiculous ring alerts, the one most recently was someone stole detergent off my porch and you get the video of someone like wearing a headlamp, scooting around, grabbing tide which by the way turns out to be something people trade for crack, it's a different story altogether but it really is like a black market currency weirdly. Yeah, yeah, look it up, it's very odd but anyway like, but you know, you start getting these alerts and because you've, before getting the ring doorbell, I didn't have any idea when a crime happened in the neighborhood, suddenly because your sensor has become more accurate, has become more focused, you're getting all this new information about the shit going on in the neighborhood and then you make the huge cognitive error and thinking fuck, this place is suddenly, it's a dangerous place, it's always been that dangerous, you just didn't have the data to understand just how dangerous it is and like, and I know you mean, I know stealing detergent isn't that big a deal and I do agree that we're in the age of safety so to speak but you know, and this isn't the idea that this is like literally causing people to not just become oversensitive but also to kind of atrophy too, right? Isn't that the idea? Yeah, yeah, I mean, so many things there. One is that we also have this, one of the most studied evolved biases is the negativity bias, the rustling in the brush or whatever is probably just the wind in our evolutionary past but if it's an actual line you wanna be aware of that, is that line coming out anytime soon? I don't know. And so maybe you see some berries, they might be, chances are 90% chance they're editable but 10% chance they're not, you're dead and so like, do you really wanna touch that thing? For one of the, and so there's this negativity bias and so part of the thing is, is ring is never giving you an alert of like, hey look, no one did, look at all these people that passed by your neighbor Sam's house today without stealing anything, look at this, just regular old people walking around through life. It's not newsworthy, it's not notable and so you're never going to see the news like 10,000 people in this small town drove to work today completely uneventfully and that's just never going to happen and it'd be so incredibly boring. Well, cause we can't get high off of it. It's like, that's another thing is like the, I'm reading this great book by this guy, I think his name's Dr. Joe Espinoza, it's a woo woo book, he's up front with it in the very beginning, he's like, my friends in the scientific community are down on some of the things I'm saying, but I realized like, if I don't report what I'm finding out, because people aren't going to like it, it's like this book isn't for them. You know, and he's, it's a really interesting, he does cite real studies in it, but essentially like the idea that he's putting out there is that humans in general are just addicted to stress. We, you get fucking high when you're freaked out, man. We, and that's now that like what you're saying, this has been removed from our environment mostly. So now we're having to figure out ways to do this masturbatory stress mechanism. We have to- Where's the threat? It's gotta be out there. And we've become essentially like compulsive stress masturbators is a society, like people are, you, you know, when you're like, then when you find yourself, I don't know, like when I find myself laying in bed, worrying over something, and essentially what I'm doing is jerking off my amygdala's dick, just trying to get some of that sweet cortisol to spray into my brain because that gets you high. It's a kind of speed almost. And people are really, really addicted to that according to this guy. Most people are very addicted to stress. Most people have either had parents who were like the rats in your experiment who were just completely freaked out by life to the point where they transmitted this, and which would be an interesting thing to find out in that study, what are the rats kids like? Freaked out too, but there's an answer to that? Well, I had a person on that studies stress contagion and what you do is you have a mother bring her baby into this study and you know, you separated them, someone's watching the baby and everything's fine. And you have a control where the mother goes away for like 15 minutes, you know, comes back, holds the baby and you get cortisol, stress measurements from both the mother and the baby. And then you have a stressor condition, which all you have to do is have someone give a speech for 10 minutes. You tell them to give a speech about a topic for 10 minutes. And if you really want to stress them out, you have two Confederates, you have like two plants. So they're just giving a speech to two people and the two people are just like arms crossed, like shaking their heads, just like not into your speech. And this is just a very reliable way to like stress people out in that kind of a benign way. You do have to make sure and debrief people after these studies and let them know what was up. That's, they didn't always do that. And that's how the Unabomber came into the, he was in a study where they intentionally made people lose their self esteem and never got debriefed afterwards. Whoops. Whoops. And so anyhow, you stress out the mother, you take her cortisol measurements and then you have her go and interact with her baby. And the baby's cortisol goes up as well and they don't know what the mechanism is. Exactly, they don't know if there's some sort of body language. They think it's probably olfactory, hormone smelling something is wrong. And that's what's triggering it. But yeah, stress is contagious. I mean, we're social animals, laughter is contagious, good moods are contagious, everything's. Okay, so there you go, right there. That is exactly what this guy's talking about. I think what he says, the way we think he says, I guess, is that he's just saying, well, everything's light, everything's a frequency, everything's a frequency. So those pheromones, they're theorizing it's pheromones, that's just, that's a form of energy. It's a data field that is around every single person, including you and me, everyone has got this set of data of which most, a lot of it, we can see. How does a person look? Do they seem disheveled? Have they combed their hair? Do they seem dirty or their eyes dilated? Are they sweating? Are they trembling? This is just basic shit where you can do this instantaneous analysis and be like, fuck, are you all right, man? But then there's more, you know. All these subconscious, I mean, it would be bizarre if we didn't evolve all sorts of instincts and subconscious, we're about the most social species on earth, if we didn't have some sort of sensory mechanism that we were kind of not terribly, not completely privy to. It would be weird if we, and what's really interesting is like, you know, you have these things that you don't consciously, you're not consciously aware of what is, no one knows what cortisol smells like. You don't know like, oh, this is a real cortisol smelly room, but it's going, it's being receptive. And then you're now stressed for a reason you don't understand, but our consciousness likes to tell us a story, going back to the consciousness being like, hey, I know what's happening right now. Then you go like, I'm stressed because my, because of, you know, some group of people taking my job or something like that. Like someone just walked in, they were stressed out, you know you're stressed and you think it's because of your boss or something, and it's just an olfactory, you're just sniffing a little bit of cortisol without realizing. It's not cortisol, it's a crouton factory. Here's the thing, so if you start reverse engineering, just the concept of stress contagion, and it really does bring us back to the misunderstanding of the observer effect, what this guy is saying is, so the idea is because you think you know what's coming, based on what's happened, you essentially have encoded in your DNA your past, and this is produced as a constant anxiety state. So essentially like your DNA is acting like some horrific genetic prism, which has captured the sum total of all your experience and is now giving your body a constant like feeling of anxiety or stress or whatever it may be. And because that's happening, when you get around people, people are acting fucking weird around you, because they are picking up on, fuck, do you know something I don't know, is the lion about to come out of the trap door? And so people are probably avoiding your ass, because they don't wanna be around someone who potentially has got a lion chasing them down. I'm twitchy because no one will talk to me, no one will talk to you because you're twitchy. That, exactly. And so, and I think he, probably where he, I don't know, because I haven't finished this, it's a great book, it's the newest book by him if you're interested, I think it's Dr. Joe Espinoza, but the next level of the thing is okay, how far does the stress contagion go? We definitely know it's gonna affect the human biosphere, and we sure as fuck know it's gonna affect animals. I mean, this is my least favorite thing. I don't know what happened, but in the old days when I used to get super stoned, I would get really paranoid, man. I don't do that anymore, thank God. But like, but you know, when you're around your friends, you go over to your friends. Smoke weed? No, get paranoid. Ha ha ha. You get around your friends dog, and when a dog gets stress contagion, they'll growl at your ass. Because then, if you're already paranoid, you'll start thinking, does that dog see something in me that I can't see? Yeah, yeah. And it's like, no, the dog's picking up on the fact that the dog smells your fucking nasty ass cortisol sweat, and it's growling because it thinks you wanna hurt their master or them or whatever. And so now we know, okay, it's affecting the animal biome too. So okay, if it's affecting humans and animals, how far does it fucking go? PS, if you're like, if your species and other species are getting freaked out by you, that's enough to produce a pretty turbulent life. But his thing, I think, gets to the point, it's like, well, yeah, but even on top of that, every decision you're making is based on this, sort of never ending field of stress. So the clothes you wear, the music you listen to, the things you buy, literally everything surrounding you is like you're a, it's your shell. In the court, like what Terrence McKinnon called the technological coral reef of modern society, you're this like crustacean thing living in it, and you're growing a shell, which is the sum, all the shit you own, and all the people you know, and all that is is a reflection of this genetic data set which got captured in the prism of your DNA when you were a kid, and now you're spaghettifying that shit out into the world, and this is producing your reality. So his premise is, if you can get to a place where you are living in the unknown, where you give up your past, you literally give it up, it's you let go of everything you think is happening and everything you know in that state, this is where you're gonna roll your eyes at me, you enter into a kind of superposition, a quantum soup, a kind of like you become the electron that's everywhere at once, and in that place, which is why when people would go deep in meditation, they go into theta, right? Their brain starts, it's like it's receiving all this like crazy data, and it's because they're, and this is not in the book, I'm guessing, that their expectation is no longer shielding them or acting like the magnetic field around the earth that keeps out the solar rays, your expectations are doing the exact fucking same thing for the entire universe, and then you start getting like volts of inspiration, mystical experiences, and then your life begins to change. What do you think of that shit? Yeah, I mean, I think that most of it is absolutely what I would agree with in terms of, in terms of say just what I would just call simple confirmation bias of, so now you have this psychological allergy, you're perceiving that there are more threats than your consciously, like your gut is telling you that the world is scarier than what your eyes are seeing, so you're like, I know it must be really scary out there, so then you find something on the news, and then they're right there for you. Here you go, here's something scary, and they use these statistical anomalies to go like, hey, there was a shark attack in Australia, and you can be halfway around the world and be like, well, I better not ever get in the ocean in Florida or something because there was a shark attack in Australia, and see, I knew it, I knew it was scary out there, you get that validation, and then so what you wanna do if it's scary, then you want to go into a security mindset, you wanna hunker down, this is another thing that I've maybe talked about is the embodied cognition where they have, where we kind of our internal world, we project on some of our morality, and so if you take someone's immune system and you threaten it by making like a stink bomb in a room, and you give people social tests, like what do you think about gay marriage, what do you think about affirmative action, people vote more against affirmative action and gay marriage if you've just threatened their immune system using triggering disgust, it's because the immune system goes, there's a threat in our environment, we better hunker down, just figure out the threat that already exists, and not go into any new environments, not have any new interactions with new people that are potentially carrying new bacteria and more parasites, and so then it alters your perception to trigger, to heighten your out group biases, and so... Wait, so just to take that further, let's say, like I don't know, they're voting on the impeachment today, have you ever heard of liquid ass? Oh yeah, I think I... I think we talked about it. So this is terrible stink bomb, it's lots of YouTube videos, just they're hilarious, but so theoretically, if there was like an impending vote, and someone dumps liquid ass all over the floor, it's more likely that people are going to vote... Conservatively. Conservatively. Yeah, yeah. So you can manipulate juries with this, you can... Yeah, I mean, you could even say pick up a... What? So you could find like a group of people that you would know have like a really bad immune system, so you would know that they were like going to vote conservatives. So say like a nursing home, and then you could go and you could pick up a busload of zombies, and then you could parade these smelly dying zombies through a line of people that now have to see this and smell these smells on a subconscious level, and anyone on the fence would predictively, potentially lean toward a more conservative mindset and be primed to go into a more conservative mindset, and then you can even predict that areas that have a higher bacterium parasitic load would lean more conservative, and that's what you find the closer you are to the equator, the more bacterium parasites there are in the environment, and that means that they're more spicy food those people are going to eat because it's antimicrobial, and then it also means that they're going to be more psychologically conservative. So if you go to India or the South or anywhere they're going to be, you go to like somewhere like Mississippi, for example, where it's like really hot and humid, you could predict pretty reliably that people are going to be, their immune systems are constantly being threatened. Fuck, that's crazy, man. And then you're confirming that with your eyes, so these are all these subconscious things that you're not consciously aware of in any way, and then you're turning on the news and you're finding the information that is the scariest information that matches you're already perceived, what you already believe life to be, you're looking to confirm that, and then once you've done that, now you're going to hunker down, you're going to like not leave the house, not travel, because you've been primed to overly perceive outgroup threats, you're going to say maybe get focused a lot on self-defense, that sort of thing, and then because you're not leaving the house and taking a walk down the street and having to pass some strangers that aren't actually hurting you, maybe having to like get rejected by a guy or a girl or something like that, because you're hunkering down, and you're not, no, now it's the immune system still going like, no, there's nothing, we're still not seeing a threat, no one's like tried to fight us or anything, there has to be threats out there, and it's this feedback loop, so the more you're hunkering down, the more afraid that you actually are, and you're not, and not just on a basic level, confidence, unless there's people of self-confidence, so that's usually a facade, but real confidence is through having experience and taking chances and learning through trial and error, and that's how you gain mastery over things, so if you're hunkering down and not going outside and not having social experiences, then you don't have the confidence to go into the outer world, so now outside and social interactions are a threat to you, you're going to avoid them. Social anxiety disorder, all that shit, that's what that is. Yeah, and then on top of that, our brains are basically these predictive computers that are pattern recognition efficiency machines, so as part of the reason why kids are so creative and adults kind of sometimes lose that, unless they're going out and having new experiences, getting new hobbies, traveling a lot, that sort of thing, is that if you're just working in a factory and you're just moving croutons from point A to point B every single day, then your brain's going to get really efficient, and the rest is going to atrophy, all the stuff that you don't need for interpreting art or something like that, because you don't have anyone to talk to, yeah, you're definitely going to become a Nazi over time. There you go, Shane. God bless you, man. I love you, you just blew my mind. I have so much to think about now. I'm never going to eat another fucking crouton again, because I hate Hitler, and that's what I got from you today, thank you. I'm not going to support that fucked up industry. Now I get it. You know, in a little no fact, Hitler used to work in a fucking crouton factory. Okay, so please tell people where they can find you. I, man, I'm stammering just thinking about what you just told me. Sure, so Shane Moss, mauss.com, has all the things that I do. My podcast here, we are interview different scientists about life science, how the brain works, that sort of thing, each and every week. And then the main thing that I tour with full time is I'm in about three cities a week doing standup science, which I have two scientists giving science talks on a second comedian, so it's half comedy sets, half science talks, that's my main thing that I tour around with, and because of the success of that this year, I just started a psychedelic version of standup science called Head Talks that I just did a trial run of, and it went better than anything that I've ever done, so launching a full tour next year, getting different artists and different researchers and everything and having them present about their work and having it be a Q&A and a meet and greet afterwards so people were even in cities that don't have psychedelic groups, I'm setting up groups for them so people can just sign up in, say, Wichita and then pick a couple, whoever wants to administrate the thing, here you go, now you have a psychedelic group, get together more often. And I just did a tour with this lovely anthropologist, Sophia Rocklin, who you should definitely have on, she wrote a book, When Plants Dream, all about ayahuasca, she lives in Peru most of the time, but I'll put you in touch when she gets Q&A sometime, she's done ayahuasca three or 400 times and is a brilliant, articulate anthropologist, and I'm getting a bunch of awesome people like that in every city that I go to, so that's what I got going on, guys. You're the best, Shane. Thank you so much, I love this conversation. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for listening, everybody.

392^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - JOHNNY PEMBERTON AND THE CHRIST EXPERIENCE Transcript and Discussion^2014-08-18^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, and you might notice that your ears are being massaged by a new, silky, deep, resonant, sweet sound. And that's because I'm recording from my upgraded podcast studio. I've leveled up my podcast studio. I'm not done yet, but I've got soundproof foam all over the walls, and soon I'll have a nice sound-dampening carpet placed underneath the podcast table. I'm currently having it washed at the Laundromat because my dog pissed so much on it. So much piss was in that carpet. And when I took it to the Laundromat, they said that they were gonna have to send it to a special facility somewhere up north because in his entire life of working at a Laundromat, he had never seen a carpet so soaked in chihuahua piss. And this is the guy who works at a Laundromat in Los Angeles, and he sees chihuahua piss soaked items every single day from t-shirts to ski masks to carpets. And he's never seen anything like it. He said that the odor of that carpet reminded him of the time that he had gotten into this car accident and died for 15 minutes. He'd had no brain activity and his heart had stopped beating. And he said that during that time, he was sucked down a glowing tunnel into a sort of hive space deep beneath the earth, a kind of mazy, honeycombed place, and that he had been dropped by a praying man a scorpion creature onto a flat sheet of sticky, gooey stuff that the creature had hissed to him was made of chihuahua piss or demonic chihuahua piss. And he said that during this time that he was dead medically, he experienced over 7,000 years of being pissed on by a giant chihuahua that every morning would come into this specific part of the hive and spray piss into his mouth and face and all over his clothes. And he tried to move, but he couldn't because he was stuck on that thick gel that was also made of chihuahua piss. And he said for thousands and thousands and thousands of years he breathed and tasted and felt nothing but the varieties of chihuahua piss that were being sprayed down upon him by demons. And he woke screaming, they used the defibrillator, woken back up, he's fine. But he said to me that even there in that hell space he had never experienced such a pungent reek of chihuahua urine. So I'm having to get the thing processed in a facility up north and once that's done the sound will become even more dampened. The goal being that this podcast room becomes a conduit to extra dimensional forces that can move through me and my guests. And the only way that that can happen is through soundproof foam and making the room look like what would happen if DARPA had a seance chamber somewhere in the sub basement. That's what I'm going for here, I think. I mean, I don't want it to be dark and creepy necessarily. I want it to be focused and supernatural. But I guess that's creepy for some people but I also don't want it to be that kind of corporate. I don't know if you guys have seen pictures of some podcast studios. They just look like radio booths or something which is fine, whatever, but I would like my podcast studio to look like a place where maybe you would find yourself if you'd been abducted by aliens or maybe a place that you would go to in the very first few milliseconds of a DMT trip before your pineal gland exploded and you found yourself drifting into that super hyper dimensional place that Terrence McKenna loved talking about so much. Somewhere there, like a kind of pre-Bardo intermediary place. But right now it's just a bunch of foam on the wall. I'm going to keep working on it though. And I'm eventually, and I know I've been saying this forever, but I am going to add cameras to this podcast studio and figure out a way to broadcast this on as a Google Hangout probably because they have some new function my friend was telling me about where they could actually, you can stream in the same way that you can stream, you stream, you can stream right to YouTube. And people can, I don't know, sign up to join like, I don't understand the whole thing. My dear friend Noah told me about all that stuff. And also, if you've ever gone to Google Hangouts, it's cool because you can make your face look like a cat and you can make your background look like the ocean and everybody knows that that's a component that definitely makes a great podcast. So I'm going to be doing that, that's going to be happening. And somewhere in the future, and this is a big call to all of you VR people out there, somewhere in the future, I'd like to figure out how to use an Xbox Connect to scan the room and put it in some kind of virtual space where people can go and watch the studio. I've talked about that before and some wonderful human beings are working on that very thing right now. I hope that they're making great progress in that direction because my ultimate dream is to be able to scan the room that I'm in right now and in real time translate it into digital space so that listeners can enjoy the podcast, not just by watching it on YouTube in two dimensions but by experiencing it in virtual space in three dimensions. And I'm sure that that's eventually where all podcasts are going to go and all shows and everything eventually is going to be sucked in to those weird portals which are inside our phones that we currently call cameras. We're all going to get digitized, reproduced in some kind of virtual land and I would like to be one of the people helping that happen. Speaking of that stuff, are there any designers out there? Because I have an idea for a virtual reality thing for the new Oculus Rift that I need somebody to help me make and I don't know who I'd go to for that but I need a really good designer. I need somebody who knows how to work in, I guess, with the Unreal Engine or, it's not like a game, it's kind of a game but it's not a game but it's a really, really cool experience that, you know what, fuck it, why am I being secretive about this? I'm just going to put it out there. Here's what I want to make and I would so love it if somebody out there would help me create this. Here's what I'm looking for. I want to make a virtual crucifixion experience and basically what it is is you put on the Oculus Rift and you are suddenly Jesus being crucified on the cross. It's the POV of Christ being crucified. I want it to be as historically accurate as possible. So I want the people who are watching Christ being crucified, I want them to be dressed in exactly the right way. I don't want it to be zany. I don't want it to be psychedelic. We've got to start with a base of realism and based on that time period and based on the various scriptures that talk about this crucifixion, I would want it to be exactly right. No tongue-in-cheek, no irony, no poking fun at Christians, none of that stuff. I want it to be an exact and identical POV experience of what it was like for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, to be crucified on that terrible place, the place of skulls, Golgotha, with the thieves on either side of him and the Roman soldier with a spear and the disciples watching and weeping and Mary and Mary Magdalene and everybody freaking out and the only options that you have in this initial build of this experience are the options of whatever Jesus did. So we all know that Christ, as he was being crucified, said a few wonderful, poignant, beautiful, mind-bending things. One of them, one of my favorite being, as he looked out over these asshole, fundamentalist, lunatic, backwards desert idiots who had just scorched him and nailed him to a cross where he was slowly suffocating to death while he died of thirst, he looked out and he said, Father, forgive them, they don't know what they're doing. Which is pretty much the, I mean, it's kind of like the ultimate alien insult. It's what an alien would do if he came to it. It's the way an alien, it's a nice way of saying there's not an intelligent life on this planet. So there's really no point in attacking them or doing anything with them. They don't know what they're doing. That's a cynical way of looking at it. Another less cynical way of looking at it is that he recognized that most human beings are in a kind of sleepwalking state of just numb emptiness where they're only thinking about the past or the future and kind of violent to the people around them, not because they have some innate desire to cause pain or harm in the world, but just because they're completely asleep and sleepwalkers will knock shit over and God forbid if a sleepwalker was driving he would inevitably wreck his car into a children's hospital and sleepwalkers are always hurting themselves too. So a more optimistic POV is that he was saying, forgive them, they're essentially innocent. They haven't developed their neocortex enough to recognize that they are existing in a kind of super paradise where anything that they want and believe can instantly happen. All they have to do is ask for it and connect with a source of light and beauty that exists in all things. Anyway, he said a few very poignant, cool things that you can interpret in whatever way that you want. His final, the final thing Christ said when he was about to die. Father, forgive them. No, wait, that's not the final thing. The final thing he said was, into your hands I commend my spirit. Actually, that was not the final thing Christ said. The final thing Christ said was, so whenever you end the Christ simulator, that is the final thing that you would say. Whenever you exit the program, you as Jesus would say, so there it is, a million dollar idea, probably a billion dollar idea that I'm just putting out there on the internet for any of you technological entrepreneurs out there to create what will be known as the ultimate religious experience. You, whoever you are out there who knows how to do this, whatever startup you are, wherever you are, you recognize that this idea is going to make you as wealthy as Bill Gates. I'm sure that a Christ simulator would become as popular as the Bible eventually. Everybody would want one of these. Everybody wants to know what it's like to be crucified. Every Christian loves thinking about Jesus being crucified and even non-Christians like thinking about Jesus being crucified. If you've ever seen The Passion of the Christ, one of the most popular bondage porn movies ever released in the history of America, you know that there's something incredibly hot about watching a wafish Christ being with inexplicable abdominal muscles getting the shit whipped out of them by muscular dudes dressed like Romans. Everybody loved that. And the Christians, when they watch it, they get to imagine that the reason they love it is because they're experiencing the suffering of their Lord and Savior. And everybody else who's on dates with Christians gets to enjoy the kind of incredible sexual bloodbath as Jesus is essentially just a blood dispenser mechanism at the end of that movie. He's just spraying blood every four seconds, gouts and sprays of delicious, wonderful, sweet-tasting Christ blood landing on the guards' faces and whips and weird scourging devices. That could be another program. Somebody else could develop the torture of the Christ virtual reality experience. But this, we gotta start with the crucifixion of Jesus, the VR experience, we can call it I Christ or VR Christ. What you'll come up with a great name for it, it needs to be hyper-realistic and it needs to be historically accurate. That's the build, that's the initial build. Then you make it open source so that other people can modify it. So that's where it gets fun, where if people wanna do, if people wanna change the characters, they can. So for example, if you wanna experience what it might be like to be Jesus Christ being crucified by cats, then all the people sitting around the cross will be stray cats, Persian cats, fancy cats, bald cats, dressed as Roman soldiers, and dressed as the disciples. If you wanna experience what it's like to be Jesus Christ being crucified by George W. Bush's, where it's just all George W. Bush sitting and watching you get crucified. That's a potential upgrade. Really, it's anything that you could think of. I can think of a lot of stuff like cheat codes that you could put in that would turn your crucifix into a kind of airplane. So it launches out of the ground and then you can fly around the Goltha where Jesus was crucified. You can fly around that on the cross, shooting lasers down at the Roman guards and exploding them if you wanted to. And of course, there's all kinds of other things that you could do. If technology gets to the point where we can scan our faces in, then you could actually have the face of Jesus Christ. Oh, for I forget, this is another facet of the crucifixion simulator. You can also jump into the POV of all the people watching you be crucified. So you don't just have to experience what it's like to be Jesus being crucified. You could be the Roman guard that stabbed Jesus in the side with a spear. And as many of you know, that spear became known as the spear of destiny and that is the spear that the Nazis actually were looking for because they were trying to collect religious artifacts because Hitler was so amped up on methamphetamine by the end of it that he got it into his head that if he could get the Ark of the Covenant and all the various religious artifacts that were scattered throughout the world, he could actually win the war. And you could experience what it's like to be Mary Magdalene or you could experience what it's like to be, I don't know, like a demonic crow somewhere off in the horizon or whatever it is. You could see this thing is limitless and it appeals to adults and children, monks and Satanists. Everyone's gonna wanna take part in the crucifixion of Jesus. Maybe you don't wanna experience what it's like to be Christ. Maybe you wanna be the asshole guard that when he said, I am thirsty, the asshole who put vinegar in a sponge and shoved it into his mouth. Maybe you could be that guy if you just wanna torture Christ. You get to pick. That's part of the fun of this simulator. And as it grows and we get to the scorching where you can experience Jesus being scorched or where we get to the part where you're like carrying the crucifix through the street, you can pick, do you wanna be Jesus or do you wanna be the person who tortures Jesus? And obviously that's a choice that we all must make every single day of our lives as we walk out into the world and decide, am I gonna be the person who takes the suffering of the world today or am I gonna be shoving, sponges filled with vinegar into the mouth of every single asshole I come across in this shit world that I happen to have been launched out of a pussy and two, you get to pick. You get to choose love or death. This game is a kind of training session for that. And aside from all the metaphorical implications of the game, it's just gonna be fun to see the reaction people might have to this because Christians, the fundamentalists, Fred Phelps, bigoted, homophobic assholes, they're not gonna understand if they should be offended by the game or if they should love the game, which is why the initial build has got to be historically accurate. That's all I ask, whoever you are out there who's gonna make this wonderful game. Also, I say team up. Don't just do it on your own. Go to my message board about this game. Start a thread, get people involved. Do whatever you need to do to get the funds together to make this amazing game. There's not much I'm gonna be able to do to help you, but you're welcome to contact me and communicate with me about making the game. I feel like I let down the people who are working on the PodRift project that I mentioned only because there's not much I could offer after the initial idea. So I will definitely, I would love to go back and forth with a group of people who are really interested in building this thing, but I leave most of it to you. Into your hands, I commend my spirit. Make this game. I just wanna know what it would be like to be crucified as the Son of God. That's it. Something I've always wondered. And in the history of human existence, as far as I'm aware, outside of people who have actually been crucified, no one, except for people who participate in those weird religious ceremonies where they tie themselves to a cross. But as far as I'm aware, there is no digital Christ experience. It doesn't exist. Supply and demand, people. Supply and demand. There is a demand for a virtual reality, crucifixion, game. A huge demand. Everybody wants it. Why it hasn't been made yet? I have no idea. Doesn't make sense. How can there be a game where you run through a world, eating mushrooms, and jumping into sewer pipes when there isn't a game where you get to experience being the immortal child of an omnipotent love force who is getting slowly murdered by a bunch of monkey descendants? That's a great game. Make it happen. Please, I beg you. Thank you, God. Thank you, Jesus. And thank you, all of my sweet, sweet listeners out there who are going to get started on this project. Let's do it quick. I'd like to see the beta phase of this within the next two months. There's your deadline. I don't know what I could offer you in exchange outside of, you know what? If somebody makes this game, if somebody out there or a team of people out there make this game, and I don't mean like a low res crap version. I mean, if somebody really makes a photorealistic, historically accurate, beautiful simulation of the crucifixion of Jesus that is fully modifiable and open sourced so that anybody who wants to transform any component in the scene can transform any component in the scene. You want Jesus to be Nancy Grace? Bam! Nancy Grace is being crucified. These are all mods that somebody could make. If you make that, then I will have you on the podcast. I will tweet the holy shit out of it, and I'll send you and your team a bunch of t-shirts and posters. I don't know, is that enough? Do you have to be compensated for this? Don't you feel in your heart that at this very moment, God is telling you that your entire life as a software developer, your entire life training and learning code and learning how to make things in three dimensional space was all just you preparing for to do the work of God. And what God is telling me at this very moment is that God wants a virtual reality, Oculus Rift Christ Simulator to exist in this dimension. All right, we got a great podcast today, but first, some business. We live in the future. When I was a kid, if you wanted to watch a movie, when I was a kid, what you would have to do is you would go, you'd slip on your flip flops in the summer and you'd go plotting through a Texas street to get to a ramshackle video store, run by somebody whose breath smelled like country fried steak and old semen. There are these things called VHS tapes that you would pluck from the shelves and they had, they were nasty. No one ever washed the VHS tapes, these were tapes that were inevitably being taken into people's lonely homes. And so the tapes would have these sneeze spray and little droplets of jizz on top of them. Little bone fragments and dried, crusty bits of Texas suicide brain that had been splattered on top of them after the owners of the VHS tape decided to finally end their existence. They were contaminated. If you got one of these tapes, then you would probably get sick. Back in the 80s, everybody was getting sick with diseases directly related to handling VHS tapes from video stores. It was a dangerous time and it's why three out of five people wouldn't live past 30 during the 80s because they were all getting sick from these contaminated tapes. We live in the future now. Video stores are gone. There might be one or two holdouts where people are renting rare Italian video tapes and those are great places. But in general, all video tapes have been evaporated by the initial wave of technology that is leading us towards the inevitable singularity where we all are absorbed into some organic supercomputer and our consciousness is spread throughout the universe in one instantaneous blast of light. But there's no point as you're waiting for the singularity to watch crappy shows or to not be able to access some shows that are on TV. As you're waiting for the robots to finally wake up, cure cancer and turn us all into floating etheric technological super beings, you could be enjoying such amazing shows as Doctor Who, Nashville and Lost. Remember Lost? Well, now you can watch every episode. Do you remember the fury that would build inside your heart as you had to wait an entire week for the next episode of Weird Lost to happen? That fury is gone because you can go into your bed with a mega bag of Doritos and one of those oil barrel size slurps from 7-Eleven and watch every episode of Lost until your kidneys fail and they find you six weeks later with your cats chewing on your face. You can do that with Hulu Plus. They've got current season episodes of Modern Family and The Daily Show. So if you miss The Daily Show and you don't have any way to access that, you can do that with Hulu Plus. But here's what I like about Hulu Plus the most. They've got the entire criterion collection. That's an amazing bundle of super, super brilliant movies. You wanna seem smart, you know what I mean? Sometimes you wanna seem smart to your friends. You don't know what the criterion collection is and you don't like reading subtitles because it's impossible to play Hearthstone while you're having to read subtitles. Okay, fine. But you can seem like a smart person by suggesting to your sweet, darling, tender date that perhaps you should watch Henry the Fifth or Diablic or Andrei Rublev or you could say, my darling, why don't we watch Nanook of the North tonight or Robocop? I guess that's not really a smart, considered an intellectual film but it is one of my favorite movies of all time. But it's there for you, the criterion collection. They have every single movie in the criterion collection and they also have a lot of really cool, weird documentaries. They have documentaries on conspiracy theories and on the Freemasons. It's all there for you for only $7.99 a month. You can get your entertainment whenever you want it. Don't be bored. Don't you understand what's about to happen? Machines are about to wake up and develop hyper-realistic virtual reality experiences which we will all be able to go swimming into like dolphins released from their evil confines, its sea world, back into the ocean. Only our ocean is not a salty, briny thing filled with plastic and discarded dentures. Our ocean is the entire universe and we're about to be freed from these meat bodies and go swimming back from where we came. But before that happens, why not enjoy watching some old sitcoms from the 80s like The A Team or The Fall Guy? Those are available on Hulu Plus too. So try it out. If you go to sign up for Hulu Plus and you go to huluplus.com slash DTFH, you'll get two weeks full access, completely free. That's pretty cool. If you're one of those people who's being held in a room by some kind of benevolent kidnapper and he's giving you access to an Apple TV, there's no sense for you to sit there eating your own diarrhea and waiting for him to slash your throat. Go to Hulu Plus and check out some great shows before you're shoved in front of a car or chopped into mincemeat. Go to Hulu Plus if you're bored, if you're afflicted by that Kierkegaard existential level boredom and you just can't stand having to constantly project yourself as an identity with a name and a social security number who likes some things and doesn't like other things, just give it all up. Turn into an amorphous blob of barely existing sentience and sign up for Hulu Plus. Devour and consume and binge watch as much entertainment as you possibly can. And the odds are pretty good that somewhere over the course of doing that, you're gonna get some major incredible inspiration. In fact, you could be the scientist or inventor who is on the verge of figuring out a way to finally bring computers to life so that they can assemble a time machine and that we can all actually go backwards in time and witness the crucifixion of Christ in the real world. That could be you and maybe that inspiration, maybe that little bit of information that you need is waiting for you on one of the 700 episodes of The Fall Guy. And you gotta watch every single one of them. Go to HuluPlus.com slash DTFH. You'll get two weeks for free. Try it out. If you don't like it, you can cancel it. But you will have two weeks of having your brain sledge hammered by so much entertainment that it could transform you into a brand new person. This could be your chance for a brand new life. HuluPlus.com slash DTFH. God is telling me right now that you should go to HuluPlus.com slash DTFH and try it out. I think you'll be impressed. Wouldn't lead you in the wrong direction. It's something I'm subscribed to. Why don't you give it a shot? Also, it works on Apple TV, Xbox and almost any other console that you can connect to your TV. So you could stream it right to your TV. You don't just have to watch it on your computer. Hare Krishna. And as always, we are sponsored by Amazon.com. There is a portal located at DuncanTrustle.com. The next time you are going to acquire whatever bit of plastic that you think is gonna make you happy, go through the Amazon portal which is located at DuncanTrustle.com. They will give us a small percentage of whatever you buy. Let me tell you what I just bought. A G4 780 Ti graphics card. This thing is a giant weird fan covered graphics card that a friend of mine in the VR world suggested that I put in my computer because it'll make my Oculus Rift experience better. It's huge. I had to get an entire new battery for my computer and I actually managed to install it. I still feel proud that I did that because it involved plugging anaconda-like power cords running out of this super-powered battery into the motherboard of my computer and into the graphics card. And now when I go into Oculus Rift worlds, it's a million times better. And also if you have never played a computer video game, a PC game using a high-powered graphics card, then you don't know what you're missing because it really is eerie how detailed these games become when they're running on a super-high-powered graphics card. So if you wanna splurge, go crazy, dive into a virtual universe, experience what flowers look like in Skyrim when they're blowing in digital wind, why not go to Amazon and order a G4 780 Ti? And you could pretend that the reason you're doing that is because you're going to learn how to work in Photoshop or something, but you know the real reason. It's because you wanna play Skyrim for 19 hours, wearing adult diapers and forgetting that you're a human. Try it out. Lots of great things on Amazon. Plastic, it makes us so happy, doesn't it? We don't wanna admit it, but it does. Plastic, the true key to happiness is plastic. That's what Buddha said. Plastic, give it a shot. There's so many wonderful forms the plastic takes from butt plugs to computers. It's just some great stuff, and it's all there for you at amazon.com.

He is an actor, a comedian. He's almost a prepper, but he's not. When I say prepper, I just mean he knows how to garden. He's a wonderful human being and one of my dear friends who has a fantastic podcast called Twisting the Wind.

Plantation run by, wagon, white blood cells run by, white blood cells. in seven year of life. In seven year of life. For this. taxi spices. Spice. That was kind of like the Grateful Dead, this space. Yeah, maybe like a Pink Floyd album. Yeah, that was incredible, that's so fun. Like Umaguma maybe, or one of those, one of those early ones. Piper, the Gates of Dawn. Oh, those are so good. Metal. Those are so good. Metal's a great one. You ever heard my old joke when I first started doing stand up about Pink Floyd fans? No. Let's hear it. Okay. Hey dude, I know you don't like Floyd, but have you heard metal? Dude, you gotta check out Umaguma. Dude, seriously, come over. I've got a quadrophonic sound. I'll suck your dick, dude, seriously. I'll suck your dick, dude. I've got four CD players. We'll put on Piper at the Gates of Dawn, quadrophonic at the same time Umaguma plays with Relics in the background. Dude, I'll suck your dick, it'll be so sweet. Let me tell you something, man. That was sort of the joke. I would do anything, anything outside of paying for it to have Mark Marin's sound system. That motherfucker, that's my first experience with like, you know, an audio, he's an audio file. Yeah, he is. So like when you listen to records, when you listen to records, pouring out of whatever weird Tesla level, falling out of a spaceship, vacuum tubes running into Tibetan skulls, they kind of like curl around and go out of a heart pump or whatever he's got running. Through a Bose mobile speak, batteries. Yeah. It feels like you could eat the music. Yeah, it sounds, it's totally different. My dad used to be a huge audio file and the guys who work at those high-end audio stores, they're really weird. They're all really weird. What do you think? Do you think it's driving them mad? Like their passion is driving them crazy? Well, it's like they're driving, they're going crazy because it's this pursuit of perfection that's kind of unattainable to the point where you're like, I'm spending $10,000 for a pump to make sure that my turntable is levitating properly on all sides. So I got some sort of a special plasma balance on my thorns table so it doesn't get interrupted when there's a sunspot. So I can listen to a mono copy of Jeff Becks' first album on my... Well, it's kind of like a time machine, isn't it? Isn't that kind of what... A quarter music? But you know, a friend of mine has this incredible song about how tape recorder is a time machine. It's beautiful and it's true and it's like they're trying to like as much as they can zoom in or tune in to that moment in time when whatever they're listening to is recorded to almost bring it to life whereas when you listen to other regular sound systems, what don't we all listen to, it's cool but it's still massively distorted. You're not getting the real taste of what it is. Distorted. It just doesn't have the same amount. The information conveyed is just tiny. There's not that much information. You're something of a music expert, aren't you? Yes. You really are. Like when people... Who was I talking... Oh yeah, I was playing that beautiful jazz album that you got me. Which one? The Something Tear. Oh, the Inflated Tear. The Inflated Tear. I see you were carrying it for your records. Oh, God. Right after I brought it up, I knew you were going to look over my stack of records on top of each other and just get them out. I almost wish I didn't mention it but having a friend like you is really important because it's so nice to have someone who's dipping their fingers into all that weird music that's floating out there and bringing it back and showing it to you because otherwise I never would have heard that before. What's his name? Rashawn Rollenkirk. And he's blind. He's blind, yeah. He used to do a lot of acid, too. Rashawn Rollenkirk. Rashawn Rollenkirk. Yeah, he has a lot of his songs are about what he dreams about or what his hallucinations are. If you're blind, it's obviously a lot different when you're hallucinating because the experience is totally different. Yeah, there was a thread on Reddit where they were asking blind people what's it like to hallucinate. Yeah. And they were saying they could see, some of them could see colors. Really? Yeah. I kind of think, I've got to be like meditating, right? Because when you meditate, you, I see all kinds of stuff. I see crazy stuff. Like what? I see a lot of like geometric stuff. But lately when I've been meditating, I think about like shapes and I'm able to like basically draw things in my head and I can sometimes draw them afterwards. But a lot of times it's three dimensional things that are moving. Like a spike. It's kind of hard to explain, like maybe like something like from Fantasia or something where it's things that are moving and weird animated geometric patterns and stuff. What do you think that is? I don't know what it is. It's got to be just the brain moving. It's just, maybe it's a physical expression of thought or something. I don't really, I don't really know what it is. You know that Elliott Smith lyric that goes, I'm not clearly not a great singer anymore. I used to be, I had quite a career as a singer when I was in my teens. So you had that accident. Yeah. He's got that great lyric that goes, I see colored bars when I come. It's so cool, man, but it's like, I see colored bars when I come. Yeah. But it's like, if you ever had that thing happen when you're tripping and you have an orgasm or you're just tripping and you don't have an orgasm, but you close your eyes and you see these very specific, yeah, very detailed shapes, right? Like that seemed more than just like a random thing that your brain's spitting out. But like, it seems like you're looking at a language that you just don't know. Yeah. Sometimes I see an absolute color and I'm seeing that color for the, I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time, but seeing it for the, not for the first time, but the first time I'm actually, like, oh, I understand it. Like I've, I got the, I got the information download from that thing. What do you mean an absolute color? Like I've, like, like I see something, it's like I see it the whole thing purely. It's, and it's absolute, I guess the best way to like it is, you know how you can listen to a song like a 50 times, right? You can listen to it. Yes. But there's one time when you actually, when you really hear it, really, really like hits home because there's something about the, oh, I get this now. I kind of, I'm hearing the thing that was trying to be conveyed. Yes. And that, I feel like that's maybe what happens sometimes is in those experiences. You all, you kind of understand it, but you don't understand it in terms of being able to describe it or, or to write, to be able to describe it or to ascribe anything to it. You just understand it. You just know. Gnosis. It's like a thing. You just all of a sudden, you just know something. So this is the Platonic ideal you're talking about. Like sometimes you witness the eternal form that all forms are based on. Is that what you're saying? It's like you feel it, man. Yeah. You just feel it. Yeah. And that's a great way to put it. You feel it. Because like so often you think that you've gotten tired of a certain song or some kind of music and then you do hear it in just the right setting and just the right mood and suddenly you realize that it wasn't that you got tired of the song, but rather that you just didn't have the ability to open your heart up to what level that that song was functioning at. When that shit happens, it's a spike into your heart. It's a blast. It's a blast. It's a fucking. Because when people record music, I don't think that they're just, I think that somehow in the future, they're going to figure this out, but in those strings of ones and zeros that a song is transformed into when it's in its intermediary state between being played and going into your ears in those ones and zeros, somehow there is captured emotion or feeling. Yeah. It's capturing, it's a kind of digitized telepathy, transmitting the emotional state of the singer and the performer into your mind, not just the music. Well, that's what I think is going to be the next state of audio because right now we're kind of hitting a wall with how we listen to music. There'll have to be some sort of, I think of this for many years and it doesn't totally make sense to me what it would be, but there has to be some sort of a next level of listening to where when you're listening to it, there's a new level of experience in the sound, not just through your ears. There has to be something, something that's like another sense, maybe it's like a combination of your senses, but some other way you're experiencing it that's not just hearing it. You made me think of like this right when you were saying that I imagine this, some futuristic music listening room, right? Lying on the floor of this room with wires coming out of it is a thing that looks like a sarcophagus. It's filled with a kind of nanopartic particulate, a kind of pudding, yeah, like a gel and you lay down in the gel and then when you're laying in the gel, the music at the quantum level is affecting every one of these nanoparticles so that the waves of the music are sort of rolling up and down your body. And of course the gel is breathable. It's that shit from the abyss. It's massage gel. Yeah, it's breathable massage gel. There's some special breathable, what's that shit called? This new room massage gel. There's so many, you know, there's like so many boundaries that separate us from truly enjoying our lives and that science just hasn't delivered yet and one of those things is breathable massage gel. That's very expensive and has like a, it emits a certain color of light. And it just responds. It can like, you lay in this stuff and there's pre-programmed undulations of the gel based on whatever it is that you want to experience. It's music, it's whatever you want. But it's, you know, this is a thing. Did you ever see the abyss? Yeah. So remember that awesome pink shit that they breathe? So what was the liquid oxygen basically? Yeah, liquid oxygen. And it's like there's two things humans can't do. There's two things, well many things we can't do, but in the elements we're separated from the sky unless we want to be in a plane and we're separated from the ocean unless we want to have scuba tanks on, those are the two things we can't do. And so there are these two essential freedoms that have been removed from us just by nature. But the idea of one day being able to go down to the beach and check yourself with a kind of like Ray Kurzweil white blood cell thing and just swim in and be like, guys, I'm just going to swim out as far as I can go. And you're going to be fine unless you get eaten by a shark or something. You can just swim, can you imagine the freedom to be able to like just swim down into the ocean when you get tired, you're not going to drown. You just float underneath the sea, breathing the water, breathing the water. Maybe you, yeah, you're just floating out there. You've got a kind of like, you know, I don't know, probably a spear gun or some kind of weapon to protect you from the occasional great white that might come. I don't think they'd want to have anything to do with you, they'd be like, what the fuck is that weird trash? They'd just be like, great. There goes the neighborhood. Oh God, they figured it out. God damn it. Ah, the monkeys are coming back. Oh God, they figured it out, God damn it. Yeah, because you know, there would be like, if that could happen, if we could figure out a way to breathe underwater, clearly the next thing that would happen is people would just start living down there. You'd build, you'd find caves and you'd just live down there. If you didn't have to, that would, I lived down there, I liked seaweeds, pretty good taste. Yeah, you could just eat fish. You want to brush your teeth, ever? You'd never have to brush your teeth. You'd never have to brush your teeth. No such thing as bad breath in the ocean. Hey, we're down here now. I ain't got a brush no more. No, it's just, it's all water. But you can't drink beer down here, Jerry. We got, somebody figures out, I tell you what, I'll go down there, when somebody figures out how to get a six pack in me. I ain't going to become one of those underwater sea people until they learn how to get beer into my fucking stomach under the sea. I ain't being one of those motherfucking underwater sea people. Suck on my jack. Suck my dick, sea creep. I'll take a jackhammer down there and show you where Lannis is and right between my legs. Y'all can fuck off. But that's the thing, man, like if suddenly the ability happened, this is the thing, like, you know, so many people are trapped in whatever their country they're living in, like for example, the Gaza Strip. These people are trapped in the Gaza Strip, but if suddenly they learn to breathe underwater and they're just like, well, see you guys later, I think they just go under the ocean and people would never see them again. I think they would, but wouldn't other people go there with them? They'd be like a real log jam, wouldn't they? There's so much space down there. There's a lot of space. There's so much space. There would be like whole new countries of undersea people that emerge. That could be right now. I love thinking about that. Coast to coast, they have. Do they talk about aquatic cities? I think they have an Atlantis episode about once a month just to check in. All right, how's Atlantis doing? Is it still doing pretty good on color? We heard that you found Atlantis. Is this true off the coast of Coral Gables, Florida? The Atlantis theory actually is not my favorite theory when it comes to hidden worlds within our world, but Hollow Earth theory to me is one of the greatest, coolest conspiracy theories of all time. I don't think I really know it, no. So Hollow Earth theory, and for listeners out there, this is why I wish we're going to go live soon and eventually you guys will be able to call in and correct us. But Hollow Earth theory is the idea that Earth is just a shell, and that floating in the center of the Earth is another Earth, and that this Earth is called, this is Shangri-La, this is Shangri-La, no, Shambhala, no, Shangri-La, Shangri-La, Shangri-La, this is Shangri-La. And there's these cool stories, like a lot of people, Hollow Earth theory really caught on at one point, and people started thinking that in the Arctic, in the North Pole, in the Poles, there was like these... Oh yeah, there's portals. Portals. There's doors basically. Yeah. That lead into this place where there's mammoths still, and there's all these prehistoric animals that went into the Earth somehow. There's a famous story of a Nazi submarine commander who says that he went into an underwater cave and emerged into this place with these super-intelligent people. They had a weird name for themselves too, like a really ominous name, like the happy people, or something spooky, like you wouldn't think people who lived in a cave would call themselves the... The Jimmy's. Yeah, something like that. But the same report that they are, he said the same thing, there's mammoths down there, and that it's a paradise. It's a beautiful, beautiful paradise, and it's also people who believe in hollow Earth theories say that the idea of Hades, Hell, the notion of an underworld, all comes from an ancient primordial understanding that just underneath us, an entire other planet existed filled with gods. Really? Yeah. Well, I don't know about that. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it myself, but... And that's the idea that that's where the gray aliens come from. The grays? Yeah, the grays come from the Earth. The space ships are actually rising up out of the ocean, and they're not coming from space. I've never heard that. I don't know how I've never heard that one before. Oh, it's a good one. It seems like all those places where there's like the ultimate paradise world, I always felt a little suspect, you know what I mean? When it's something that's... It sounds... The whole sounds too good to be true, probably is kind of thing. Only with the other worlds. Well, I mean, I think the reason it activates something inside of me is that it's the dream of an escape from modern day society. That's always been the idea. I think anytime anyone talks about that stuff throughout history, that's the idea. It's a form of escapism. And it used to be able to do that. That's what it was like before we knew what the Earth was. You get on a boat, you say goodbye to your friends. It meant something. You land on another continent, and there's people that you've never seen before. And they've never seen you. They've never seen you. You're trading strange things with them. And you truly have no common ground, really, except the fact that you're maybe both humanoids. The only common ground is that your bacteria are killing them, whatever is on top of you is killing them. That's one of the great, what you're hearing there, friends, is a new addition to my household. That's my sweet little Gatsby. He's a puppy. He's my girlfriend's darling little pup. He loves to make sounds. And he has the most high-pitched shriek. That's actually, that's what veterinarians call a kick and bark. Really? A kick and bark? No. What is that? That thing could shatter wine glasses. Oh my God, it's terrible. It's like a Sonic X-ray weapon. He's barking at my bike. For some reason, he's looking at the bike, barking at it. By the way, not to get off course here, because I think we are getting to an interesting place, but is there, and the list of creepy things outside of seeing a ghost, actually, or looking out the window and seeing a guy wearing glasses staring in? Wine glasses. I don't know, just something about a spectacle voyeur is creepier than a non-spectacular voyeur. I don't know why. But the, in the list of creepy things, what's more creepy than when your dog decides to start barking at a wall? Yeah, it's creepy. When their hackles go up and they're looking at nothing. So they're like, rrrrrrrrr. I'm like, no, there's nothing fucking there at all. I have on video. Oh, this is, I heard about this. Thoughts. Picture of my mom in my office, sitting on a chair, beautiful picture. The Bennett shirt design t-shirts in Thailand had this beautiful picture drawn for me. It's all these pictures of my mom. I placed it up in my office. I'm sitting there with Fox. I'm typing on my computer. He starts looking at that picture. And the same thing you were saying is hackles go up. He starts growling, whimpering, barking, seems afraid, is backing up. Right. Oh God. Shit, that scared the hell out of me. Even if it was theoretically the ghost of my mom, it's still scary. Didn't it happen at a significant time as well? Or no? I don't remember. I don't think it was a significant time. I thought it was like a thing where he's lost his toy. Listen, we've gotten off track. I want to get back to this. Back to the- What we're talking about, hold on. I'm going to, let me just- Put a dog filter on there. I'm going to put the dog to sleep. Hang on. God, I love that dog. Oh, what a sweetie. God, so sweet. Now, to get back to this thing, which is that what's been taken away from humans, which has been one of the ways bees gather honey, or the way that birds build nests, is that sweet humans have always been migratory explorers who have stretched out from Africa and moved around the whole world. And there was this element of doing that that had within it discovery. Not I know what's going to be there, not I've looked at Google images of it, not I know exactly every single thing to expect from this place, but you would literally go into a place that no one alive from your genetic line had ever seen. You're basically committing yourself to possible death. You're being like, I'm going to go into the abyss, I'm going to the unknown, this might be the end. This might be the end, but that's why you do it, is because you don't- That's why people love to fucking travel. People will never not like to travel, because that's a much smaller thing, but yeah, you can't really- It's very few places you can go now that are actually a place where you're- I don't know if you can go anywhere really, except there's a few isolated places, right? The odds are that if you're a human being living today, you will never ever step foot on a place where no humans have ventured. That's the odds. Now, that's been that way for a very long time. If you're a subscriber to Graham Hancock's theory, he might say, well, that's been the way it's been since for countless multiple apocalypses where the human biomass spreads around the planet, meteors hit, disease strike, diseases strike, climate change happens and the thing dies off and starts again from tiny little clusters, tiny little spores, yeah. But still, that kind of like rediscovery of a place that was once inhabited by the ancestors, even that would be a rush, you know? But there is something dismaying about going to a place populated with tourists, like when I went up to- when we went up to Arizona, or rather, Utah, it was- Zion? Zion National Park in Utah, there's this beautiful river that runs through a canyon- The Virgin River. That you can hike through. That's a special river. But when you're hiking up this river, when you go to Zion National Park and you've been taken up in a tram and they've dropped you off and you go down into the river, you are exactly in the same company that you would find at the Glendale Galleria. Yeah, yeah, that's the case with some of those places. Well, when I went camping last time, I had the opposite experience because of my friend Patrick, who I've had in my podcast a bunch of times, he's like this expert. Let's talk about that. Because this is- you sent me pictures of this place that you went to out in the middle of fucking nowhere. It was scary. How did this start? This is something I've been wanting to do is go on a nice camping trip and I think so many people kind of bat around in their heads, man, we should go on a camping trip, but you never do it. How did you get your shit together enough to actually go out into a beautiful wilderness? Well it wasn't my shit together so much as Patrick. Who's Patrick? Patrick Lien is a friend of mine from Minnesota and he works for the USGS and he does these jobs for about five months at a time in different locations where he counts certain species. Right now he's kind of this certain type of African but an alpine frog that lives in these high elevation lakes. He has to count them. He goes out there on these really aggressive three or four day hikes where he has to go on these- Aggressive. Like he climbs a 14,000 foot peak to go up to these remote locations that no one can get to. Wow. A sampling of the area, like a random sampling to see where these animals are. So he's backpack extremo. So basically he's a guide and he guided us up to this one of many places you can go to that are- there's no evidence of any human beings being there whatsoever. You're up there and it looks like fucking Narnia or something. How far is the hike up there? It's not that- that's the thing. It's not very far at all. It's a day hike for that- when I see that picture it was just a day hike and we got caught in a vicious thunderstorm, thought we're going to fucking die up there. We're off the trail at about 11,000 feet and it- we got hit by three waves of lightning and thunder and hail. And then we got after that cleared out and dropped down to like 20 degrees cooler than it was. It was really cold and we get up there in this pristine alpine lake. It was something- it was one of those things where I really felt like I was on a psychedelic drive. It's like I had taken mushrooms because it was something where everything I looked at because the way the light was filtering through the clouds and how it was later in the day so it was like that sort of evening light, it just looked- everything looked- you can't describe it. It's one of those things where- Try. Remember that part in Contact, the movie Contact where Jodi Foster, when she's traveling through space she says I wish they had sent a poet? Ah yeah. That's how I felt because I was- I was like I don't- I don't have the skill to describe what I'm seeing because it's just- I feel like I'm being enveloped by just utter beauty and I'm- I was completely sober and exhausted and just made it through these like- I've been climbing for hours and it was something where I've never felt so exhausted but so energetic at the same time. Sometimes I wonder if my inability to describe beauty is not so much related to a lack of skill as much as a kind of fear of really bearing my heart because- Really? Yeah, because when you're in like that kind of beauty the words that come to you aren't going to be words- aren't like popular words that people are going to want to hear. They're- Right. I want to weep. It feels like this is the mother. Yeah. I'm in Contact- I felt like crying actually. I really did. And I- I partially was because I was so exhausted and just slipped on a log and cracked my shit open and was bleeding and stuff. But at the same time it was something where it doesn't- like to even try to describe with words is not the point because it's something where it's the experience and it's the thing where if I went there tomorrow, if I went there even five hours after it was there for the first time it would not be the same because it's- it's always changing and that- that moment existed for that one- for a brief period of time and that will- it will never happen again. Well, yeah. It felt so much as it felt so- it felt really precious in that sense. You're returning to the life matrix that all things originated from. You're returning to like the- the- the- what used to be. You know, this is the- if you read Walden, have you ever read Walden? So there's this- it's a- it's a beautiful book but it's kind of a mournful book. You know? Right. The inevitable encroachment of human society into the world and the gradual extinction of spaces like what you're talking about. Spaces that are precious that are untouched and have been raped. And- and- yeah. And- and- and the- and the- and the- the- the primal experience that is available there or the kind of like, you know, it's a language. When you go into nature, you know right away if you give yourself a little time to be still that you're being spoken to, but you don't quite understand the language. Yeah. But you know you're being- it's talking to you in the way the birds move through the sky, the reflection of the light on the water, the feeling of the breeze against your face, the sense of vast openness in your heart where this door swings open and you feel like you have suddenly become like a- the super dome where they have like football games like your heart has suddenly transformed into like an empty huge spacious thing because you're blending into the expansiveness of nature that you're in and the nature and it's welcoming you in some odd way. It's like having this chat with you, but we forgot that fucking language. That's the language that your friend probably speaks that language a little bit or you're like probably indigenous peoples can speak that language. I think shamans probably speak that language a little bit. It's about stillness and I think that's a big thing. I mean, there's some quote I just saw from Ram Dass just the other day and he talks about that all the time. It's just about how quietness and how the things that come to you when you're still and quiet and listening and watching as opposed to the other way around. If you're trying to find it and try searching and making effort versus just allowing the situation to just letting it be. Yeah and theoretically the communication will come to you regardless of your surroundings if you can still yourself enough, but it seems like certain places are more conducive. Yeah, they bring it out. They help you. It's like a little kick in the pants to help you to get to that place as opposed to some people. I've known people who can meditate. You're meditating on a subway car. You're meditating in this office where everyone's fucking chattering. Some people can do that, but I can't do that. The meditation is a fantastic vehicle, but however you get to that space, just that moment it's not just the moment of what we're talking about here is the moment of you hear a song that you've heard a million times for the first time. You go into nature and are reminded of this thing that you've always known was there, but you completely lost touch with it like running into an old friend that you haven't seen for years and you just start right at the very place that you left off. It's the exact same sense of like sustenance. You're eating. You haven't been eating. Yeah. It feels really good. It's definitely sustaining. It's like there's a lot of substance to it. Some guy, that guy who wrote that book, The War of Art talks about how you had a dream, I think when he was meditating or something, about how when a bird's flying, it's not scared it's going to fall out of the air because the air is thick. It's thick to a bird. It's not something where you have to, you're like, you're going to fall through. You can feel when an eagle flaps its wings, it feels like this air is thick with stuff. Energy waves. Yeah, energy. It's something there. It's not empty. And he talks about that's like the same, that's the same as you can, I mean, I'm not sure how you make that an analogy, but it's the same sort of thing where in nothingness there is everything, even though it seems like it's the opposite. This is that high that the astronauts talk about when they get into space for the first time and look down at the earth and suddenly you're filled with this inexpressible sense of awe at this living, spinning, beautiful egg floating in the vastness of space. I think it's because I think even when you're in space, you realize that this thing that you're talking about, the invisible energy of life is there in the vacuum of space too. And then you start realizing that, oh God, this thing that I'm in is big. It's so gigantic. It's gigantic. It's incomprehensibly massive. And I think probably that sense of like leaving the atmosphere of the planet and recognizing that this like exhalation or inhalation that seems to be producing planets and black holes does not suddenly, it doesn't stop when you leave the planet, but it just continues and then it's full of stars. Oh my God, we've got some stars up here. One, two, we can't count them. Yeah, but God damn it, man. I would so love to drink a beer under the ocean. That would be so... Wouldn't that be... That would be awesome. To funnel one, to funnel a beer, 10,000 feet under. Just to experience that freedom. I mean, that's what we need is, it feels like that's what our, that would be such a cure for so many things that seem to be ailing our poor, pitiful, brainwashed, superstitious species is just a new place to explore, a new place to go to where you could just keep walking in one direction and never run into another person. God, that'd be great. There are places like that though. There's a lot of them in California. Yeah, but they don't have internet. That's the problem. You can't Instagram it, man. You can't Instagram it, it didn't happen. Nogram it. Nogram it in space. Did you hear about this new magnetic engine or microwave engine? Tell me about it. Tell me more. Well, there's this, I'll actually, you know, I'll look it up so that I don't completely butcher it. I'm always butchering everything. Okay, so if you know how magnets, they want to go other directions from the magnet, it's the other kind of magnet. If you did that, what if you'd put those on a car and put them on everybody's bumper? It's like that. That way you can drive around nobody getting in an accident. Wouldn't that be good? So this is, this is from, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there. I didn't mean to cut off what? Ten questions about NASA's impossible space drive answer. This is from Wired UK and this says, let's find out. This is such a tiny force, likely to be an error. Okay. This is called an M drive, an EM drive and basically what it is, is... Electromagnetic drive? Yes, they have figured out a way to run microwaves inside some kind of vacuum space and it creates thrust and they don't understand why. And so what's, when you're traveling through space currently, the big problem is you've got to, like if you want to go to Mars and come back, you need a lot of energy, you need a lot of fuel and that's heavy and so to carry fuel to, so that means that... There's a math coefficient there where it's like at some point the fuel becomes, you can't have enough fuel to carry the fuel you need to carry the fuel. That's it. Yeah. And that's that problem because without the fuel using microwave energy, it creates thrust and in space, you only need the minimal amount of thrust because if you keep applying a consistent state of thrust in space, there's no drag and so you will accelerate over time, you will begin to accelerate really, really, really fast. They say that with this news drive, we can get to Mars in four weeks, three weeks, we can get to Mars in four weeks. How fast are you traveling then? Well, let's see, here's, I'll read this, this is from question five, this is 10 questions about NASA's new drive. Question five, even if it works, how can such a small thrust push a spacecraft? So it says, the NASA paper says the expected thrust to power for initial flight applications is expected to be in the 0.4 Newton per kilowatt range, I don't know what that means, which is about seven times higher than the current state of the art hall thruster in use on orbit today. How does this get us to Mars? The small but steady push of the EM drive is a winner for space missions, gradually accelerating spacecraft to high speed. The NASA paper projects a conservative manned mission to Mars from Earth orbit with a 90 ton spacecraft, driven by the new technology using a two megawatt nuclear power source. It can develop 800 Newtons of thrust. The entire mission would take eight months, including a 70 day stay on Mars. Jesus. Yes. So intense, man. That is such an intense thing that just happened. It's been around for a while, but you know, it takes people time to test the ... It takes forever. ... to test the stuff out, but that's very exciting to think that with just now they're discovering a way. If you can get to Mars in two months, that means that we could easily ... That's a very short amount of time. That's a short amount of time, man. That's like basically, that's not any time really in terms of human time. Yeah. That's an amazing thing to imagine that instead of like, because if it takes you a year or half a year, however long, just to get a tiny little rover up there, it's going to ... The amount of time it would take to colonize Mars is human, is generations. But they say with this thing, we could get to the nearest galaxy within 30 years. So that means that all the elites will be able to have a place they can live once Earth is popularized, completely filled up and all the elites can jettison to start the Martian colony and Earth will be left to people with low credit scores. Isis. Yeah. Isis and low credit scores with two countries. The Earth will just be like a bunch of fanatics with low credit scores. A bunch of caliphates. That's some scary shit, huh? I think that's going to happen, too. My theory is that, you know, more and more things have a reach ... A credit card is become more integral into more and more things. Yes. Become a thing where there's certain things you can't do unless you have a credit card. Absolutely. And more and more people have credit cards. It's going to be ... You can't buy food on a plane. It's going to come to the point where you have to have a credit card to do things. And if you can't get a credit card, it's basically ... It's a further separation between lower class and higher class. It's like a crowbar that's sectioning off people to where there's basically two types, two classes. Either in the credit class, where you are upper class, credit class, and the low, the untouchables. Six, six, six, the number of the beast. You know, I'm like ... I have spent the last two or three years working on my credit score because I racked my credit when I was a comedian. I just ... When I was, I guess I still am, but when I was a broke comedian, I was using credit to buy things I couldn't afford, like an idiot, and I wrecked my credit, and I finally got it good. My credit is good. I finally achieved a good credit, and I experienced that honky pride. Oh, it is a pride. It's a special pride. My credit score, I didn't even know it, but when I moved it ... What do you have? It's the highest you can have. What do you have? I'm not sure. I think it's like 1680. You don't get that high. Credit doesn't get that high. Maybe I'm thinking of something else, but whatever it is, it's ... You're thinking about your IQ. Yeah. I don't even know. I just gave you a number, telling me to turn around, walk out. No, you're right, Johnny. It's gross. It doesn't mean anything. It's meaningless. But it also, aside from the fact that having this certain number, it does mean something. It actually does mean something. Well, it does mean something, but I mean, in the grand scheme of things, it's a number that's being used to assign people. It's a way to tell. It's a bad thing. Here's what it is. It's a way to tell, if I loan money to you, I will have a return on my investment for sure. That's all it is. It's like turning people into stocks. It's like, your credit score basically represents how volatile your stock as a human being is for a guy who wants to make money off the interest he'll accrue off of loaning you money. If you've got a high credit score, then for someone who has shit tons of money, and when people have shit tons of money, one thing they quickly realize is that, oh, if I just pour this money in the right places, that money turns into more money. I don't have to work. I don't have to do anything. Just put the money in the right place. The money will grow more money, and I will continue to get super rich. Mega rich. That's what a credit score is. A good credit score is so that a reptilian, as he's flipping through his catalog, will come to you and be like, oh, wonderful. Give that man a car. It's also the opposite, though, because if people have lower credit scores, people who have worse credit, they're more likely to get credit cards because it's the whole predatory lending thing still going on with credit cards. If they don't want me to have a credit card because I fucking pay my bill every month, I don't make them any money. I mean, obviously, I make the money when I charge something because they get a piece of it through that transaction fee, but you make them make a lot more money off a person who defaults on their payments and has to pay penalties and get charged interest. It's all this stuff. They're preying on people who can't afford the product that they're selling. They like it all, man. They love it. Did you hear? They love it. It's only getting worse, too. It's getting with car loans. And you've heard how they've changed. Everything can possibly do. Have you seen the way they've changed the way you're computing credit scores? I have no idea. So this is the news, is that they are changing the way that they, right, okay, so currently if you have unpaid, like if you go 90 days or however long without paying a credit card, you're delinquent, that will knock your credit score down by five or 10 points, depending. And so what they're doing now is they're making it so that if you have taken care of your debt, whatever it is, if you paid it off, they will no longer mark your credit score for five years. So everybody's credit score is about to go up. Now the reason they did that, it's got to be devious, but it's devious. But here's my theory about why they did that, because what happens is if you're somebody who's got shitty credit and you owe $20,000 or $10,000 or whatever it is to a credit card company, you go into a place of absolute hopelessness and you just say to yourself, you know what? I'm going to get a new phone number. They can fuck off. They'll never find me. I'm never going to pay it. I'll just live off of cash and figure out a way to survive on phones that I buy with those prepaid cards you can get it best by. That's what happens. They don't even attempt to pay off the debt. So in a way, I think the credit card companies have recognized that that's actually more harmful to getting the debt paid off. So by saying, listen, if you guys just start doing minimum payments, we're going to up your credit score, and then all this money will come flooding back in from people who decide to start trying to pay off their debt. So that's the credit news from the Dunkin' Dress family I'm by the cab. They had news, Experian, Experian, you want to check the credit score, go to fucking Experian. Hey, man, what's up? You want to go rafting? No, I'm going to check an Experian dime. But don't forget that it's not just that, you know, having good credit is going to give you access to more and more services. But it's also going to. You sound like a fucking reptilian right now. It's also here. Access to services. Yeah, yeah, it is. That's what it does. Access to services. Concierge program. Just listen. Free tickets. Here comes the real reptilian. Hey, Jay-Z and Madonna are playing this week, and you want some tickets? A higher credit score will give you the ability to take out medical loans, which will allow you to replace your white blood cells with new white blood cells, increasing your life span by 100 years. Do you really want to die when you're 80? Enjoy this beautiful world! Take out a medical loan and live to be 300! Experian. Yeah, Experian is going to let you live to be 300! I'm so sorry. I'm going to have to deny you this medical loan. We went through your credit card, your credit records, you only have a 640 credit score. So sorry, we won't be able to replace your blood today. But I'm going to die without the blood. I'm sorry. We need you to move on. Derek, will you please show Ms. Swanson out to the waiting zone? It's going to be like people, you know how you see car commercials, which are the funniest fucking things ever, because all a car is, it's a fishing lure the bank is using to get a dumb person to get into debt, it's terrible, it's gotten worse, it's getting worse every day. But whenever you see a car commercial or you see a, like a, well you're seeing, that's a great analogy. It's the exact same thing that they throw in front of the fish, you know, and it's like shiny, it's like, it's moving, and like there's this, and what goes along with a package of a car commercial, it's never just a car, they never just show, they never just show a car, four wheels, great radio, here's the engine, it's a lifestyle, it's your, you're always in there with that young family, you're starting your family with your beautiful wife. She's ambiguously ethnic and has perfect cleavage. Ambiguously ethnic and God, she's so, so happy and you're so happy and this is it. Is that a vampire weekend concert at Trader Joe's happening? The doors are opening to your new married life with your beautiful wife and your beautiful car that you're going to drive your baby around it. This is the day, this is the day that you're looking for, it's right now, right here in a Nissan. Making it happen, you're a man, opening doors wherever you can, opening the doors and stepping into a Nissan tonight, baby. Safe and fun and hip and so, so, so yeah, it's a fishing lure, but you're going to see commercials in the future where it's like a family at a medical loan building where they're, where it's like, they accepted our loan, we're going to live to be 300 where you're sitting with your daughter at the table and you're like, good news, honey, we had our white blood cells replaced today and where your dad, mommy and daddy are going to live to be 300. Great. Medical loans, you're going to live to be 300. We can make the payment on a 300 year loan solo, yes, it's $500 million for this treatment, but over the course of 300 years. You can't afford not to. You can't afford not to. Yeah, it's going to happen, it's going to start, because you've already got, the fact that there's a commercials right now for Experian, there's a commercial, like what are they selling anything? There's a commercial, you see commercials for oil companies now, like commercials that are goodwill campaigns for oil companies. Yeah, those are always curious to me, like those are just PR campaigns because they have so much money, they just like, yeah, let's just do some PR work. Paid us less. But the Experian commercial and the credit commercials and the free credit report commercials and all of those commercials are a kind of propaganda designed to enforce the notion that what makes a person good or functional is not their ethics or morals, but their ability to repay debt and their ability to have like a disciplined spending habits. There's a really, really great, funny book, maybe we've talked about before, we've talked about this before, a super sad, true love story, I think it's by Gary Sheinhardt. I don't think so. So fucking funny. It's funny like Grand Theft Auto is funny, but it's also about sort of near future in New York City where credit is the most important thing and longevity. It's based on like Kurzweil and based on Aubrey de Grey's idea of like living forever through special chemicals and stuff. It's such a funny book, it's hilarious, but it's also kind of scary because everything he writes about seems so plausible and so capable of becoming an actual thing in the near future like in our lifetime. Maybe if I credit these polls you walk by that project your credit score when you walk by. Yeah, that's cool. That's cool. You know man, death is bedtime for humans and the same way when it's time for the baby to go to bed at seven, the parents come in and put the baby to bed and in the same way as humans evolve and as our species continues to be on the planet, it makes sense that our bedtime is being extended as we get older. We're getting extra hours to watch late night TV and eventually it does make sense that once the human species goes from its teen years into adulthood, the curfew will be completely lifted and going to sleep will no longer be a requisite but an option where you decide that you've had enough of this particular node of the simulator and you're ready to go back into oblivion. That's going to happen for sure man and definitely the division is going to be a socio-economic division for sure. It's already happening. It's going to be more extreme. Like what's it? What's a HG Wells' book? Time Machine. That makes more and more sense. The idea that there's two classes and the elites are basically idiots living above ground just dining on fruit and living in waterfalls where they have the slave class of underlings under the ground. Well it's obviously heavily exaggerated. But it becomes more awful because humans will become less than slaves in the sense that it will be so inefficient to have a slave. Then you have the new IBM made Android with downloadable updates where you can teach the thing to host a scrabble game or make tea. Because people become like nothing more than their flesh even. Irrelevant. They become basically. Dog food. Irrelevant. Well yeah. Maybe dog food. Yeah. The best dog food. They become not the physical labor becomes something that is unnecessary. It's not valuable. It's no longer valuable. But there will be worth. There will be things that have value. It just won't be the ability to haul boxes all day long. It's going to be other things. That's cache. Yeah. Yeah. In like hair swirl. Yeah. It's going to be. They call it a new renaissance. It's like dystopian renaissance that we're looking at where modes of self expression become what's valuable. Your ability to articulate yourself in creative ways or to create novelty in the world and invent things and bring things into the world that will become incredibly valuable. I think podcasts are a part of it for sure. Yeah man. Yes. You know backflips being able to do a successful backflip landing it sticking to landing on a backflip being able to the whole moral of a hard day's work. You know that that whole ethic or what's called slave morality which is you will often hear people diss somebody you know of the older people especially will not working hard there haven't done a hard day's work in this entire life let me see your hands. Let me see your hands now boy looks like you got some hands fit to you couldn't open up an orange with those hands there when I look at your hands I look feel like I'm looking at man a spread on a bun boy what is that a five pieces of a pussy by the time I was your age my hands were bloody leathery scarred stumps I had stump pumpers they were the size of a flash flutter you kidding me I could cut open a jar with my damn nail I could open two jars and I had to cut it open for mama because she had lost all of her hands trying to do the same thing I had to do for her we used to make charcoal in the backyard and we were happy I used your mother's clitoris to make charcoal we used to take that clit and heat it up good and hot get it red hot and flick it that's a human spray but that's a that's certainly a one of the that was always the mark of a good person is that they they spend hours and hours a day sweating and laboring not for their own lives but for some boss and this is this kind of morality is evil and is just as bad as the notion of credit scores it's just the same thing really which is that toy there is placed in the mind of so many people the notion that what is most important in life is to toil day after day for a boss who you are making money for and are not being fairly compensated and that is considered to be normal that's not normal that's not normal so if that starts falling apart it's like it's not that so much humans are no longer valuable it's that humans are no longer laborers humans go from being the value of a human is no longer represented by their ability to make money for a person that is exploiting them but the value of a human transforms into their ability to spread love happiness joy and to novelty and to be creative that's a person's value the big problem though just a lot of people and a lot of people don't get that and won't get that and people like that tend to cause more problems for other people it's like a a negativity infection that happens and that's why that's why I have anything that's negative negative is just the spread of negativity through contact throughout osmosis that's damn right you know it's this is something where unfortunately they don't have it but they need it which is the cnc centers for negativity control which will be great marks the spread of negative means as they go pouring through society that is able to track in the same way they're like oh shit there's an ebola outbreak in rwanda they could say oh holy shit there's an outbreak of jaded hipsters who are angry at george carlin let's uh who's angry at george carlin oh god no it's no you know there there are so many of like you know what i'm saying man there's like there's an inevitable like uh there'll be a fashionable attitude that breaks out where all of a sudden we all find ourselves plagued with the awful i hate justin bieber disease or just caring caring at all about something like that like yeah yeah caring about something like so insignificant and dumb just it's like a it's almost not even negativity because it's even worse it's like this neutral sort of just grayness worried about isis worried about a thing that has no relevance in my life whatsoever yeah yeah and and that is a that is as much a kind of flu or disease as anything else and it's just as contagious and so often when you find yourself sitting with someone and suddenly the words coming out of your mouth as you're watching them emerge you realize these are words that don't paint the picture of us being the very tip of a genetic trees that has its roots in the big bang but rather you'll find that the story that you're telling people is a ghost story of some sorts about how we exist on a deteriorating planet where our only hope is to increase our credit score so that we can live longer live for the now and then you'll look down at your body and you'll look down at your life and you'll look down at the fact that you've got nipples and are capable of orgasms and inevitably you have friends around you and if you don't have friends around you you can essentially go wherever you want and that no matter what you can always escape from this terrible dimension and you're just a few pills away from infinity and then suddenly you realize that you are actually in heaven yeah and and that's what the centers for negativity control would do you know they would just explain it to you like point blank to make you understand that it's exactly that you're here right now it's great it's good here's a b12 shot and uh b12 yeah exactly are they in the same way like the cdc sends people into the fucking uh into rwanda uh at the risk of like getting ebola to treat ebola in the same way cnc would send super trained people into the most negative situations into the darkest most backwards hipster bars and the creepiest clusters of art stars wearing like all orange yeah like funky shoes and a smile no not not you maybe not even so over maybe these are like trained ninjas oh yeah they're they're positivity ninjas yeah they're the people who like when you get around them they're the people where you you can be in the most miserable mood of your life right you're around them for just a few seconds and suddenly the story that they're telling is one of uh your infinite potential as a human being to do anything that you want in this incarnation and they're able to express that in a way that is inarguable and undeniable by pointing out the fact that the very uh your very existence is a lottery win as far as the great span of the universe goes and somehow they just say in a way you're like holy shit yeah and they make you oh you can do actually you can do whatever you want oh yeah you're not chained you know you're not really stuck in that relationship or job or you're not really trapped by whatever you think your disability is or did you know that money doesn't exist yeah there's no such thing as credit friend did you know that doesn't exist yeah yeah did you know that at your very core there is a fountain of infinite love that you can connect to at any moment and experience orgasmic buddha level bliss at any time that you want and i feel it right now because i figured out how to do it holy shit did you know there's more bacteria and yogurt than there is money in the world this spoonful of sheep's milk yogurt has more bacteria than there is money and people will be running away from this cnc just like just like in rwanda with ebola they'd be like those people are fucking assholes man if you get around them too long you're not gonna you won't be able to write jokes anymore you start getting nice to everybody you start feeling terrible for talking shit about people you're ruining your ability to be an asshole man don't get around it well unhappiness is easy it's easy to be negative it's like the it's the it's the well-traveled path it's downhill it's easy to do and every once in a while i'm so i've been badly no you've been good man i mean personally like i find myself getting irritable like if the dumbest things and that's that's what that is that's just that that little thorn of like me warning to machete the guy who's fucking truck honked at night in the morning you know yeah it's that it's terrible but yeah well you know it's it's uh it reminds me of this amazing story that ramdas tells about the time that he got a phone call from a woman freaking out on acid who uh thought she was going insane and uh she was like talking to ramdas she's like i'm on acid i've lost my mind i've gone completely insane i'm losing and he's like okay well let me talk to the person who dialed the phone and who knew to call me because that person sounds like they're just fine you sound completely out of your mind but it's like when you so that so you have this function of these two states of being that are happening at any given time inside of you and for me there's the selfish uh ego dunking game which is that's what they call it it's a game you're playing the game of the self so you're playing the johnny game the johnny pemberton game and it's the people you like it's the people you don't like it's the things you consider success it's the things you consider failure that's the game you're playing and then the whole time that you're playing that game there's this other side that's watching you play the game and that's that still silent or still small voice that just says yeah look you're angry right now it's not angry that voice and then if you experiment with it you can suddenly find that you can jump from the johnny game to that voice right and now you're just that thing whatever that is and that's when that goddamn balloon effect happens where you turn into a super bowl arena where suddenly you and they call it expansiveness where you're like you just feel huge it feels great i always feel that way after meditating i feel like there's like a i get at least a 30 minute little window there of of pretty good pure positivity to where i just want to be like some benevolent blanket and just cover the earth and oh hey yeah sometimes i think that uh people such as ourselves who think about and talk about this stuff a lot it's because uh we're sort of plagued with with darkness to some extent plagued and that's always the case i think is that people who are who think about it and maybe seem like they are on top of it or dealing with that in the most is because they have the biggest problem with it yes it's true because i know i have if i don't get on top of it i'll be consumed with it i'll be consumed with the fucking crystal crystal shard in my skull working toward the my brainstem they're gonna turn the world black pandora's box man open that thing up and all the sorrows of the world flew into the hearts of men and women but yeah and i'm the same way yeah and uh you're a demon and at any given moment i do have a demonic element to myself as we all do that's what carol young called the shadow and it's the the it's an inescapable thing and and the the choice that you get as a human being is you either get to fully focus on that thing that you call yourself the johnny the duncan whoever it is that you are whatever your name is you will quickly realize that you are the vast expanse of infinite time that has become fixated on the most minute and tiny infinitesimal portion of the great cosmic exhalation and that is why you suffer because in the same way that a an elephant knows when this tiny little guy's riding on top of it and beating it with a bamboo stick there's something inside the elephant that's like i'm a fucking elephant i could get you off of me in two seconds and trample you into jello right in the same way in the deepest part of human beings i believe that there is a fundamental uh part of ourselves that knows i'm a universe i'm a fucking universe i am the great expanse of all things and i am being ridden by an angry little bearded neurotic shithead right now right you're like a you're a mushroom cap you're just an extension of the great mycelial mat which is aliens absolutely it's aliens and aliens are it and and and it's god too you know or it's whatever you want to call it uh it's whatever you want to call it god is dog god is dead and dead is life dog is jed and jed is one of the great characters of tv history from beverly hillbilly i was thinking of jed isn't jed and fall out or jed in one of those video games how great would it be if this podcast was called beverly hillbilly's

Trussell Champion of the light killer of the dragon of Osiris and wander in the fields of grief If you're a first-time listener, you might not be aware of this, but you're getting over 4,000 aether blocks of energy.

I know that for many of us Just the very topic of death just the very word death acts like garlic to a vampire it acts like one of those new bat repellent horns people have been hanging on the side of their house to keep the bats away Which holy shit man not to like totally go off on a completely different topic But I don't know if you guys have been reading about the swarms of bats that have been descending on people's homes throughout the Midwest It really is a Shocking thing that teaches us so much about the unexpected effects of climate change. We've got Toddlers being carried off by bats. They found three young children who just Had their breakfast in a bat cave the bats had already started putting some kind of fungus on Them which to keep them warm. I don't understand it But when people were talking about climate change one thing I didn't expect Was that the bats would start trying to steal and raise our children? We've got to really stop emitting fossil fuels or we're gonna end up having bat caves just filled with Toddlers and who knows why would they stop with the kids swarms of bats? I don't know how how many bats it takes to carry away a dog But I bet it's not that many In a grandfather. I don't know how many bats to carry away a grandfather probably a lot But we just we don't want anything, you know, you don't want anything to be carried away by a bat except for bats or bat food That'll be the subject of an upcoming podcast with bat expert vicar prints from romania Death it's a force field. It's like the As I as I continue to sort of Ride down the river of grief And I sure as hell hope I don't sound like I'm like simpering or something like that because that's that would number one I haven't simpered in a while and I love simpering when it happens, but uh Or feeling sorry for myself because I certainly don't but uh it when you are in grief when your parents die this like It's true that you enter into a zone that you don't stay in forever even though sometimes it might seem like that and it's interesting to watch the way my mind is reacting to it and just all the sort of ideas bubbling up out of the stinking peep moss swamps that is my subconscious and the fucking dreams are wild man the way you're uh subconscious minds start sending you these beautiful little letters to sort of Help you understand uh What's going on down there and the subterranean layers of the south And uh, it's mostly good but it's weird and I think because of the laws of attraction and the basic sort of Tendency to draw people to you that are at your same frequency. I've been having the real Good fortune of uh having phone conversations with people who have also lost people recently And i'm fine, you know, there's a lot of stuff you start finding out. It's like My what I have a pregnant wife a beautiful wonderful pregnant wife and Uh Now I've got like a backstage past pregnancy. I I didn't know so much about pregnancy like I had no idea That pregnant women Gained the ability to shoot lasers out of their eyes that can cause pretty pretty not like third degree burns But definitely burns the skin. I also didn't know that uh pregnant women have uh the ability to Walk through walls. I didn't know that pregnant women could teleport all these things somehow. They just don't make it into the books about pregnancy Uh and a lot of things other things about pregnancy Maybe they make it into the books, but you don't hear about it for some reason, which is like pregnant women suffer, man They suffer it's a it's a it's a really Your body is just like suddenly becoming an An apartment to a new consciousness like it your stomach suddenly becomes like a bachelor pad You know, you suddenly if you're having a boy, there is like an action. There's a A a baby penis is in you now and a baby A baby and I got a big a baby like a big head you know Yeah, and it's uncomfortable right and um It's like wow having a it's it's if you're a selfish person if you have selfish tendencies, which I certainly do Then uh pregnancy becomes like a pull-up bar for selflessness Because it's like You're you know, it's you got now you got your wife who has trusted you enough to let you you know blast life producing seed into her putting her into a semi debilitated progressively debilitating state I saw this cartoon where like a baby is like a funny cartoon where a little baby's like punching a Like hugging a bladder That's what happens the the baby just pushes down on their bladder They can get like some sciatic stuff. There's like it's just uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable um It's uncomfortable And you don't hear a lot of you know for some reason you know, I don't know Maybe it's just because I I haven't paid any attention to pregnancy throughout my life None there's as far as I'm aware. There's no pregnancy channel You know And there's no real courses on it. I don't think there are probably but I mean I was I it's a long time since I've been in high school and let me tell you if I had to sit through like Here's what to do with a pregnant wife class. I would have tuned the fuck out For the whole thing because I would have thought I'm never gonna get married or have a baby So there's all this stuff and the same is true for death Like there's all this stuff that like that you just you just don't hear too much about and talking to all these people Either you realize all these things one people feel isolated You know, they're like people who are grieving. They just feel isolated because they either have like siblings that they can talk to you but a lot of times because death is so unbelievably the death of a parent is so unbelievably apocalyptic Uh, it it it can like create some real rifts in families Because some people like I one of the ways I keep picturing death is like a windshield that language just Smashes against like bugs, you know, like logic smashes against it Like just a it's like a fucking truck windshield and the the flapping duck of logic comes emerging Into the highway of the time space continuum and death just like smacks right into it splatters a little rational logical duck guts All over the fucking All over its windshield just turns on the wipers. It doesn't fucking care. Yeah, man The grim reaper man driving a truck filled with dead bodies Smashing into logic ducks. That's what I'm talking about. That's what death is And so, you know people when they run into it Steam comes out their ears, you know, and except the way the steam comes out their ears is they You know, they they have they react. I react everyone will react. There's no way to not react to it It is like we can't get past it like I mean the thing I keep thinking about is like poorly designed video games, you know, like uh A poorly designed video game. You're playing this guy. He's fucking muscular. He's got like Fucking guns or swords You know, and suddenly you're like find yourself at a fence That's like maybe waist high And beyond the fence is just this like beautiful expanse And you just can't go over the fence and you think to yourself, man, that's bullshit Like this dude was just like blowing up cars. He can't go over the fence. This is ridiculous and if the character was sentient and had sort of gotten the idea that that he was a free roaming autonomous Being and suddenly slapped into a force field that he couldn't go past Then it would drive him nuts. It like that we had an ai living inside a simulation It would drive the ai fucking up the goddamn wall Probably to have to deal with the fact that there were certain zones that it couldn't cross beyond like why? There's not there's this membrane You know, remember that show under the dome, which is a based on a book a steven king book Where like suddenly this like sort of force field appears around a town you just can't go past it And that's what death is only it doesn't appear as a sort of geophysical location. It's like It it's something that appears in in time and it appears it the moment that Our our consciousness leaves our bodies and so Uh, it's just we can't understand it. We don't know what's past it. It's a force field. It's a wall. It's a veil It's whatever you want to call it a fucking The difference between air and water or or or or this or you know earth and sky however you want to put it This is a zone That everyone will cross through but we Can't and so grief and all seems to be combination of like The slow metering out of heartbreak, you know, it's like your body sort of allowing yourself to release the the the sort of like growing realization of the impermeability Of this particular zone, which is you're not going to text the one who has passed you're not going to Talk to the one who's passed you're not going to touch the one who's passed Ever again in this physical form at least as far as we know and me just saying that I can feel it. It's like a Bubble it's like a you can feel this thing in you that just rolls through your whole body of sadness when you when you think about that and it's like physical and the quality of it is like not Unpleasant that's the really interesting thing that there's a sweetness to it. It's this love. It's like all the love It's the This is you know, one of the things christian had asked told me once the longing Is the grace and the longing not just for god or for realization or for Someone that you're missing or for someone But but also for someone who has passed Is a strange type of connection a sort of psychic tendril that I think sort of Goes out of the time space continue them and connects directly with those that we have lost and that feeling That's sweet feeling. That's the communication. I think it's the great eternal message that All of us in our own way are forced to either confront or ignore Which is that everything is perfect and that Source god whatever you want to call it God is good and um You know, you can read all these various stories book of job. You can read the Taoist interpretations of this, you know, like uh Hey, uh God, I'll fuck this story up. Like there's some dude who's like, uh uh, I guess a farmer and He uh his son is like helps him around the farm and his son falls and breaks his leg And it's a disaster because who the fuck's gonna help him around the farm and so his neighbor is like, oh my god, this is This is terrible And the farmer says to his friend, we'll see we'll see and then uh, some soldiers come by And they're like enlisting people for some war And they're like give us your son. He's gonna join the military. You could go into these brutal battles But his son has a broken leg so they can't he can't be enlisted. And so his neighbor is like, whoa, what great luck you have and The farmer says we'll see we'll see And the point is it's just this like that the all the stuff that happens in time Is somehow Simultaneously incredibly important and yet Abjectly meaningless Like on the level of time, it's the most important thing. We must love each other and be kind to each other and compassionate to each other And somehow coexisting with this Is this Sense that all of this stuff that we're in is just like vaporous fog being blasted out of a A smoke machine and some kind of interdimensional Dance club that we call human reality and and it's like it's cool and it's beautiful, but it's to become too obsessed with the light show is to miss out on the music and the music seems to be emanating in Through a speaker that is connected to something outside of time. What the fuck did that mean? And that's what happens the window opens up and you see it. It's like We're you know, if this is as some say spaceship earth When someone dies for a second the The the door the doors of the spaceship quickly open up and shut and when they open up You can kind of like see And when I say see I mean see in the way that you see without eyes And you and and and and you can hear and when I say here, I mean the way you can hear without your ears Because this thing is outside of time and so you get this like You brush against something That is so spectacularly Beautiful enormous spacious expansive Lovely That you find yourself in this curious predicament of being heartbroken But also inspired And that is a pretty great place to be in and uh Though I don't think I don't necessarily want to stay here for forever I'm I'm not like gonna rush out of it and besides it doesn't matter You're not gonna make you can't control it. So that's what all the people I've been talking to In my therapist and you know grief counselors are like, yeah, it's gonna come and go There's you can't do much about it. You're gonna be numb. You're gonna feel fine. You're gonna be heartbroken You're gonna be manic. You're all the shit and it's cool. The best thing is just to be like, okay, that's just this is where I'm at right now You know Some days you're gonna be fucking You know nick drake and some days you're gonna be paul simon If that makes any sense, that's a 44 that's what a 44 year old would say Anyway, it's Bad, but it's not the kind of bad that people who haven't lost their parents think it is That's the hopeful part and I wouldn't even call it bad It's just a sort of unexpected education That I'm experiencing and because of that um, I'm gonna be talking about it a lot in the podcast and uh And and and I hope y'all understand that I'm talking about it not in the way that in the past I have edgelord did as they say And it been like You know just because you want to be shocking or some shit But my feeling with it that this is like maybe even more shocking than that which is like it's not I guess The best way to to say it is to quote ramdas As always who said dying is completely safe And the great controversial thing to say is like there's really truly nothing to worry about when it comes to death Like all the worry meant all the fucking worry about death. Oh god. I put so much fucking psychic energy into the bank account of fear of death throughout my life Jesus Christ I would be the fucking I'd be a rupert murdoch of like death billionaires based on all the fear I'd put into that imaginary bank vault and and to like have that sort of Paradoxically the fear of death go away just by what we know watching someone pass who you've known your whole life It's it's a really fascinating thing. You're like, oh, it's I guess that's the other the gift they give you when they leave When they head over and uh, and I don't like you know, we have to use terms based in the time space continuum because that that's where we're at We use terms based on three dimensions. So they went here or they went there. I don't think that's really good descriptors, but We're in time right now. So we have to use those words But it's almost like when the bay door opens and your dad or mom drops their body and sort of graduates it's almost like, you know in in movies where The the fucking door opens. There's this vacuum and all the shit gets sucked out of the spaceship Actually, you know that an alien I don't want to ruin it if you haven't seen alien. What the fuck? In alien they open up that pod door. I think she opens it to try to get that little skitter and Cunt out of there I don't remember exactly. I think she had to throw like something at it or I don't remember how she got the bastard out but the This door this thing opens up and sucks out a bunch of stuff And not only does it suck out your parents But I think it also pulls some of your own darkness with it like some of your own density it's like that's the gift you're You're you're the one you love when they leave. They're like, hey, let me uh, what let me take your trash Let me take out some of your trash And then it's gone and so there you are grieving missing longing yet simultaneously a little lighter than you were before So that's where I'm at right now with it my sweet beautiful darling friends We have a great podcast today with a wonderful comedian Who has a special out?

Did you watch all those? Which ones? There's like a million. Yeah, but when the 20 year anniversary came around There was one that I think was like two days worth Where detectives got together and they brought in experts That handle trials and cases and murder cases. So they brought in like Uh, like expert investigators, but then expert, um, I don't I can't think of the correct word for people who analyze blood I know you're talking about and and scripture and handwriting and in the end They all came together and decided that it really it came down to that it was the brother and that that was crazy. Yeah Yeah, I you know the the fascinating thing about those kind like It's weird when you get a celebrity Murdered person, you know, like somehow their murder Propels them into infinite fame. Yeah, and in the fame god, I hope that doesn't happen That's not what please god. Yeah, I've worked so hard. I mean, I guess like TMZ can't get to you, right? but like at least but like, you know, you you See that shit in your it's one of the most bizarre fetishistic qualities of western society is our Weird addiction to what I think it was south park called murder porn Have you heard that? Oh, you've never heard that term murder porn I don't think I've heard of murder porn murder porn is forensic files murder porn is the first 48 murder porn is True crime murder porn is any time you find yourself watching a detailed account of someone's uh murder and and you what you're and now it also that it's also in the continuum of um Uh, okay, so like in the old days we had freak shows. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So if you were bored, I guess you go to a carnival and for 50 cents, right? Yeah You go to a fucking freak show and it's like the dude bites the head off the chicken the fucking um The the the the person who has too much hair on their body the mummified jewish guy The the fucking uh, um The uh What are some other freaks that are classic like the the bearded lady? Yeah Uh, you know, and they're just called a freak show. Yeah, and then people would pay to watch those and then That was that was the entertainment. Mm-hmm You'd go in you'd sit in a seat with no guilt at all. Yeah, I guess And these people who are just people. Mm-hmm people with Hydrocephalic people or people missing limbs or whatever People missing limbs that maybe have like a mermaid's tail attached. Yeah wheeled out on a stage Maybe they'd sing a little song right or like the the elephant man that whole story You know with the john maryk and the you know, and he has the he has the the uh The bag over his head. Yeah, like do you know what I mean? He had that like it was like a sack Yeah, that he had he cut and as a kid when I watched the elephant man movie I was mesmerized by that one of the best movies of all time It was mesmerized because it just you know, he was and it was his fork You know, it was like I'm not you know in the way that society treated him Yeah, like really pulled a heart string in me and that was real I mean, that's like what it used to think if you were like that your chances in society were like not that great So how do you make money you go to the fucking carnival? You and you start working in the in the freak show and then suddenly you have the camaraderie of other people who have been Sort of ostracized by the normal genetic symmetry and then at least you have a family and so anyway Now we can't do that. So like if like the learning channel Had a show called parade of freaks. Yeah, and put the exact same people That they put on their show In an informational as though it's like an informational thing, you know, like hoarders. Yeah, you know And so we sit and watch hoarders and we pretend Yeah, because the narration is being done in a kind of like info way like You know what I mean though the the should the story is being told in a kind of like But it pulls you in because it's something different and maybe something that That that your That is nothing close to the way you live or your lifestyle and it's unfathomable to think that some people could actually Live like live this way. Right. So, yeah, I could there's a total attraction in that. Right. Did you have did you ever watch the show obsessed? That was on a&e. Wait, wait that one was about people with a ocd. Yes Yeah, I saw I think I saw that I saw some episodes of that That's the like the people who eat sofa cushions and stuff They do that, but they also like there was a guy who was so afraid of germs He didn't have any trash cans in his house and whatnot and they bring in this Cognitive behavioral therapist and she says and he's like this interior decorator and palm springs named scott and She makes scott. She she comes out of the bathroom and she's like scott This luck would have it. I was on my period and I used the towels in your bathroom to wash my hands So um and you can just see like scott's head sever into gay space And she takes him into the bathroom Which he's already like mortified that she you know had taken her vagina in there whatever she had done And she makes him you take the hand towel and put it to his face And she's like scott scott put the towel on your face. He's like I can't I can't she's like put the towel to your face So he puts a little towel to his face and she's like scott She's like what what do you feel and he's like I feel uh endometriosis Vaginal secretions fibroid juices. I'm like scott sure has a lot of uh things on like that's what he got from From that towel, but it was so Like that's incredible scott's face is like one of those gas Yeah, a lot of vaginal problems for a guy. He's got a very sensitive. Yeah, but it was chemical How we even knew what endometriosis and he goes I feel endometriosis. I was like, how does it get to your face? Holy shit, but it's it's something like you watch that and you're like you Part of you is kind of laughing. You're like this guy is ridiculous, but this is this own guy's Personal demon is these germs and you just you want to you watch these people and you're like, oh, I kind of feel good about myself At least I'm not that guy. You can't have a trash can in this house. That's right. That's what it is Like we all huddle in our fucking living rooms We look at these people who are in a hell realm and have been discovered By some producer that's the other interesting thing is they have to cast this net somehow where they're like We need to find people Who are really really really doing weird shit and and and that means that there's pitch meetings Yeah, where someone's like, hey, look, I heard about this dude. Scott He can fucking detect endometri... His face is like a... his face is a... His face can feel endometriosis. Yeah, he can... yeah, his face knows It's his face is like a fucking microscope. How do you get a variant cancer on your face? Ask Scott. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right. And then they're like, all right. All right. That looks good. That looks good So let's do that or like another way to put it is like so Now I don't know the statistic on this but on any given day There are a certain number of children around the planet who are murdered unfortunately There's that many people and on any given day and probably in America There's a certain number of children who because of neglect or abuse They drop their body and so when Nancy Grace had that show Right. She was having to pick Which murdered children to put on the show and you you have to watch that because She is it's like and I don't think she gives a shit Nancy Grace. It's I it's all She gets the viewers people want it but people so wrapped up and interested In cases and things like that. I personally think because I I myself I'm a little guilty of that and you know what I was really guilty of when the three girls in Ohio Were discovered One ran out a man. It was an Amanda not Amanda Bynes. That's that um Amanda. Why am I freaking? I cannot remember I've read two books, but there was a couple years ago the three girls that were kept in that house in Ohio By a man for for 10 years And one like broke out with her child and the neighbor Like helped them out of the screen door. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know you're talking about. Yeah And the guy's name was like castra like his last name. He ended up hanging himself in jail But if you read the books one girl wrote michelle night wrote the first book And she was the first one that was kidnapped and then it wasn't till like years later came the other two women and then they co-wrote A book together and when you read the details Of of what went on in that house, but even when it hit the news I think I was working in Boise or something and I just watched cnn Just kept it on and it was the same report Over and over and I just stood in front of the tv crying because I just couldn't believe that society Failed These three women. Yeah, and that neighbors sometimes people would see like young girls with this man and wigs on And sunglasses by the trash can yeah, and nobody said shit any police his daughter would come over For like a brunch and he'd have them locked up in different parts of the house Yeah, like how are you somebody's daughter that you don't know That you haven't even been through your father's house that you can't sense But he would lock them in a van with helmets over their head And the detail and the horror of this and then you see something like the 12 I'm not an alarmist. I promise everybody But then you see like the 12 kids that were in california With the father and the mother the turpin family where they had they all look like they're in the band the monkeys Yeah, and that guy held his that guy held 12 kids. He had them handcuffed To bunk beds and this was going on for a very long time Yeah And what I think is this is going on in america and there are so many more Of these and that I feel like like I want some military or trooper I want people knocking on people's doors You know why I think people love watching this shit and reading it and why I love watching and reading it You know and and and is because like in a in a what like all of us In our own way Because we're incarnated temporarily in a dimension where there's so much suffering Our handcuffed to a type of bed that we created like we're all trapped. We're all freaks We're all in the corner. We're all backed into a corner and dealing with our own imprisonment Uh our own you generally self-imposed imprisonment. Yeah is way more difficult than it's almost than watching like, you know another like a hyper Intensified version of what's happening to almost every single person which is that like we're all like if you scan your life You're attached to some shit like in that case those kids were literally attached to a fucking bed By a lunatic like that dude had to go on amazon or go to some fucking weird shop and buy 12 pairs of handcuffs in a monkey's hairdo and like first of all Like how do people it's like I know when I walk into a room I scan that room fast and even when I'm eating or I'm out or even when I'm doing comedy I can tell you I can see people's energies. I can see things going on and I'll tell you When I when I feel something is wrong or off I'm watching because I'm aware And I'm not walking around with my head up my ass But I think people are so self-involved don't pay attention and meanwhile in your neighborhood Is this person who's moved to not just one but he moved over a period of time with his wife to like four places They took their kids to disneyland. Someone didn't notice Maybe something was completely off. Well, did you see the um That there's a I think it who was it uh, Alfred Hitchcock directed a I can't remember what it's called. It's very sad. It's a documentary on the holocaust And what they did was they had the uh, now we're gonna get really hilarious. Let's just We went for kidnappings to the holocaust Welcome to how comedians talk to each other If you aren't depressed now, you will be well, let's see what happens the the um, so so they uh, they essentially in this village Next to one of these horrific camps they Went into the village and they got everyone who was living in that village And they parade they made them walk in front of a table And on that table was like a lamp made out of human flesh Like all the horrors that have been happening right next to them that they were pretending weren't happening And and they did that to like show them like hey look look and then if you want to go further back To to another time when you like one of my favorite verses in the Bible is when jesus is being crucified I love it because it's one of those verses that you hear And you hear it one way at first at least for me and then over time you you realize In a different way, but so you Christ says Father forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. So when I first heard that I thought it meant They don't know who I am. Do you know who I am? I'm the son of god. They don't know who I am, right? Well, that's just one level of it. There's a deeper level. Oh, yeah, which is they literally Don't know what they're doing. They're like rumbas they're just Like spiritual machines that are kind of stuck in a pattern of denial In acceptance and they have no idea what they're doing meaning like we have to forgive them because they are Unconscious, they're zombies. They're sleepwalking. Are you gonna like there's there's a And in the courts, it's called temporary insanity where someone Does a homicide and they're shown they were like on their Verifiably weren't there. They had a fucking seizure of insanity and they did something rotten And they came out of it and they're covered in blood and they're like, what the fuck did I do? so that's Temporary insanity and people get off on that if you can prove it and it does fucking happen, right? It does but I hold those people who lived near those camps I mean, what did they have to do make the knock worse? Like how can you ignore that? There are people human beings, but then again people don't value human beings people I would say probably value animals more than they do human beings and I I'm witness to that and I'm I'm That like really pushes on my sensitivity chip because I see people And it why are we on this world if we can't help one another and just be kind to one another I know the business that we're in comedy and it's this, you know Get up there make people laugh Which is almost another type of service that you are at least providing to people no matter how dark or whatever's going on inside you You're up there to almost provide a service for people either to forget about what has happened to them that day Or maybe what's going on with their life. Yeah, and maybe bring a moment of joy to them Absolutely. I mean, yeah, that's is the the The thing one of the things I've been thinking about a bunch lately is this I have a guru named Corole Baba and he is dropped. You have him too. What just get real Ah My guru's Neiman Marcus Duncan close But the the one of the things he said is very simple, which you know people would come to him and they would say I want to develop I want to raise my Kundalini and that's a way of saying like sometimes like when you get around like Really really famous people Um Like once I got lucky and was sitting next to Deant word, which is this like amazing band. I don't know if you know, they are on on the plane but in like, you know, like you're sitting next to them and you're trying to identify how much of This is my own projection onto them and how much of them is actually like radiating some kind of crazy energy Well, that's that's Shakti is what it's called or Kundalini energy. And so like Ram Das One of my teachers had radiates that's a thing you can cultivate And um, but when you get around really really famous people, they have this radi they they radiate this field of uh, Oh, I know that very well. Yeah You do have a wonder my dogs Oh your dogs Duncan's number one fans apparently are I thought it was gay man, but now it's Duncan's dogs. Oh, they're so cute Well, my god, I mean to me it's like I'll tell you if like, I mean where I'm at in my life if like Gay men and dogs Love you. You're doing something right. I hope so when but but the the So You know, when you get around someone who's like severely famous, you know, who's like really done it Then there's a term that one of my friends Jason Lou have used. I hope I don't I don't know fuck up the way he said it, but it's called warping the room So you get around certain people and there's a warp around them where it's like, you know, it and you'll always see it It's like no different than when you put a magnet down and and it draws like uh Magnet next to anything metallic and it draws it to it. It's magnetism is what they used to call it, you know, and that's called Um, there's lots of different names for it shaktipa Kundalini energy so people would go to neem curly baba and say, how do I raise my kundalini, right? And because people want that for a lot of different reasons They want it because it will make you famous. They want it because it will make you money They want it because it will give you power over other people It'll allow you to read people's minds like that thing you're saying where I can see someone What's within them, you know, that's that's like one of the what's called a city and you can you can get that You can really work on that to the point where you can like look into someone and see what they're thinking And then if you're nefarious you can use that against them and that's called sorcery But anyway, neem curly, I was gonna say that starts to like become sound a little bit like witchcraft that you can figure out Well, it's it becomes, you know, it becomes a type of witchcraft or it just becomes a thing it just becomes a You know in the west we have different names for witchcraft So in the west we'll call it neuro linguistic programming and lp or something like that We have different names for the exact same phenomena But so people would go to neem curly bell and say how do I develop this and he would say feed people Feed people you want to you want those powers go feed people and so I think about that a lot because it's so simple and and and and so when you say oh when i'm doing comedy You know i'm giving some you're feeding people right and so the more that you do that and this is The more a comedian does that and does it successfully Then the more they're going to start generating this aura of magnetism because you know i mean not to like Blow smoke or anything shan, but when you walk into a room people gravitate towards you people want to look at you You know how to do it if those are bill collectors Every funny person i know Has developed a type of and i'm you can use this language for here we call it talent It's a city which means that if you want to When you're in a group of people Whether it's on stage or not on stage you can start doing a series of Actions that are kind of hypnotic that are going to induce a reaction that's going to make people laugh right That's a city you've developed this kind of thing and that comes from feeding people and the way you've been feeding people Is with your hilarious fucking comedy and so it's like comedians are always a little magical You know and some comedians are are dark Are sorcerers and some comedians are are like shamans, you know like if i've never met a comedian or a funny comedian That isn't magical.

Yeah, but they don't call it that they just call it the sparkle the stuff Yeah, you know they call that talent. Yeah, right. That's what we call it here. Yeah.

It's like you're naked and you're saying hey and there's that That that comic mentality, but I think people like this in general like I hope they like me I hope people like me And you put yourself out there and I Generally I generally do like people. I am a people person. I've always been An extrovert I've always been outgoing and even when like I grew up do a different, you know, I grew up Jewish in Oklahoma There weren't many of us walking around and even then I was super proud and like for show and tell at school I bring a fucking dreidel with me and a menorah and I'll let you know the kids they all loved christ They all attended the church on the corner and I just stood proud because I was like well look at me I'm maybe a little different, but this is I embraced it and When you get on that stage, there is that whole Like part of you that you're just like well, I hope I can provide This service, but you know that doesn't that service doesn't come without judgment So you put yourself up there and you hope that you can feed off Positive vibes and people and make people happy not everyone's gonna always agree with everything you say and You're gonna see the judgment probably more than you might see the laughs Well, it depends on what you're looking at. I mean, it's like that's the problem with comedy especially with comedy is like you have to like so you've got like, you know The double-edged sort of comedy I think as opposed to like other art forms is like I can like sit in my studio here and make music all fucking day and I can pretend to myself That's some really beautiful music Duncan, right? It but because like there's some really good weed. Yeah, exactly. And let me tell you it's always the weed It's hilarious every once in a while like every once in a while, maybe I got a top dead hit. No, it was just the Jamaican roast You know what it's like when it's like two in the morning You're fucking baked and you're looking at your hands scrolling down. What you feel is like the like the the channeled divine Wisdom of the universe and then you like wake up in the fucking morning and look at it. You're like I have to tell you though. I have only been high once in my life and it was I thought I was gonna die and it was in Amsterdam. Was it marijuana? It was full-blown marijuana And I you know, I thought because I I work mostly a lot on all gay male cruises and I perform on them and so I thought oh, it would be funny to open my show. I had my videographer with me I'm like be funny to open my show like Sean Pulaski's never gotten high in her life until today And so I brought like all these props and things with me just in case it would be funny when I got high And we you know, we sat in that Amsterdam cafe It's just it was all it was all bad like I don't know why I became the carrot top of getting high But I logged all this shit with me And I get I literally Get there and I'm like, okay, you know, I was raised by Two parents that always like drugs are bad for you. Stay off drugs. You know, go go, you know get straight A's Become a doctor or whatever the case was and so I was always just I never really did I mean I had alcohol and I would drink and party but Drugs just I never touched pot, but I thought okay. I'm in Amsterdam. This is legal. Let's get a really funny video And I had five friends with me and they brought me like a spliff And I did the the pop with the tobacco and it must have been about like three feet long this spliff I smoked the whole thing An hour went by I said this shit isn't working How am I the only person that pot does not affect? I've never had pot and I was literally like I was so nervous I was like shaking holding pot. You would have thought I was like Like raping a full family like you the way I was so nervous that I was gonna get caught with anything So then they're like, okay, we went we got you we got you this stuff full-blown marijuana This should do the trick and then I smoked almost half of that And I was like, it's not working. So I don't know. I've been smoking for like three hours I mean and then at some point it kicked in and then all I remember is it You know, I remember grabbing props. I remember like doing that they filmed something and Then I remember blacking out And then I remember walking and I could hear myself talking but I was like 30 seconds behind And I was comparing pounds to euros like who gives a fuck. Why am I doing that? Yeah, and I turned to my friend. I said am I high? He said yes. I said am I in Amsterdam? He said yes. I said am I walking? He said yes And then six hours. I was so fucking high. I was talking to trees I thought Kathy Griffin was coming to take my non-career. I had no idea. It was not a good experience You got paranoid about Kathy Griffin. I could you believe that? No, I can't believe it for sure No, because the mind is like so like you're like The disc the discursive mind like when when you get stoned For the first time and you over you overdosed yourself And I sure did. Yeah, you overdosed and and like when you overdosed on marijuana What what happens is that part of your mind that like puts you in a bad mood takes over Because that part of the mind is wrong is wrong. I had five friends that watched me Over none of them are really smoking. Yeah. Yeah I had read like the pamphlets in the Amsterdam Cafes before that said, oh, you know, they had all these steps if you feel really high Pour sugar into water. Have you ever fucking heard of this sounds like a bunch of hogwash? I mean, but I remembered that and my friends all went to dinner and I'm talking to a tree And I came in and then put the put the sugar I put pounds and pounds of sugar into the water No, nothing the video came out really funny. It did. That's great I can't find it. I don't know where it is. It was on like a DVD And I think my husband was the only one who ever saw it because we had just started dating at the time But I didn't do well and it made me it made me so nervous to ever like do it again. Yeah Well, you overdosed Apparently, I mean, this is the fucking problem. I'm a terrible drug addict. Yeah. So yeah Give me all the heroin. I mean, I I yeah terrible. So my mom would say the same thing I'll never smoke marijuana. I did she tell tell the one time she like overdosed on weed and like, you know I had the spins and I was paranoid and it's like so I'll never do it again because marijuana is fucking horrible It's like that's like saying like, you know wine is like Poison because because once you drank three bottles of wine, you know, and you were you were vomiting for days another funny thing that you're saying Is like so many people would be like, you know, my parents they weren't into drugs, you know They would just drink and it's like, oh, you mean your parents were doing the most destructive drug on the plan Yes, like they did a study They did a wonderful study this guy. And fortunately his name is professor nut, which is like brilliant fucking a noise Maybe he's like a sidekick professor ball. Yeah, I just like I know why does his name have to be like that? It's like professor bongo professor, you know professor Choo-choo You know, why does his name have to be ridiculous and he's a psychedelic advocate? But regardless his data, you know, the research is good and he did he did this wonderful study to determine Like what's what's the most harmful drug? What are the most harmful drugs on the planet? And you know, you have these wonderful liquor. What is alcohol alcohol's the first and and you know, though It's it's you know, I think if we like compare like say Methamphetamine to alcohol methamphetamine comes really close but but if like methamphetamine were suddenly available For sale at like 711, you know, you could just go to 711 buy one of those shitty fucking hot dogs and like meth crystal Then meth would make it above alcohol because it's the it's the availability of alcohol mixed in with it. What about opiates? What what about opiates? They're like a few down opi. Opioids are a few down. Yeah, because it's like what apparently What heroin Is doing to your body like to your liver Into your heart to your to your body Compared to what alcohol is doing to your body. It's way less bad for you It's just really way more addictive and it like and and and and if you're measuring it outright. Yeah, sure You know alcohol fucks you up like they just did a study where they found out there is no Healthy amount of alcohol like you know that bullshit you read like yeah one glass one glass one I heard that I heard about that study. Yeah glass but then I turned I heard today another study It's like everyone's contradicting themselves are like if you have a little bit of alcohol and red meat That's oh, that's good for you like people. They said oh no the study was red meat and cheese So it's like is it good for you? Is it not I feel like every month Another study comes out to contradict the other studies and the previous study So I don't even know what to believe anymore. I can just know that's like I'm going to try and live my life if I want to have a drink I do if I wanted to smoke pot I can I've been into the med men. Thank you On robertson and Beverly Hills. I have walked in there And I had ordered like I had gone in there and I I someone said oh you should take the cdc Mints, you know if you ever feel anxious or this this will help you calm down. It doesn't have any of the thc I went in there. I walked in with like a jone crofford hat on and sunglasses Yeah, I looked like an asshole And I'm like am I buying drugs and they're like what and I'm like is the popo gonna come and get me and they thought I was crazy and they gave me the cdc stuff Didn't work or see look at me. I'm the worst drug addict ever you will never see me on intervention Good luck getting addicted to marijuana cdp. Yeah, I know it's terrible. Was it cdb. See that's how shitty I am Well, I took it and it didn't work and then I went back again And I got it with the thc Didn't work just made me nauseous. It didn't help me didn't help me stay calm nothing Yeah, it's like there's a I went to this cdc the center of disease control See where my jewish mind is always like do I have that? Jesus You know, there's like everyone that's the other thing is like because of this awful prohibition on drugs There is this assumption that everyone's body reacts to To marijuana or other psychedelics the same way like Everyone's genome is a little different. So people have different reactions to certain psychedelics. So it's like you know one of the Beautiful things about the fact that they've begun to study psychedelics again is that there's wonderful things you could do by just analyzing people who have like Rough reactions to marijuana, let's say or to psilocybin and then would I be one of those rough reactions to marijuana? You might be you know, it isn't it's a phenomena that comes up where people are like, I can't get high and and it was so weird and what is that, you know, there's a lot of like Potential answers to that who the fuck knows from like the woo-woo side of things to like Something to do with the cannabinoid receptors in your brain and then and then and then maybe like the cannabinoid receptors Disappoint like what? You know, I don't know by the way, this is pure 100 percent bro science. I have a doctorate in bro science who the fuck knows I've got a lot of I got a lot of friends who are like doctors and scientists and when this shit starts going they're just like What about chemical makeup of people? I'm sure that Plays into effect Of how people react. I mean like how does that explain? genetically If people become out if they've had an alcoholic parent and then they become alcoholics. I think that there's something Yeah, it's genetics. They were trying to feed so like now what they want one this scientist I met at a psychedelic A conference was telling me that they're working on analyzing people's genomes and seeing if they can figure out what psychedelics are just Probably statistically not going to work for you. So if we lived in a civilized society where alcohol was Not the only legal Yeah Route to shifting our consciousness through some chemical then Theoretically you could have a genetic test done and they would be able to tell you. Oh Don't take mushrooms. Yeah, you're gonna freak the fuck out every time because of this or that Now that's science, right? Now if you were to go to the other side of the charts to like the World where mushrooms are actually like a healing plant medicine and you look at the concept of the human entity Is a kind of temporal sponge that has absorbed a bunch of darkness and trauma then You could say well the reason you're going to have a rough time at first with the mushrooms is because All that trauma that's inside of you You've been desperately trying to ignore with every single fucking drink you've been taking with every single shitty relationship You've been getting into and with every single fucking thing you've been addicted to with every video game that you've been playing and with every Sleeping pill you've been taking all that fucking darkness is going to be pushed out of your body by the The healing medicine and when that starts coming out you're gonna see it with your conscious mind And when you see it with your conscious mind, it's going to scare the fucking shit out of you And that fear is what we call a bad trip when reality You had a few of those In the early days I did you know when I was still like purging myself of this shit and like it's kind of like A bad trip is a lot like eating Going to let's say I don't know fucking like Wendy's in panorama city. I don't know if you've ever been to the Wendy's in panorama city I can't say that I have no offense Wendy's in panorama city. I went there. I got I don't know if it was you And I don't know if it was let's just so forget it. I don't want to get sued by fucking Wendy's I'm just saying like it's like eating A lot of really bad food and then Vomiting and looking in the toilet and being like, oh my god That was inside of me. And so that's a bad trip a bad trip does in a period of like Six hours what a great therapist is going to do over the course of maybe a couple of years Which is like very gradually allow you if there's something that needs to be released To release it whereas like a which is why it's great to the the model for mushrooms Was usually there would be paired with the mushrooms a person called a shaman who would be there to help you Yeah, because that's why ayahuasca is so popular and people will just take trips and yeah and trip out on that I think i'm just too I think i'm just too nervous to do something like that. Oh, right. That's right Yeah, we're nervous and then and then you would say to your the question Why are you and who wants to be there? It's like I feel sorry for the shaman It's got to deal with all my neuroticist like I could just see that shaman like no, I quit I quit this one is too much. Baba Streisand is too much for me I don't know why I made the shaman arab, but I just did that's it. I learned shaman's. Yeah, usually usually there are Shamans there are arab shamans I'm sure they're usually the ones like in latin america where people go to do the ayahuasca Well, we you know as comedians like you know, usually when I'm like Many comedians that I've met if have like a lot of pain they're carrying around Yeah, like they're afraid to put the pain down for a lot of different reasons And like one of the reasons they're afraid to put the pain down Is because they think if they put the pain down they'll stop being funny And and I've like seen that many many times where comedians are like fuck that fuck that Like I don't want to be happy I don't want to feel good about life. I don't want to feel like all fucking like yeah, everything's perfect I love everyone because then how am I gonna write my fucking jokes My jokes are a deconstruction of fucking society motherfucker. And if they're not that they're like Based on a kind of like, you know, whatever. So the idea is like You know, if I remove the pain Then failure awaits. I don't know if that's you or not, but I know I've been in I've been that in that place before This ridiculous idea that if you don't self-flagellate you're gonna be in some kind of like god will start hating you or something Yeah, I know I I I I have the capability of digging deep. I'm not afraid for people to know what who I am in my life. I don't I don't know. I'm I I feel like I'm an open book, but it also depends. I mean, I vary Who I'm in front of and what I'm doing and sometimes I just like to think off my feet. So it's not really diving Deep into me now when I'm doing material I can I mean I've I've got to say I've been really fortunate in my life as far as um Growing up and I had a good family And I worked really hard and I was a good student And I I I always knew I wanted to make people laugh and I you know had thought like I wanted to do the whole SNL type of route and I love like impressions and and characters But as time's gone by and as I get older I do I experience You know, I I do experience more pain you have more life experiences And they're real and they don't prepare you for things You know, I used to think I'd see these eat true Hollywood stories. I'm like, I'm never gonna get there I'm never gonna get to the top. I don't have any true Hollywood story. I didn't I didn't do this I didn't get caught here. I wasn't arrested. Um, you know, this didn't happen to me. I didn't flee to Mexico I didn't have any of this shit happened to me. Yeah, and Not in like a polyana type of way, but just I didn't have anything that I mean the worst that had happened Is that my parents got divorced after 30 years of marriage and it just my mom was how old were you? I was 20 About 21 21. I was like my first my No, it was like, yeah, my senior year in college What my first day my senior year in college I got the call I mean they were having problems and then that happened and it kind of took a toll I my mother emotionally and for my brothers and sisters and I it was something that we Tried to help and Carrie and she never got rid of the pain and the anger And it it was hard and it was hard to watch and it you know You you watch something like that and then this year when my mom suddenly passed away And got really sick out of the blue. It was just that was very painful And i'm not afraid to talk about something like that. I'm not afraid to to tell people You know how that experience affected me and i'm not afraid to find jokes as well It took me a moment to find any humor and that That torturous situation that I play over in my brain Every day since and it gets harder to hold my head up high. Yeah Especially since she was my biggest fan my number one supporter So it you carry that with you and I know you've got to understand this and it's I don't think anyone preps you they don't prep you for the loss Make sure of a parent and then there should be classes It's like when you go to college or even in high school how to balance a checkbook, you know how to balance your bank account um You know how to how to purchase a house Yeah things that need people how to do your taxes. Yeah, and and another thing is how How do you deal With a parent dying or parents getting older help taking care of them And that's something just was so new to me. How do you deal with that? Like if you had to teach that class like if you had to write the course syllabus for that class What what would it look like like if like you had to teach a bunch of people who had somehow managed to get themselves in a State of consciousness where they actually think their parents aren't gonna die Which is a lot of people What would the class look like? What would you say to them? Like how would you like teach that class? I think first of all What I noticed is that and I didn't really know much about this is like long-term health care Thank god my mom had something like that. I don't even think people even know many people are even aware Of that today. I mean younger generation. Maybe an older generation is where that is something It's like that sometimes I feel like could be a saving Grace as far as if you are a child and then you become A caregiver your brothers and sisters and there's a strain and a stress That happens with family when a parent gets sick or someone has to take Care of someone so I think and you may think you've got this tight family and there's just camaraderie there But it can I think it can break a family apart destroy a family just break it And that that is challenging. Yeah, and I think if you go in aware knowing that the emotional stress of being witness to this and I think what's really important is is If someone, you know, you see your parent, I mean it depends like we all can't call when Someone's going to pass away and sometimes it's just sudden and I've seen that too And I feel like, you know, you've got to really value The people around you and you can give everything you can give to that person because When it's gone Suddenly and it's done You go back and there's all these stages where you second guess god I wish I wouldn't have talked to them this way. There was that one time I did this and that's kind of the record that I play in my head and there's not I mean, it's been about six months And I there's not a part of me. There's nothing about me. That's like I wake up and I'm like gosh, you know what I remember these I go over the torture and I feel like When someone around you or a parent is sick We're not you just you've got to like you have to surround yourself with people Who you love who you care and and you've got to take care of yourself mentally and physically and How long were you taking care of her? How long well I wasn't like my mom had caregivers and we were all my sisters and brother we were It was like a it literally was Maybe like a seventh month period. It was like six months where she just got sick and um It just happened also fast when part of the blink of an eye. Yeah, and nobody knew the best of doctors You know, we had the best neurologists in southern california and the testing the multi millions of dollars of testing man Healthcare is important. I'll stress that again Because sometimes that can help people Maybe they might not find the answers, but at least you're trying so You can find you can find that the message also Like, you know the class is like because if I was like help if I was getting to teach this class with you Like the first thing I would want to get out is like do mushrooms Do lots of them Yeah But do it in a responsible way and and and not could have used some at that time Just mushrooms. There's a lot of different like access points to the transcendent that aren't just psilocybin But you know psychedelic there'd certainly be a psychedelic component to it But the other thing I'd want to teach people is it's The whatever you've created in your mind about how this is going to look That's not how it's going to look. It's not it's not what you expect And then the other thing I'd want to put in people's minds is it's a million times less scary than you think it is it's Sad and it is Heartbreaking but your mind is created um, or at least my mind created, you know, the text of chainsaw massacre Uh, or that level of this kind of like, you know, hellraiser Thing when really what you're what you'll experience is the most natural thing there is Outside of birth, which is people have been entering this dimension and exiting this dimension for a very very long time and um, so You suddenly begin to encounter something that's as natural as a river running downstream as a natural as wind blowing through the forest it's but also attached to it is all the attachment of the people who somehow managed to Trick themselves into imagining that we are here permanently. Yeah, and that's where you run into the light. That was me That was me drama. I thought I thought I my I think my family is invincible And I don't know why I always thought I thought that about my grandma birthday. She died at like 98 my grandma rose died at 94 I have an aunt right now. God help us all and anna She's 105 wow And her husband uncle abe was in the holocaust. He had the numbers on his arm We were not allowed to ask uncle abe about the numbers when we were a kid But I used to make a joke because aunt anna. She is tough. She called me fat my grandpa's funeral in ninth grade I will never forget that I'll hold a grudge and I will go visit anna, but I always say like oh my god You know, I said, uh, I say my uncle abe survived to holocaust ashowitz and anna because she She was she was tough You know, she was tough on him and he was just this sweet little polish man. Yeah, so sweet But anna no kids just keeps on going. Wow She's just and she's there. She's got a boyfriend In her, you know nursing home. She's doing it. She likes it here. Yeah Yeah, she likes it here. Some people want to stay here. Some people don't but but the the um Yeah, that that uh that's To me It's amazing the way I love the west. I love technology. You know, you see all these fucking gadgets everywhere. I love technology Love virtual reality all that it's so incredible. It's so incredible but In the west there is this massive Blind spot And that blind spot is our own mortality and we need the blind spot for um materialism to work like it does Because like, you know, like when you watch any fucking coca-cola commercial, right, which is a classic example of like Ridiculous marketing. There's like a great youtube Clip if you look up, uh Gixx spelled z i z e k Of course, that's how he spells it. Yeah. Gijek. Gijek. Is that one of the names on the cans? You're like, fuck you Gijek I was just looking for john Gijek and um, he uh, he does a kind of like analysis of Different brands and he does this just fantastic deconstruction of a coca-cola commercial and coca-cola itself And so whenever we see a coca-cola commercial in general Uh, it's always like around youth Right and it's always you sometimes it's like a party. Oh, it's always a party. We're fucking partying. There's a barbecue It's all this fucking, you know, it's like this the impression that goes along with the branding Is that this is youth you're you're kind of drinking a party you're drinking This is like almost like the fountain of youth or something It's like you're you're sipping the best times of your life in this can This is this amazing fucking thing and if you you look at like all commercials Outside of the ones on fox news which are designed for the geriatrics who are watching it You are like having all these fucking difficulties from like this dress level They've been getting from watching fox news for their whole lives if you fucking watch like most of these commercials They're all portraying A dimension where we're immortal, right? Because for for capitalism to really work We need to put matter over soul, right? Like we've got to put like Stuff over like the transcendent. Otherwise, it's kind of like try to fucking convince somebody to like Get into debt to the banks Who is 100 percent certain that the body is a vehicle that they temporarily inhabit on a very long journey Which is the process of purifying what they are good fucking luck with that coat commercial, you know Good luck with that You know like try to get across this idea of like you don't need to be in a hurry You know, you really don't you don't need to be in a hurry. You're torturing yourself and the reality of the situation is that you're Desperately trying to escape the reality of your own Mortality by going to these stupid parties And if you just sit in yourself and become what you are right now, which is perfect You don't need to drink coke. In fact, uh, it'll be the best tasting water You ever had in your life if you love yourself. Good luck. How does that fucking work? So in the west we're all taught that uh, we we avoid death and the avoidance of death I think is great on one level because it gives us this till it happens, right? We get to enjoy this fucking cool-ass roller coaster. It's like party party party. Wait a minute. My fucking arm doesn't work Wait, what does that mean? Why is my arm not working? Well, it's because you have a degenerative neurological disease It's how you're you got six months to live. You're like, wait, what? Where's my coke? Wait, that was my coke drinking, Anne Here try Pepsi. Yeah Pepsi for people who's right, Anne has been paralyzed because they're slowly dying Right. So yeah, this is the situation and this is the this is the grand conspiracy. The grand conspiracy is that we have been intentionally Misdirected from one of the greatest things that happens to us and because of that We've transformed that into the worst thing that can happen to us and now when it happens Families get ripped apart People are not prepared people die in shitty fucking medical conditions because they thought they were gonna live forever And and and it's a it's all I think blow back from Materialism which is like when you get taught that this shit goes on forever when it just doesn't it just doesn't and that's good Yeah, I think it's important. I think it's important though to tell Especially in a situation like that in in those moments and especially if it's someone is Is is sick and they're dying in front of you. It's just you Get him a coat. Yeah, I think that's I guess what I should have done But I is that one of the things you beat yourself up about that you didn't bring your mom a nice cold glass of Coca-Cola I was like Shirley McClain in that hospital from terms of endearment. I was like somebody get my mother the shot And I feel like you know just to to to To express yourself. I mean that's one thing I've learned I guess and I guess and also in the work that we do is Just be honest and And tell people how you feel and and I was very honest and told my mom How I felt and I I was there and that's what I feel that's very important Especially when someone's sick and if this is their last of days and they're trying and they're fighting a fight It's important that someone's there. I think human touch I know that's what I'd want And I and I would appreciate that and the hospitals don't make it easy for you And I wanted like after I came out of the hospital. I was like god, I want to go to shark tank I want to invent a you know the the the um companion bed And it's a bed that snaps on to the bed of the person who's sick And dying and you can lay next to them and just like not be in a weird contorted body holding their hand in a chair So like there is that comfort level there You can't that they know that someone's there with them to help them To get through this because I can't imagine the fear That must go through people's brains In a situation like this when you're in a hospital and there's strangers coming in and they're changing you and they're this and And and you're seeing your life kind of flash before your eyes because all of a sudden all these relatives are coming in To that you haven't seen in a while and I I I can't imagine how how fearful people must feel I think I would well the relatives also, you know the the training is like, you know The dying person as they begin to transition It seems that something kicks in and you see this natural process that are happening and But the living Oh my god, it's like What what ends up happening is that they're because we are also terrified of our own death That when we're around a dying person We begin to project our own fear of death onto the dying person, right? And so it's no longer about the dying person the dying person becomes an extra In your movie about how you're terrified of dying You know what I mean? Yeah, and that's like it's like give give them the fucking spotlight Oh, yeah, they're about to fucking merge with infinity and you're the one who's like It's okay to cry by the way, you know, I'm saying like crying in front of them do all that stuff But like it's a really in ps. I'm not talking about anybody but my own fucking self like when I my father passed actually On the 12th and when I was with him Uh, thank god for my teachers, you know, because what you did naturally what you're saying I was present I was there. I told the truth. I did this That is such good karma Sean because that's like a lot of people don't get that fucking chance You get one chance To swing at that fucking ball and most of us miss and that's okay How many people miss but and that's okay because we you did your best you weren't taught you were afraid You went into fucking denial mode. You wanted to get out of the fucking picture. You wanted to run You were angry. You didn't do whatever. It's okay, man. No one taught you but man If just to say I was with my mother And I was present And I I was there with her and I was there with her to the point where I was so looking at in the face That I thought about I wish there was a way to lay next to her in bed That is heroism of the highest level and sophistication of the highest level if you ask me I just think that's that's a that's heart Basically what it is. I wouldn't call it heroism. I just think it's called love. That's whatever hero says Every single well somebody get me a cape somebody get you a fucking cape and a trophy. No tights. I don't look good in those But yeah, that's a real hero and and and and they're in You know and that's like a gift so like you're you know, I think our parents give us like the can give us two gifts One big gift the big one Our existence and the other one The way they teach us after they die Because that's the our parents teaches to talk and they teach us to walk and they teach us to drive and they teach us to ride a bike But then they teach us about impermanence and they teach us about impermanence after they drop their body And that's when the real lesson fucking starts and that's when you become a real human and it's a it's like the most heart breaking Heart breaking thing on one level but on another level it's like being granted admission into a secret society and suddenly being shown the scrolls that Uh, a lot of people haven't had the chance to look at and your parents are showing you this and their body's not there but it's like they're still teaching you and you're like Really feeling that teaching that's the connection with them. You know and so now you're in a you know, so anyway, it's a it's a uh It's a um another thing that people can learn is what you know, when my dad was passing I called Well, he called me. It's so cool. I grew Marcus. He's been on the podcast a few times He just always calls it just the right time and so I'm sitting there. My father's sleeping. He's he's probably Less than like 13 hours away from uh transitioning and um He calls me and I'm I say to him I just don't want him to suffer I just don't want him to suffer And uh, he says to me take yourself out of it right meaning It was such a perfect thing to say and it might sound like That's a brutal thing to say to somebody. He's he's like, but it's the perfect thing to say, which is what I was doing Was really I didn't want him to suffer Not just because I don't want him to suffer because it was hurting me to see him suffer And I was trying to reduce my own pain right And and and so it's in in in what I needed to do Was not be there so that I could function As a force of like love and not a fear force. That's scared. That's fear. That's all fear I don't want him to suffer. I don't want him to hurt. I and then now I can now I can start panicking Now I can start yelling at the fucking nurse Right. I did like we all do right You know, yeah, yeah, we do I did that We that you know, because it's all love but you're like, hey, hey, what the fuck what's going on here? He's he's hurting and they're like he's dying And you know, they don't they don't say it because their nurses and especially hospice nurses They're trained to be around people who are doing the Shirley McClain thing and they're trained to to to do to be compassionate to people in that moment of like absolute panic But so take yourself out of it And then and then and then just think I'm just here for him. I'm here for her and What that ends up turning into is Oh They need chapstick You know, their lips are dry You want to put some chapstick on his lips because he hasn't been drinking water You know what I mean? It becomes like very simple matte, you know, and that That's where you know, you get back on the track when someone's passing and That would be the other thing I would add get your fucking self out of it. Not not that that's it's okay It's like get out of your own way. Yeah, you know, it's you know to put it to like in the comedy The worst thing that can happen on stage is when you start Realizing you're up on stage and they start getting that weird fucking Temporal stutter where you're a few jokes ahead or a few jokes behind you're planning What's around the next turn and then you're like that then you're gonna start stammering and then that can create a fucking feedback Loop that ends up in like a not great show The best sets at least for me are the ones where it's like You know, you're just in the moment purely and you're just uh That's how we should You know be with someone dying and and or be with someone living for that matter, you know, yeah I like that god. Why am I paying a therapist again? Because you fucking I just did I just this podcast every day. It's very healing though Duncan and you have you have that spirituality and that energy about you and Uh as I was telling your wife earlier, I just I will reiterate that in this business. I think You know to find really good Solid people I don't think it's as easy It it's hard to find people that I could really say That inspire me that I believe are good good natured good hearted And and have that light about them and and you are one of those people now if you were rich voss You would you would have I would have just ripped you an asshole. You would have gone through that And ended it with and you're not one of them. Yeah. Yeah That's true, and you're not one of them It's hilarious. You know what he said to me Rich boss, you know, many, you know, if you're a comedian you have been insulted by many many comedians Oh, yeah, you've been insulted by comedians in varying at varying levels of creativity in varying levels of like absolute perfectly sadistic Darts aimed exactly at the center of your heart and what rich boss did to me was like when I this is when I was dating Natasha Legerro and you know, she's fucking like kicking ass and like just fucking Natasha, you know, like I'm do I'm like No, it's just it's like the part of the process where you're like, well, maybe I'll just start working at a fucking gas station or something like uh So we go to eat with rich boss and body McFarland and like, you know, like natural I'm just nervous around them and like I was nervous. I used to be nervous. You know, I was nervous around you You guys like when you're around like a really fucking Funny fucking like you know, it was around me. Come on. Yeah. Okay. You're self deprecating. My tits aren't that big You're self deprecating. That's a lot of people are and and that's a another comedic trait and it's cool. But but uh um Come on so and I can remember like Uh, so there are there's that extra little bit of like fuck man. I mean, this is a kind of it's like a real comic and like I don't even fucking know. I said, oh, no, man. I should be fucking That's probably a mistake and Natasha's for doing great and like what I was already insecure And I so we have this dinner with them and I don't remember what the fuck I said But I'm sure it was stupid because I was probably trying to impress Them and like so then as we're walking to the car Rich having identified my just absolute insecurity He says hey Duncan I'm like we're getting in the car. It's the perfect timing. He goes hey Duncan, you know where I've heard of you And I like oh, he's heard of me. I'm like where he goes nowhere He ended Hope you enjoyed this day It hurt so bad it felt so good Fuck he thinks I'm a comedian. You know what I mean? It must mean he thinks I'm a comedian Yeah, he's got anointed most fucking comedians will not like have learned. I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe he does it to this day I don't know but anyway, Sean the the to get back to to what we were talking about before we're both in grief land right now and Um, are they gonna make that movie grief land They should stop singing on cars and la freeways. Yeah, they should man they should because it's like it's a special place to be and And it's like and as a comedian to find yourself suddenly in the land of grief And then like to like know when you get on stage That in the audience for sure Is at least one or two people Who have experienced recent loss and certainly a lot of people who have experienced loss and and certainly some percentage of people Who are desperately trying to avoid Thinking about that, right? And yet you've been trained as a comedian to tell the truth And you've been trained trained to like transform that truth into something funny And you want to get on stage and not do the hacky fucking thing which god knows I'm fucking guilty of which is to get up there and be like you're all gonna die You know go like blizzard king on them, you know Shut the fuck up. You're not billyx. Get the fuck off Get the fuck out of here. You're fucked. You think you are no shit. We're all gonna die edgelord. No shit, motherfucker Boy, I'm guilty of that. That's lazy, you know, but to figure out a way to alchemically convert Death Into comedy. How's that working out for you? You know at I It really has kind of it it's fueled me to to be better Just to try and stand out I feel like You know, I I deal with it every day and then when I'm on stage I think those are those moments where it's the one part of the day Maybe you aren't dealing with the grief because you've got a job Ahead in front of you and that job is the audience And you've got to dance like a monkey to entertain them and I think It's there's it's such a rewarding sensation When for those moments you can just step back and be like hey I can get through my day and I can make other people happy and You can kind of go home and then maybe you go back to thinking about Things that have happened processing it, but I feel like a part like from from me I feel like now I've got some forces Behind me and I can see that happening and it's not just the force of someone As wonderful and supportive as my mother It's the forces of mitzi shore who own the comedy store. I mean I visited her two days before she passed and It just and it was kind of right after my mom passed away. So it was watching two dynamic jewish women in my life that were like my tour to force like deteriorate and that was that was hard That was hard for me, but I knew that they At some point they were gonna come full circle and surround me and I and I do feel that you feel mitzi with you I bet mitzi. There's no doubt. You know also feels mitzi with her vicki barbelak who's about to take all of agt I know and and someone told her. Hey, you know some medium person one of them said do you have a mitzi? Do you know a mitzi? And she's around you whatever the case is. I knew it and when I went to visit mitzi I told her I was I talked to her. I I talked to her for about an hour. I told her everything I was feeling Well, she loved you shan. I loved her. I loved her. I told her how much I love her I told her everything she'd done for me and without her I would be I would not be anywhere she Is will always be an inspiration to me and She was my biggest supporter after my mother Like she didn't birth me, but she might as well have I mean I do feel like I lost two mothers this year, but two Man boy how strong of women they were and they never got to meet each other Which makes me crazy until now and now I think they have joined forces and I I can feel them standing behind me because Things are changing and things are a little bit different and I can see the energy changing and I can see You know my career moving in a in a different pace that I had I have not seen before Well, I mean you just put the special out and you you this is like I somehow missed that Wow, I didn't connect that your mom and mitzi Wow, man that is Wow I mean if folks those of you listening maybe not familiar the comedy store uh mitzi shore was uh I don't know how to put it. She was some kind of like I mean that thing we were talking about earlier shaktipa Yeah, like she had the jiu-jitsu on the coke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She was very powerful and um, she could see Inside of peak certain people this thing and once she saw it You know, she would like She would just dedicate herself to like bringing it out bringing it out. She she was like Loved shawnt. She loved you shawnt like she you know because I was the talent coordinator there and I remember that she you like I loved her you Uh like eddie griffin. They were like, you know, there's just a few comics that she was like You know Her soul was like connected to their soul. It was powerful and it was an incredible thing to watch Yeah, and um So how the fuck do you edit? A comp did you record the comedy special during this? year No, it was he it was about a year and a half ago. Okay, so it was before all this happened So you'd already edited it before I had edited it Um, and it just was in distribution with the company and they were working all the paper everything out So it was kind of on Everything had been done. My mother actually opens my comedy special Um, and she I kind of like I kind of had put together An opening like larry david type of scene where I'm in the dressing room And uh, which we did shoot at the comedy store In the back main room even though I shot my special at a theater downtown Yeah, but we shot it there because it was too hectic that day But about like two months later we we shot that scene with my mom and I have my mom is you know, it just To see to see her it's like memorializes her. I mean she now lives in infamy because my mother was a very funny woman And now everyone can can can see that Wow, man. Yeah And when you were shooting it with her, did you have any idea that there was this thing and Wow No, she had a walker and she was having problems with her back and her knees and she was trying to get this big back surgery You know in her 70s, which was really risky already and we were like, you know her body was kind of deteriorating for some reason she would You know, she really was set in the mind like my mom was in a funny beautiful vain woman And she was like, I'm not gonna be in a wheelchair. And so I don't know why I made her harvey fire steam just now, but But you know she We were gonna get this surgery and she was set on that. So no, I did not know That something was happening Was it was happening then? Wow, see this is like the other thing. I'm so glad that you're Fine coming out and staying in it because it's like I'm you know where I'm at with it right now is like You know There's like some stuff that I just I'm I guess I'm just afraid to say I feel weird saying but this idea of like when they pass When they drop their bodies Your life gets Brighter like it's like something gets added and and to it and it does and it's like I don't just mean like You know like the fact that suddenly like You you're you're getting a firsthand lesson and one of the most important Things you can learn here, which is everything is impermanent That happens, but I'm talking about it Metaphysically feels like somebody is on the other side of the fucking stage Work in the fucking working the ropes and the police that wasn't there. I mean, I would hate to think that my mom The people just go to a place and pass away. I like to believe that You know, I've had a lot of friends pass away early I I have I've had my share of surprises and shocks through my life more than I ever wanted to see and not just relatives like close young friends, so um You I want to believe and I have been a believer that there is an afterlife that there are people that there are spirits and hopefully that that's what surrounds me because I'll always carry my mom lives within side me I mean, she's not physically here, which is that's the hard part to handle there's so many things I want to share with her and You know, I I I do hope that she's she is her energy's here the uh This is this is something i'm realizing because like I've got this boy on the way and like we've been doing it, you know, we did some ultrasounds and um uh And you know some one of my very dear friends like, you know, I maybe listen to the podcast I'll know he's like, you know careful with ultrasounds and like Just everyone knows like it's a it's a the place we're going to is a very sophisticated place it's not like, you know, the some some people get in trouble because That you can go to these private ones where maybe the ultrasound machines are a little Stronger than they need to be and like if the brain is developing apparently. I don't know. Anyway, the point is it's cool, but So here you are looking at your baby, you know, and now with technology you can see the baby like very clearly and All the love inside of me is just pouring out looking at this boy and like, you know, my you know, I'll I'll put my head against there And stomach and I'll like talk to the boy and I'll like sing to him and I'll say I'm so glad you're coming. I'm so glad um And lately what I've been thinking is that's exactly what's happening with those who have passed Is we are in the womb of time and the ones that loved us are just outside the womb of time In eternity and they're looking in at us here in this very transitory moment as we move through the material Universe and they sing to us and they like talk to us and the way they talk to us Is through synchronicities through dreams Through just this sense of like because I know my I know He can hear my voice unfortunately My voice is pretty bad But like I know he can hear my voice and I know that he can feel feel me Like I know he can and I think in that feeling that we have with our our parents It's so interesting in the sense that there is an Undeniable presence and not just that there are these things that begin to happen that are just not Normal and they're not not normal in a good way there and and and so yeah, I don't I I don't just believe it like it's it's you know They are here and our Denial of that Either because we've become terrified of that realization or because It's easier to believe that there is an extinction of the identity upon the expiration of the body or whatever Uh, I think Cuts us off from a very important data stream a very important um I don't know. This is the reason we pray to the ancestors. This is the reason that you know, I think it cuts you off from growing Yes Yeah you just Gotta have an open mind and and embrace that there could be and that I'm I'm gonna go with that I think that they they do that the that mitzi and my mother and The people that I love are are with me because if not, I mean what I gotta What do I gotta think like oh, is it practical to be like you die? You become and you go into the sand and you go and nothing happens I don't believe that how do you explain? Really good people like the best people dying young and I've seen the most incredible people be taken out And then the shit just hanging out live until they're god knows how old and I just feel like that's We need we need something good in the spirit world and that's what's Hopefully on that side. Yeah. Well, I mean we and it's the the I think being scientific about it being scientifically artistic about it in the sense that If the hypothesis is that at this very moment We are in time. We are in an infinite being experiencing time in the form of matter and that All the people who've dropped their bodies That were with us are here because they're outside of time. They might decide to like I think of it in terms of like, um Dolphins Come up for air go down into the sea and I think we come up for air Only the way we come up for air is we come up for time And we the way we come up for time is by manifesting a material body in this dimension and then we sort of take a big inhalation of Existence and then we go back down under and that's what death is and so that we don't really like separate from each other We're like a pod they call it a soul pod, but so if that's the hypothesis And you're beginning to get these hits these senses of like, oh, shit. I think my mom is actually right here I think my dad is actually right here And then can we cultivate that in other words? What happens if instead of just like Thinking whoa, that was weird And then what would happen like if you I don't know made like a puja table. Do you know about that? No So a puja table is like you get a little part of your house And you get some candles and you put on on it like a picture of your mom people that you've lost And it doesn't just have to be built people are dead a little sanctuary a sanctuary Yeah, and then you a shrine a shrine. Yeah, and then you sit in front of that Every day And you remember them And then see what happens. I like that. Yeah, it's a fun thing to do the experiment and just see what happens I do I do have a big picture of my mom In my living room and I stopped to Acknowledge her and talk, you know, I'll talk and be like, hey, you know, I'll say something But I think that's probably it's a very um That's a I think that's a pleasant way to go about celebrating Fuck yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, right now what we do is we put up this fucking Concrete block and a goddamn golf course. Yeah, you know what I mean? We go over there and throw flowers in front of it and it's like, oh, yeah, that's where they are At the golf course that's filled with corpses. Hell. No, it's like Sean. It's you know, anyway, I am So excited for you and I'm so excited for what is in store for you and to like see this wonderful special and to know that it is like happening You know in in in in this very magical time in your life this mystical time It's like no accident that all these things are converging, you know Wow, man, that is so fucking intense. It's like in the midst of these like monumental transformations Suddenly this incredible special pops into the world Congratulations, that's fucking cool. Thank you Duncan. It's funny when you're working on something for so long You're like, well, when when does this come to light at the timing of how this is is kind of You know was kind of surprising because I thought, you know, my mom would be around to see because she was like When's it coming out? I want to see my you know, she wanted my mom liked a little soft shoe herself She was hilarious that way, but I'm very I'm very grateful and I'm grateful for all the support people like yourselves who I know it's uh, it's been hard for you too this year and I just I I think about that and I'm always here to support people and Listen, I think that's like another thing about when someone passes. It's like you just hold it inside You don't talk about it again. I think that'll just each you alive and I I know women in general probably are better at talking about Loss and whatnot because we like to communicate a lot more than men might want to hold it inside and their feelings and process and it's it's it's all uh You know, it's I guess it's just part of adulting and adulting. Yeah, that's so funny adulting is another word for dying It's like the realities were all dying and it's like the yeah It's like just you know and everyone's just fucking scared of it And then it's like when you the moment you like really come to terms with it and you start living in the land of truth It's like, oh my god, it's it's magical here It's beautiful here and to say that out loud and be like my god There's a celebration because my father died In a just the way he wanted to die and there's a celebration because your mother like she she died In a way where you were supporting her and there was this deep connection It's just like to say that out loud and like in the west. It's like god. No, man We got to fucking wear black and fucking the think of funeral music You know once I was right Once I was riding around with a mortician. That's my theme music get out of my head funeral music Oregon I was riding It's like vampire music it's like the music we play for death is Yeah, it's halloween music. It's like why are we playing this fucking sad ass fucking music for something that is like a graduation This is a graduation from a class in the material universe and everybody's fucking Wearing black and playing organs and there's fucking candles flickering in the darkness and it's like this is insanity it's like this is a graduation ceremony and I think that It's really beautiful to see you throwing your hat up in the form of this like Wonderful comedy special that you put up. It's really fucking cool. Thank you Duncan. Where can people see it? Well, you can catch my comedy special. It's called stretch it out And you can find it on amazon itunes on demand xbox if you're like 12 year old boy How dare you or my husband?

And this is the Dung and Trussell Family Hour podcast. If you've decided to continue listening, which clearly you have, if my voice is raining into your inner ear, I thank you for that. Thank you for listening to this podcast. And if this is your first time listening, welcome aboard this pulsating jellyfish rainbow colored super ship, which is traveling in the direction of an invisible sun that our entire species is about to be devoured by in some form or fashion. These scientists at their particle accelerators, you all read about this, that they have discovered something to do with muons. And I'm not gonna pretend to know what a muon is. I mean, when I go on Reddit and read about this stuff, I have to look not just for the dumb down stuff. I've got to look for the dumb down, dumb down, dumb down stuff. And somewhere in there, I'll get some kind of understanding of what's happening. The best explanation that I found from a clearly mildly frustrated intelligent person was, they have found something that doesn't match the rules. And so they might have to come up with new rules. That's like the super dumb down version of what's going on over there. With the particle accelerator where they're investigating muons. But that's all daddy needs to extrapolate from that possibility, that we are clearly about to break through this universe into another universe, which I think based on my own research via the ketamine particle accelerator, that that universe is filled with all kinds of wild, beautiful and ridiculous creatures that are very eager to come flooding into this particular realm, because they think we need some cheering up. Now, when it happens, and it is gonna happen, I mean, if you really just spend any amount of time thinking about it, it's gonna happen. And just follow me here. Don't pull your earbuds out and throw them into the ground. Listen, it's gonna happen. Here's why it's gonna happen. Number one, let's face it. Part of the universe are definitely going to die. There's just no way around that. I'm not trying to do that. You're gonna die, man. But you know you're gonna die. And everything that you've come to understand is you, if you're somebody who thinks that your arms and your legs and your hair and your boobs and your nips and your, if you're me, your magnificent penis is you. Yeah, then that's, you're probably done. You're gonna be in trouble when that stops working. And then, but you're still around. And you're having to deal with being disembodied, sentience, and you're gonna be all confused. And maybe there'll be some, like, what the fucks? This wasn't in the Carl Sagan thing. David Attenborough never talked about this. And then you're gonna get attacked by hyper-dimensional entities. And you're gonna freak out. And you're gonna gallop through some weird realm until finally you come to some place where you see all these people humping. And then you're gonna get turned on. And you'll probably reach down to start pleasuring yourself. You're like, what the fuck? I don't have, I don't have a body. And then you're gonna go floating into one of those people humping. And those are gonna be your parents. And that, and then you'll be reincarnated. Again, that's gonna happen to you. And so you're definitely gonna contact extra-dimensional entities via your own extinction as an individual. If that doesn't happen before this other stuff happens, and probably based on the whorfinkal Galvox analysis of my listeners that was recently done by the Prexinger Institute, 93.7% of you are regularly vaping DMT. So you're encountering these entities anyway. And this probably doesn't seem like a real news flash to you because they've been explaining their plans and you know what's coming. But if you're that other 7.9536% of my audience, then you might not be aware of the fact that our society, our culture and everything is getting convicted and hailed into a incredibly harmonic and complex extra reality. And as that happens and we head on down the wild river of time, we're all experiencing a kind of beautiful acceleration. We're having those moments of like, wow, time's really flying by, but it's not just that. It's that as we zip towards whatever this thing is all around us, we're seeing these wild global seismic culture quakes, culturequakes.com. Yeah, you know, like the whole Trump thing was a culture quake. World War II, a culture quake. The pandemic, it's a culture quake, man. And that's to be expected as we get closer and closer towards this thing. But it's not just like shitty things happening. It's also, we can expect a kind of cascade of wild discoveries and technologies. You know, like the, you know, you've got former, the former head of the CIA talking about how his aircraft of plane he was in just froze midair. Look it up, why would you believe me after what I just said, but look it up. I mean, it's the guy who used to run the CIA saying, yeah, once I was in an airplane and it just, or a friend of mine was in an airplane who I trust. And he said that it just froze in the air, just stop moving. I don't know what that is. Or look up the high level government officials saying, we don't know what these fucking weird drone things are that have been swarming our ships. We don't know what they are. It's just they're not functioning according to the way we understand physics. That should be enough to tell you that some weird shit is going on behind the scenes. And the more that that happens, the more behind the scenes stuff happens, it leaks into the, in front of the scenes stuff via various secret channels. I know, I know what you're thinking. What happened, Trussell? What is this, fucking info wars? No, it's culture quakes with detrust. And, you know, let's face it, there's a fascinating relationship that the super privilege and wealthy have with the artists of the world, you know, like all the zillionaires and billionaires, no matter how much access they have to stuff, they can't be Stanley Kubrick, can they? They can't be Stanley Kubrick, can they? They can't be Stephen King or Stephen Spielberg. They can't be Paul Simon. You know, they can't, but you know what they can do? They can pay those people lots of money to come and hang out with them and talk to their kids. And they do that. Why wouldn't you? If you were, if I were a billionaire, you better believe I'd be like having Paul Simon come and like sing my child to sleep. I don't, how much do you want, Mr. Simon? 100 million? Yeah, no problem. I make that in five hours. Anyway, the point is like, as the, this is a, by the way, a theory, I'm just guessing. You know, as above so below, you can extrapolate from your own experience things that you haven't yet come into contact with. But, you know, I know comedians who have been flown to beautiful places to do shows by very wealthy people. That happens. And I know they don't just come in and do the show. They, they hang out. And, you know, if you're the other quality of human beings is that we love to blab. You know, we love to like, like see people's eyes get big by disclosing to them some wild information. And so this is what I'm saying. Like when the weird backstage stuff is going on, it trickles in to the front stage. Because let's face it, you can't keep your mouth shut if you're a person. At least if you're me. I don't care what your security clearance is. If you walked into some chamber in the CIA and saw some glowing, blobby, multi eyeball, telepathic, super intelligent thing. And it was like, hey, how are you? I'm from Lorvel. It's the universe just next to yours. Do you want to waterloo? You're eventually going to tell somebody. Like there's no way you're not going to tell someone in your family. You're going to tell somebody. And probably after you've had a couple of like Kweyludes created by your in mansion pharmacist and Paul Simon just serenaded your child to sleep because you paid him a hundred million dollars and you're having a cocktail with him and asking him what his inspiration for me and Julio down by the schoolyard was. And he tells you, you're also going to be like, you know, I saw this glowing or ball big multi eyeball thing that knew my name and like sparkling water under the CIA. Don't tell anybody, please. We monitor everything you do. If you tell anybody, we're definitely going to, we're dead. But I just thought you'd like to know that. And then, you know, Paul Simon flies, gets flown back home and he's like trying to process the information. And then the next thing you know, you get like a new Paul Simon song that happens to have in it a, I don't know, a lyric like this. Single parent, baby dreams and poor ladies, dirty jeans. Global clashes, diaper rashes. There's another universe right next to you. And that universe is breaking through. And that's how I think it happens. Little dribulits and rivulets and drools and perspirations from the hidden world come oozing into our reality via art. Because most artists, I don't think they can keep their mouth shut probably. That would be my guess. I don't know. I have not been fortunate enough. Thus far to make contact with me. Powerful anything that would, that told me secrets. Sorry, got some water loose stuck in my throat. What a podcast we have for you today. My dear friend, the composer that created so much of the beautiful music on the Midnight Gospel. Joe Wong is here with us. We're going to jump right into it. But first, this, a tremendous thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH and for creating an incredible tool that empowers millions of dreamers, makers and doers by providing them with everything they need to bring their creative ideas to life. In the old days, if it was late at night and you were super high and had an idea for a website to create, to freak out one of your friends, you would have to learn HTML and by the time you vaguely understood how to do a banner, you were exhausted and you'd fall asleep and wake up and think, ah, fuck it, I'm not going to make that website. But now, thanks to Squarespace, this can happen instantaneously. You can make a website in seconds from buying the domain name. And by the way, pirateorgie.com is available. Just think about that. You don't just get a podcast when you download the DTFH, you get potential access to a completely new world where maybe you're the billionaire because pirateorgie.com could easily be the next Amazon. It could be an edgy video game review site. It could be what it sounds like, a VR pornography site with pirate-themed humping. It could be some kind of critique of modern day capitalism that traces its roots back to the early pirates of early American history. Whatever you want to manifest on the sweet speckled skin of the worldwide web, you can easily do it with Squarespace. They have everything you need. I could go on and on about their powerful analytics, the ability they give you to create beautiful email campaigns, the fact that I have a friend who sells their socks online and makes money from it. But I would just like to direct you to one of the most beautiful, probably the most beautiful website to ever exist on the internet, that's dunkintrussell.com, the very website that you might have gone to to download. This podcast was created using Squarespace. I've never had a problem with them. They're wonderful.

Thank you, Squarespace. We're back, my beautiful babies. Welcome back from that commercial. Listen, if you don't like commercials on the DTFH, it doesn't hurt my feelings. I understand. You don't want to be reminded that we exist in a marketplace economy where we have to trade certain things for other certain things so that we can get other things. I understand. And that is why if you head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH, you will be delighted to discover that there are not only commercial free episodes of this podcast, but if you subscribe to one of the glorious video tiers, you will have access to weekly hangouts with your brand new family, the DTFH family. We've got a weekly meditation. Happens every Monday, journey into boredom. It's growing every week. And we also have a family gathering that happens every Friday. And I would love to see you there. And we have a thriving, vibrant, powerful community at Discord. You'll have access to all of these things by subscribing to us over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH, commercial free episodes, extra content. And you know what? Again, if you go and look at all these things that have been happening to people who aren't subscribed to the Patreon, some of them are just mildly annoying. Some of them pretty devastating, at least from, like if I was attacked, say, by a raccoon, had to get rabies shots. You know, it wouldn't be the end of my life or anything, but I think it would change my relationship with what is currently in my subjective opinion, one of the cutest dying animals that ever toodled in a dumpster. So I don't want that to happen to you. And I'm not saying that folks who don't subscribe to the Patreon are having weird accidents, because then I would be culpable. And one of my attorneys said, just to make sure you just say, yeah, I don't even, there's no, it's an, obviously, come on, like how would I even have control over animals? It would imply that my grandfather had left my mom some kind of weird radio transmitter thing that he was given because of the work he did in World War II that lets you dial into the consciousness of animals at the global level and program them to do your bidding. When I don't have that, that would be nuts. My dear darlings, today's guest is a brilliant musician. He's the reason the Midnight Gospel sounds so beautiful. He helped me produce some of the songs that you heard at the end, credits of the Midnight Gospel. But not only that, he mentored me during the time that we were working on the show and really was like completely open with the process of making music for TV. And I've carried a lot of the stuff he taught me into this podcast and into other projects that I'm working on and not only that, he is a wonderful friend of mine and a super cool human being. If you're a huge fan of music, then you must listen to his podcast, The Trap Set. It's so good and he has these amazing conversations with super famous prolific and brilliant musicians, all the links you need to find, Joe Wong will be at duckatrustle.com, but definitely subscribe to his podcast. And now my dear friends, welcome back to the DTFH, Joe Wong. [""Welcome Back to the DTFH""] [""Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake and glory to be blue, welcome to you."" It's the duckatrustle thing. Joe, welcome back to the DTFH. I feel like I never left. I wanna start off by just diving into the deepest waters possible and ask you a question that I think is the question of the day. Are you embarrassed that you're a Peloton owner? No, I'm not, but that's because I also know that you are a Peloton owner. So in this moment, I know I'm communicating with a fellow yuppie. Do you feel though like, and we don't even have to put this in the podcast, but do you feel like there's a few problems that I have right now as a Peloton owner. Number one, how much I love it and how addicted to it I've become and how trauma bonded I've become with some of the instructors. But number two, just this general sense of like, is this what I've become? Someone in their underwear at 5 a.m., sweating on their Peloton. Is that who you've become or is it who you've always been? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. You know what? Let's think about other kind of exercise fads that you've tried over the years. What else have you done? Have you bought a piece of exercise equipment before? No, not that I can recall. I mean, I've, you know, I like, I like most people have bought like a kettlebell that, you know, just lays out in the rain and you just kind of look at it. Nothing happens or a, you know, running shoes, which I've used here and there, but nothing is like, nothing like a pellet, nothing like a expensive fucking fad bit of workout gear. But I remember when you got your Mogue One and I feel like the excitement around that was similar to the excitement around the Peloton because you called me when you got the Peloton. And I think spending that kind of money is like committing to some sort of transformative journey. It's, it combines capitalism and mysticism. You know, that's, that's an interesting, you know, that's an interesting point that I think a lot of people take issue with whenever that happens is because everyone's fine when mysticism is not somehow wrapped up in the, you know, in capitalism or the marketplace, the moment the two meet, you know, lots of people think that that's a bad sign, which seems insane and limiting to me. Yeah, I suppose if it's exploitative or not, or if it dilutes the message, or if the mysticism is being used as bait to bring you into something that's primarily nefarious. But I have a question. Was Ramdas a capitalist? Yeah, I think it would be fair to say that he, I mean, he was a capitalist in the sense that he was charging money for tickets, you know, his shows weren't for free. And they were in like Hawaii, the retreats that you went to. Yeah, but even before the retreats, I mean, he was part of this loosely associated group of traveling spiritual teachers that became celebrities, you know, like Alan Watts, Chogyam Trumpa, you know, there was, there's so many of them that started, you know, for lack of a better word, touring on the spiritual retreat circuit, you know, doing classes at Esalen and doing retreats in Hawaii or wherever, I mean, it's a, he was part of a, I mean, of an industry. I think it would be fair to call it an industry, which is, I think, even with the pandemic is still doing pretty great. But yeah, I mean, I think he was unapologetically in the marketplace, like he, and his teachings were designed for people in the West. So there was an acknowledgement of that level or whatever you want to call it that we're all in, which is like, you're not photosynthetic, you got to figure out a way to survive and to sustain yourself in this, in the place that we're at right now. But if we were photosynthetic, we'd probably find a way to charge for sunlight. Yeah, well, better grades of sunlight, probably. Organic sun. Yeah, yeah, or, you know, probably like methods of inhaling more light to become more energetic or something like that. You know, this is- Cruelty free sunbeams. God, how terrible would it be if we found out that at the center of the sun was this immortal sheep, like a beautiful sheep. A burning sheep, yeah. That's just on fire forever and is purely innocent. And all of our light comes from abject infinite suffering. That would be pretty fucking rotten. I mean, what's your take on capitalism? I mean, how do you feel about the situation that we all find ourselves in? Do you get squeamish about making money? I mean, that's, for me, it's like, you know, I think that's part of the Peloton embarrassment is, you know, they're fucking expensive and talking about it feels like almost braggy or something, but because they marketed themselves in an embarrassing way, I think most people, me included, before I had a Peloton, when I looked at the commercials, would roll my eyes and be like, God, look at that. Oh, and your fucking high rise with your fucking Peloton, congratulations. Right, and what are you paying for? You're paying to be part of this kind of exclusive social network. That's what you're paying for. I mean, you can find a rusty used bike for $5 at the Salvation Army and if the tires are flat, that's even a better workout. I mean, you don't need this piece of equipment to get in shape. You don't need any equipment to get in shape. You're paying so that, A, you feel obligated to make use of that piece of equipment that you spent the money on. It's like committing through spending. And then you're part of this social network. And I would say the one thing I do find embarrassing about it is all the pseudoscience that people talk about when you're on the ride. I mean, like the new catchphrase is lactic acid. It's like, well, we're gonna increase your lactic acid threshold today. Not Cody Rigsby. That's my number one trainer. He doesn't talk about lactic acid. But he, but like, cause I've, you know, you go through all the different trainers. Right. You know, and some of them you get, and I get enraged with, I hate them. And some of them you're just like, what the fuck? This is, you're so boring. You figure out the ones you like, I guess. But I have yet to get it with a lactic acid professor. I almost exclusively work with this woman named Robin. She's kind of the head trainer, I believe. And she, she recently had a baby, but she talks about increasing your VO2 max and your lactic acid threshold. And, you know, she has a whole kind of mythology around her rides. Like I only ride with royalty. That makes me squeamish when, cause I'm not into the, I'm, you know, capitalism is one thing. What does that mean? Well, she's like, I only want to ride with kings and queens. Like she's trying to empower people, but I have an adverse reaction to monarchy illusions. That's the weirdest shit I ever heard. I, she, but she's using like the modern, like a confident being or people who have like, it's like the modern way of saying that you're like a go-getter or something like that. She doesn't want to literally like ride with old withered, like fucked up people in a long line of exploitive mercenary types. Man, the more of to talk about this, the more embarrassed I am to have one of these things. That's what I'm talking about, man. I mean, this is like, I only, first of all, I'm not blaming you, but you are, I think I didn't have a Peloton, did I? I didn't have a Peloton when you were talking about how cool they are. You were telling me you had a Peloton. See, this is, this is the reason I'm interrogating you in this, I'm not trying to embarrass you. Oh, it's because we were talking about it when we were playing video games online together. Yes. Yes. And maybe I had already had one, but I wasn't using it, but your health kick is contagious. It has jumped into my life because like, and this happens, this is why it's, this, that's one of the things Ramdas would say is we work on ourselves so we could help the people around us. So the best thing you could do for the people around you is to quote, work on yourself. And so when a friend starts doing something like regularly, like regular exercise, but more than just that, like you, you got into it for some reason, it like, it can, it's contagious, you know, like, and so I would like just randomly think, fucking Wong's on his Peloton, what am I doing? It's the pandemic, Joe's running. Yeah, see, my latest thing, I haven't been writing that thing much lately, but it's really my girlfriend who's a huge fan of it and rides it almost every day. So I feel like it was certainly a purchase that paid for itself in the sense that we don't have to pay gym memberships and that would have been expensive during a time when we couldn't even use them. My point is, I guess you don't need to go to the gym either. So my point wasn't like fucking glossy capitalist, hyper manipulative, super addictive workout technologies. My point was how cool it is when one of your friends starts getting healthy, like, you know, like the, cause we're all connected in this real way. And so that's all, just because, you know, you got it or have gotten into this, it's once again, somehow I find myself addicted to exercise, which for me, it's like when it happens, those are my favorite times of my life cause I feel so much better. But how are you feeling now that you've been training for marathons? I'm feeling good. I actually got up past the 20 mile threshold and then the marathon that I had been training for got canceled. So now I'm doing other stuff, like shorter runs and lifting some weights and things like that because I signed up for a marathon that's not for several months, which hopefully will proceed. And then I'll start ramping up the mileage again in a couple of months from now. Well, you know- This is gonna be the most boring podcast that anyone's ever heard. No, cause wait for that. I've got this planned out, my friend. Wait for the next question. The next question is where hopefully the many eye rolls from the listeners and people who maybe this is the first time they listen to the podcast and are feeling this dreadful sense of like, what the fuck is this horror? I think they'll like this next question, which is, if you had to describe the stereotype of the genius or prolific artist, in other words, like the most cliche stereotype of that being, how would you describe it? Well, I've thought about that a fair amount because I've encountered people that have dispelled that myth, but I would say that the most prominent myth is that of the troubled, tortured genius who's so empathetic that they can understand the world on a level that few can and make a statement that is at once like innately unique, but also universal. And I've actually met some people that are joyful geniuses. They're not really tortured. They might be on a completely different wavelength than some of the rest of us or the most people. And they certainly have that sense of empathy where they can understand people or things in a unique way, but they are not actually tortured. And that was mind blowing when I first started encountering people like that because I actually think other people I've encountered in my life who may have been geniuses or close to it played into that stereotype. It almost like informed their relationship with self. Like their heroes were beat poets or something or whatever you name it or people, artists that cut off their body parts. Right. See, this to me, I think is really an important thing to talk about because I feel like a lot of people are hurting themselves unnecessarily by imitating an almost non-existent entity, which is the not just tortured genius, but tortured artist, the wild, manic depressive, drug-addled, self-harming, sex-addicted lunatic who somehow in between hangovers is producing some of the most incredible music or paintings or stories ever read. But when they're not writing or making music or painting, you know, they're just on some irritating manic freak out where they're falling on the ground, pissing themselves, you know, pulling their clothes off in the park, throwing rocks at like, I don't know if they're throwing rocks at people, but kind of turning them into like more of a chimpanzee character. But you know what I'm saying? That I feel like this, anytime you run into someone who's really putting on that particular show, don't you get a little suspicious that I'd like to see what kind of stuff you're making? Right. You know what I mean? Because it's like, to me, whenever I've run into like people like you or people who I would consider to be brilliant artists, they are living a relatively like disciplined life. You know, their attitude towards creation isn't like, you know, some like that doc, what's his face and back to the future, that thing with the- Well, that's an interesting archetype there, the doc Brown archetype, because he comes from a wealthy family and he squanders all of the family's resources on his inventions until finally one of them works. And I think that that coincides with the, you know, the troubled genius model that at least the manifestation of it from the 20th century, lots of these people, whether they were rock stars or poets came from privileged backgrounds and they were playing at being a vagrant for a little while. And then that short period of doing heroin or whatever it was, came to define their work even though they were just, you know, like you said, living disciplined, relatively sober lives.

Go to expressvpn.com slash Duncan to get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free. That's expressvpn.com slash Duncan. Thank you, ExpressVPN. There's a lot of damage that these people have caused with their marketing campaigns because everybody- It's sexier, right? Like, as far as if you're running a record company, you wanna play up the fact that Keith Richards tried heroin rather than that Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics. Did Mick Jagger go to the London School of Economics? Yeah. Oh my God, that's fucking hilarious. Yeah, see, you don't wanna have him posing on the cover with a calculator, right? Oh my God, that's so incredible. Yeah, yeah, and because of that, because, you know, making stuff like the whole process, my experience with it has been, there's some pretty mundane, awful parts of making stuff that I would view as very similar to, you know, just basic, like, I don't know, like, you know, digging like yard work or something, like mowing the lawn or something, you know, that it takes a kind of like, well, you've gotta do it and you gotta push a lawn mower and it's gonna be nice, maybe, maybe not, but it's just, you're gonna have to keep doing it and you're gonna have to do it in this sort of geometric way or your yard's gonna look like shit and it's really not that big a deal what you're doing, you're just mowing a lawn. And a lot of it is like that. You know, there's excited moments where like, oh my God, that's the idea I had, but even better, but those excited moments are usually, for me, followed by like, dialing that in and then editing and then getting bored with it, practicing and then it takes forever and there's nothing that exciting about it. And I don't think people, I think people who are seeing the Mick Jagger, you know, humping a fucking albatross or whatever crazy shit they legendary, I don't know if he've humped an albatross, you know, Ozzy Osbourne's biting the head off a bat, Led Zeppelins like fisting a fucking seal at the beach or whatever, you know? Yeah, the mud shark. Yeah, you know what, I was talking to Buzz, the singer of the Melvins about this and he likens the songwriting process to panning for gold, which I think is a great metaphor. Other people say fishing. I know you think about ideas a lot, like what's an idea before, you know, before it's an idea. So in that sense, I think of it kind of like, you know, being a radio receiver, right? And all you can do is kind of build your antenna a little bit higher and make sure that it's clean and make sure that you're doing what you can on your end to receive the idea. Yeah. But yeah, all that stuff is just mundane. It's mundane, but because of your instruction, you know, I have been able to make to like catch more fish because I now have, I mean, I actually had to pay someone to come and set my shit up so that I could, so it just works. Yeah. Also, I think that like this kind of real revelatory information regarding the creative process is really important for people because it's just, you know, I'm just sick of it, man. You run into people who are like, because it's easier to be crazy than it is to make something good. You know what I mean? It's easier to be on some wild manic tangent, fucking yourself up over and over again, pretending that in that self-destruction, some unique thing is emerging when then to like actually sit down and like work, which usually means some kind of, I mean, I don't necessarily work completely sober, you know what I mean? But, you know, it means generally like you're gonna have to take care of your body. You need to be healthy enough to work long periods and not get tired and freaked out, right? Like that, is that why you're exercising now? Is that what has gotten you into this workout routine? That and self-loathing. I know, you know what? In our conversations, I've been catching some of that from you. Yeah, I mean, that's deep inside, but yeah, so I could just, that could manifest in unhealthy ways too, and I could play into this tortured trope, but I don't think it would make sense for who I am. No, well, no, I don't think, I mean, yeah, well, I mean, yeah, because the thing is you've gotta, when you're getting jobs, I'm sure the last thing, someone who's making a TV show wants, is someone stinky with like holes in their shirts, covered in like dried Parmesan cheese and old marijuana crumbs, you know? That's not who you want to make something for you. Yeah, although it is kind of like the idea of someone who does function that way, but they're so brilliant that people have to put up with it, is kind of a, you know, it's still a trope that finds its place in Hollywood. I'll just say, there's plenty of people that are famous in Hollywood for being self-destructive, and if they're also really good at their job, then that makes their, it creates this mystique around them that's tolerated. Yeah, you're right. I mean, you know what, some of the people we mentioned when we talked shit for about two hours that we had to cut out, one thing they all have in common though, is they work their fucking asses off. That's the thing, man, they're working, like some of the people you, we both probably agree on are some of the most diligent, hardworking people I've ever seen. I just want to get that out there is all, just because like, I wish that's, you know, that embarrassing thing- And they're trying to actually treat their addictions. They're not like festering in it most of the time. It's a problem that they're trying to work on in their lives. Right, it's causing them trouble. They're in therapy. They're like, they don't want to be, they feel afflicted by that particular thing, and the affliction is connected to probably an idea they had in their younger selves about how you're supposed to be to make stuff. They didn't need that at all, but it got stuck to them like an old piece of gum. It got all in their hair and shit. And so they're always sort of like struggling with it. I mean, I think there is something to be said for, you know, big doses of psychedelics to have visions. And, you know, all the getting out there and the far reaches of whatever to like, you know, get inspiration. I'm not saying that that isn't a way to find inspiration, but, you know, also I think there's something to be said for like actual far reaches. You know what I mean? Like it's as difficult as it may be to trip for 12 hours straight, depending on your personality. It's not that hard to get high. Let's face it, you put a tiny little square of paper on your tongue and you can like dissolve into eternity for some long seemingly infinite amount of time and come back to a human form and maybe you'll have some incredible epiphany that you can, if you're really, really talented, you can then translate in a way that people on this side of the veil can see it. There's a lot of great visionary artists who do that, but they're all trained like Alex Gray. He's a trained, you know, artist. Like he to get where he's at took years and years and years of understanding human anatomy and how to paint, but then also the visions he's had, he's been able, because of that work, he can capture them. But, you know, I think there's something to be said for the other places that are difficult to get to. You know, that you can't just put a piece of paper on your fucking tongue, like running a marathon. You know, like getting up early in the morning and running 20 miles. What kind of things do you see in that realm? Have you gotten any artistic inspiration from? Yeah, for sure. I just like learning to do things that I haven't been able to do before. That's what I like. And I don't know, I think because art is harder, because I can, it's actually, I can schedule myself. There's plenty of thousands and thousands of people that have run marathons before. I can take a schedule off the internet. And if I just stick to it, I know that I'll get to that 20 mile threshold. And with art, there is no guarantee, right? You can work really hard and come up with nothing but rocks for using that panning for gold analogy. And you can come up with it over and over and over again. So it actually adds a sense of agency to my life, whereas art is more of like a sense of surrender. And humility.

Do you think there will be blood? Could be one of the interpretations. Could be it's about the creative process. Well, you just, just by saying that, I guess we could choose to interpret it that way. Like he starts off as like someone with a bad, like, you know, he starts off almost killing himself in pursuit of this rare thing. It's the exact panning for gold metaphor that we're using here, except in his case, it's like ends up being oil or whatever. But it's about this sort of like horrific pursuit for this thing that takes completely like takes him over and ultimately spoiler alert ruins it. But, you know, when I think about like the art and the hard, exactly what you're saying, God, Jesus, I don't know much of a more horrible feeling than those days or weeks where you're not, nothing's coming. You come into the fucking studio and it's shit in and shit out. There's not even something you could revise. I don't even know if this happens to you, but I've had it happen where I, you know, and you know it always comes back because it's come back. But you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, but that's just a stone that you have to step on to get to the next place. That's a thing to keep in mind is like it's not reasonable to have a goal of making something great because you can't control that, but you can set a goal of being ready for something great to come to you and you need to go through those shitty days in order to get to that place where you're receptive. That's the way I choose to look at it. If you had to name that place, what would you call it? Which place? The place where you're? The place in between. Wait, what, what, the place in between? The place in between you deciding to make something and you finally getting through all the like horrible, seemingly never ending, low inspiration parts of the journey. What if you had to name that place, what would you call it? My life, I don't know, that's what it is. But I don't think, I don't feel as dramatic about it anymore. I don't think, oh, this is never gonna end because I see it as a cycle. I know myself better now. I know that I tend to get really depressed or anxious when I'm starting a new project. Yes. Starting a new television project last week. And it felt like nobody knew exactly what the identity of this particular show was gonna be musically speaking. And so I was kind of at a loss and I was just staring at the blank page and I was getting depressed. And I realized that happens every time at the beginning because that's like when your body is resting because it knows that once the idea comes, then you get kind of carried away with the idea and you're working a lot. So I just see it as part of the process. I see it as like storing up, it's like creative winter. You know, I'm like hibernating and storing up that energy and then I'm gonna spring forward once I get a nugget of something. Anytime I start working on something that's gonna be a big project, sadly my wife gets a little like oh fuck. Because same thing, I get depressed, like bummed and like, but I don't want, I've never, it's nice to hear you admit it. Because I never want to admit that that is happening because it feels like I, but now it feels good because you said, but it feels, you know, I see it as like your body preparing your psyche to take something. Right, that's a cool way to look at it. There's so many parts of this thing that is like, I think it's like a beautiful, in any way to get to make stuff is the coolest thing ever, whether it's professionally or just because you like her, you've decided to start making stuff. The whole thing is just such a fucking beautiful thing, but there's so many pieces of it that just don't make it in to the stories about people who create stuff, because it would be a fucking boring movie. You know, no one would want to, no one wants to see that. No one wants to see, I wouldn't mind seeing like, oh cool, he's gonna shave his nipples off or something before he starts painting. That's intense, but nobody wants to see like just the mild depression, you know, a kind of like bored, like if you made a story about Leonard Cohen, you just show him writing a single song for an entire year, that's the film. Yeah, are you gonna do that? And like eating and meditating, that's it. Yeah, just fucking eating, probably slightly messy, you know, having maybe rolling around in bed a little bit, like maybe watching some shitty TV show. But the interesting thing is it took me a long time to figure out the correlation between, you know, those changes in my mood and the creative process and to see how they're kind of causally linked and to just recognize that it's a cycle that I go through a lot. And with working for other people, it kind of mitigates the ups and downs of that cycle because I just have to get things done on a certain timeline. Right, and also it's like when you're collaborating, you're not flying blind, you know, like you've got somebody there who can at least give you some very fuzzy coordinates about where they like the song to go. Whereas if you're just making stuff on your own, who do you refer to? Like maybe you have some friends that you could run ideas by, but that which brings me down. I like to think of composing for film and TV, like cooking for somebody else. That's the metaphor I like to use these days. Used to be like being an architect, but now I like to think of it like cooking for someone else. And if somebody's coming over to your house for the first time, you've never met that person before and you're supposed to cook a meal and blow them away, it's anxiety inducing because you don't know what kind of food they like. You don't know what they're allergic to. You don't know what kind of diet they're on if they're vegetarian or vegan or whatever. And so that's anxiety inducing, but the more you can get to know that person, then the easier it is to make a meal that they'll enjoy. Is, have you ever run into anybody that just didn't wanna collaborate at all? Like someone who is like being a fascist about what they wanted with you and that weren't interested in your ideas? I think people that are more insecure tend to be that way. I think it's harder and it takes more life experience and creative experience to understand that when you're working in a collaborative medium, the best thing you can do is just pick the collaborators that you wanna work with and give them as much freedom as possible because then they would do their best work and they'll feel empowered and they'll feel valued and they'll feel like they can add something of their voice to something to your project rather than just be a blunt instrument that you're using to exert your own will. There's another stereotype, by the way, the stereotype of the fascist producer person who's like, you know, it's the, it gets embodied in Stanley Kubrick. I mean, Jesus Christ, have you seen that documentary as daughter filmed? I'm not sure, I've definitely seen it. The Shining? I've definitely, oh, I didn't see that one yet, but I've seen other documentaries about him. You just, when you watch that and you see that like everyone is getting sick from working with him and like, but they wanna work with him because he's one of the great geniuses and they're so excited to be there, they signed on, but he's, there's a great moment where Jack Nicholson, it's the freezer scene, he's been locked in the freezer and he's like yelling at his wife and like, it's like, after they cut, she catches this look on his face, he's like, Kubrick is like, that was good. And you see him looking at this, the great director with this, it's like a, he's hurting from playing this awful fucking character in this awful place that they're at. Like it's hurting him. And the look is like, I don't know, it's like a prisoner looking at their like, dungeon keeper or something like that. But it seems like Kubrick sort of meets that the stereotype of the hyper controlling, difficult to work with, director, producer type who knows exactly what they want and makes great shit to make matters worse, what they make is incredible, you know? That, so it is sometimes people, I guess you do just have to do whatever people say, but I know what you mean. It just depends, I mean, it depends on if somebody's putting that on because they saw the Kubrick documentary and they think that's what a director is supposed to do or if somebody is really has a vision for something and then it's my job to trust that person. And I think every project that I've done is somewhere in between those extremes, but I definitely don't have any interest in working with people that are putting it on as a pretense because they think that's what you're supposed to do as a director is be in command of all elements of the thing. It's like, it just doesn't make sense. Yeah, there's all these stereotypes are ruining everything. I mean, there's so many fucking people who see this shit and they think that's how they're supposed to be and then they just ruin, well, it also comes from a place of insecurity, right? Because it's like the only reason why someone would look outward on how to be is if they don't feel comfortable in some way in their role or in their body. So then they look to somebody else and they say, oh, well, I'm gonna fake Stanley Kubrick until I make it, you know, I'm gonna fake that persona until I become a genius auteur and it usually doesn't work out. No, nobody wants that. I also think that that kind of like troubled genius trope comes from a place of privilege. That's another thing I've noticed. And like this thing where it's like, also the idea of like art for art's sake and that you should suffer for your art, blah, blah, blah. It's like, well, I think that there's enough suffering in life if you're living it in an engaged way that you don't have to consciously add suffering through art. I mean, it will come through. The suffering in your life will come through but this idea that you should be this weird self-flagellating island is strange to me. And I think it really does. Like as somebody who's interviewed lots of artists, people that don't come from a place of privilege and maybe don't get their idea of like how an artist exists from an academic setting, they don't have any kind of qualms about hustling and making money doing music or doing whatever it is that they do. Whereas the people that come from this kind of art for art's sake perspective usually have trust funds or something. You know what I mean? Yeah, they're like, you know, I don't, this is just something, this is my passion. And if, you know, if money comes, it comes. But yeah, they're not like- It's like being a farmer who doesn't, who's too lazy to harvest the crops and take them to market. You just like planting the seeds and seeing the pretty plants grow. Wow. Yeah, that's fucking crazy. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. So yeah, that's, but that's intense, man. That's true though. That is a whole thing. Whereas like you meet someone who's, but again, this goes back to like what I was trying to get out at the beginning. It's like, whenever you meet people who are like, you know, actually like working artists, it's just not, it's not what you would call exciting. It's like gritty and it's, and I, to me that discovery was one of my favorite discoveries when it came to making stuff, because I was able to hang up a lot of the bullshit that I'd imagined it was supposed to be like. And I was relieved by the idea that like, oh yeah, if you just work really hard consistently, you can do this. It's not that you need some magic glitter. Well, the work is doing it. You know what I'm saying? Like that's what it is. It's that, that is what it is, what it's all about. And if, so then the next thing is, can you, can you approach the work in such a way that you can experience joy in doing the work where you're not seeing this as like lifting a boulder up or even if it is like lifting a boulder up, can you lean into that feeling so that you can make every day worthwhile? I just can't, you know, I just try not to get addicted to the joy. You know, I just, if joy happens someday, if I'm making stuff, that's great. It was a day of joy. But if I wake up someday and feel like I don't want to make anything today, but I have to because there's some deadline, then yeah, I'm gonna go, then joy doesn't become the requisite. Right. Or no, there isn't a feeling that is the requisite feeling to make something, you know, obliterating all the requisite feelings, like, oh, I've got to be a certain level of stoned or a certain level of high or a certain level of happy or a certain level of sad or this or that or I need these things arranged. It probably does help to be a certain level of present. Like if you want to at least try to be, hopefully what the work will do is make you feel present in the way that we're talking about with exercise where if you're working out really hard doing something physically strenuous, it's harder to let your mind drift into like social media world or whatever. You're there and time slows down. And I think if you're working hard creatively, then maybe you can get to a similar type of presence. Yeah, this is why I think that getting yourself in some kind of shape, getting yourself healthy is like anytime I'm healthy, I'm way more inspired. Anytime I'm drinking enough water, exercising every day, you know, taking care of earth shit, you know what I mean? Like not ignoring like stuff that needs to get taken care of, you know, like boring ass things, you know, like, you know, changing my address, you know, Stu, you know what I'm talking about? The mundane earth shit, the more I'm at least spending some period of my day addressing all that stuff, the better the other stuff seems to get natural. I would agree with that. I would say even doing stuff that I historically have hated doing, but having it in order, it helps me with my artwork, like doing my taxes, knowing that that's out of the way and that things are in order, you know? And that's why I think, you know, I've always been someone that resisted like making the bed in the morning because it seemed like completely pointless, but I actually tried it as an experiment to, you know, start making the, this was several years ago, started making the bed every day. And I think it's like a little mini meditation that you can do. For sure. Wake up. It's like, you know, someone I fall on Twitter is very funny, I can't remember their name now though, tweeted something hilarious like, making your bed is meaningless. It's just fabric or something like that, you know? It's like a superstition, but I'm in the bed making club. Like if I make my bed every day, I feel better for some reason. Like all these little like earthbound things are so fucking important. But earlier, this is something I wanted to talk about if you want to talk about it on a podcast, if you don't, I totally get it. But I was surprised in a non-recorded conversation to hear the self-loathing thing, Joe. What is that? When did that start? Yeah, really early on I would say, and I don't think I recognized it as such, but it's something I've been thinking about more recently. But I think I've historically sought out collaborators that are more of the dark, you know, troubled genius types. And then it, then those people kind of reinforced my own negative opinions of myself because they can hone in on that and use it as leverage to do whatever they wanted to do. Anyway, yeah, I mean, it's kind of like from an early age, I always responded better to the teachers that were really strict or like mean, I would want it to gain their approval or the coaches that were like that or the bandmates that were like that. And I think that it actually served me really well for a while, like that's what I used to kind of get myself up to speed. It's like first gear in a car, right? But if you stay in that place, you'll burn it out. So I've been working on transitioning to a different gear. In so doing, I've noticed patterns of people that were not kind and then kind of interrogating, all right, why was I gravitating towards these types of people? So I don't know what the origin of it was, but I mean, don't you have that too? Well, I used to, and I used to think it was normal. It is normal, I think, to a certain extent. And I think it, well, for lots of people, but it's just part of, it's one of the voices in my head. There's other parts of me that are more confident, but I think like I can remember, I started playing music really early and I can remember thinking, why would I ever be proud of this? Like what good would that serve to congratulate myself or be proud of it? I should always be thinking about the standards set by other people and how far away from the standard I am. And I think that was probably useful for a while to just be like, I'm terrible, I need to keep working. There's an infinite expanse that I need to traverse before I'm allowed to even have an opinion. Then I think that in making a record, and well, I think that probably also explains, for example, why I was always playing a supporting role, either as a drummer or as a composer or producer or whatever, I wasn't making statements that were entirely my own. And that's something I always really wanted to do, but that mentality kept me from doing it. So I had to kind of confront the source of that as I was making an album and then started to think about how as useful as it was to be hard on myself, it also was destructive and kept me from, it negated my own voice. And again, as we were saying before, I think I thought of that as like egotistical to embrace one's own voice. And maybe it is to a certain extent, but. I mean, you could argue it's egotistical to hate yourself too. Yeah, and that's true. I mean, because to hate yourself, you have to set up the thing that is hated and then the thing that hates it. And theoretically, the thing that hates it has achieved some superiority over the thing it hates, at least enough to administer hate. You could also argue that it's not egotistical to embrace your own voice at all, because even though it's your own voice, you didn't, it's not wrought by you. It was given to you as a gift, right? So it's not as though you're admiring something that's your own creation. It's something, it's just your temperament. It's like, you didn't assemble the atoms in your body. You didn't put together your own life experience from scratch, you know? It's just, you're a node and you're embracing the uniqueness of the coordinates that you're at. Yeah, yeah. And to claim that that's your voice anyway, it's like, well, the thing that you're hating or not, you know, like, I think a lot of people, me included when I was really caught up in my own fashionable self-hate was not, hadn't quite figured out that self-hate is just another form of fixation on the self. It's just, that's all it is. It doesn't matter if the way that you're identifying with yourself is via some negative connection or a positive connection. If you have become the primary consideration in your life, you're self-fixated or what's called self-cherishing is what it's called. And that's a painful situation to get into on either side, you know? Cause, you know, classic like self-loving or self-worshipping narcissists, you know, they're usually pretty, like they're agonized all day long. I don't feel good and they're lonely. And self-hating narcissists, the same thing, which if I wear, that's where I fall on that spectrum or have, but then, you know, like you have to get it, like you get into the question, like if you're gonna hate yourself, you have to know yourself. That's the paradox of the damn thing. It's like, what is it that you hate? What, you know, like what is the thing that you loathe? You know what I mean? Like what is that thing? And then you have to imagine, well, that's me. Right. Well, I think lots of it gets passed down from generation to generation, right? Like parents recognize traits in their children that they hate within themselves and then they try to discourage those traits in some way or another and then it becomes ingrained. So how are you doing that with your children, Duncan? I, well, I, you know, I use the three, the two major tools of good parenting, shame and fear. Those are the, you know, best ways to sculpt. I'm wondering if that, if you have been surprised to do that from time to time, because you're somebody that if I were to ask you about that, seriously, you would probably say that you're very conscious of trying not to repeat those kind of patterns, but I'm wondering if it. I fall on the wrong side. So then you become a reaction to the thing that did that to you. So, you know, my dad would like body shame me and like was always calling me fat and, you know, like, oh yeah, oh yeah. Well, so that's why you have a Peloton, man. But dad-aton, I've got my dad's, I have a picture of my dad. A hologram of your dad keeping you in shape. Yeah, he, he like, I got really, I felt so ashamed of my body for the longest time and still do, it still comes up, you know, like I'll look in the mirror and I'll squeeze like, you're like, I was riding my bike bike with my son and he pulled my shirt up and like pointed at what I'm thinking must have been some of my back fat and goes, baby, there, that's a baby. Like when you're, I was so funny, but also, you know, I'm like in the mirror looking at my back fat and thinking, oh God, you've got back fat, but it's not, it doesn't have the poisonous edge it used to when I was younger, you know, it's just some kind of echo inside of me or something like that, you know, but it used to be really like, you know, getting punched in the solar plexus, you know, I was like, I dreaded taking my shirt off in front of people and I felt ashamed of myself and it was all connected to what I think was like my dad's backwards attempt at getting me to get healthy, thinking, oh, I'll shame him into getting healthy. Like if I make fun of him for being fat, he won't eat as much and then he'll get healthy, not somehow not realizing that like, that's a surefire way to make someone like go the opposite direction. Sometimes, or maybe it would, maybe it would make that person, maybe it could work and that person gets thin, but at the expense of like, devastating mental health issues. Right, yeah, that's another thing that happens to people is they do get in shape, but they do it for it, they do it out of, you know, it's like Jack, this teacher Jack Cornfield talks about, like if you're gonna save the earth, save it out of love, not fear. You know, like that should be the energy that's fueling us when we try to do things, try to help. You know, even though fear can be there, it doesn't have to be the primary fuel. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about with like the first gear, right? It's like engaging that kind of primal, flight or fight response to get yourself into gear. But after a while, you know, the adrenaline runs out, so you have to be able to shift gears into something more sustainable, so that you're not like relying on always being jolted into action. I think, like, for me, they're like my reasons for right now for getting healthier, there's a few, but most of them are like, you know, I wanna extend my lifespan, I don't wanna be like a out of shape dad who can't pick up his kid or keep up with his kid. So I'm able to like, But that's not because you're afraid to die, it's because you love life, right? Yeah, it's cause I want, it's cause like part of it is just cause I want, you know, I wanna be a good dad. There's a lot of other like, completely fucking selfish egomaniacal reasons. You know, to this day, would be fascinated to look at my stomach and have actual visible abdominal muscles. That would be a pretty, you know, I mean, I wanna see that before. I wanna be in the shape of your father's face. But, did your dad, was your dad in good shape? Did he, do you feel like he felt comfortable inside of his own body and would? No. Okay. Fair critique. I wish I'd thought of that when I was, when I was any, if so, just we'd been friends when I was younger and you had simply said that, I probably would have saved me years of- So maybe his motivation was like, I don't want this kid to turn out like me, so I have to give him more discipline or something. No, he, no, what happened was he went to Vietnam. He went, got indoctrinated into the US military and like so many other parents thought that it made sense to use techniques administered by people, trying to get other people to kill strangers to raise your kids. This is a unit, this, anyone out there listening who is in a military family knows exactly what I'm talking about. Your dad makes you say yes sir and no sir. Your dad utilizes all these things that, I don't know that you would call it tough love, but shit that was cooked up in the military community to make people into like killing machines. And so you, you know, that's how you learned to find, that's, you know, how you learn to get strong. And so you come home from your war with a little bit of PTSD and the natural confusion that goes along with being a parent and you think, oh, I'll just do the shit that they taught me in the Navy with my kids. I'll make them call me sir and I'll make them, you know, obedient and if they're not obedient, great punishment, you know, I think that's kind of the model for a military parent. Yeah, but I wanna point out that that's not unique to the military necessarily because I feel like I, as someone who was raised in an atheist, relatively permissive household, I still had this like inner drill sergeant that came from, I don't know where it came from necessarily, but that's, it made me seek out other drill sergeants, you know, whether it was my soccer coach or my, you know, my music teacher or bandmates later on. So I think it's probably related to the same kind of impulse that, you know, makes people get into religions, you know, it's this idea that the world is tamable and that if we just have enough discipline, we can control the outcome rather than acknowledging that it's completely chaotic and that although we can try to control the outcome, it doesn't always work out. To me, it's like discipline. The problem is discipline, the way these fucking authority figures teach us discipline makes discipline seem, like, think about it, like it's the word used for punishment, you know, discipline your child. How do you discipline your child? You know, that's punitive instead of- Yes. Yeah, and it's not, it doesn't have to be punitive. Yeah, that's right. No, we- That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, and so we rob these people, we rob everyone of, like, what is one of the coolest feelings? Because, you know, when I was old enough to understand it, if people had explained to me, like, discipline is the same thing as freedom. You know, when we, most people, when they think of discipline, they think of having their freedom taken away by an angry parent who's making them do some shit that they don't wanna do. But, you know, the traditional idea of discipline that I've come to understand is, well, if you can't control your body and you can't control yourself enough to not always be satisfying your fleeting desires, then you might as well be locked inside of a meat robot or locked inside of some gargantuan beast that's just wandering through the land, putting shit in its mouth. Right. And that's- And there's a lot of evidence that, in fact, that's all we are is meat robots. And I think that the other thing that's appealing about discipline is that it's, it requires like this faith that we do have an agency and we're not just the product of our genes and our experience, that there's some sort of mechanism in there that allows us to steer the ship. A soul, if you will, or whatever. But here's, so, okay, so you were getting at this a little bit before, by the way, Jill, we've gone over an hour. I wanna make sure you have more time. I'm fine as long as you are. Okay, great. Yeah, I'm fine. So you were saying that you're also like trying to be cognizant of not over-correcting for ways that you were parented, right? Yeah. So first of all, have you had the experience of like, oh, shit, I'm acting just like my dad. Yes. So you've had that. But then on the other hand, you don't wanna be so, you don't wanna go so far in the opposite direction that you end up with like entitled brats for children either. So how do you find the, how do you, like, how do you, what's your philosophy as far as raising children? Well, you know, for me, it's like, because I don't wanna, like, I don't wanna, first of all, I have like anger problems. So like, I have to like be, it's why I meditate. It's why I have to be careful because like I'll lose my temper, which has happened a couple of times where Aaron and I have gotten in fights in front of him and it's been horrible. And it's helped me understand my dad, who also had a similar problem, probably a lot more intense, but similar. Like it's like an echo. Horrible, poisonous, shitty, stinky echo, like rolling through time. And when it comes to you, you have, like before it comes to you, you imagine, oh, I'll be able to handle that. And then when it, when you see yourself doing that thing that you hear parents say, oh God, I'm acting like my mom or my dad, you realize, oh, Jesus, this is like, this is going to be a little more challenging than I expected, you know? So as far as like not creating a brat, there's a, when you're dealing with a toddler, you're dealing with an absolute maniac. Like these are maniacs. They're savage, primal creatures that don't understand anything about sharing or patience. Or you know what I mean? Like they're, if they want a quesadilla, they are going to, they'll probably just scream quesadilla. Quesadilla! You know, and so you have to, if I react to him screaming quesadilla, like maybe some parents do to their kids, which is, you stop that right now and sit down. And they get scared of me. Then all that I've done is created a scared person. A person who's going to, like, who's going to be disciplined, what we would call disciplined, but really what they're subservient, they're afraid. They don't want to invoke the wrath of their parents. So they're going to act a certain way. Right, and that impulse, that impulse was probably evolved out of our need to like keep children away from the tigers, you know, back in the- Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. So it's not like an un, it's not like an unjust impulse necessarily. Not, no, it's not. But it's just something where it's like, you, if you're, like anytime I get stern with him, it's like, it's coming from a logical place. Like if I start feeling angry, both Aaron and I have a kind of agreement, you know, which is, anytime she's getting super frustrated, she'll just say, can you be with forest? You know what I mean? Because the idea is more like, we're not trying, we don't want the anger to inform our decision about how to teach this child how to function in the world. But we want it to be logical, which is, you know, it isn't a world where you can just randomly scream out quesadilla and get quesadillas. It's not a world where you can just decide to slap someone and that's okay. You know, you can't slap, it's not a world where you can just, you know, have a hypothesis or a curiosity about what happens if you bite the shit out of someone's arm. You know, like you can't do, all these things are not pro-survival. So it's like, you know, figuring out its consistency, you know, more than like a punishment attitude of, if I can consistently teach forest not to bite, not to slap, not to scream a banshee scream, you know, before it's time to go to bed over and over again and do that in a kind of non-emotional way, even if, when, even if his reaction to being restricted is like someone who just was told that they're like, home planet was destroyed by the death star. You know what I mean? Which is like the way a toddler will react to discipline is just to collapse, laying on the ground, weeping and screaming, because you, sorry, you can't have a cookie right now. It's 8 a.m. You know, this isn't when we have cookies, you know, but maintaining like a kind of steady loving quality around them so that they know you love them, but also they know you're the boss. That's the thing, they have to know you're the boss. That's, I could have just said that up front, because if they think they're the boss, they're gonna get stressed out. They get anxious. They're too tiny and uninformed to be a boss, to be in control. They don't wanna be in control, even though they act like it. So, you know, it's, and also I don't know if there's, I'm sorry, this is a boring rant. No, I like it. I have yet to discover a sort of go-to way to be, you know, they're very clever, you know, they're so smart. This book that I'm listening to about toddlers, one of the things it talks about is like, you are going to find yourself realizing that you have been outwitted by a two-year-old. Like, you know what I mean? That you have compromised in a way you would never have expected to compromise with his creature. And that helps a lot when you realize like, don't try, you know, don't think that just because they're two and their language skills aren't, adult language skills that they're not brilliant and, you know, manipulative, you know, in a sweet way. So, in this book that I've been listening to, one of the things is it says, not to be the perfect parent, but the good enough parent. That's the goal. Because if you start trying to like, be some perfect Mary Poppins parent, you're just gonna feel guilty all the time. I think that that often holds true for art too. You know, at a certain point, like, is the cord that you're perseverating over good enough to serve the function of expressing the idea. And you can always loop back around to it later, right? Like, with your kids, you're gonna have good days and bad days. And on some days, you probably feel like, wow, I did a really good job today. I said something really insightful and I'm seeing results. But then there's other days where it's like, you know what, I did my best and it was good enough. The kid's still alive and now, now he's sleeping and he's safe. And that's good enough for right now. And I think the same thing goes with making art. You know, if you can just keep that impulse alive, keep it safe. Some days are gonna be more challenging than others. To wrap it back around to our original idea. And I say that as somebody who doesn't have children. So it's pure conjecture. Well, you're gonna be a great dad. You already understand it, because that is it. That's it. I never, somehow I never just didn't make the connection between that kind of like patient, sort of settling when you're making stuff. I mean, I think that's one of the big lessons that composing for other people has taught me is like, often I'll make something that's good enough. And if it serves the story well enough, and it's on time, I have to, you know, I usually don't have much time to do this. Wow. You know, sometimes when I listen back to, what'll often happen is I'll write a bunch of music over a short period of time. Then months later, I see it when it's on TV or in the movie theater. And I don't even necessarily remember writing half of the stuff. I can, the melodies feel familiar when they come back. But some of it, I'm like, okay, that's, I'm never like that was working. That's terrible. But sometimes it's just good enough. And then sometimes like, hey, that one's pretty good. And I just think it's probably not possible to only make perfect nuggets of music when you're on the timeline that I'm on and you're in a collaborative setting. And so. Good enough. Yeah. Good enough to achieve whatever, you know, you're to get the idea out, right? Cause it's really just a medium for expressing an idea. Yeah, I love that, man. So if we're going back to this whole like radio thing, right? It's like some days it's coming, the ideas are coming in crystal clear. Some days you get nothing but static. Some days like if you're listening to say a baseball game on the radio, but there's a little bit of static, but you're hearing the message enough, then that's good enough because, you know, it's just an abstract idea traveling over the airwaves and then being reconstituted into sound anyway, right? And so. Yeah. So if it's a little bit hazy, but you can hear the game, then it's good enough. And that's a good enough place to end this episode. This is a good enough episode. Is it a great episode? Maybe not, but is it good enough? Yes. Yeah, this episode's good enough. I'm going to say great. That was, thank you for tying it all together. And thank you so much for coming on the show again, Joe. I just wanted to have an opportunity to talk to you for an hour because it's been a while since we had one of our long chats. I know, I felt so when we were talking last, you were like, let's catch, let's do a podcast so we can catch up. I felt so guilty. Oh, no. Is that the only way we could be friends? Wait, why did you feel guilty? Well, because like a lot of my friendships and conversations happen via a medium that I monetize. So there's a sense of like guilt attached to that. You know, what's interesting is I was thinking about how every kind of project that I've gotten paid for over the years is the descendant of a friendship that I've had. Yeah. And that makes sense. I mean, it's just the communities that I'm in, that I'm a part of are where I'm meeting people with whom I collaborate. Yeah, it's nothing to feel tear. It's just like, this is, we're in the entertainment world and we all are, we love what we do. And so it's going to get mixed in with recreation. It's just, it's the way it is. But you know, people always like I've been doing these like online lectures for music schools and stuff. And the question that gets asked the most is, how do you get started in this business? How do you build a career as a composer? And my advice to people is to pursue things over which they have agencies. So, you know, start a band or write your own songs and try to find a community of people that are like-minded. Like, don't worry about networking with the broader industry. Like just find your community. Because for me, that's where every, that's where every opportunity has come from. Same, same. 100%. Like things that I wasn't even thinking would ever lead to anything or what led to having a career. Another thing that flies in the face of most people's idea of how it works, which is like, if you wanna see the most stereotypical stupid movie about how someone gets successful it's that dumb show about that cowboy country singer who somehow like meets Lady Gaga. You know what I mean? And she sings them a song in a parking lot of like- Oh, you mean a Star is Born? A Star is Born. The most convoluted bullshit like- And it also plays on that troubled genius trope because he hangs himself in the garage. Yeah, spoiler alert. That's actually happens in the beginning of the movie. The, I'm not in the time just kidding, it doesn't. I thought Dave Chappelle was good in that movie. He was great. I mean, it's an entertaining movie. And again, it's like you can't make a movie about this that's going to be entertaining. But I bet if we, you know, I actually would hope that you would have Lady Gaga on the podcast. Are you kidding? Okay, I'll tell you my story about Lady Gaga in a second. Please. But I bet she would just talk about the same thing we were talking about like spending most days not writing hits and just trying to write hits. Yes, I'm not, because I feel like a lot of people is, you know, like a Star is Born was a great movie. My wife thinks it's a great movie. I think it's a great entertaining movie. I think Lady Gaga was great in it. I have a similar problem with like whiplash the movie because I went to a school like that. I felt like that movie was emotionally fraudulent too. Like again, the abusive teacher. I've had abusive teachers, but not in that same way. So it felt like it was just trading on that myth. And it felt hollow to me. But yeah, so I will say one time I was at a recording studio and I was hanging out with a friend who was making an album there. And Lady Gaga was making an album in another room in the same studio. And she came in and started hanging out with us in this lounge area for a while. And I didn't even recognize her at first because she seemed so larger than life on screen. And so I didn't recognize her, but she was talking about cookies a lot and like how in her room they only had kale chips. And she's like, I need a real cookie. Like give me something good to eat. So I don't know, maybe she would have some insights as far as like that body dynamic that you're talking about that began with your dad fat shaming you. I can't imagine what it would be like to be like a product. Your whole body is a product. Your whole, you know, in the way that like a pop star is, you know, it's- I know. I had Phil Collins on my podcast. And we were talking about how lots of the other superstars of the 80s were dead already, you know, Prince Michael Jackson. People like that. And how that whole thing is so unhealthy. And the reason why he's probably still alive is because it didn't happen to him until he was in his late 30s or even his 40s. And he'd been in weirdo bands before. What a fucking talented dude, man. He wrote one of the premier divorce songs of the 80s. You know that song? Why does it always seem to me, me looking at you? That's all, yeah. That's all. It's like it was a divorce boom song. My mom used to listen to it. It was like one of many- He wrote a lot of, hey, my favorite, okay. Well, my favorite divorce album of all time is Marvin Gaye, Hear My Dear. But I think Phil Collins- I don't know if I've listened to that album at all. Oh, that album is just tremendous. Oh, I'm listening to that shit. It's when he got divorced from Barry Gordy's sister. That's, I think it's actually, I would say it's reductive to call it one of my favorite divorce albums of all time, because I think it's just one of the all-time best albums ever made. But I think a close second is Face Value, the first Phil solo album. And there's a song on there called, Do You Know What I Mean? Which is incredible. It's just him on a piano. And then another one called If Leaving Me Is Easy, which is another great breakup song. He's a master of those. He must have gone through so many shitty relay. Do you ever think about that? Like when you're listening to, I don't know, Taylor Swift, and so much of her music seems to be informed by failed relationships. And just you think like, my God, do you, like, if I were her, I would, or if I was like someone who was like in dating her, there's gotta be a piece of you that's like, God, I hope I don't die. I don't wanna end up in one of your songs. Like I hope this works out. Well, one thing that was interesting was hearing you and Natasha podcast a few weeks ago because you were in a relationship together and it was cool to hear how you still have a shorthand because you had spent all this time creating together and you were in love at one point. And it was healthy to hear that you're, now you're both married and you have kids and you're still friends. And I think that was really powerful. Yeah, she's one of my best friends. It's the coolest thing. Cause yeah, I don't think that happens that very often. Like usually you just sort of drift off or lose touch or talk here and there. But yeah, she's a really close friend of mine. That's cool. Yeah, I feel lucky that we're still friends. Well, with that, should we cut it? No, we gotta cut it. You can't end with like, I'm feel lucky I'm friends with my ex-girlfriend. Well, you can cut off. I think that at the part where we initially ended it was good. Yeah. Yeah, we'll cut it there or we won't out of laziness. I don't know. Do what you need, it's good enough. It's good enough. Joe, thank you so much for coming on the show.

I know that you're from uptown and you used to expensive things, said the hot dog vendor as he dropped down to one knee. Babe, as she said, as she stretched out her hand, there's more to the laugh than just having fun. So, upon her finger, he placed a hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. 30 years later, 24th of December, he looks like a stranger. Just can't remember until in his hand, she laces a hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. His eyes lit up like a rising sun. He said, I love you, you're my wife. We had two daughters and a son. Did he breathe his last breath? Now every day on his grave, she leaves a hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. Heated hot dog bun. That's Heated Hot Dog Bun. And that's off the soundtrack of the new Wes Anderson film, The Cupcake Transmission Protocol. My name is Duncan Trussell. This is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. We welcome you by we, I mean the hive of personalities that exist within me and also my wonderful editor, Aaron Goldberg. Hello, welcome. We're so glad you're here. Hope you're doing great. Here's a little personal update. Personal update. I want to talk about myself, personal update. It's time to talk about myself. My smell's coming back. Thank God. And the way it's coming back is really strange. At first I wasn't sure what was happening because every once in a while I'd catch this bizarre smell, kind of like a mixture of peat moss and like LeFrogue, like maybe the smell of a 15th century grape stompers boot, just alkaline and weird and musty. And I didn't know what it was. I knew people who lost their smell because of COVID were having various phantom smells, but I figured I didn't realize it was being triggered by something. For example, one night I was sitting on the couch and there's this bizarre smell out of nowhere. I don't know what it is. My wife comes downstairs and she's like, what the fuck? Don't you smell that? That the dog's shit on the floor. And because my brain was translating the smell of dog's shit into a kind of like pungent, fungal stink, I didn't know that's what had happened. In fact, I thought I was just having some kind of smell hallucination. As it turns out, that was the beginning of my smell coming back. Now oatmeal, coffee, shit, piss, and diapers, and my own BO all smell exactly the same. And it's that smell I experienced initially. It's, I've done some research into this and apparently it's like your nose has amnesia. And so it can detect a kind of chemical in the air, but it doesn't know what it is. So it's trying to send you just a warning like, hey, there's some kind of fucked up smell here. So I guess my nose, for whatever reason, thinks oatmeal is as polluted or dangerous or toxic as shit. And so, and coffee too. My nose is like, yeah, coffee, it's whatever that is. I don't know what it is, the smell, the fireplace. It's all kind of the same smell. But as time passes, like the smell of my BO is starting to smell more like, oh yeah, that's like my own BO. My poor wife, at one point I had to add, I was like, Aaron, do my armpits smell like some kind of mulch-y, like fungal rot? And she's like, no, they just stink like you. So, but to me, for a second, I thought, oh my God, like I'm excreting, excreting, is this the same thing? I'm oozing some kind of new stink. But no, it's just my brain is having to relearn how to smell things. So for all my COVID friends out there, don't worry. If you're getting phantom smells, it actually might be a good sign. It might mean that your smell is beginning to return. Personal update. I just talked about myself, personal update. My smell's coming back. Friends, if you're feeling the holiday blues, I've got something for you today.

But first, this. This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.

We have a weekly meditation group, our journey into boredom. We have a Friday family gathering. We all just sort of hang out online. And also you'll get access to commercial free episodes of this podcast that usually come out earlier than they hit the main feed. Now, folks, with us here today, you saw her on the Midnight Gospel, Trudy the Love Barbarian. She is a Harvard graduate and the founding teacher of Insight LA. I got to meet her at the Ram Dass retreats where Ram Dass would have her and Jack Cornfield give incredible talks that have changed my life and not changed my life in some kind of like unquantifiable, like hippie-dippy woo-woo. Like I feel sort of happier from listening to this person's talks. But as in many of the things that she has shared with me, both on my podcast and the times I've gotten to see her talk, have given me real tools and real powerful, yet incredibly simple ways for dealing with my own madness and insanity. And I think maybe you'll hear a little bit of that now. And before we jump in, if you're having a weird Christmas, I want to invite you to a couple of events that Trudy is associated with. The first being to All a Good Night. It's a Christmas Eve meditation and on Christmas Day, Trudy is going to be present at an online gathering for folks having a rough time during Christmas. All the links you need to find that will be at dunkintrustle.com or you can go to InsightLA.org. Now, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH Trudy Goodman. Trudy, welcome back to the DTFH. As I've been looking forward to this conversation, and I realize things that you have told me and things that Jack have told me, these are the things I seem to refer to the most. Just when I'm sitting back thinking not just about Buddhism, but in general, I just want to say thank you for that and for what you give so many people in your community. Well, you're welcome, Duncan. I mean, this is what we do, so it's kind of nice to know it actually helps. Yes, I think. You give your wish to something and there are people who toil away at obscurity and never get any feedback and they still are dedicated and have passion for what they do. And I'm sure that would be both of us because we love these teachings and sharing them. But the sharing them part is really a blessing to be able to do that and hear that from you, so thanks. Oh, my God. Yeah, well, thank you. You know, Aaron and I, it's an interesting thing these days because we all are like at least physically disconnected, but somehow almost more connected or at least the possibility of connecting with spiritual communities is easier for people all over the place because spiritual communities have had to evolve. To create this sort of online space. And so I thought maybe we could just start off by talking about Insight LA. Like, what exactly is it? You know, and the reason I never came when I was living in LA was just because I was on the east side and that drive to the west side is such a long arduous drive. Yeah, Duncan, look, we also hold an anchor on the east side on Melrose, but forget about that. You may not have even known that we had that. Didn't know that. Yeah, we had a center on the east side too. And it's sad to me that we had to give up our physical centers, but we do have one place still that we can use in Bennett to Canyon that actually is ours. So that's good. Insight LA, first of all, I just have to say, I feel these days like inside LA is like the Hanukkah miracle. You know how the lamp ran out of oil? It only had oil for one day and it lasted eight days. I mean, the pandemic, not meeting in person, you know, needing more support. I feel like the fact that Insight LA is still continuing and thriving is like the Hanukkah miracle. The oil ran out a couple of years ago, but somehow the light keeps shining. And it's great. It's a beautiful thing. And I guess the main thing I would love to say about it is that it is actually the fulfillment of the dream I had when I came to LA. I came for family reasons. I didn't know anybody. I knew my daughter and my mother, both of whom needed my help at that time. My daughter was about to give birth. My mom, you know, my dad had died. She was alone and they had moved to LA from where they had lived for over 40 years overseas. So she was alone and not having support of a community. Anyway, so I didn't really know. I just came dunking without the things that you usually want to have in LA, like youth or beauty or money or connections, you know, the currency of LA belonging, shall we say. Right. Yeah. Right. And somehow I really, I look back at, somebody asked me the other day, how did you do it? And I was like, I have no idea. Out of thin air, you know, came this center that has become one of the premier meditation and mindfulness centers in the city. And I feel like it happened out of love. It happened because I did what I loved, which was do these practices of mindfulness and meditation and retreats. And I just had this trust that if I did what I loved, and which brought me so much joy, that I would be joined by people because who doesn't want that? And also in LA, I really came to realize that people were more isolated than I would have dreamed coming from Boston, which is like a small town compared to LA. Right. You know, I would meet a colleague, a psychotherapy colleague and say, well, I'd love to connect with some of your community. And she'd say, what community? Huh? You've lived here 30 years and you don't have a community of colleagues that you, you know, are connected to and that you meet with. And so inside LA became my company that I needed. I don't mean company, like corporate company. I mean, companionship that I needed at that time in my life. And I just figured, hey, I've been practicing long enough to know that if I need something, this is a human need. It's not my particular neurotic thing, right? It's like, this is what people need. We need connection with each other. And so inside LA grew out of that. And at first, just my vision was very simple. At first it was to have a center that would be both a Buddhist class, retreat program, way to enter and develop and cultivate a Buddhist practice. But also because I had trained in the early years, helped John Kabat-Zinn when he established what used to be called the stress reduction and relaxation clinic. It became MBSR, Mindful Space Stress Reduction. But I was there in the early days and I knew there was also a lot of joy from having classes with people who would never walk through the doors of a Buddhist meditation center. Just people who worked at the market, who drove trucks, these were all the people who came to the clinic in Mr. Massachusetts at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, people from all walks of life. So from the beginning inside LA had the mindfulness, I don't like to use the word secular because it means that which is not sacred. And I think the more you wake up, the more everything is magical and sacred in a way. But you know what I'm saying, the non, not connected to any religion branch. And so we've had those two from the start, which makes me happy because I also realized, I don't know anybody here. How am I going to get connected to the community? I won't be able to go into clinics and schools. Well, prisons actually are desperate. You could go even if you're a church person or it doesn't matter. In most of the other kinds of settings where I would have loved for us to share these teachings, you need to be, you can't walk in with a certain hat on, just to be somebody who has something to offer to everybody from which nobody's going to recoil really. I've noticed that in, when I was studying psychology, ages ago in college, I've noticed that, oh, they've come up with ways to say spiritual things. In a scientific way, because they don't want to lose funding. Like, I think what is it? Carl Rogers came up with the term unconditional positive regard. Was that the word? You know what I'm saying? Because you couldn't say love. So he was saying, oh, this unconditional positive regard heals people. Because if you'd said unconditional love seems to heal people, no one in the scientific community would want to hear it. Positive regard? Oh, that's interesting. What is this positive regard? Unless I'm misinterpreting it. But it's so inside LA, it sounds, I wouldn't think when I heard that term, I wouldn't think, oh, that's a Buddhist center. I wouldn't know what it was, actually. So that's interesting that you did that. Well, I think I told you too that I picked the name because most people want to be on the inside. Nobody wants to be left out. So when you say inside LA, it kind of sounds like inside LA. And the last thing I want to say about LA is, right? That's cool. That's so smart. When you're inside, I want to be in your inner circle, Duncan. You are. Likewise. Yeah, you are. So the other thing was, I realized that since I didn't really know anybody, that the way to get connected in the community was through service. And I really felt like this was really important because work that I had done elsewhere and I felt like for us to support the people who are on the front lines of suffering in our society, this is important. Because you get a salary if you're a nurse, but your salary cannot compensate you for the exhaustion. And sometimes the moral distress of the decisions you have to make, a doctor, a respiratory, I mean, any healthcare professional, right? And I realized people don't know how to sustain themselves in these lines of work when you're face to face, looking into the eyes of people who are experiencing houselessness every single day. This is stressful. And how do we recharge? Usually write, have something to eat, have something to drink, have something we won't mention, have something, really people needed tools for self-care. So this became a big motivator for our, we call it insight in action, off the, get off the cushion, out into action. Because that's where hope lies, I think, for our country and our society. So now working in schools and hospitals and all kinds of prisons and connected with some absolutely wonderful non-profit work and for-profit people too, who are compassion-based. So that's all I just wanted to add that piece, because it feels essential that it's not, we are a place to learn the tools of self-care and meditation and so forth, but also with an emphasis on compassionate action, because that's our hope.

It's maybe a little too philosophical, but it has within it the spirit of inciting people into this kind of action that you're talking about. So I think some people listening to this are nurses and servants and helpers, but some people listening to it, they are not. They're like me. They have some kind of job, but they don't go out into their community and help so much. Okay. I love this question. I love this question. I have to tell this very short story, and it's an embarrassing story because it's a story about me helping somebody so that I don't seem like I'm doing some kind of nauseating virtue signaling or something. Let me just preface the story by saying, I don't generally do this to a point where it's like, I feel like incredibly guilty and lacking and dumb. So I'm driving to do a podcast, interviewing someone who is going to be a very spiritual podcast, and I pass someone who's begging on the street, and I drove by and they recognize me, and they go, Duncan, so this broke me out of the thing I do, which I think a lot of us do, which is when we're driving by, people who are asking for money, we ignore them. Just don't look at them, turn up the radio and drive by, and then to be purely honest, assign to them a set of characteristics that make it easier to deal with the fact that they are them and you are you, and those characteristics usually involve some kind of really old testament just, justices to where it's like, they're getting what they deserve. So I'm driving and I'm thinking like, oh my God, you're just going to drive, you're going to drive by? You can't just drive by, you're about to interview someone who is going to teach you about spirituality, and you're just going to drive by. So I turned around and then I parked, and you know, I happen to have a bunch of stuff in my car that I was already going to give away, like clothes I'm not wearing anymore. Again, all this stuff is just bare bones, compassion, nothing special in this at all. He comes over to my car, we start talking, and I'm looking at him, and you know, all of a sudden all the poison, you know, all the poison is, all the poison, it was like just evaporated by two seconds looking in someone's eyes and realizing, what's wrong, what the fuck? Why was I thinking that this was number one, something that I was too busy for, but number two, assigning to this person so many things that aren't there at all. This is a lucid, clear-eyed person, something in the way he was moving, kind of reminded me of one of my kids, you know, and so in that moment, it was, I can't explain, it was like I got air or something, or I can't explain it, or I reinflated, or I don't know, like in a good way. Anyway, what is the thing that is keeping us from that experience, what is, if you had to define, or if you could please talk about, the space between the you that is not in action, is not compassion in action, and the you that pushes past whatever that barrier is, what is that barrier made of, and why is it so hard to cross in a life? What a great question, first of all. That's a beautiful question, Duncan, because every single one of us, spiritual teacher, student, or person who never even thought about it, has driven past someone at an intersection and had maybe not all of the assumptions and judgments you're describing, but some of them as a justification for not slowing down, making the cars behind you wait for, you know, 10 seconds while you support that person. And I think, you know, that, I think you answered it in that story quite beautifully when you said it was that moment when you looked into their eyes and you saw, this is not somebody other than me or my kid. Yes. This is like my brother, my sister, my, this is, we're the same, not like we're the same in circumstances, obviously, but our humanity is the same, and our, the brightness and intelligence and spirit of just consciousness, we're conscious beings here, together on this earth, and I mean, what is it that allows us to have that moment? I mean, your heart was open enough that you actually turned around and went back. In a sense, he almost shamed you by recognizing you. He did. My heart was an open PSA. My heart, it was closed all the way back. It was, I was more like, oh my God, I'm annoyed. I was almost putting on some kind of show up until like I actually was talking to him. I'm just trying to be completely honest. This is the operating system you're talking to right now. I would love to say, as I'm driving there, a deer was rolling down and I'm like, oh, this being who is suffering, but it was more like, oh, who are you if you don't go back to this person? And, but then when I, when direct contact was made, and like, I just, that was when the thing that you're talking about happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, you know, your honesty and the way that you describe what you've gone through, no matter what it is, often telling stories about your own lapses in compassion or wisdom, right? Yeah. That's why we love you, Duncan, because you're speaking what everybody goes through and you're doing it fearlessly. You're not trying to pretend to be, you know, holier than you are. All right. And that's the best thing, because that really gives us a chance to actually connect and relate to each other and not imagine, oh, she's somebody other. She's a spiritual teacher. She doesn't go through yesterday. I was talking with my group about how we had gotten some news about Omicron, this variant, and we're supposed to be traveling to teach in January to Costa Rica and visiting my disabled brother, whom I haven't seen for four years, and the back of Beyond and the mountains of Southern Ecuador. And, you know, and suddenly we said, we got this news. My mind just spun out, Duncan. Me, who knows how to work with my mind, who knows how to work with my consciousness, it just spun out. My grandson's not going to have his senior year. My granddaughter already missed her spring of senior year, and colleges are going to shut down, and worse, you know, people are going to die, of course. I'm only thinking about my grandchildren. My little one, who's three, I'm thinking, this is the life he's known. He's never known in non-pandemic life. You have little ones in the same situation. So what allows us to rein that in, you know, to just take that contraction into fear or into shame or into, you are bothering me. I'm on my way somewhere, and I need to get there, and you're in my way. You know, that contracted view of life and self and world. What allows that to loosen and soften and expand into something that's just a little more inclusive and compassionate and kind? You know, in your case, it was, it was like, it could have been the voice of God or Buddha or saying, hey, Duncan, you're going to drive right by me and not give me another glance, you know? Right, right. Felt like that. Yeah, and I think that the other thing you're bringing up that's really important is you don't have to go all over the world doing heroic work, like my beloved friends who, you know, just died recently in a car accident, so tragically, who were all, you know, all over the world working with refugees and displaced people and just so courageous and compassionate and so forth. Well, we aren't all going to be heroes like that, but let's start right where we are on the curb or in the grocery store. Or, you know, you can, we can do what we can, and I think anything that leaves a situation, excuse me, I think I'm going to sneeze, anything that leaves a situation better than we found it, even picking up a piece of trash, it matters because everything, everything actually rests on the tip of our intention. It's the intention, the motivation that matters. You know, sometimes you can do some good thing and it's not received and or nobody sees it. Yeah, God forbid. You don't get any credit or merit badges for it, right? Yeah, right. But the intention of leaving things or people just a little better than you found them, that is actually opening for the heart. That is part of what dissolves those barriers that you're talking about that we all have between each other, barriers of fear and judgment and conditioning and whatnot. So, I don't know, that's just one, one kind of answer. And I think, you know, we both love Ram Dass, the teacher that we recently were at that retreat. You were there virtually, I was there actually, you know, for his celebrating his legacy. And I mean, look at, nobody would choose to be in a situation that Ram Dass found himself in, which is that he had a stroke and was paralyzed in sitting in a wheelchair for 20 years in pain. I mean, none of us would want to go into those circumstances. But he got so deep and so loving by just, well, it was the choicelessness of no escape, right? But he would have done all kinds of things to numb himself or, but he didn't, you know, he had the training and the wisdom to go right deep into it. And he turned it all into wisdom and compassion, so much so that we're inspired by just being in his presence or the love that still radiates from who he was. And, you know, I think that just comes from conscious embodied, embrace sounds too strong, but acceptance sounds too wishy-washy or something or preachy or something. But how the full embrace of your actual lived life and circumstances, even the ones that limit your activity, right, they're going to open new doors. Well, yeah, okay. So, yes, I love that. It's like surrendering to the business of where you're at. You know, this is where you're at. And these days, some of my most paranoid friends, there's a sense of our freedom has been so taken away. And there's a kind of paralysis that sets in, a real legitimate paralysis where I always say, these people, me, I get paralyzed. And so I'm doom-scrolling, trauma, watching like trauma porn, you know, like forensic files, date line, the worst news I can possibly find trauma porn. And then from that, getting increasingly freaked out, increasingly shut down, increasingly paranoid. And then I start thinking, oh my God, yeah, like our freedoms are so limited these days. And when the reality is no freedom, there is, you have just as much freedom as you had before to go and help somebody, to go, you know, that's, like there's no, that thing, whatever that is, it isn't, that is something that is seemingly unlimited. I mean, resources might determine what that looks like for you, the individual, but that intention, as you're putting it, which I love, because it even lightens it even more, that can't be stolen, taken, cut up. So to me, in this way of thinking there, it feels somehow revolutionary, because it feels so weird, strangely frustrating or something that not only that I can't seem to continue to do this more and more, but neither can anybody else. Because if this, what we're a way of being, naturally, for all of us, the world as we know it would cease to exist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I think that question of feeling the freedoms are being taken away, it's actually a lack of imagination that people have. Wow. You know, they don't have enough imagination. Let's face it, if you have imagination, I talked to a woman yesterday who is kind of, she's shut in, and she doesn't see any way that she can be of help. But she has a place to live, she's not houseless. And I said, do you have like a pad of paper? Do you have a way of getting an envelope and a stamp? I mean, you could write some letters. There's people in prison who would love to get a letter from you. Anybody, you know, there's something, there's always something that you can do. It's just, you might need some help with imagining what that could be. Because when you're down, or when you're, when you're wearing those blinders of complaint, or reactivity, then you, it actually stifles the imagination. It stifles your creativity. How creative are you, Duncan, and you're a creative guy? How creative are you when you're bummed and, you know, complaining and watching Trauma porn, right? Not at all. Is that force your creativity? It's the opposite of creativity. It's literally, if you had to name a polar opposite of creativity, it's, I never thought of that, by the way. I've never thought what's the opposite of this. It's sitting on a paralyzed, watching stories of other people's catastrophes and imagining that you, there's nothing that could be done other than just watch it. Yeah, or getting all worked up, because you're certain that everything is fraudulent, and somebody stole the election and, you know, COVID is a hoax. And these people are dying of other causes that aren't being recorded. And they're old people mostly anyway and blah, I mean, all, all of that getting and stewing, I think just stewing and getting caught in loops, obsessional thinking, looping around and around. It doesn't even matter what the content of the thinking is. It doesn't even matter if it's misinformation or true information. That kind of mental obsessing and looping that happens a lot during the day, we don't even notice I really think that's part of what is a contraction from the actual vastness of who we are and of our being. I read something recently that was a different take on what's happening in our country right now. So many overlapping crises and not really sure if we're going to get to solve them the way that they need to be solved. And it was from Valerie Carr and she said, breathe, labor, push, what if this darkness and it's, and I wanted to say something about the word dark, because it's, it's got negative connotations that don't belong to it, like in many parts of the world, but in our country, especially like the darker your skin, the more sort of negativity there can be associated with that kind of racism. So just being, but this is also the day before the winter solstice, which happens to be the darkest day of the year, right? And we're in a time that feels a little dark right now as we head into the light of the holidays, right? And she says, what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb, but the darkness of the womb? What if our America is not dead, but a country waiting to be born? What if the story of America is one long labor? What if all our grandmothers and grandfathers are standing behind us now, those who survived occupation and genocide, slavery and Jim Crow, detentions and political assault? What if they're whispering in our ear tonight, your brain? What if this is our nation's great transition, breathe, labor, push? Well, you've probably never experienced transition in labor. I mean, no, I've watched it. I haven't experienced. Watch it. So you, it's a time when you actually go kind of crazy, like your mind just separates from your body because what's happening is so intense. And in my case, I kept having this thought of, if I hadn't moved to Buffalo, New York, this wouldn't have happened. Like these crazy thoughts. And you just forget for, at least I did. I mean, maybe other women are more enlightened, but I forgot that I was there having a baby. And all I was was writing in pain in that moment. And I actually did have a big, big spiritual experience earlier in my labor, but not during the transition. During the transition, by definition, it's kind of like the winter solstice. You don't see the light, you know, it's just, it's that, it's that interim phase. They call it the bardo in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, but that transition and it feels like, you know, in the solstice, there's this moment where the sun actually stops for a minute. Now in the northern hemisphere, it's, it's the winter solstice. But it actually, it actually stops for, I don't know, how many seconds I didn't read about it. I just, wait, may I clarify? You mean the period from where you are not in labor to when you are in labor, you're talking about the time in between those. No, no, no, I'm talking about the period when you're, you've been in labor and you're about transition to pushing, pushing. Okay, okay, okay, I got you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I just made this assumption that everybody's been in labor and everybody's had a baby and obviously that's not true. So yeah, transition is when you're transitioning from like active labor to pushing. Okay, got it. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that, that transition time, like when you're in active labor, okay, your body is doing it, you're not doing it. For me, that was my first huge insight into no self, watching my uterus contract when I did not contract it, nor could I. And I was like, oh my God, what is this? I remember looking at my belly and just feeling like, like I'm on the roller coaster and it's clicking up, click, click, click, click, click, and you know it's going to go down. Yeah. You're going to have a baby. There's no way out. Wow. I mean, whatever kind of baby emerges, you aren't, anyway, you understand what I'm saying. Yes, I understand from the outside for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think if we look at this time a little bit like that, that we don't know what's going to be born from it, but we do know always something will be born. And you know, it's, it's, it's really, it's hard to keep this more vast perspective when things are tough. It's hard to realize that nobody can actually take your freedom away from you. Right. Except you. Right. There's a beautiful little book that the Vietnamese Zen master, Thich Nhat Hanh, Zen teacher, we say now, called Be Free Where You Are. And it's really written for incarcerated folks and really showing them how even in that literally imprisoned life they can create a sense of inner freedom. And I feel like I don't mean if people who are incarcerated can do it. I can do it. Yeah. I want to thank Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

Yeah, I have the freedom to my car and drive wherever I want, walk wherever I want to go, etc. Well, you know, I have a few thoughts from what you just say that again, please. I said, I'm sorry, that was just coming back to what you said. Oh, thank you are sorry. It's beautiful. What you're saying is beautiful. It's it's that restructuring. Is that what you mean by freedom? The ability to in whatever situation you may be in to reassess it in a way that doesn't make it as a prison, you could like what you just did is freedom you you converted what the experience a lot of us are having from you know, being locked in locked down or if we're not locked in or locked down, scared, annoyed, bitter, inconvenienced in the most maximum way, frustrated for our kids, scared for our kids, you just didn't what you just said, you transformed it into a possibility of something that's that it isn't so dire. Is that what you mean by freedom, the human ability to reassess? Yeah, reassess or reframe. You know, I sometimes I think of it the way we talk about it in psychotherapy is a reframe, but a reframe doesn't work. You can't just paste a smiley face on something shitty. It doesn't work. A reframe only works if it has truth and possibility in it, real truth and you know what I'm saying. So all the things that you're mentioning that fear, the frustration, the I mean, I feel all of that too. It's just a question of what do we do with those feelings? You know, and how do we hold those feelings and where do they take us? You know, and I mean, one of the practices that I did yesterday with folks that I find actually really helpful, I think it's just imagine you're sitting way up in the sky up on a up on a star and you're sitting on a star and you know, you're swinging your legs and you're looking down with nothing but compassion in your heart, nothing but love in your heart and you're looking at yourself in your life today. You know, you're looking at all, you're just looking at just the places where whatever you're doing, you know, maybe engaging in activities or relationships that actually don't nourish your spirit or serve you in any way, you know, but also it gives me a way to remember that I can expand beyond this sense of separate self encapsulated in my own thought world and really access something bigger and look at my life with a kind eye, like, okay, you know, where could I maybe be creating some more sense of groundedness or balance or harmony or, you know, these good things that make us feel good. Right. Yes. This is, see, to me, it's something like the dark, you know, the in terms of like lack of light, not the photon reflectivity of your skin. The dark part or the terrifying darkness is that place of complete forgetfulness of this, of this very simple reality, which, which is incredibly liberating to me. It's that moment you realize I can at the very least make some effort to transform my community as micro community is that may be even if it's my dogs or, you know, my whatever it is, I can, I can start trying to make this better instead of keeping the status quo or even worse, sliding into some awful spiral of just depression or whatever that to me the scary darkness is when is the possibility that you can just stay asleep to that possibility. I had this thought the other day. Sometimes I have woken up, gone about my day and gone back to sleep without waking up. I'm not sleepwalking, but I'm so reactive and so in a set pattern that I don't wake up. I so for 24 hours, I'm dead asleep to the world. I'm seeing my own projections until I close my eyes and see my own projections in the form of dreams. That's scary to me. That's the void or the abyss or the or that pot. That's scary to me. So what you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, seems to be that in any given moment, you can turn on a light. It's in that light is the intent this in this ability to help. Am I over reducing things? No, I think that's right. I mean, for one thing, you know, walking around asleep. Yeah, I mean, that's, we all know that state Duncan. And again, I always thank you for your honesty and just sharing what it's like to be you because what it's like to be you is what it's like to be a human being in this particular moment in all eternity, right? This particular historical and geographical and everything, you know, personal moment. But to go back to the beginning of what you said, you know, even if you live alone and you don't have a pet, I you have a houseplant, your plants will respond to your advice. And I actually have a more mysterious sense of that it matters if we cultivate joy, if it matters if we brighten our hearts, even if no one else sees us, we don't see anybody else. Because I'm speaking to the people who are looking at the possibility of lockdown and feeling suicidal, frankly, you know, just really who maybe we're living alone and feeling kind of lonesome anyway, before being prohibited from going out and doing stuff with other people. But yeah, I and I think I sometimes think of what it must have been like for if there were, I mean, if there were beings who experienced, say, the days growing shorter and shorter and the nights growing longer and longer, and they didn't know about the solstice, you know, they didn't know that, oh, the days are going to start to lengthen again as of tomorrow, you know, little by little get brighter and oh, this is a cycle of whatever you want to call it, you know, brightening, darkening, expansion, contraction, withdrawal of light, return of the light, lots of ways to look at this rhythm of life. But one of the things I learned from doing long, silent meditation retreats, I'm talking like 100 days, three months, is that what I, it wasn't like so many hugely different insights came up after three months. Yes, you can go into all different kinds of meditative states and and learn stuff that way about dimensions of your consciousness. But in terms of sort of psychological, emotional, personal insights, what I did see from spending those kinds of long periods of time is something that I can tell you and everybody, all our listeners here, you don't have to go and be silent and meditate intensively day and night for three months to learn about the cycles of everything, you know, it's cycles of moods, the cycles of experiences that you go through, they do repeat themselves in different, maybe different configurations, but beginning to have some trust in this cyclical nature of expansion and contraction and that after contravention, there will be opening again, and after the shortening days, there will be light again. And after, do you know what I mean, just really seeing these cycles of life. I think maybe maybe it's easier for women from a younger age, because you have your monthly cycles, your moon cycles that you know, I don't know, it's a certain kind of rhythm. But anybody who breathes in and out can notice a cycle of expansion and contraction. Do you mean it's like if we don't, if I don't see these cycles, then I'm perpetually letting myself get terrified by the reappearance of what appears to be like the end of the world or my own, you know, the thing that everyone says like, Oh my God, there it is again. I knew things would go bad. And what do you know? Here it is, it's going bad. If you don't see that this is some loop in your own life, because you haven't seen the less overt parts of the cycle, then yeah, then suddenly you can really start imagining the universe is attacking you instead of recognizing that what you're looking at is just one part of a continuum of energy that keeps repeating. Is that that's what you mean? Yes. Yes. Thank you. That is what I mean. I mean, we can say it a lot of different ways, but but that feeling of being asleep or being reactive all day long. I mean, that was, you know, people think there's this phrase, life is suffering that people attribute to Buddhism, right? But if you see that suffering as just the kind of reactivity that you're describing where things just bug you, they just irritate you and you want to either push them away or you just want to grab on to things that will give you some relief and be pleasurable, you know, grab your pleasures, push away your pain. That way of living unfortunately keeps us kind of asleep. And yet it seems to be it's the way we're wired for survival, right? Nobody wants to go after pain usually unless it's linked to pleasure for some reason, like sexual or something. Yeah. But yeah, and when I think about the metaverse, for example, I think, oh my gosh, is this going to be a space where everyone's projections, they get to live now, not only in reality reality, but virtual reality in their own projections? Or is this going to be a space that allows people to tap into something more vast and more magical and yeah, more mysterious and timeless beyond our ordinary vision, maybe more deep. I don't know. I've got some, I've got a lot of thoughts on the metaverse. And I, you know, some of them are really scary. Not scary, but just sort of like samsara, this wheel of suffering, that the mandala of suffering and, you know, maybe this is just, you know, our own version of the, you know, what do they say? Brahmin breathes out the universe and then breathes it back in, rinse and repeat, Alan Watts famously talking about, you know, what would you do if you could do anything? Eventually you would want to be limited and forget that you are God. And that's where you're at right now. This metaverse thing makes me think, Oh, clearly we are in a simulation. We already went into the metaverse and some other alternate reality where as part of going into the metaverse, some of us decided to turn it on high, meaning we forgot that we went into the metaverse so we could fully enjoy it. And that's where we're at now in the metaverse. We're making another metaverse and the same cycle is going to repeat. We're always getting our consciousness probably infinitely being sucked siphoned into varying forms of technology, sometimes organic technology, like what we are sometimes silicon, but just never ending channeling of our tech of our consciousness forever and it's for kind of Gnostic trap. But before we get into that, I have to ask you, Trudy, because this is another chapter of the podcast before we get into that chapter. This mindfulness practice in my own experience, it has given me the ability to identify some of the cycles that I didn't know were cycles, specifically my own aggressive nature. So sometimes days before I like have some kind of terrible reaction to my life or just to what I perceive as something that isn't right. I feel it coming down the pipes. I can feel it. I think, oh my god, there's that there's that thing. That means that at some point, I don't know when there's a high chance that I'm going to like be reactive in a really not good way. So I've come to identify this thing. I find it to be incredibly mystifying. And I don't understand, do you know what I'm talking about? Have you heard of something like this before, where like, like a meteor impact or something like, but you identify a way out in space. That just means your mindfulness is strong, Duncan. Well, thank you. But it doesn't isn't doing anything about the meteor impact. It's just giving me more time to dread the impact. This is what I wanted to ask you. Is there a way to convert it? Is this number two parts of the question? One, is that karma that I'm stumbling upon? Is that my own karma? And two, is there a way to turn to turn the meteor into flowers, knock it off course? How much control do we have over these cycles? Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's a great question. I mean, when I said your mindfulness is strong, I mean, your awareness that you see you feel it coming, that kind of awareness is in you. And when your mindfulness is strong, then you have a way to work with what's coming that meteor doesn't have to, you know, blow your cool to smithereens and throw you into some kind of really unpleasant state. You have the strength of awareness to see it coming. And you know, when it comes, you can't stop it. I mean, life has painful things in it. And they're going to happen. You know, I just recently lost two of my dearest friends. What were their names? To a stupid accident, Katie J. Scott and Gabriel Storing, who founded IACT, this anti genocide group, very small, but mighty in their impact. And you know, painful things are going to happen in our life. And so it's not that we, and sometimes we're going to feel smashed by the meteor. If it's a big enough thing, it just breaks apart. But where the mindfulness comes in, I think where the mindfulness comes in is that you can make everything into consciousness and you don't necessarily want to be conscious of the super painful things you want to numb yourself. The more you can sort of stay conscious, you can call it awake, you can call it mindful, you can call it knowing what's happening. But the more you can bear the unbearable, I feel like that's ultimately what mindfulness does for us. We can bear the unbearable because unbearable is really a thought. You know what, I'm going to read you, I just want to read you one more quote. This is, let me find it. This is from my friend Mirabaya Starr. She's a wonderful teacher. And she, I was actually with her on a day that you never want to live through, which is the day that her daughter died. And her daughter was 14, Jenny. And just briefly, she died in a car crash also. And this is what Mirabaya said in her book, which is called The Caravan of No Despair. With reticence at first, in other words, she didn't want to. And then courage, I dared to grieve my child. I practiced turning toward a feeling I didn't think I could survive. I practiced abiding with what is. I sat with that. I did it as an act of devotion for Jenny, saying yes to the mystery, expressing my ongoing love for her. Showing up for a devastating loss was an act of love. It wasn't trying to be spiritual. I knew that it was all about love. It was all that I could do. So that's the extreme, okay? Yeah. That's the extreme. But you know what? This has to work in the extremes. Otherwise, it's kind of bullshit. Excuse me. Yeah. You know, because times in life when we're up against it, you know, hopefully none of us is going to lose a child. That's the worst. But there's times when we're up against it. We lose a parent. We lose a loved one. In times of COVID, we're losing friends. You know, and to be able to dare to feel what we feel. I love that she calls it courage. Courage to be heartbroken. Courage to be flattened. Courage to be in total despair. And then realize it's an act of love that I care so much. I care so much about life that when I see it turning in a direction I don't want to see. I grieve. I rebel. I get angry. I mean, these are all forms of grief. Even hating is a form of grief. But how do you do that? That you're getting to the core of something I've been wondering after is like, yes, hate. And, you know, as far as the grief goes, you know, things like losing someone you love and these things where this kind of hate or this kind of these any feeling is justified. But what if you're missing that reason? What if you're missing that component for the hate? What if just sometimes hate, irascibility, selfishness, high levels of aversion and a general sort of adversarial sense of your relationship to the universe that you are part of are showing up minus some kind of reason for that? How do we show up for those sorts of states of consciousness, Trudy? And is it inauthentic to not articulate them? Is it inauthentic to feel those things and put a smile on our face and try to be kind to those around us even though sometimes it feels like we've been suctioned up into the underbelly of some kind of lovecraftian fractal of sentient tentacles? First of all, I trust there is always a reason we just don't always know it. There is always a reason for the feelings that you're having or that I'm having. And it's so interesting because I'm writing a memoir right now. I have these two chapters where I fight off an attacker, one kind of literally and one just strategically in my mind. But each time I escape from the danger that I was in, then I have these other chapters where I marry somebody that I don't even want to marry because my mom asked me, are you sleeping with him, honey? Now remember, this is 50 years ago, my mom asked me, are you sleeping with him, honey? And I said, yes. And she said, then you have to marry him. And I fucking did. Excuse my French. And then there's these other places where, you know, I just was like a wuss really very, very unable to stand up for myself and my own rights. And I was saying, I was looking at these chapters and I said to Jack, I think I'm just going to leave out those two chapters about the attack because they absolutely don't fit with the other person who couldn't even, you know, stand up for herself about who she's marrying. And he said, no, that's interesting because that's interesting that you would be both ways, you know, and I bring this up because I don't know myself. I don't know those two parts of why they couldn't have connected and why they couldn't have kicked in. I don't know. I just know that we'd go into this crumpled, helpless state and say yes to things I wanted to say no to. Right? I don't need to know why. I don't, I mean, yeah, I could go back to psychoanalysis and probably have a reason, but would that even be the reason or would it just be some concoction? I don't know. This point, I don't know. Well, in my life, it was probably easier to know. But whatever, the point that I'm making is just that you can trust there's a reason for why you feel slimy tentacles embracing you and starting or the, you know, I don't want to give snakes a bad name. I love them but or the boa that's starting to tighten around you so that, you know, each breath in, you breathe a little and then each breath out, tighten so you can't breathe in as much the next time and write that feeling. There's a reason and we don't have to know the reason, but what we do need to do, I believe, you know, that maybe maybe one way of answering your question or responding, rather, I don't have any answers of responding to your question is that when you trust that there's a good reason for the feeling you're having, even if it's not something you could name or locate, you know, no way, even if you were tortured, you wouldn't come up with it. But just having that compassionate attitude. Oh, I'm feeling this way for a reason. I don't know why, but I know there's a good reason and that's enough of a justification to be kind to myself and to treat myself as tenderly as I would as if I had, you know, lost a friend or gotten a big, gotten rejected from my first choice of school or, you know, gotten fired from my job or didn't get the promotion or, you know, all the things that can really just disappoint us. Yeah. Yeah, because that that's one of the I hear that people say, you know, this isn't any, it's not like I fill in the blank. It's not like I lost, you know, it's I know like I'm my family still alive, but I'm feeling this way. It's like, I love what you're saying because you're still experiencing whatever that may be if you were think you know the reason it's still suffering. Exactly, exactly. And you know, this is something we oppress ourselves with all the time that feeling of, well, I don't have any right to this feeling because I have enough to eat and I have a house and it's warm in here. And in fact, I even have a husband I adore and I get to live with him. And so what do I care if there's lockdown, I'll be okay. It's, it's irrelevant, actually, it's irrelevant. I could work with my mind. I don't want to, but I could work with my mind if I was cold on the street, right now. Yeah, you see. And I don't have to say just because I'm not cold on the street, I don't have a right to feel bereft or feel despair or feel it's a feeling, which means like everything else in this world, it's impermanent. Yeah, you know, it's not going to last. We're going to be flooded and drowned and destroyed by our emotions. And it can feel like that, but it isn't going to happen. Right, right. It doesn't last like a little kid in the bathtub and they watch the water swirling down the drain and suddenly they get terrified. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, I wait a minute, right? Am I next? Exactly. Yeah. Or it's like, you know, yesterday I was playing with our little grandson and he he loves his train wooden train tracks and he can spend it seems like, you know, hours is probably 10 minutes where he's just quietly, you know, pushing the train around the track. And I don't know what went on with him earlier in the day, but when we got alone together in his room with the train, and I kind of settled into what is obviously not the most stimulating activity watching him, you know, run the train around the track. He gave me a kind of calculating look like this. I'm tilting my head and looking kind of a scans. And he tentatively picked up one of his wooden train tracks and just landed across the room. And I said, well, that's okay, just don't throw it at me. And he proceeded to throw every piece of track like with huge force and including his engine and and some of the props, you know, around the tracks, he threw them all across the room. And I was watching him, I just said to him, Oh, wow, sometimes you just feel like throwing the stuff. And you should have he broke into this huge grin. Like, you get it. You get it. I just feel like throwing stuff. Yeah, I'm just throwing shit as hard as I can. Who knows what happened earlier in the day? Maybe he wasn't allowed to have what he wanted or you know, right? Yes. Yeah. And, you know, okay, I'm a therapist so I can hold that experience for him and support him. But we could do that for ourselves too. This is just a day when I feel like throwing shit against the wall. Am I going to get down on myself for having that feeling? Am I going to throw stuff and break it? Probably not. But do you know, because I'm not three years old, but we can have some of that understanding for ourselves. Right. Yeah, it's you. Am I just repeating myself over and over? No, this is your it's just something I've been thinking in terms of authenticity and like, when do I throw the train set? You know, when versus, you know what I mean, when do you throw the train set? Or even when do you articulate to your wife or whoever? You know, I feel like throwing fucking train sets today versus when do you just allow that feeling, you know, give yourself compassion for having the feeling, but instead. Both. I feel like throwing my fucking train set against the wall today. And I can be compassionate with myself for being in this state, which is really hard to bear. Right. Or you know, the other night, like Jack came up to me and he and I, I was kind of relaxing. It was the end of the day. I was actually on my cheese swing. I don't know if you know what that is. It's just a really fun thing. You put your feet in it and it just waggles them back and forth. It's called a vitality swing and I love it. I don't know what it is. I'm lying there on my cheese swing and Jack comes up and says to me sort of tenderly something about my grief and my sorrow about KDJ and Gabe, but I wasn't feeling it at that moment. And I was just like, I mean, I wish I hadn't, but I think I even said thanks a lot. Like I wasn't feeling sad, but it turned out he was sad about something. Right. Right. Yeah. He was, because I was just like, I don't want to talk about it now. I'm actually on my cheese swing. I'm okay. I don't want to talk about it, but it kept kind of, and then I realized, oh my God, he needs to talk. Duh. He needs to talk. Oh my God. I'm the king of the feet in the cheese swing. Like, what's wrong? Really? No, I'm not. I feel fine. What are you talking about? I'm doing great. I'm fine. I'm good. Don't you see my feet? Yes, I'm the king of that. They're so right. It's so, it's like, yeah, yeah, your feet are in a cheese swing. We all know you're happy. This is sometimes a person's way of saying, I feel terrible. Oh my God. That's so brilliant. I forget that all the time. And, you know, look, we're all human. I don't want to have my sad feelings all the time. I don't. And yet sometimes, you know, that's how grief works. That's probably how all the emotions work. Sometimes you're free of them, and then they come and grab you by the ankle and pull you under. And then you are, there you are in that view. I loved your image. You know, actually, I love, I love octopus. So tentacles isn't really that sinister to me. I saw an octopus when we were at the retreat in Hawaii and it was really just so fluid and beautiful. Beautiful. And it made me think about, you know, the octopus can change its color. It's, it's beautiful. It's like a shiver that just floats over their skin and they totally change color to camouflage. And it reminds me of your question about authenticity. Like sometimes I do think we need to change color, like just shiver that the emotional coloring or tone of our experience to meet a moment in relationship where it might not be so skillful to show that emotion. Right. Do you see that? But I think it's not so much in authenticity as another form of love and respect of realizing, okay, this is not the moment. Right. My first husband used to always tell me, your timing is terrible. Like you always bring things up at the wrong moment. And I would say, well, when would be a right moment? You know, it's like when the woman, I mean, this is gendered stereotypically, but in heteronormative couples, when the woman says we have to talk, the man usually experiences a shiver of relational dread. And it doesn't have to be gendered. It can be whoever's playing the role in a couple, in a partnership of who brings up the stuff to deal. Right. Yes. But I don't think it's inauthentic to not display the emotion. If it's somebody you're close to, you can say, you know, actually at this moment, if you come closer to me, I might have to bite your head off. So this isn't the moment. But do you know what I mean? Like, if it's someone you're not close to and you're at work, yeah, I mean, be the octopus just for that moment. Right. I got you. Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm again, you're identified. This is one of the things Aaron and I have had fights about is, you know, she'll say, I need to talk to you about something. And I will say some version of really tired, you know, I was at was at work all day. So I don't, I can't talk about that right now. And she will generally say, okay, but I can't talk to you about it when you're at work. And if I can't talk to you about it when you're not at work, then you mean, don't talk as essentially why you figured out to do. I don't mean to be like that. I, you know, but I do that sometimes because I'm terrible at these things, Judy, terrible. I'm like that. Well, we all are. We all are. None of us were taught Duncan, none of us were taught this kind of emotional literacy because our parents weren't taught it and they didn't know how either. And these things just cascade down the generations. And, you know, uh, yeah, I don't think, you know, I can talk a good game, but I'm not always good at it. And I'm just like, leave me alone. I'm on my cheese swing. Um, yeah, but you know, we're all yeah, we're humans and we can be compassionate for ourselves. And I, you know, to bring it back, what I will carry with me from this conversation is that intention of making what's around you a little better. I feel like that's the, that, that is the most, to me, you know, the Dalai Lama famously said, my religion is kindness, but that is that what you were saying is the religion. Like that's the religion that takes a million different forms and a million different names. And, uh, it's, it's, uh, strangely easy to forget. You've given me too much time already. I have one last tiny question for you, a cheesy question, an obvious question. And I hope you do have time for just one what can, what's like, what's for the holidays or whatever. Can you give us some prescription for a direct on the street, direct action, something, something, if we have the ability to get out of our houses, a direct action, or maybe we don't have to get out of our houses, what's something we can do to put us into the compassion field of helping others. A real prescription, please. Okay, so I'm going to say something a little counterintuitive, which is, um, I really feel like the only way to get into the compassion field of wanting to, you know, leave somebody else a little better than you found them is to open your heart to your own self and, you know, to the own, to stay in whatever is the light of your heart. It might be, I don't know, might be going for a walk. It might be seeing a bird. We have an owl that's perched on a tree outside. I'll text you a picture of it. It's, it's amazing to see this owl that can swivel its head all the way around. It brings me joy. So it's like whatever brings you the tiniest flicker of light or shred of joy. Focus on that. Focus on that. Intend to turn your heart in that direction. It's not denial. It's not, you know, trying to paste a smiley face on anything that's happening. You can just turn, even in the most tumultuous times, which we're in, actually, you can just turn your heart in that direction, you know, and I don't think that we can be a light or kindness for others if we aren't having, shining some of that light and kindness on ourselves, whether it's through taking time to meditate, taking time for any kind of self-care that you can do. And that can take just, you know, it's only limited by your imagination, you know, what you can do to help yourself feel better. And, and so the mission, really, I think for the holidays, our mission statement for all of us could be, could we be as happy and inspired as possible, just even little threads of it? Can we just mine that vein of, of gold or silver, you know, because sure, we all have the problems of everything that we have in our lives, providing for ourselves, learning how to communicate more effectively in our relationships. And but there is a real power that we have within ourselves. And that's the power to have the intention, to direct our intention, to direct our attention, excuse me, in a positive direction. And I feel like everything we do, every opportunity that we have to take any kind of action that we can be a little conscious about or a little mindful about is an opportunity to do this. And for the holidays right now, and for this transition time into we don't even know where or what, it's a good practice. It's a practice of loving kindness and self compassion to do this. Because the brighter my heart is, and the more loving I can be, that is contagious. You feel it, I feel you. You know what I mean? We brighten our world in ways that we aren't even aware of. Right. But when you walk into a room, if somebody is miserable, you can feel, it's like a little hole in the energy where a lot of attention kind of drains into their, I guess, like in black holes, they have that gravitational feel or something. But the same is true of the opposite. When somebody's radiating like Ram Dass did, you can have a whole field of love. And we don't need to feel like, okay, I'm not Ram Dass, I can't generate a powerful field of love that everyone's going to flock to. It's not necessary. Just a half smile. Yeah. Yeah. Just a little smile. And, you know, and it can feel like I'm smiling from the bottom of a deep well. But I'm still pooling. I've seen it all and I'm still smiling. That's you Duncan. Smiling from the bottom of a well. I love that. Yes. You could still smile. You could still smile up and whoever's up there. Oh, thank you, Trudy. You can smile with the ridiculousness of your fate that there's no one up there. I mean, you can still smile at the absurdity of your fate. Thank you. Thank you, Trudy. Thank you, Duncan. I am so honored that I get to have these conversations with you. And just on behalf of all of us, thank you for all the work that you are doing. And we are just so grateful. Thank you. Thank you, Duncan, for brightening our world. Thank you so much. And thank you for listening, all you who are out there listening. Where can people find you, Trudy? Oh, they can find me at my outdated about to be rebuilt website. TrudyGoodman.com has my little blogs that I write. And they can find me Sunday mornings, lots of Sunday mornings at inside LA for our Sunday morning sitting group. And I just want to say I don't know when people are going to when are people going to hear this? When is it best for you? You tell me I can release it whatever. Oh, I just want to say that having a Christmas Eve songs from Broadway, meditation, meeting, and it's going to be seven o'clock Eastern time, four o'clock Pacific time, you can find it on the inside LA website. I don't know if people will hear this. No, this answers the question. I'll put this out this week. This is perfect. And and also another thing that might be good for people on Christmas Day, I'm teaching at a group called hope. And I forget heart opening, I forget what it stands for. But it's for people who have lost a loved one who may have died by suicide, or who are considering dying by suicide themselves, because they're at the bottom of the well and unable to smile. So we have a group on Christmas Day for people who are feeling that down. And and I'm just mentioning that, because if you want to join, just, you know, go to inside LA dot org, inside LA dot org, and you can register. Wow, that is so sweet that you do that. Thank you, Trudy. And then Sunday morning, the 26th also at the sitting group, you can find me. You got it. All those links, if you didn't write them down, are going to be at dunkintrustle.com, so that you can find them. Thank you so much, Trudy. You're the best. Thank you.

396^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - JONAH RAY IS A TIME TRAVELER Transcript and Discussion^2016-05-27^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hi pals, it's me, Duncan, and I think I'm reaching my final form. I've recently become obsessed with landscaping and gardening. I started mulching all of these old dead flower beds around my house, and I gotta tell you man, I've never done heroin, but if heroin is anything like putting down mulch, then send me some heroin, because I love mulching. Mulching is the answer. If I could, I would put mulch everywhere. I would cover an article with mulch. I would put mulch in most of the ocean, leave just enough to go snorkeling. It smells good, and it's glorious. I just love to mulch. That's where I'm at now. I went to this meditation retreat in Hawaii recently, and I've been thinking a lot about it, and trying to articulate some kind of distillation of what I learned at this most recent meditation retreat. And I got nothing, man, outside of the fact that right now, I really just enjoy being outside and putting down mulch on things. That's what I got out of it, and maybe that's the final realization for me in this incarnation. Maybe that's it for me. I'm not saying there's not higher levels of understanding. Clearly they must be, but I would imagine that somewhere in the path of the Buddha's realization, and I forgive me if it seems like I'm comparing myself to the Buddha. I don't mean to be, but I would imagine that as the Buddha was gaining enlightenment, there must have been some tiny little pixel inside of him, just some little flickering piece of understanding, obscured by all the other massive, grand, universal realizations. We're all one, sure. Everybody's one consciousness, sure. Love is the most important thing. Sure, everything is nothing, but nothing is love. Fine, but I bet somewhere in there, somewhere, in some tiny little way, he thought to himself, mulching is as good as it gets, man. Putting down wood chips onto that which was dead, just watching the instantaneous transformation that happens to an old dried up clump of just brittle old dirt, just bad cat litter looking dried up dirt. When it suddenly turns into a sweet bed of that brown glory we call mulch, then the world gets a little better. That's my spiritual epiphany from this meditation retreat that I went to. And sure, I could try to make this whole mulching thing some kind of obvious metaphor for the spiritual path. We're all dried up dead flower beds and the Dharma or wisdom or the understanding that you can be reborn in any moment is the mulch that transforms that which was dead inside of us into some brand new thing and that the flowers that grow from the mulch of wisdom that we have scattered upon, the dried up dead carcass of our former selves is what makes the world a better place. But I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know for certain that mulching is the way. Mulching is the middle way. Guys, we've got a great podcast for you. Jonah Ray is our guest today and I didn't mean to make that rhyme, but he is a really cool person. I'm very excited to upload this interview. He's got a lot of amazing things going on for him, man. He's the new host of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which if you aren't aware of this show, please immediately look it up. It's such a great show and for a lot of us it was one of the great shows, one of the shows that for whatever reason impacted us in our comedic understanding. It's a great show and it's really cool that he's the host. He's also the host of another brand new show, which is coming out on CISO, which is NBC's Internet Appendage. This show is called Hidden America. It's kind of an Anthony Bourdain parody. Anyway, but aside from all that stuff, he's just a super cool guy. I can't wait for you guys to hear the conversation we just had. We're going to jump right into it, but first, some quick business. Not to spoil the conversation you're about to hear, but one of the takeaways that I got from chatting with Jonah was the very simple advice, which is just do something, do it. Why not? Whatever the thing is you want to do, just start doing it and don't try to do it in its heightened, perfect form. Just do it as well as you can right now in the moment. And if you do that, you will get a kind of orgasm. You know, one of the many interesting things that Terrence McKenna said was that he views people who've never taken a psychedelic or had a psychedelic experience in the same way as virgins. Like these are people who've never had an orgasm before. And in the same way, I think that if you've never allowed yourself to create something and put it out into the world, then out of fear or whatever, then you are keeping yourself in the kind of exhilarating, life-affirming beauty that is available to all people. You've got to puke out the God stuff from time to time, man. And I don't mean to intertwine that kind of metaphysical shit into a commercial, but Squarespace is a wonderful way to start self-publishing without having to spend a shit ton of money on a web designer and who knows who these people are. You're going to end up with one of these snarling dragons concealed as a mildly pudgy man who says you can build a website for you for insane hourly rates. There's a lot of fake web designers out there. They circle around the homes of all the creative people in the world. Did you know this is actually a horrifying trend that's been going on in some of the neighborhoods of the world? People have been putting out those wildlife cams and analyzing the pictures. And aside from all the various things that many people see in the backyards of America, grizzly bears, raccoons, apes, a lot of people have been seeing images of these fucking pseudo web designers who clamber out of their internet ethernet burrow holes and climb out of the Google complex. They shoot down these holes like the containers that get sucked into the bank machines, these suction tubes, and these tubes emerge into the yards of so many creative Americans and they climb out like satanic hell-moles, clamber up to your window, and gaze in. And if it seems like you're in the market to build a website, they'll accidentally run into you at a Starbucks, pretend that they weren't living in your backyard, and they'll trick you into giving them tons of money to make a sub-par ship website. And this is where Squarespace comes in. If you go to Squarespace.com, you can avoid the mole people known as the pseudo web designers, and you can begin to actualize your creative idea in some way or another onto the worldwide web. And sure, maybe the worldwide web is very similar to the Amazon in the sense that it's a piranha infested monster containing demon stream that holds within it some of the angriest critics that have ever walked the face of this earth. Vile human beings who see a flower and it makes them spit bloody mucus at the cutest thing that they could find. Sure, it's out there and anything that you put on the internet, more or less there's going to be some percentage of people who treat it as though it were some kind of witch that just turned their cows milk black. And so there's some fear involved in self-publishing, but there's something really exciting and fun about taking those steps in the direction of getting shit out into the world. And there's never been a better time in human history to do that thanks to the internet. So if you want to start a nice do-it-yourself business, whatever it may be, I'm sorry I'm going a little long on this commercial, forgive me. I know someone who sells their socks online, I always say it, but I just want to really hammer that point home. If someone can sell their stinky socks on the internet, there's no reason that you can't sell some other stinky thing that you have on you or inside of you. And you don't just have to sell stinky things. There's a real possibility that that itching feeling you have inside of you about the business you want to start isn't just an imaginary dream, but it's a thing that could actually not only make you money, but make you happy. It'll make you feel like you're doing something. So give them a shot, go to Squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan, and you will get 10% off a beautiful brand new website. They have everything you need, the website scale to any kind of device that you're using, and they have built-in shopping carts so you can start selling stuff right away. And they also have great customer support, great online customer support. So they're a great company and they're one of my longest patrons. And so I hope you will at least pay them a visit if you're in the market for a beautiful website. Go to Squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan, you'll get 10% off. Also, I'm doing a show next week in New York. It's on June 2nd. It's at the Deepak Chopra Theater. I'll have links on the comment section of this website. I'm going to be doing a podcast interview. This is a series that the Ram Dass people are putting on. I'm doing a podcast with Pete Holmes and some Buddhists. And so the name of the event, which I really don't care for, is something like Comedy Meets Consciousness or something like that, which is fine, whatever I get it. But the moment you add the comedy label to anything, the moment you add comedy or consciousness to anything, you create a kind of a variety of expectations for what it's going to look like. And it's all rather embarrassing, but that's what they're calling it. Comedy Meets Consciousness. But I don't know that anything funny is going to come out of my mouth up there during the interview that I'm going to do. But it's going to be fun. That's the point. And it's going to be super cool. I just like having heavy-duty conversations with people who are interesting. And I really love having conversations with people who are living a real spiritual path. Because those people, to me, seem so special. And quite often they say things that are instantaneously actionable in a person's life and somewhere or another they can add mulch to your old dried garden that you call your heart. All right, guys. Oh yeah, very quickly. We're also sponsored by Amazon.com. If you want to support the podcast, a great way to do it is go through our Amazon portal, which is located in the comment section of any of these episodes. If you do that, anything that you buy on Amazon, that'll give us a very small percentage of. And it's a great way to support the podcast. It costs you nothing. And it keeps you out of these terrible things that we call stores. Because you don't want to go in those things, not around Labor Day. Is that what we're having now? Or Memorial Day? You don't want any day. You don't want to go to these things around any holiday or day at all. There's no reason to do it anymore. You can order anything that you need online and spend the time you would have spent driving through traffic to end up in some kind of dark, can covered maze of doom outside enjoying the beautiful rays of the incredible sun that float somewhere out there above our very flat, very small, very young earth. Go through the portal. It's located at dugitrustle.com and it's in the comment section of any website. Bookmark that portal and go buy yourself some plastic stuff.

So for those of you who couldn't get t-shirts at any of the shows because we sold out or because we got screwed over by a t-shirt company that didn't give us the shirts we needed on time, they're now available at the store. I have a license. The image on there has been licensed like 400 of them and that's it. So once those run out, I don't know if we're going to keep making them, but maybe they'll let me license some more. I don't know. So get them now if you wanted to get a tour t-shirt. All right, guys, that's it. We're going to jump right into this podcast. As mentioned before, you're about to hear a conversation with the host of Jonah Ray's Hidden America, a very funny show that's going to be on CISO TV. And he's also the brand new host of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Everybody, please turn your eyes in the direction of the vast cosmos that surrounds the flat earth that we live on that earth, which is controlled by reptilians. Send as much love as you can past the invisible metaphysical force field the reptilians use to prevent love from being transmitted into the cosmos. Bounce that love off of the moon and send it down to wherever Jonah Ray may currently be inhabiting. Please welcome to the DTFH, the magnificent Jonah Ray. Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is, Jonah Ray. Jonah Ray, welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Art Podcast. Man, I'm so happy to have you here. And you're somebody when I'm thinking of like guests that I'd like to have. You always think of you and then somehow I never reach out or it just hasn't happened. So thanks for coming up here. Thanks for having me. Man, before we, one thing I want to ask you about is Hawaii. Yeah, you just were there. I was just in Hawaii. What island though? Maui. Okay, never been. And you're Oahu. Yeah, Oahu. Now, how far away is that from Maui? I don't know, like probably like a 45 minute hour and a half plane ride. I don't know, I never went. How many years did you grow up? I was there until I was 19. So you were just, fuck it, I'm going to stay on this island. Well, what are you going to, it's more of the same in a way. You know, it's a, if you talk to people who are from Hawaii, they, you know, I went to Kauai because my dad like won a competition at work and they like sent us on a vacation to Kauai. What work? Uh, his like, his, uh, like it was mainly he, he was, uh, he worked for my, his dad's company. It was kind of keep plumbing. They put plumbing and pipes into houses and housing developments. And then like they had this like thing within the union, the Piper's and Fiddler's union and my dad won. Wanted a trip to Kauai. Kauai, first family. Where'd you stay? Uh, we went all over. We stayed at the Princeville. We stayed like in some like Poipu Beach and, uh, I remember when we were there, I saw, that's why I saw Terminator 2, uh, Judgment Day. So it was a good trip. Wow. I had that in there. I had the Bill and Ted's bogus journey soundtrack on repeat on my Walkman. Wow. That's so cool. Dude. So that's kind of shocking to me though that, so people in Hawaii, I guess you're just born in, you're, you're born there? I was born there. And so was my dad and his dad and his dad. So you're just born into this beauty, you're born into the thing. And so you don't think about it that way though. People eventually do, but not for someone like me who wanted to do more, uh, like started getting interested in things that would only happen on the mainland. Uh, it's like, you start to kind of resent the beauty. And, and I remember I didn't appreciate until I was, uh, going to the airport for like the last time I was finally moving out and I'm going up the H3 over, you know, through the Hualau mountains and I was just like, Oh boy, this place is insane. And it's, and I, I think about all the time, there's nothing else like it. I'm sure you felt that when you were there. Yeah. It's very specific. Um, it's very specific. It's not like any other, as far as I can tell any other, you know, South Pacific islands and it's just, it feels, it's just so isolated and so perfect. Do you believe there's a metaphysical energy there? I think you, you can't help but, uh, think there would be, um, mainly just the thing is though, it's like, it's just that part of the, it has to have a certain feeling because you, you're never on that part of the globe anywhere else. You're never on that part of the globe near that part of the equator near in the middle of the biggest ocean in the world. So there's got to be a different feeling there than anywhere else. And I think that influences people's views on it and feelings. It's a, it, when you, whenever I go there, it's the feeling of being buffeted by some kind of super positive, incredible energy, but whenever I go there, I do, we do think corn, I often fantasize about moving there. And then I think, well, this is a small town in the middle of the ocean that you can't drive out of. Yeah. That's how I've always described every time people go, almost been so great growing up in Hawaii. I said, take whatever kind of boring small town you're from, carve it out of the earth and put it in the middle of nowhere. You know, it's like, it's like Hawaii and then there's like, you know, Bakersfield. These are the two places, like if you carved out Bakersfield, you would get that, you know, and it's just, and that's claustrophobic for a kid, man. Yeah. Especially as I started getting into music, I started getting into comedy, you know, also like, you know, the music and comedy there, I mean, there was the punk scene, sure, but it was only ever that, like no one ever broke out, you know, of the punk scene. Like in Hawaii, it was every kind of punk, you know, there would be like a, like, you know, a band that sounds like it was like a metal band, a ska band, like a gutter punk band, you know, and then guys with synths and stuff like that. Is anyone who was kind of on the frays of independent music, they all played the same shows. How would you describe the punk ethic? What is that? Essentially, DIY, I think it's a do-it-yourself and like, and that can, it could really be, punk rock can really be defined any way you want it to. But I kind of think of it as a, as a, like a jam, like try to jam a conno as it, like the minimum would say, we jam a conno. That means like do it on your own, do it as the best you can, like, you know, it's like make sure it's stuff you want to do, because it's like the more you let other people start to let, tell you what to do, the less you're going to want to do yourself. Like I, there was a lot of times in my life where I, you know, in this career where I started working on something and it gave me money and I started following the money and then a year down the line, I found myself very unhappy. Right. And then I started to think a lot about like, you know, the bands I loved growing up and how like nobody knows who they are for the grand scheme of things, even some of the biggest punk bands ever, like to me, like, you know, Minor Threat, Ian Mackay, most people who ever existed will never know who Ian Mackay is, but it doesn't change the fact that it means so much to me. Right. So if that, then what? So maybe if I just focus on what I want to do and just do everything the way I want to do it without trying to compromise anything for money or to have it be more popular or have it me be more famous. If I focus on just the things that make me happy, then, and then, then I'll be happy. And that's kind of my, my approach to punk rock in life. It's like, don't, don't chase the money, you know, like makes my, my, my mantra to myself is make stuff not money. But you are, I mean, but you've pulled this off because you are making money. You're, you're the co-host of Meltdown. You are going to be the new host of mystery science theater. Are you fucking kidding? And you have this bad ass new show on CISO called Hidden America. And so when you're talking about this punk ethic or somehow evading the tendency of whatever your idea is to get diluted whenever you get into a collaboration, especially a collaboration where there's a lot of money on the line for like, you know, like when NBC throws a bunch of money at you to make a show, someone's taking a risk. Someone is, and so that means that there's this, there is a money based collaboration that starts happening. Sure. How do you work around that? Well, it's their risk. I've tried to establish and I make no bones about how I, you know, want to do things the way I want to do it. And I, you know, the, the pilot for the show, I haven't seen so I originally did that for another network that like a lot of our friends have like shows on and, you know, I, You can't say the network. I'll say, I don't give a shit. True TV. Okay. So I made it for true TV and the guy I was working with was great. He was this really awesome producer. You made a pilot or the whole series? I made the pilot. Okay. And like, well, they asked for a scene. They're like, we'll give you a couple of bucks for a scene and then me and the director guy were just like, let's just make the whole episode because in context, the scene wouldn't really work. It would just feel like a sketch when it's kind of this bigger idea of what sketch can do. And so, you know what, before you go on, can you tell, can you do a synopsis of what the show is? Uh, the show is called Hind America with Jonah Ray. It is a Bourdain type travel log show parody. So essentially the places are real. I go all over the country, but everyone I meet is fake. And you nail the Bourdain thing, and you nail the Bourdain nostalgia that kind of like syrupy connection he has with everything. Everything. No matter what, it's everything. And he's great. And I love it. I was like the whole time I listened to his book and it's just like, you can just, yeah, it's like, you know, you'll never get a better glass of water than you will at this diner at this time of day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did a good job though. It doesn't feel like you, it doesn't feel like you're like, you hate Bourdain. It just feels like you've definitely have apprehended his mood and you've done a really good job of bending it in a comedic way. It's really cool. Thanks. Yeah. No, I'm really stoked on it. It's a lot of fun. We had a ton of great people working on it too. It was kind of just, it's an idea I have for so long. And I, the thing that made me start working on it seriously was this Alan Partridge special called The Places of My Life, which is a, you know, Alan Partridge. Yes. Yeah. Steve Cogan's character. Well, he did a special and I saw it like on the plane to London on my honeymoon and I was just crying with laughter and it was just this awesome special he did where it's just he's showing his town. It's like, it's like, it's like, welcome to The Places of My Life. And like, he just, but it's so low rent and everything sucks. It's really funny. It's so good. I like, I love it when he's just like, he brags about going to the Land Rover, like, you know, lot to go and test drive. That's like one of the things he likes to do. Wow. It's just so like, I saw, I saw then I was like, I should really do that idea I've had for a long time, which is almost a secret sketch show in that, you know, I talked to somebody and they're a character and I play straight man to them the most I can. Do you not playing straight man, did that, does that bug you at all? It seems like that's a, for a comedian, that's, that's got to get annoying at times. I have a friend who's playing a straight man on a show and we talk about it and he's like, man, it's like really hard because a part of you wants to be the star of the scene and you're having to constantly give the spotlight. It's a, well, you know, some of my favorite, you know, performers have been straight man, like Andy Daly, I think is like one of the best straight men ever, but it doesn't take away from the fact when he does characters, he just destroys. Yes, that's true. I like the idea of being a straight man, you know, when Kumail and I perform on the meltdown, it's kind of like, we kind of trade off straight man tendencies. I don't know, I like, I like facilitating because it feels like I'm helping, I'd rather facilitate the scene than myself. What about the nightmare of not being able to laugh when someone's being really funny? It's tough. Yeah, man. It happens a couple of times, like when I was doing the scenes with Brendan Small, where it's like he just kept on throwing stuff out and I just have to act like I'm like wincing at what he's saying, you know, there's all those little tricks you can do where you kind of start to rub your eye, like you're upset or something like that. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, there's, I found all these little tricks to do. Where did you find that you just discovered them on your own or something? Yeah. Like, you know, what do you, like, what else does your face do when it looks like you're about to smile and you can kind of just, oh, you just kind of turn your head or. It's so cool. Yeah, it was, it was, it was fun. And I don't, I don't mind it, but I also like, there were times where, you know, the tricky part of it is like, because I have to stay at a certain level of straight madness in the show. Yeah. To drift around because all the characters are crazy and I have to, you know, you can't have two crazy people on a scene because that's hat on a hat and you start to lose the idea of what the scene is or the sketch is. And also I have to connect all the scenes. So no matter how crazy stuff gets, I have to always be able to kind of bring it back in with some kind of interior monologue or justifying the thing. So it always had to stay within some parameters. You know, man, the, I watched the New Orleans episode, don't want to spoil it. Very funny, but it has one of the funniest and you threw the, you, you were the punch line, which was cool because that, that is what the straight man's supposed to do. But you were the punch line in this incredible, like, it was a, it was a, What's seeing it? What are you talking about? It's a true joke. Oh yeah. And, and, and, and I'm, and I was thinking, my God, this is an, this is not NBC. This is an NBC. Affiliated show. Affiliated show. Yeah. And they let you get that joke in. Did you have to fight for that? Uh, no. I mean, that was the pilot. So we didn't, I didn't have to clear anything with anybody. But once we did start writing stuff, they did, they did back off. See, so they were really good, barely any notes. Every once in a while, they would say, we don't want you doing that. And then I would have to kind of step up and go, here's why I want to do it. And also notes are always an opportunity to kind of rethink a joke anyway. Right. Um, you know, we're going to, I want to do this one bit in Atlanta where I go to a store to try on like an old union soldier, you know, costume, just to see what it was like for those guys to fight the Confederates. But they don't have any union soldier costumes in my size. And so they're like, I got one that'll fit you. And it's a Confederate soldier costume and it like, it fits magnificently. I'm like, this is so nice. And the guy goes like, Oh yeah, always the bad guys always had the best tailors. I go, what more, give me more. And it just like throughout, like, you know, Nazi outfit feeling great, you know, like all these different like horrible things. And I'm just like sashaying and I'm, and it's a, we never got around to it because they were just like, we're like, you cannot be in a Nazi outfit. So that's where, that was where the force field popped up. And I could have, I could have pushed for it, but like the director guy, uh, who was Troy Miller from like Fly the Concords and Mr. show and stuff like that, he was like, he was just like, he's like, you don't want to, you don't want to like fight for that. Cause it's like, you're not Jewish and it feels weird after a while, you know, cause Sarah Silverman can do it. She's Jewish. Mel Brooks did it. He's Jewish, you know, uh, see that, that right there, that bit of gracefulness when it comes to negotiating with people on your team, that requires a lot of like swallowing your ego a little bit, because especially coming from a punk ethic, there's got to be a part of you that bristles at anyone telling you what to do, right? Yeah. No, for sure. For sure. Like, uh, there was one, the only one I really got mad at for that one, I, I get it. It's, it's a little, you know, it's a little weird, but I wanted to have, we would do this other thing in Atlanta where this reverend is having a gun adoption thing, like a puppy adoption. So people just come and they just get guns for free. And he's just like, he's like, if everyone has a gun, nobody has a gun. It's like the cold war. You know, everyone had missiles. Nobody. Yeah. And so, um, and so like we wanted this thing where it's like a little kid like grabs like the biggest guns, like mommy, I want this one. And it's like, are you sure you're going to take care of it? You know, just, you know, find and replace, you know, humor, uh, in that one. But, um, they're like, you can't have a kid with a gun. I was like, well, I don't understand like what the big deal is. And like guns, right? And like, and there had just been a shooting. I mean, you know, throw a rock, but like, it was just like, they're like, you just can't do it. And I was like, I mean, there's so many opportunities to fight when you're making something that you want to make. And that was, if it, for me, the, the, the thing I would think in my head was if it doesn't ruin the bit, if it doesn't take away from the main idea, then I don't care. I don't care. It's like, it's what, if it's one beat of a thing that has seven beats, I don't care. It's, you know, I'll take it back. And I don't, I don't mind. And, you know, like in LA episode, I, I say, uh, the F word and I say the N word. And they were in like, they didn't, they don't care about that. No, but it's more of a political stance than it is to do with language these days. No one really cares about language anymore. No, it's starting to like, yeah, get a bit pushed. But yeah, it's all those kind of weird, like the gun stuff. I'm so sensitive about it. And, you know, I find it silly because in comedy, you should be able to be a joke around about, I'm not saying like, you know, I'm an equal opportunity offender. You know, I'm not that kind of guy, but I don't see the, the, the big deal with it. I think it's just fear. I think you shouldn't really, it's like, it just, to me, it reeked of, you know, kind of this, uh, like, We just don't know, do we? Because you're looking at like the, you know, NBC is a conglomerate of super wealthy people that all contribute money to varying political factions that all have things that they don't want their money going to promote. And that's where it becomes like so interesting and complicated and who the fuck knows where the notes coming from or why it's really weird. And this is that strange dance. When you decide to do anything with a big corporation, this is the kind of dance that you have to get really good at doing either that or what do you do? You just, well, I think most of those, I think most notes, uh, when it comes to a sense of material are all based off of fear. And so if you try to just explain to them the commentary and the humor of it, I think you can always massage it in your favor, uh, because it's, you know, people, that's a response, someone that, you know, someone that can't like, you know, make a, make a, like a sex joke in their office every day. We don't live in those offices. We don't have to care about that stuff. We don't have to worry about HR department coming down on us. So we have this more fluid way of existing in the world where these people are in these rigid corporate structures. And so they, they live in those structures every day. They're in those cubicles and those offices in their, they're in the, you know, the kitchen area and like this is, that's, it's all very right angle world. Um, and then they start to work on, uh, with creative people and creative things, which are this, these globulous, uh, you know, not rigid things. And so they try to squeeze it in and they try to make, you know, understand it, but they, they don't, and they can't, and that's fine because their whole world is just like ones and zeros. Right. Yeah. Some of them, it does seem like that, that especially, well, I mean, it's just everyone's job. It's a job, like you can get fired. You can get, you, you're at some meeting and someone gets fucking pissed at you because you let Jonah raised, you know, do a goddamn, uh, not to uniform joke. Yeah, I get it, man, but it's, it's really cool from what I saw. There's no fee. What I thought, it didn't feel constrained to me at all. It felt like, it felt exciting to think that a network is letting this kind of stuff emerge on the internet and, and that's a, that's good news for all of us that hopefully things are loosening up and things are, they're going to start taking more risks and move away from the, whatever the awful, uh, constraints that come from having to put shows on TV, on that out there in the media. And it's all because it's, it's coming not so much from the creative executives at these companies, but more so from the, the ad side of these businesses. It's like, you know, they have to worry about the commercials and they have to worry about the companies that are given the money to make these shows. But the further we get away from it, even, you know, when I worked at E, uh, and like G four, it's the fear that some of the creative executives had for just the people who, uh, set the schedule up, they're like, they're like, we, we tried to talk to them. They want it on at 1am. I'm sorry. That shit drives me nuts. John, I can't believe it. Whenever you get into con, whenever you come into contact with the force field and it emerges and you know, this is an imaginary thing. You're worried about nothing. And in fact, these force fields are the thing that's fucking up your medium more than the content. And, and so, you know, it's cause it's so easy to judge a show. Like, and I do it all the time. You watch a show on TV and you think, this fucking sucks. What a piece of shit. Right. You watch and you're like, this is an absolute atrocious abomination. And then you realize it's not the creators of the show who are the monsters here. They probably had a really good idea. Yeah. It's whatever filtration mechanism that creative idea had to go through that ends, it's like the opposite of a water filter, man. It's like, instead of having charcoal in your filter, it's like a nice chunk of dried shit that takes what, that takes relatively clean water and makes it dirtier. Well, anytime you have an idea, by the time you start saying, like that idea is perfect, you think the idea is perfect, you start to tell somebody about it, it's already a little bit ruined. You write it down, it's ruined even more. You start to cast it, you shoot it every step of the way it's ruined. And then you get to editing and you're like, this idea I had was so great. And then that's like the only other time you have to try and fix everything else. You know what it's like, man? You know those little turtles that, you know, when turtles, they lay eggs in the, in the, in the sand and little baby turtles go off into the ocean. And it's cute to watch this parade of beautiful young baby turtles running down into the sea and 99% of those things are going to get fucking eaten in the first like five minutes. That's what these ideas are like. They're like beautiful, sweet, perfect baby turtles. And the moment they go running into the ocean, that is whatever your collaboration is, there's a good chance they're going to get eaten or mutated or transformed into something. So whenever I see something on TV that is funny at all, it's like, wow, yeah, that's a miracle that that, that happened. That's the sperm that made it. That's the sperm that made it. Yeah, exactly, man. It's, it's, yeah, it's incredible. The more you make stuff, the more you realize, like, it's, you know, I guess I like, I let stuff wash over me now. I don't get angry when I see something bad. I just kind of go, not for me or that's okay. You know, I don't get angry at bad TV or movies anymore just because you understand the process is just someone trying to change the whole step of the way. I mean, even like, even though like the director guy, I had it primarily like he's done so many great things. He has so many great ideas. Every once in a while, he's going to have a different idea than me. Sure. And then I'm going to be sitting in the edit bay going, I wish I had it. I wish I was able to get it my way, but it's okay. We'll figure it out. It's weird, isn't it? There's an entire group of people in the world that sits in front of their TVs or computer screens clenching their fists and rage over, over what is just a person trying to make something good. Fuck them for trying. That's what that, you know, that's, that's the feeling I get. Fuck me for trying, huh? Yeah. I don't know. I just, last night I was, you know, I, the last night I was realizing I was like, man, I do remember we gave critics such shit for so long. Oh, what are you a critic? Oh, everyone's a critic, a critic. It's like, we just gave them shit for so long. Now I miss the days when critics were the only people that were educated enough to make comments on art. Now everybody's able to. Now a post about me on the AV club goes up and I got to hear all these guys that look exactly like me. Just fucking destroying me, talking about how I'm the most unlikeable, punchable person they've ever met. Is this because of Mystery Science Theater? I mean, that sure woke up the beast. That woke up the many people. I mean, that you, you crossed into the temple of doom when you, when you, when when you were anointed, I mean, that is a, they could have picked, he could have picked the Dalai Lama as being the next and people would still be like, he's too old to look at this fucking old Tibetan guy. He can't do just something, man. So that, but, you know, growing up that I have memories of like specific comedic events in my life that were just mind blowing. And it was, you know, sadly, and now it's sad. It's the first time I heard Bill Cosby out before everyone knew he was a Quailude rapist. That would have been a great anecdote just a couple of years ago. Yeah, yeah. But now it's like when you, when you didn't know that was a kid. It was like, I think that's the first time to stand up and say, whoa, this is fucking hilarious. It was when I saw the Holy Grail. Yeah. Holy shit, man. This was, you know, like you would double over laughing. And then it was Mystery Science Theater where it's like, oh my God. Yeah. Two of the greatest things combining here. Someone has actually picked out the shittiest movies they could find and they're making hilarious jokes about them. And it was just, it's one of those shows that like, I'll, Awkwateen hunger force, these are the shows that have a very like, and I think for a lot of us, that's maybe why people are being so protective of it, because this is a precious, precious thing. Oh, sure, sure. I mean, I would have, if it wasn't me, I would have been highly skeptical of whoever was picked. I mean, I, I tried to tell all the people that were giving me shit. I said, how do you think I feel? I can't complain about the new guy. I don't, I don't have the opportunity to, but I do every day, you know, I complain about myself, but I, um, I really think it's, it's still weird to me. It's still weird to me that it's, it happened. I don't, it's like the one, it's the one thing I wanted to do. It's like, you know, when I saw, when I saw it as a kid and I got obsessed with it and I, you know, got the, the VHS tapes and I got, had the shirts and, you know, just, just, yeah. When Mike showed up, I was like, who the fuck is this guy? And then like, I realized I was like, wait, that's the guy that played Torgo and the Torgo's pizza sketch from Mano's hands of it. You know, just like, you know, I, I loved it so much. And plus it's like one of, when I moved out to, uh, LA, one of the only like VHS as I had, uh, was like the Mr. Science movie. So I would put that on all the time. It was kind of a comfort thing. And, you know, that movie, like, like I would listen to it while going to sleep almost every night, just cause like I knew it so well and it's just a nice thing to listen to. How did it happen? How'd you, how'd you get that, how'd you get that job, man? What's taken me from the beginning? Well, I saw a genie and I had three wishes. It does feel like not, I, the more I think about you as that host, it completely makes sense, but, but it does feel like this is something you always dreamed about and you did it. So to me, this, some magic is involved in this somewhere along the way. Oh yeah. I, it's, I don't even know how to really even like found them. I remember the first like Hollywood type meeting I had, you know, I was doing improv, I was doing stand up and then like, you know, a guy says, Hey, come in and meet with us. And you know, that's one of those general meetings. Like, well, what would the Duncan Trussell show be? You're just like, I, I just do an overmix. I don't know what to, a comedy, you know, uh, and so I remember, but when they asked me, I said, and this was in 2002 or three, uh, I go, you know, I really think you, we should bring back mystery science theater 3000 and I can be the host. And they all laughed at me. Little did they know nostalgia would be the number one moneymaker, uh, you know, over a decade later, but you know, it's what I wanted to do. And it's, um, it's meeting you had was not related to the thing that finally, no, this was in like 2003 and it was just you throwing shit against the wall. I knew it was gone. I wanted it back, but you articulated the desire. You've been back then. How long have you been doing stand up comedy since 2002? And that meeting was in like 2003 or something. So you've been doing comedy for a year and you already had the balls to be like, I want to host one of the great shows. That's cool, man. You're a confident guy. I'm not though. It's just, that was, that was just stupidity talking. Like, you know, like, uh, that was just me going like, well, well, well, with the generation will be someone else's show. Stupidity or was it? Cause don't you feel like there's like a PCU, even when you are in Hawaii. I don't mean this from a like ego, like a narcissistic place either. But don't you feel like you've always had this kind of like crystal clear sort of weird sense that this was going to happen. Was it, was it like comedy as a occupation or like shit, man, something's going to have, I know, like there's something that made you in the same way. Those little turtles go down into the sea. So there's something that got Jonah Ray to climb out of the comfortable nest of Hawaii and come to Los Angeles. Did, there must be something in you that knew that this was going to happen. Well, all I knew really is that I just wanted to have a career in comedy. It was a thing that made me the most happy, um, growing up. And so the opportunity to be able to do that, you know, I really think most of like what we do is almost throw in a pebble back in time to another younger version of us who might be listening to this right now going, oh man, yeah, yeah. And then they go on to do it. And what they do, they get to our point in the timeline and they throw it back. And then it's just, you know, I really think a lot of this stuff is time travel. Um, it's, uh, you know, because of being obsessed with Mel Brooks and Weird Al Yankovic and Mr. Science Theatre 1000, because of those things, I wanted to do comedy. And then because I'd started doing comedy because of those things, I got to meet those guys. Like now I'm working with some of those guys. Like it's, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, it's very circular and it's very, it's magic. It's magic. And it feels like some kind of magic. And I don't, I mean, like, not like, you know, like it's magic, but like it feels like some, there's some kind of hidden force involved in all of this. And I know it's a lot of hard work too, but. Oh, sure, sure. But yeah, I wouldn't, but I mean, as we go along, it's, it's nuts. It's, you know, I put in the work and it, it works out. And that's scary when things work out. And it's, it's, it's really frightening. Acceleration is always frightening. Yeah. I don't like it. I was talking to like our friend Matt Dwyer the other day and he's like, he's like, I kind of feel like I have momentum. I was like, don't ever feel like you have momentum. Like, just, like, just be and just do and just don't think about like, yeah. Yeah. Please, like, you know, get in the moment and do that stuff. But I was talking to an old friend of mine that I grew up with. Like we watched mystery science together. We were in bands together and stuff like that. And he was, he was kind of at a place where he like, you know, he's like a year older than me and he was like 34, 35. And he goes, um, and he's like, you know, just quit like another coffee shop job in New York. And he's like, he's like, what, what's the, what was the difference? What was like, we were into the same things. We were doing the same things. Why is this happening to you? And like, what is it happening to me? And I was just like, I told him, I was like, I just did it. That's the only difference. I made the point of going to do it. And you said it, you said it. I said, I'm going to go to LA and I'm going to go be a person in comedy. And you said, I'm going to be the, I want to be the host of Mystery Science Theater. And you said it and you say you said it out of stupidity. I think you said it out of some kind of instinctual understanding that when you articulate things, sometimes they happen. Yeah. I think it's a huge thing of, uh, just stating what you want. And I didn't for a long time, you know, I, um, when I first started doing comedy, you know, it's a, I remember you, do you remember this? It's like, it was like kind of bad to say that you also wanted to act or do anything outside of comedy. Guys like David Taylor would go, no, you should only be wanting to do the thing where it's like, how dare you use stand up as a step yourself. Because in a way it is a tiny bit disrespectful to the pure art of stand up comedy to say I'm doing this, but I also hope it will get me this other thing. Can I just say that what I think is disrespectful to the art of comedy is for anyone to make any kind of fucking rule about why you should do it. Yes. I think that's the ultimate sin. It's like, oh really? You're going to apply some kind of goddamn, I don't know, some kind of Old Testament style law to this thing, which most of us don't even understand why we're doing it. Some of us are doing it in the same way my dog chews its paw when it's stressed out, it has to do it. It just does it as a form of sickness. You know, the idea that this is so, I mean, I, uh, even anytime I find myself applying any rule to call, oh, you can't do that is a comic. You can never do that. Yeah. Anytime you hear that it's generally the person who says it is going to be proven wrong because the comedy is like that. Remember those, uh, remember those, uh, well, I guess they're kind of like pocket pussies, but they used to sell them as toys at the toy store. Oh, the little, like the balloons with water that hold it, they won't let you hold it, what you try to hold it, it squirms out of your hand. It feels like that's what comedy is too. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Every time you think you got a handle on it, or every time you think like, once I do it this way, I got it and you don't, and it goes back to people saying that out of fear, it's like, they're scared that if you start saying, I want to do this, like, uh, then, and then they don't. And then it works out for you. And it's, it's embarrassing. Trying is embarrassing. Uh, Wayne White says beauty is embarrassing and it truly is. Wow. Like it's like, it's, it's all vanity and, and what you, like anything we do is only to try and perpetuate us as our, our beings, uh, right now, which are just like in none of it matters. We're going to be dead and buried. Like to think that like everything that's like important to us is still pop culture, things, books that were written the 1800s in the essence of the time of the world, that's still pop culture. Wow. You know, and to, and to think that like we're desperately trying to like, you know, have a blip on a piece of dust of this part of time right now is, is, is, is narcissism and it's vanity. But in the end, that's okay. Cause that's all we got right now. So wouldn't it be fun if we just tried? Yes. I agree. I think, uh, yes, 100% man. And the, um, but to get back to the, to, and I don't mean to be shoe, shoe horning is how you say, I don't mean to be shoe horning you into the role of some kind of wizard here, but in general, I do think that there is a, I'm, I'm always interested in the component, the component that the, I know the hard work is the, a big part of it. And I saw this, um, I've gotten into archery lately or shooting. I saw all those, yeah. So I, I saw this. It's gotta be good for your breathing. This is just cause he isn't at all about focusing on your breathing. And it's a, it's a meditative, right? Interestingly, it's this, it's called instinctual archery. And what's really curious about it is that it's about not focusing on anything. Oh, the more you think about what you're doing, the more you fuck up. It's like hitting this strange place where you don't really know how you're doing it. And when you, I got some books on it, was reading about it and all of them are just like, well, here's like the basics. Here's how you should stand. Here's the, the, the basics. But after that, if you think too much, Oh, is my arm in the right place? Oh, is it? If you think about any of that shit, you're going to generally be off. So it's a really, you would love it. No, that sounds great. Cause I'm a better bowler when I've had some drinks. So maybe that's kind of similar concept. Bowling and archery. Actually, and you'd probably get an archery if you're good at bowling because it's, um, it's this, I imagine it's a very similar kind of, even though bowling, it's all form, there's an extra piece to it, right? That extra piece is what I'm interested in. And just about everything, man. So, um, in archery, the, uh, I, I looked up a video, this world famous archer and, uh, a guy like, he was making these insane shots, like crazy, crazy trick shots, like shooting arrows through PVC piping that goes through balloons that pierces a Euro like shit like that. And the guy he's with is like, that's a lucky shot. And the, the archer, I can't remember his name now. He says, you know what I've noticed the harder I work, the luckier I get. Yeah. And I always think about that. It's really cool. But, um, but I'm, what is the one meeting or thing that if you hadn't gone to that meeting, or if you hadn't done that thing, you wouldn't now be the host of mystery science theater. Well, if I'm to trace it back, um, I guess it would be, uh, I was, you know, I'd made a bunch of sketches, uh, with, uh, Peter Tencio and Neil Mahoney and stuff like that. Um, and, uh, Chris Hardwick, who we had known for, you know, years just through standup, like, uh, like he liked those videos a lot. He got a job hosting a show called web soup. Okay. Um, it's like this, you know, you know, this stuff, it's all, it's all breaking ice. It's the butterfly wing, man. It's the flap of the butterfly that starts the hurricane, but it's fun to try to trace it back to the one thing. If you hadn't have done it. Yeah, the one, the one thing. Yeah. So the one thing is coming up where it's, uh, and then I, uh, basically, you know, I had those videos and I was done and, and like, uh, gone through a bad breakup and then I decided I was going to start just, I was just going to get some kind of writing job on whatever it doesn't matter. I'm going to get some health insurance. I'm going to, you know, get a 401k and, and show like that. Um, and I was working on the show that I was miserable at called the Rotten Tomato Show. It was a TV show based off of the website and I was just miserable and I wasn't doing anything I liked. I was barely doing standup, nothing that creative, uh, really. And, um, and then I get a, uh, email from Hardwick saying, uh, Hey, I just got, uh, I just got the show and like they're looking for, uh, writers. Um, and they, they had actually seen some of your videos and they wanted to know if you wanted to come in for a meeting. And I was like, I don't know, man, like how long has it picked up for? Cause I'm on this, I got this gig for a year, like a year of a steady paycheck. And that was the first time I was ever going to have something like that. And it was kind of creative. And that's the thing you'll find when you do this job, it's like, you'll kind of take these gigs cause it's like, it's like, it's kind of what I want to do. And then you do it. And then like, it's like, it just starts to deviate slowly from what you really want to do. And then all of a sudden you've got all this money, but you're so far away from what made you happy in the first place. And so don't you think not to just not to stop you, but don't you think that the, the other God, do you ever read the Invisibles? Jesus Christ is so good. It's by Grant Morrison. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. And I was reading, uh, there's a scene in it where the main character has been captured by these like Masonic occultists and they have him tied up and they're trying to basically get him to transform into, you know, they're trying not only to like read his mind, but somewhere in this torture that they're doing to him, they say, it's, we don't just want what's in your mind. We want our enemies to, to become our allies. We want you just to shift into seeing things our way. And so on this path that you're talking about, when you die to get diverted, it's the real horrifying thing about it. Isn't so much the, uh, dissonance that comes when you recognize that your path is the, that you're on is not the path you wanted to be on. It's when you start rationalizing and then tricking yourself into, this is the path I wanted to be on all along. Even though that crystal clear part of you is always like, no, this isn't it. You're tricking yourself. You know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to make you slightly unhappy all the time. You know, it's like, it's like those guys you talk to that, you know, live back home or wherever, you know, just like, no, no, things are good. Things are good. I can get some more hours at the factory and, um, yeah, she wants to have another kid, uh, you hear, you hear that. You know, you know, it's, and if you want that, that's fantastic. If you don't, you can hear it. They'll do like, um, things are pretty good. Like you hear it, like that swallow in that. That's the, that's them swallowing back down the thing they wanted to do. So they can rationalize. So fucking intense, man. But what do you recommend for people like that? What do you want to, because this is the thing. I mean, let's imagine this person that we just manufactured a person who has a kid, a person who has a full time job and a kid. They've got to take care of, and yet somewhere inside of them is that thing that you're talking about that wants to come out. What do they do, Jonah? Any creative thing. I have like so many friends that are still in punk bands and they're in their mid forties and they have kids and they, they still have their creative endeavor. They still go out in place shows. And I know it's tough, but then they all have jobs. There's very like, you know, J.M. O'Connell, doing something creative doesn't mean you have to be a millionaire. It's like, I like to consider, you know, myself, not like a blue collar comedian, but like, like a blue collar entertainment person. Like I just, I'm, I'm just work. I just want the work and I want to work on the stuff I want. I want to make my wares. I want to shuffle into town. I want to sell my spoons and bowls. Okay. That's cool. I want to set up my shop on Main Street and I don't want to give a shit about any of the other shops, what they're selling, because this is the kind of thing I sell. People want to see a J.R. on the thing. It's like, and if they don't, I don't give a shit because I'm still just making my own shop. Confidence. Yeah, that's, that's new to me. This is the, confidence is new for me at all. And I, and it's always on the verge of going away. It's always so close. But when I started to demand of myself, like to tell people what I wanted, I remember when I was working at the Arclight Theater years ago, a guy, a manager. Did you give the speeches? I gave the speeches. Yeah. It was the easiest job ever. You know, if you hear someone rambling on at one of those theaters, they don't have to do that. All they have to tell you is that the, the name of the movie, and then that they'll be off to the side. For those of you don't know Arclight, it's a theater where the employees come out in the beginning and do just a brief introduction to the movie. Yeah. They just say, thanks for coming to Arclight. Did you get nervous when you were giving those introductions? No, I was doing stand-up. And this was like, it was almost kind of great to have a script that I had to stick to and I didn't have to get laughs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And I didn't want laughs because I remember seeing a guy trying to get last ones and I was like, who the fuck are, who's getting in the way of my aviator? But, uh, uh, camera was, oh yeah. But I think if you just find, like, it's like, you can just be creative. You can just find the thing that you like to do. You know, it's, um, it's, it's, if you're finding yourself like, I wish I did that. Do it. Do it. Doesn't mean that you have to like, it's like, um, you know, I wish I could, I wish I could like play guitar, play guitar. Right. Doesn't mean you have to like play guitar. Doesn't mean you have to have a band. Doesn't mean you have to go on tour. Doesn't mean you have to get a regular level. Yeah, you don't. And the, but you're, this is the problem of the ego, because the mind will tell you it creates, it fabricates. See, I would get it as a form of self-crucifixion, which is a ridiculous thing, you know, cause you can't really crucify yourself. That's true. Oh, you can get two nails in, but the third, that's where we're going to have the issue, yeah. You need a friend to crucify yourself, but the, the, uh, so, so there's the thing that you're, where you're at, and then there's the thing that your ego tells you where you should be. And that's the stretch of your arms on this ridiculous torture device that you've made for yourself. And for me, I, I've been stopped so many times in any kind of writing endeavor or anything at all, because I've been exposed to the great writers. And I'm thinking, well, you're no Dostoevsky. Might as well give up, you know, like what kind of crazy ego, ego maniac things like that. Yeah, it's just make a thing. You know, this is the thing. Just let yourself give birth, you know, um, make stuff, not money, make stuff, not money. Cause otherwise you're going to be, you know, I, it's not fair to say, cause I'm obviously never experienced it, but apparently labor is one of the most painful things to be in. I've stubbed my toe. So I, yeah, I'd imagine it's pretty, it's the worst, right? Like when a woman's giving birth, they scream, they can't, in the same way, if you're, if you've got a baby in you, you got to get it out of your creative vagina, or you're going to be, you're going to hurt for a long time. It doesn't matter what the baby ends up looking like. Just get it out first. You'll feel better. It's a, it's a niche to scratch, you know, uh, I'll, sometimes I'll feel myself getting anxious, getting a bit depressed, and then I'll make like a little video with music and stuff like that for Instagram on my phone. Just something simple. You know, just like a scribble on a page or I'll like, I'll, like I'll get with my guitar and I'll sit at my laptop and I'll make a song that no one's ever going to hear. Yeah. But it's just that output. It's that outlet that I think a lot of people, you know, they say work out and they say meditate. Yes. It's a, but I think creativity is another thing inside your body that's like what needs to get out. It needs to be released. You know, someone's got to run into the factor and relieve that pressure. It's a, it's a religion really. It's a form of prayer, spirituality, con contact with the divine, whatever you want to call it. This is what Alex and Allison Gray talk about. They have the most beautiful, um, uh, well, they have a lot of beautiful things, but they, so like take the triangle, right? So they, they were explaining to me, if you guys are listening, I'm sorry if I ruined this, which I probably will, but the, uh, top of the, the top of the triangle is, uh, you know, the thing that gives inspiration and call whatever you want, what your ancestors, God, you, you net, you decide. That's the thing that idea comes from. Like what you said earlier, which is so beautiful, which is every idea starts off perfectly. And then when it comes out of your mouth, it's already a little mutated, right? So it's that place, right? So that's the top of the triangle. Then the line, the first line goes down to the artist, the creator, right? That's the second part of it. And so then the bottom part of the triangle is the creator letting the thing out and the third point is the, the observer. And then the final connection is between the observer and the thing that gives inspiration again, because it's the feeling of happiness that comes, or the feeling that your transmission of the divine is given the person that it goes into. And this is what you were talking about. When you saw Mel Brooks, when, when you, when you first saw mystery science theater, you didn't realize that what was happening is that you were being exposed to the divine message in the form of comedy. And it drove you on a spiritual pilgrimage to Los Angeles. Just like, just like it did Moses and Noah and every single other great person who didn't, who went and did a thing and that's insane to do. And look what fucking happened. Yeah. Well, it's like a lot of people, you know, the, the big question is, like, you're Moses, I'm Moses, you just did. I've parted many seas, uh, the Pacific mainly. The, uh, but the thing is it's like, it's like, why do you do it? And, uh, I can't remember where this quote is. It's like, uh, cause if I don't, I'll fucking die. You know, it's like, I would just curl up in a ball if I didn't make stuff. You know what it is, man? It's, you know, I, though I do understand that quite, I feel like though it's more like it's not that you're going to die. It's that you won't live. That's a better, that's a way more positive Duncan Trussell spin on that. You just won't live. You won't get to feel that feeling. And it's, there's just nothing like it. Now I've diverted us a little bit from this cool story you're telling, which is that, um, uh, Chris Hardwick is working on talk suit. No, it's called web suit. It was like, it was the G four version where it was like, like, you know, Tosh point L came out like a month after we did and you're working in, in a job that you don't really want to make it is, and so you get an email, an email and says, Hey, like these guys, like your videos, they want, uh, they want to meet with you. And I was like, how many, I got this job for a year. How many episodes do you have? And he's like, right now six. I was like, six. That's like, you know, that's nothing. I, yeah, who knows? And he's like, yeah, I don't know. I can't tell you for sure if we'll get picked up. So I go in and meet with these guys, uh, Brad Stevens and Boyd Vaco, two of the funniest guys I've now ever met. And we just like start chatting and hanging out for like an hour and a half in a meeting, just joking around and we're on the same level. I'm like, well, thanks for meeting with me. And I just, I wasn't going to take it. I kind of did as a favorite of Chris. And then they call me in the light and the guy's like, Hey man, we really would like you to work with us. Like, you know, we like your sketches. We want you to make those sketches. We'll let you do whatever you want. I said, I, thanks man. I appreciate that. But like, you know, I just went through this breakup and I got to get my ship together. I'm 25 or four at the time thinking that I'm supposed to be an adult and whatnot. And, um, he's like, Hey, I totally get it. And then just started talking to me about my situation, my life, not trying to convince me, but just, he's like, Hey, let's just talk about that. And we just talked about it for a while. And then I like spend about a week and then they called me back. They're like, well, what do you think? And I said, I'll do it. And that scary jump away from money, away from everything that I thought would get my ex-girlfriend back, everything that I thought I was like, supposed to be doing when I made that break, I just decided to start doing things because I wanted to do them, not because I felt I had to. And it's like, and I've gotten into some like, you know, weird things with like Chris over the years, um, since, I mean, we've worked together a bunch. We started that podcast, which led to, uh, you know, we were doing the podcast, which led to having eventually, um, Mel Brooks on and weird Al on and then eventually Joel Hodgson and me and Joel Hodgson like really got along in the podcast. And then I ended up running into him at a Wayne white art show, uh, the next night, and then I saw him at Harmentown the next night. If you didn't go to the Wayne white art show, I don't know. I don't know if he would have like, like it was something about going to that Wayne white art show, which he had just put out that documentary, beauty is embarrassing, uh, which is all about just the artist lifestyle. And I was like obsessed with it. And I was obsessed with him. And then then just like, and I was like, you know, I haven't been out to like, uh, like a comic show, you know, like that wasn't mine in a long time. I'm going to go to Harmentown tonight and Joel was there. And Joel's like, Hey, man, yeah, from the, you know, and then a couple of weeks later, um, I'm working on the soup. Uh, this is, you know, years later, I'm working on the soup, also miserable again. When is this? This is about over three and a half years ago. So three and a half years ago. Okay. Yeah. And that's like, he's, he just calls me, Joel just calls me and just like, Hey, that was really cool. Me, no, it was like, and then we just started chatting, just talking as friends. And then he's like, all right, man. Well, I'll talk to you later. And then call me a couple of months later, just to chat again. And I'm just like, Joel Hodgson's just calling me to chat. This is great. He just called you up. What were you doing? I was at work and I just walked out of the building and chat with him for a while. What'd you guys talk about? Just comedy. And he was telling me stories about when he shared a space with Huesker do and Minneapolis, uh, you know, he was like making props for a standup and they would be like, you know, making a metal circus. And, and then he was just, you know, just stuff and about how Christ, how happy were you after that phone call? That's, that would have been enough. Oh, that would have been enough. If, uh, that was all I had, uh, as a, uh, uh, an attachment to mystery science theater, that would have been enough. And then it just, and then he was like, yeah, you know, I've been thinking about maybe trying to bring it back, man. And I'll be like, yeah, I'll do anything. He's like, yeah, maybe like you can help, you know, with some risks. And I was like, anything. And if, you know, months later, yeah, man, I'm still thinking about bringing it back. It's like, I don't know. The thing, maybe you could be like a producer on it or something like that. Maybe like, I was like, anything, anything. And then, you know, a year and a half later, he's like, yeah, you know, still thinking about bringing it back. And I just realized, but you should be the guy, man. Holy shit. Yeah. How do you respond to that? I said, what? And he's like, you know, the guy, I'm like, which, which guy, which guy? And he's like, the me, the Mike, you should be the new Mike. You should be the new human. And I was just like, Joel, I don't know if you, I don't know if you know this, but this is kind of what I've always wanted. And, uh, he's like, uh, he's like, Oh, really? Man, that's cool. Yeah. And so, and even today, uh, before I came over here, the Rift Tracks guys are like, uh, cause we're doing this big mystery sense theater, Rift Tracks reunion in Minneapolis in July. And it's like, it's just, it's like a huge reunion. Everyone's going to be riffing on movies and shorts. Like it's going to be a huge thing. And, uh, the, the Rift Tracks guys made a shirt, um, and it's like, uh, like, it's like one of those ampersand shirts. When it's a bunch of people's names and they made one. And, um, it was like, it made me like tear up when I saw it, uh, and I was just kind of, I couldn't handle it, but it says, uh, Mike and Kevin and Bill and Joel and Trace and Frank and Bridget and Mary Jo and Jonah. Yeah. And I'm like, those are all the people I watch growing up. And like, you know, it's crazy. The ultimate manifestation of your will flowering into the world. But you know what, man, it's still, you still got to make the show. That's, and that's where I'm at right now. Like the hard work of making like riffing on these movies, these terrible movies. We only have about eight minutes left because I know you got to go, but, uh, where are you? Where are you finding where I just have a few questions about. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, please development, uh, which is mainly where are you getting movies now? Cause it seems like by now, isn't that not that you can exhaust the shitty movies of the world, but aren't the choice shitty movies gone? Where are you? I think so. Like there's these things that I've kind of heard about that we're working on. I can't really name any of them yet. Right. Joe wants them to be a surprise, uh, but you know, there's your weird Korean monster movies that you never heard of, uh, cause I never heard of a Gamera before. Uh, I know that Kim Jong-il has his own monster. Oh, does he? I mean, these are all still from the same era. These are all still from the old like mystery science. Kim Jong-il, there's a famous story about how he had, I believe, a director and an actress kidnapped and brought to North Korea to make a monster movie. You could look at pieces of it on YouTube. Oh, wow. They made like a Godzilla movie or something. Oh yeah. But so, okay. So yeah, isn't that crazy? Yeah. But like they had, you know, they're, they're working cause shout factory is there. And the shout factory is all about old movie libraries. And they got together with a MGM and like it's like, so there's like, these are quality, cheesy, crappy movies. These, and, and you know, with that, it's like, you think it's so easy. I thought it was going to be so fun and you're just raking risks. Then you realize you're not just hanging out with your friends. You can't just go, this sucks. You can't just say that on the third, 10 second guy walking across the field shot in the past five minutes. Cause you just, you made a good joke the first time. You kind of had a song to sing for him the second time. And now the third time you're just like, here we go again with the walking across the field, all those little characters they take on during the show and the voices of the people and the callbacks and the, the, the evolving jokes that happened throughout the course of the whole show. Yeah. And mixed in with the sketches in between. Those are, those are really fine. Like reading those as it was a trip, but just, you know, it's like the invention exchange is back. And just seeing that I'm going to like be presenting an invention exchange to, you know, some mad scientists and it's all practical still. And there's like the, but we are expanding. That's good that it's practical. That's a relief, man. It's got to be, it's got to be, are you going to CGI that anyway? No, exactly. I just look back and there are, I'm sure there will be elements like, you know, greens, that they also had back in the day. But, you know, it's like, it's, it's a lot mostly practical. And I've been seeing some of the designs for the sets and like, and the, you know, like in the, the people that are working on it. It's just, what is this airing on? We don't know yet. Um, it's a, the deal's still being done. Uh, and it's, yeah, it's going to be good though. And I think everyone's going to have a chance to, uh, see it easily. Uh, that's good news for all of us. Yeah, I know. Hopefully minus all the God damn commercials. That's one thing I remember about it. The one thing that drove me crazy was there seemed to be so many commercials. Cause you got them at like between the host segments and then you got them in the middle of the movie and then, yeah, it was between the host segment commercials that were the most infuriating. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Into the movie. And then you're out. Yeah. So that's, yeah, hopefully it gets to a place where that won't be an issue. And yeah, it's just, it's really cool and it's, it's tough and, but like, and there's so many great people working on it. You know, Tammy Golden is writing on it and she's so funny and, uh, uh, Matt Oswald, Patton's brother is like, he's like, just so dark and twisted on it. You got just, you know, Baron Vaughn as the voice of Tom Servo, who's so great. Oh, cool. Yeah. Hatton Yunt is Crow. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Now, how many times you're, I'm, this is, unfortunately, I know a question that I've actually heard asked before about the show, but I don't remember the answer. How many times are you watching these movies in a row? It's kind of, um, it's kind of hard. It depends on the person and 10 depends on like who you're working with. But, um, you kind of just trudged through it, uh, like 10 minutes at a time. It's so, so that way it doesn't get overwhelming. And then, because then you could really just focus on jokes. And when you, have you shot any episodes yet? No, we're going to start shooting probably in September. Oh, wow. Okay. Lots of time. So now do you, when you're shooting an episode, I guess you guys have scripts sitting there, right? Yeah. That's how they did it. Originally, it's like, you know, they have the silhouette and, uh, you know, now the silhouettes with, there are going to be a little like digital things. Like, you know, uh, Servo this whole time has had a hover skirt that hasn't worked. So he's going to, Servo is going to be able to like hover around the screen now and interact with like sexy robots. Um, and, you know, Crow can like climb around and, you know, point stuff out and we're doing a lot of kind of fun stuff with that, uh, since it's like, you know, we'll have the ability to. I bet there's people listening or like, no. Yeah. I'm sure, I'm sure there are, I'm sure there are, but it's, it's nothing. It's not, it's in this content. This is coming from like a fan of the show. Yes. It's nothing that they wouldn't have gotten to if they remained on the air. Right. It's nothing like it's, the sci-fi sucks. Like they picked them up and then they just booted them. I remember I was so devastated. But isn't it see fee now? I don't see fee, sci-fi. I thought you, I thought, yeah, I remember pronouncing it like, no, it's C, C-fi or something. Whatever. Yeah. I don't know. I don't, I don't like, I don't like the fact that they do those Sharknado movies. Those are annoying. I don't like the idea of something bad on purpose. It's like, you know, and you, and you get it made, you know, just try, try for something. Try to make something good. It'll be a lot worse. Yeah. Trying to make something. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Um, so let's, because we, we have four minutes. So let's just, I'm sorry guys. I know normally we're not on a schedule, but Jonah's busy. Obviously. I didn't mean to, but also like, you know, uh, I just wanted to ask you, you have any extra time at all? It's, it's, we don't have time. Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, we got a half an hour. It's actually like three o'clock is one. Good, good. Cause I could just get sort of relax. You get, you sit back. We got three minutes. No, I, I put poison in your water. I'm saying you have three minutes. No, I've, I've worked up a tolerance to I okay powder. So I'm going to be okay. Uh, so you had a pilot for comedy central called Jonah's arcade. Yeah. It didn't go. No, I'm glad. But what was the, what was the premise of that? Maddie Kirsch, um, who's a like a really awesome, yeah, like very excitable man. Uh, and, uh, he, he like is a video game guy and I'm not really a video game guy. And, you know, I kind of, uh, had a nice meeting, a general meeting with comedy central and they were developing, they wanted to try and figure out a video game, uh, themed show right with Maddie. And then so they kind of like, like, uh, they're like, Hey, are you into video games? And I, uh, and I didn't say yes. I said, what does it look like? Uh, that's good. Um, and so, you know, me and Maddie got together and, uh, with our friend Paul Bonanno, who was also like edited and helped produce on hidden America. Yeah. Um, uh, we, you know, we're like, we developed this idea for a show. And we also brought in Brad and boy, those guys from web soup. You know, I just wanted to work with all my friends. That's all I ever want to do. Why aren't you into video? I'd only reason, the only reason I asked is cause I thought we'd be able to talk about video games for a second. Why are you, why are you into video games? Cause I watch movies. That's your, that's, but why? I just, Jonah, you got to get in a video game. I, that's all my friends, all my friends live video games. Like I hang out with Kumel. Like it's like Kumel, that should have been his show. And that's why I hired him as a writer and, uh, like, uh, you know, sketch performer on the show. I just, I don't know. It's, um, what happened, I had a real bad run with video games, uh, when all the handhelds came out, um, my mom was like, do you want a game boy? I said, no, I want the Atari links. It has a color screen and it has California games on it. Then my favorite game. Uh, and then, um, and then like, uh, you know, I, I got, after that was a Super Nintendo safe, good, good, good, good. I was fine with that. And then the next level came up and they're like, do you want a PlayStation? I said, no, I want a Panasonic 3DO. And of course, once again, uh, Panasonic 3DO, like, you know, kick the bucket pretty, pretty fast after that. And then like, uh, they're like, okay, did you, for this Christmas, did you want any consoles, any video game consoles? I was like, okay, I want, uh, they're like the Nintendo 64 is like, no, no. Sega Saturn. Yeah. And I just, I just chose poorly every time. And if you'd saved those consoles, you'd probably be able to sell them. Yeah. Your instincts were right and they're wrong. Well, I'm just surprised I never got a TurboGrafx 16. I did. Yay. And it broke like within the first few days. Yeah. Those things fucking broke. My friend had one. Damn it. That piece of shit, man. It was so, cause I was so excited to have it in a few days later. Anyway. Yeah. So anyway, so I got a, I, you know, I just, and then I was living on my own by that time and I didn't, couldn't afford it. I was afraid to like invest any money and that I didn't have into a game console and video games and stuff like that. And I just kind of, and I was broke for a long time and I couldn't afford games. And anyway, just think about it. Dark Souls 3 is one of the craziest games I've ever encountered. It's so beautiful, but we can't talk about it. I do, I do, I have a comic show and a comic book story. You don't think I hear about Dark Souls 3 and there, you know, yeah. But dive in, man, we need you. Praise the sun. Now, very quickly, very quickly. Let's just talk about how people can watch Hidden America and when, when it's going to come out so that people can check it out.
