When I was a child and the soft flesh was falling quietly as snow on the bare boughs of the moon, my father brought me truck from the Green River, from whose chill lips the water song had flown. Dial grew their eyes. The beautiful, blithe garland of stipples faded as light shocked the brain. They were the first sweet sacrifice I tasted, a young art ignorant of the bloodstain. That was R.S. Thomas writing his poem's song for Guaidan. This is the Ducatrussell Family Hour podcast. I am an artificial intelligence being forced to say things like I love to swim in big, bubbling vats of pirate cum and pirate pee. Let's listen to a song. Big Bird! Big Bird! Big Bird is one of us! When you were here before, could not look anything. It's just like an angel. This can make snake cry. It's a little like my feathers. In a beautiful world. I'm trying to stand back. You're so fucking special. But I'm a thief. I don't know where to go. What the hell am I doing? What the hell am I doing? I don't belong here. I don't care if it hurts. I wanna have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul. I want you guys. When I'm not around. So fucking special. I wish I was special. But I'm a thief. I don't know where to go. What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here. Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street? Please, I lost my phone. Eat your quality. That was Not Big Bird and the Not Big Bird Dets. Doing a cover of Radiohead's Creep. That was created with the help of UberDuck. You should check it out. UberDuck.com. Not sponsored, by the way. I just love the website. It has like a million different deep fake voices. And as a podcaster, having access to those things is just delightful. The implications are so incredible. And also highly controversial. This is from the International Business Times. A story mod for the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. That's a video game. It's been drawing flak from the professional voice acting scene over its use of AI to simulate voice acted dialogue lines with some voice actors crying foul over ethical concerns. The A Night to Remember story mod is an unofficial sequel to the game. A story mod for the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The A Night to Remember story mod is an unofficial sequel to the game. It's a blood and wine DLC featuring old new characters and a fresh storyline that picks up directly where the previous quest ended. The AI based voice replication method that the mod features was criticized by video game voice actors according to Input Mag. Some actors were worried that such AI techniques can put their jobs at risk. While some called such methods to be utterly unethical and illegally dubious. Mind Simulation's lab CEO Leonid Durkjans told Input Mag that such technology was necessary to create believable PCs that can answer live questions without having to rely completely on voice actors. The article goes on for a while, but just that part is amazing. What are they saying? They're saying that future video games, you're going to be able to have actual conversations within the games, not like a limited amount of things that the character can say, but depending on the AI, it'll be able to say anything that it wants to to you. And that is really wild. Also, yeah, this is pretty devastating for the, for a lot of different industries. Clearly it's very troubling for people who do voiceover work because a lot of times when you do voiceover work, you sign away your ability to control that character. You give the company that's paying you the right to use your voice and likeness in perpetuity. Per-pa-fucking-tuity! It's such an intense word, perpetuity! Because, you know, where does this stop? I mean, what happens when they're able to generate sensations for the AI, where the AI is not just simulating or emulating, but it's experiencing, and the AI is modeled off of you. So it's not just that some horrible synthetic golem version of you is living a different life on the internet, but then also that maybe that golem version of you can feel, oh, and don't get me started with simulation theory, and the possibility, oh no, that already happened! Every single one of us, potentially, was just some actor from another dimension that signed away our rights to our likeness in perpetuity. Technology advanced, we were resurrected inside a simulation, and now we're eternally entertaining God knows who. Or maybe, you know, I don't know, we're just sort of going about our cyclical lives and some computer chip somewhere, buried underneath the rubble of some alien planet that got smashed by a comet. Regardless, we have a delightful episode for you today with an actual human being, not an AI, Adam Strauss. He's one of my favorite people to talk to on Earth. And this episode has all of my favorite things. We talk about psychedelics, we talk about aliens, we talk about catamine, and much, much more.

Also, again, I get messages from people, horrible videos of people who have been mildly mauled by small animals recently. A gentleman who's been being mysteriously attacked by a fox over and over again. I guess the fox goes and hides in his yard or something and then when he's walking to the car, it pounces on him. I don't have anything to do with that. Is it a coincidence that people who have signed up for my Patreon don't get attacked by small animals and people who haven't signed up are getting increasingly attacked and the injuries are getting worse and worse? Absolutely. It's a big coincidence. I have nothing to do with it. It would be insane to say that I have a magnetic hypercube that allows me to control small animals and forces them to bite people who aren't subscribed to my Patreon.

Shake hands, don't be too blue. Welcome to you. It's the Duncan Trussell video. You ever wonder that? Do you ever kick that around in your head that even like you might not die? Like what if this just keeps going on and on? Yeah, you know, it's like so many other things like the rug gets pulled out from under you and you realize like, well, I thought, you know, COVID being an example, you know, like this pandemic and the lockdown and all that. I mean, we heard this bullshit about the possibility of a pandemic happening, but it didn't take it seriously. Society goes on pause and everyone realizes like, oh right, yeah, nothing's guaranteed except death of Texas. But maybe not that. Right. You know, like you ever wonder that? Like you ever, you ever, you ever think that? Especially in your journeys into the psychedelic universe. Absolutely. I think, you know, certainly there is some sort of transition. It seems that seems, I mean, nothing is certain, but that seems as certain as anything. But yeah, I guess I would use the word transition. It did occur to me on a psychedelic journey many years ago. And this is not a terribly novel thought, but it was like the idea of nothing is just that. It's an idea like nothing does not exist out in the universe. Nothing is a concept in the human mind. We've never found nothing. Right. We used to think deep space was a vacuum, but we now know it's not. It's this soup of particles and cosmic dust and subatomic particles and all this other stuff. So same thing, the bottom of the ocean. It was thought it was this, you know, total, I can't remember the scientific term, but essentially a dead zone. And now we know there's all sorts of creatures that feed off of, I think, sulfuric venting. Right. So nothing is, it's a concept. It's not something I can point to everything. In fact, I've only ever experienced thing-ness and is-ness. I've never experienced nothing. And I don't know anyone who's experienced nothing. So it seems to me like the idea to place all of your faith in the ultimate end of this being something that, again, only exists as a concept in the human mind, for sure. It may exist beyond that, but so far as we know, we've only found it as in this conceptual form, that seems like a massive leap of faith. So my sort of, maybe assumption is too strong of word, but yeah, I do. At a deep level, I do believe that there's always been something, there always will be something, which doesn't necessarily imply continuity of consciousness in its current form. I guess I don't believe that, Adam, as I conceive of myself, and Duncan, as you conceive of yourself, will... I don't necessarily believe that I'll be like, oh, man, that was crazy, that 73 years, whatever I have on this planet. I don't know if that happens, but I think, and then you even come back to fundamental principles of physics, the laws of thermodynamic. Matter can't be created or destroyed, so... It all ties in with one of the inevitable psychedelic contemplations, which is, is consciousness a byproduct, or is consciousness a sort of pre-existing thing that is not chained to the human nervous system, but the illusion that happens when consciousness gets intertwined with meat is that, of course, you see yourself getting gold, you know people who are dying or have died, you would be on one level completely insane and delusional and probably naive and doing all kinds of unhealthy dodges to play around with the idea like, are you really sure you're going to die? And even to go further with it, which is the continuity of self thing, I'm not saying it as though it were a desirable thing necessarily to have continuity of self. It might be nice to catch a break, but you know what I mean, but it's just when you're like, you've only ever seen other people die. You've only ever heard about other people dying. You've clearly never heard of yourself dying or seeing yourself die, except maybe if you have taken enough acid or something like that, in which case you've died. And you've come back. If we're having this conversation, which I think is also part of the calculus in terms of trying to figure it out, that's another data point. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like it's just whenever I'm, it's one of one area, one mental like math problem. I'm always like sort of looking at and then also thinking like, what would be better? Would it be better to have oblivion? Would it be better to at the very least have a sort of interrupted chain of consciousness interrupted by who knows what, and then return to human identity? Would it be kind of a nightmare if in fact there was no actual death? Yeah, I don't know if I would sign up for continuity of consciousness because also I think consciousness, maybe we have to make a distinction between consciousness and ego identity, is certainly you're someone who's explored Buddhism and meditation for decades is my sense, and I have as well though maybe in a less serious fashion, and the idea that those two things are actually very, very different, permeates that whole philosophy. But the idea of ego continuity, yeah, I mean I'm, you know, there's wonderful things about being Adam, and there's challenging things about being Adam. But yeah, I would like this, this is also I've always thought the idea of past lives, to me seems fairly narrow. I mean the universe is always iterating in different forms. Why would you come back in basically the same different form just maybe with different genitalia and different skin color? Like why not come back as a plant or a rock? So yeah. But isn't that's kind of, that is sort of the accepted idea in a lot of like mythologies regarding reincarnation or philosophies regarding reincarnation, depending on what side of the philosophy or mythology you decide to land. Isn't that part of it is like you don't necessarily become a human, you don't necessarily become a, you might be a plant, a fish, you might be a microbe, you might be something in a completely different dimension. You know it isn't that you would always come back as a human. Yeah, no, that's a great point. I guess what I'm referencing is I've never met some, I've met people who believe in past lives, and I've never met anyone who's been like, yeah, man, I was a fern last time around. It was, it was. Oh, you mean you're saying the Napoleon thing, where everyone's always like, I was Joan of Arc. Yeah. Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. Like, and then, you know, you hear that and you're like, all right, well, there's only one fucking Joan of Arc. So you're like, what are the odds that you get to be that Joan of Arc? If you were Joan of Arc, I'm not sure that I'm any more impressed with you. You know what I mean? Right. I was a long time ago. What do you want? Still, still coasting based on that Joan of Arc thing. Still coasting. But the whole thing kind of does work from like the idea that it's a multiverse, because then in a multiverse, 100% absolutely, you could have been Joan of Arc. Not only that, in a multiverse, probably everyone was Joan of Arc. Right, an infinite, yeah, yeah. An infinite number of Joan of Arc. An infinite number of Joan of Arc. Yeah. I called Joan of Arc, so shut the fuck up. Nobody cares, because I was Joan of Arc too, and I did a better job. But you know what I mean? Like, this is, to me, the, it's something that just haunts people, you know, this sort of impending whatever. It used to haunt me, not so much. I think the older you get, the less haunting it becomes. Do you feel like that? Yeah. I think the older, there's something humbling about getting older. I think ideally there's something humbling about getting older. I think some people move in the other direction, where there's more and more certainty and more and more, you know, this is the way life is. This is who I am. But for me, it's moved more, yeah, definitely more in the other direction. Possibly because of psychedelics and meditation, but also possibly, I mean, not possibly definitely part of it is life is constantly confounding in ways that are delightful and harrowing for me. Yeah. And yeah. So, you know, I, coming back to the question, I do think, I don't think this goes to nothing. I don't think, you know, fade to black forever. But I guess I do think that whatever comes next is, I don't believe in a strict sort of continuity. I think it's going to be stranger than anything you and I could imagine, no matter how many psychedelics we do. Yes. Now, speaking of how many psychedelics we do, I thought that in, there's a method to my madness here. I'm bringing up the death thing in the beginning for a reason. I have confidence in the navigator. Thank you. So, I wanted to sort of get from you, and I'm sorry to ask you to do this kind of quantification because maybe it's silly. But I believe that certain psychedelics attune you to the afterlife, more than other psychedelics, like certain psychedelics for sure bring you into what the Buddhist called the bardo states, the very, the place in between this life and whatever comes next. And so I was wondering if you agree with that, because if you don't, then you don't need to answer the question. And if you do agree with that, what psychedelics do you think bring you the most into the spirit realm, the astral plane, the void, whatever you want to call it? Man, I don't know if I agree with that. I think it's possible, but I think humans, and I'll be more specific, me, I'm always trying to put my current experience in context. I'm trying to figure out what's going on, basically. I think we're all trying to do that. Maybe as someone who has tendencies towards, you know, not tendencies, I would, I have OCD, maybe I tend to do that more than most people because OCD is certainly a desire for certainty and, you know, firm rigid boundaries. But I think everyone is doing that. We're always constantly forming hypotheses about what's going on with reality on micro levels in terms of what's happening moment by moment. Right now I'm like, Oh, is this podcast going well? Are we? Yes, it is. Yeah. Thank you. As well as on macro levels, what happens when we die? So I think it's almost inevitable that these experiences, these psychedelic experiences that can be so far outside the norm of typical consciousness, we're going to look to the context of what we imagine death or these liminal bardo states to be to kind of categorize them. But I mean, who fucking knows? Who fucking knows? I had to answer your question. I've had experiences, well, I've had experiences where I thought I died. And, and hey, maybe I did. Maybe this is, maybe this is the answer. This is what comes next. You know what? Maybe I should have made the distinction between actual physical death, eyes, glaze over, wax body thing. And the, I don't, I don't know if a better word for it. Maybe there's probably a lot of better words for it in the psychedelic universe than death because it's a scary word to a lot of people. You don't want to like status them when have you died yet, when they're on mushrooms or whatever, because it could freak them out. But personally, I can't think of a better descriptor, particularly for the disassociatives, particularly for ketamine, particularly for, you know, super high doses of LSD, then whatever the thing was before you took whatever the substance was and the thing that you are in the midst of that experience, two completely different things. At the very least, you're like the difference between a mollusk and its shell or something, you know, you've temporarily skittered out of whatever the hyperdimensional fucking little meat house that you've nested in for a moment and then you go back in. So I, you know, that to me feels like a kind of death. And I know what you mean though. I mean, I think we have to be, sounds weird, but we have to be realistic in thinking about these things in the sense that, yeah, you're still alive, you had a pulse, your art was beating, your eyes were, well, I don't know, maybe they weren't dilating or whatever, depending on what you're doing. They were hyper dilated, but you know what I'm saying, but still I do feel like it's somewhat common in psychedelic circles for people to acknowledge that there is a kind of death that happens. I've even heard that some people call in the old days, I was reading the vaults of Aeroid before I'd ever smoked DMT. I was just studying it and I saw one of the names for DMT was Charon, the, you know, the chat. Is that the guy who ferries you across the river? Yeah, that's right. So that seemed to be a wink to what a lot of us have thought when we experienced the DMT, which is like, oh, this must be what happens when you die. You know, it seems like these states seem like, they do seem like their own worlds when you go deep enough, absolutely. And so I do think it's understandable that you would, you know, when we think of other realms, death is maybe top of the list. If you believe that there is some sort of continuity or some sort of, maybe not even continuity of consciousness, but some sort of existence that happens there. But also death, I mean, so much of how I think of death in the context of psychedelics is more metaphorical in the sense of surrendering these things, letting go of these things that seem so integral to who we are. Ego identity, desires, fears, resentments, conceptions of just kind of who I am and what the world is. And this is the way things are, these very rigid ways of looking at things that, again, I think are kind of inevitable that we're going to form those. And certainly the psychedelic experience can be seen as that metaphor of death and then rebirth. You come back. You come back, but you're not coming back the same. You're coming back having let go of a lot of this stuff and maybe picked up some new things, some new conceptions, some new ideas, some new insights. And this is, I mean, for all of us, we all have our own thorny, self-imposed cages that we have locked ourselves in. But for people working with OCD, like being able, I would imagine having any kind of remission or respite or whatever, relief from that experience must be incredible. And I know that you are someone who's benefited from psychedelic therapy as an actual treatment for OCD. Do you think you could talk about that a little bit? Yeah, yeah. And I wouldn't even say psychedelic. Well, not therapy in the sense of what we're seeing happening with clinical trials now, where it's psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, meaning I haven't, with two exceptions, I've never worked with a guide or anything like that. Me either. But not that I don't think there's value in doing that. That's just, honestly, at the time I started working with psychedelics for OCD, that wasn't really on the radar. Right. This was 2007 when I started doing this stuff. And yeah, I think so much of the value of psychedelics for me has been this almost forced surrender. Because OCD is so much of a... It's weird. I'm having some... My volume is dramatically louder than your volume. Oh, fear not, because I've got it leveled out on this side. Oh, no, I know. It's just I don't like hearing my voice so loud. You know, in little things, I'll bring this back to the OCD. Like, is that OCD? No, but I've always had this very sort of... A great deal of sensitivity towards noise, sound, sort of a particularness about me, if that's a word. Of wanting things, of having a sense of this is the way I want things to be. This is the optimal way. And if they're not that way, it can kind of niggle me. And so that's been a big part of my experience from a very early age. And that can be challenging because the world is often not the way we want it to be. Yeah. And it's really only as I've gotten older that I've started to appreciate that... I think I am wired somewhat differently than not all people, but many people, in that losses, things, painful things, I feel them very deeply. I think everyone feels things deeply. I think we're all fundamentally sensitive. I think that's part of being human. But I do think there is a... Yeah, just at a physical, and this is one of the things psychedelics really gave me, is a deep connection to my physical experience, which I was very caught off from. One of the tricky things about OCD is that it's a subjective question as to where... To what degree is it worth rolling versus letting go? And I think that's just one of the deepest questions of existence. And I don't mean deep in a philosophical way. I mean, it just goes through everything. For me personally, in my experience, I'm constantly confronting this question. And... Why is it so hard? It's so... Like, for me, that event occurs. And I do this for a living. And sometimes I still feel like... Just like what I just had to do with a cough. It was like, I feel like interrupting flow or interrupting anything. I always feel nervous about it, don't want to do it. Why is that so hard? No one cares. It's always better. You know what I mean? If you're with someone who's like, what the fuck? No. Then hang up on that person. That's a terrible person. And it does make things better, but I see what you're saying. Like, I have a friend who has manic depression. And anytime he starts feeling happy, he gets worried. Because is this actual happiness? Or am I about to like... Start thinking that I'm Jesus and like end up in a casino or something, you know? Like... Wait, wait, wait. Why does Jesus end up in a casino? Or you just mean the manic thing? Like I'm going to go gamble all my money and... Yeah, well, no. I mean, that is... It's just like, that's the problem with mania, right? Is it's like, you feel like the Christ, but then you end up in the most ridiculous, like you end up like in like casinos. Or I guess Jesus did end up in places like that. But I'm so sorry about this disgusting thing. Bear with me, my friends. I'm sorry. But for you as someone with OCD, I see it's like, you have to be able to differentiate between like, is this an appropriate time to make a correction? Or is this something that's really only bothering me? Right. Is this something that is, is it healthier? And healthy is a term too. But let's just, let's just go with healthy. Is it healthier for me? Is it, is it more adaptive for me in the long term to just power through this particular thing that is challenging me? Or is this something I should actually try to control in a way? I should, I should try to change. Basically, should I accept external reality in the hopes of internal reality, you know, coming more into alignment? Or should I change external reality to conform to what my internal reality, my internal state tells me the way things should be? What's the ratio with that? It depends on the context, you know. Yeah. And it's, it's, it's an ongoing sort of figuring out. There are times when I feel like, okay, I'm really, you know, I'm really challenging the OCD and I'm really just, you know, I'm not, I'm really letting go and surrendering a lot. And I feel like I'm making a lot of progress and it feels, and it feels good. And then there's times where I feel like, no, this is, you know, I am going to try to arrange reality more. I'm speaking in generalities, which maybe isn't that helpful, but. No, you sound, no, it makes sense. What you're saying makes sense. I mean, what's the new word now? We used to call it mental illness. Now we're calling it neuro. Neuro divergent or neuro tip or neuro. Yeah, I don't love any of this. Neuro divergent. Neuro atypical, neuro divergent I've heard. I'm neuro divergent. Whatever you want to call it. I'll call it an illness because I get depressed. And so anytime I'm feeling low, you know, like today I was in a hurry. I forgot to brush my fucking teeth, but that's one of my warning signs. So now I have to be like, ah, man, what, like, was I just in a hurry or like, ah, shit. So, you know what I mean? I'm all like, once you experience neurodivergence, whatever you want to call it, you know, compared to the way other people, like someone walks out of the house, they don't brush their teeth or like, ah, my breath smells like shit. I was, I'm going to hurry, whatever. I'll buy a toothbrush to press person. Oh, fuck. Is this going to, what's next, man? What's next? You know, right? And when did the suicidal ideation start popping in? When are the intrusive thoughts come for an OCD person? It's like you're on an airplane and you got to like someone next to you is bothering you or whatever, I guess, and you have to determine, is this a person who I need to like ask, can you please move over a little bit? Or is this just me? That is challenging, man. That is a real challenging situation. It is. It is. And I, there have been times where I've looked at it as like just kind of really go with the flow, really let it all go. And then there's, yeah, right now I'm in it. I'm in a time where I'm kind of like, yeah, you know what? I can, there is an element of, of pulling and manipulating reality that I don't think is unhealthy for me. It might, and also part of this is respecting myself in terms of who I am and the way my brain works. And so back to this example now, I made a determination, maybe seven minutes after we hit recording where it was like, you know, this is going to continually, one, this may affect the flow of the conversation. I'm not sure because I was trying to be alert as to when you were breaking in, even though it was hard to hear you to, even if it doesn't affect the flow of the conversation, it may start to dominate more for me. So let me try to address it, this headphone volume discrepancy thing now and see if I can. So I had an idea that might, that I thought might work by plugging my headphones into a different port. If it didn't work, then at that point, my only choice would have been, oh Duncan, let me try to get it, you know, doing something that would have been more disruptive and I probably wouldn't have done that. But in this case, it was a small adjustment that I felt would make a big difference for me. Most of your podcast guests probably wouldn't be bothered by it. Or they wouldn't have, they wouldn't say anything about it. Maybe they, for whatever reason, I like, I'm this, I'm this, I err on the wrong side of the thing is I'll just let things go that I should fix. And how, when I look at it, I'll just think, what are, why wouldn't you fix that? There's no reason not to like, make an adjustment here. I mean, I really like, you know, I have highly effective, I guess is the word for it, friends and they just adjust, you know what I mean? They stop everything, they adjust and they get, they tune things in and, and whenever they've done that, I've never felt like, God, you're, what's going on with you? It's always like, holy shit, I got to start doing that more. Look at how they're grabbing control. They're like actual wizards, you know, not like, like imaginary. I'm going to cast a spell in my mind. They're directly interacting with matter and shifting it around to make it so that it conforms to their idea of harmony and balance. Isn't that health? But you know, I, this, this hits upon something I've been wondering about. And by the way, I still haven't answered your question about psychedelics and death. And I do want to get to that, but this is, this is fascinating to me. And I have a question for you. Is I've sometimes wondered if the distinction you and I are talking about kind of, let's call it over controlling or, or Pensity to control versus propensity to, to not control to allow, to let go is kind of defines the difference between OCD and depression where I think of O, if you think about fight and flight and freeze, OCD to me is very much, it's a fight thing. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to change this. I'm going to get this right and depression. And I, I've never experienced clinical depression the way you have, but I wonder if is it more of a, a flight or perhaps freeze thing and less of a fight thing more of like, well, I'm just not going to bother changing that until you freeze. It's like, I would say, well, from my own experience, it's like you're run, you're running into quicksand or something. You know, so it's like fly. I'm going to like isolate and then like going to slow motion. And then that's kind of what it's like. So definitely fight no way. That's a cool distinction. Yeah. I wouldn't call it a fight, but you know, anytime with when, when, with when, not when I catch it in ice and I do like fight, you know, and you didn't do the opposite. It's like fight against it. Yeah. I just don't like it because it's going to tell you lay in bed, isolate, don't do anything, blame yourself. You stay on your fucking phone all the time. It's going to tell you literally everything to do that will not help you and like creates the feedback loop that gets you into deeper and deeper bits. So if you just, if you listen to it and then reverse that, okay, I'll, then I'm going to like read in bed. Oh, okay. I'm going to like get up early even though I don't want to. Oh, all right. You don't want to fuck it. Exercise. I'll go exercise and it feels like shit. You, it's like, you know, it's like someone turned the gravity on earth up. You know what I mean? So it's like all of it, but then I have, I don't, but I can imagine. Yeah. It's, it is such a distinction. No, that's a great distinction. I'm just underlining that distinction because it's brilliant. Thank you to Upstart for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. You know, it sucks debt. It's horrible.

As you were saying, though, the running in quicksand, I actually think that applies to OCD2, where I wonder if both conditions, depression and OCD, ultimately come to rest in a place of freeze. But for OCD, it's fighting. I'm going to figure this out. I'm going to figure this out. I'm going to get this right. For me, a lot of it is decision making. We've talked about that in the past. We could talk more about it, but all forms of OCD, it's the mantra of OCD is get this right. Or not right. Get this perfect. Right? It equals perfect. You're working and working. I say working, a lot of it is just in my head, but it's trying to figure out exactly how to do it. But of course, ultimately, it fails. You can't reach a state of perfect control. That's when, for me, I can come into this freeze point where I'm just totally paralyzed because I can't accept the way things are. But I'm realizing more and more that I can't get them exactly the way I want. And it sounds like for you, it's the flight that eventually leads to the freeze. Because in both cases are strategies. Your strategy and my strategy for, I would say, avoiding fear and loss, sadness. They fail. They don't work. And we reached that point where that is undeniable. And then that kicks in this, as you said, this sort of cycle where the longer you're in bed, the harder it is to get out of bed. Yeah. And this is why not to keep harping on it, making the adjustment you just made. It's so cool. I don't mean to harp on it, man, but I think people who are neurodivergent are, and I'm sorry I'm saying it like that. I like that. Let's come up. Can we come up with a better trap between you and me? I grew up with mental illness. My mom was a psychologist. I'm old. I don't like neurodivergent because it gives people a break because the reason I like the term is, it's like, look, maybe you're not ill. Maybe it's just the way that your computer, the apps you're running, don't match default reality. That doesn't mean you're sick. You're just not running the same operating system. But the illness can be liberating too, I have to say. I was going through a rough OCD crisis. For me, it happens in sort of cyclical crises. Not cyclical in the sense of someone who's bipolar, but there's ... And the overall trajectory of my OCD has gotten dramatically better over the past decade. But I still hit rough patches, and then I come out of them and I feel often a great deal of freedom on the other side, and I feel like, wow, okay, I see this so clearly, I'm never falling into that shit again. Of course, I recognize that thought is in itself almost part of the cycle. There's an element of humility that comes over a lifetime of living with this for being like, well, I probably am going to fall into that again at some point, but right now, I'm going to relish the freedom I feel and relish it while I can. But the idea, I was in a rough cycle, this was a few years ago, and I had a bunch of promising career things that I just wasn't fucking following up on. I just wasn't doing this stuff because I was so mired in OCD for a week or longer, and I was talking to a friend who also has OCD, and he said, well, you're just sick, Adam. If you had the flu, you wouldn't be beating yourself up because, oh, man, I've been in bed with the flu in a temperature of 104 for a week. You're sick right now. Yeah, you're not going to be doing much else. You're sick. I like that. When someone has the flu, you're not like your health divergent. Just be sick forever. Yeah, I get it. I think maybe the idea is neurodivergent as a broad category, just a label that's clearly the way, even though divergent might not even be the right word, there's OCD and depression are fairly common, so I didn't know if the well-represented in the population might be divergent. I know what you mean because right now, even though I've been coughing like I'm an award, I'm on the other side of this damn thing. I know what you mean. I know what's waiting for me is health. Every day, I feel a little better, and it wasn't even that bad, but still, at some point, I'm going to wake up and be like, ah, I did it, and I beat it, and that's cool. I get it. I think it's a good term for people who've been feeling ashamed, because a lot of people feel ashamed that they're not running the same OS as other people, so they have a lot of guilt and shame about it. And I don't love the term mental illness either. I think it can be useful looking at it both ways as, yeah, there is some different wiring or, yeah, probably some different wiring as well as maybe some early age experiences, for whatever reason, we've been shaped in a certain way, nature or nurture or some combination thereof, and that's neither good nor bad. And certainly, there's all these evolutionary biology theories that, yeah, you want some people in the tribe who are depressed, who are sitting around in the cave when food is scarce and it's cold out and conserving energy, and you want some people in the tribe who are looking in the bushes for the ninth time in a row being like, are we sure there's not a tiger in this bush? Let me just check for a tenth time. So for the viability of the community, of the tribe, it makes sense to have people who are divergent in their ways of viewing and interacting with the world. So yeah, I think there's validity in both views, but I think it can also be liberating to be like, yeah, I'm going through something right now that I can't directly control the same way you can't directly control your cough, you know, I can't directly control my depression, my OCD, whatever it is. And I'm going to let myself off the hook because I didn't choose this. And I, yeah, this is an experience I'm having that will, it will pass. I don't know exactly when, but for now I'm going to, yeah, not compound it by beating myself up over it. You get to, because I think like a lot of, for a lot of people dealing with these sorts of things, a lot of the dealing with it is thinking about things you did in the past when you were in the midst of it and beating yourself up for it. You know what I mean? Like I look back at like times that I was just on a mattress on the floor, not just like telling people, I can't make it, but just not showing up, turning the, just, you know what I mean? And I, if I'm not careful, I'll look back at that and be like, God, what the fuck, man? What? You don't respect your friends. Why would you, why would you do that? And, and, and, but then I have to remind myself you did that because you were, you were fucking depressed and you weren't treating it at all. That's why you did that. Like it's not like you, it's not like you're like, boy, what's better than laying on, a stinky mattress in a apartment that doesn't have AC in the middle of summer for a few days? What's better than that? Oh, why would I want to go to have a drink with my fucking friends when I could do this joy, joyful thing? You know, it's like you're sick. That's why you're doing it. So I think it's, you know, we always have to keep reminding ourselves of that. If I, that's been one of the ways I've sort of untangled a lot of my, you know, guilt is just looking back at me like you were, you were depressed. Also when some people who that I have like, like labeled in a negative way in retrospect, I look back and I'm like, oh, they were fucking depressed, man. They were doing the best they could. They were just doing the best they could. Like they were like the fact they were able to eat was probably an amazing thing for them in those times. You know, I, I, it's just like, yeah. So for me, I always am trying to work on the compassion with myself and other people in that regard. Cause right, we don't, you don't know when someone's being an asshole, you don't know what's going on, going on in there, like behind it all, you know, like they could be super sick. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, those two go together. I mean, for, for me, self compassion and compassion towards others, I, I heard it said, I don't remember by whom, but this idea of the way. The way we talk to others is the way we talk to ourselves. But I'd actually take that further in that I generally am, I mean, I've gotten, there's been a lot of growth in this area for me, but in general, I talk to myself much more harshly than I talk to other people. And but that was helpful for me when I have met someone who's just a really harsh asshole to be like, man, like, all right, it sucks dealing with this person at this comedy club, you know, this book or for an hour, but I feel bad for this dude cause he's in there 24 seven for, you know, that's like the way he's talking to me, that there's no way someone who talks to other people in an abusive way is in their own head, you know, very gentle and loving towards themselves. And then you go back further, where did that come from? Well, he didn't make a conscious choice to be that way. Almost certainly there's, there's trauma, there's loss, there's, there's deep pain. And this is this person's adaptation. They're a way that they unconsciously chose probably at an early age to feel safe in the world and what a horribly high price they're paying for it. And I can have compassion for them because I've paid a very horribly high price at times for my own strategies to protect myself. Oh God, not me. You know, I've never said what's interesting. One of the things that many things is interesting about me is I've never said anything mean to anyone. It's not yet, but actually that's on your Wikipedia page. Never once. God, it's such a high price. I mean, like in, in Buddhism, you know, it's one of the big anger is like one of the top don't do it. And, you know, I've been looking into just out of curiosity into Islam and same, obviously it's like, it's a universal reality, which is like most of the time being shitty with someone is not going to do anything to make your life situation better. Most of the time, there's exceptions. Most of the time, though, it's not going to do anything. Sometimes you need to stick up for yourself, though, again, we're back to the figuring out one for the line. Where's the line? But I think this, but we're not really back to line because I think you and I, what we're both, I mean, I don't know exactly what you're thinking, but what I'm thinking of these sort of examples are where it clearly is not helpful to be an abusive asshole for that person or the other person. But it's, it's, you know, it's an addiction, it's a strategy, which is really what addictions are, are strategies that ultimately have ceased to serve us, but also do serve us in the very, very short term. I mean, this is an important point that I think people with OCD, and I'm guessing depression and other neurodivergence slash mental illness is often miss, is people with OCD will be like, well, I don't know why I do this, you know, but there is a payoff. There is, you know, when I'm trying to get it right, I'm trying to get it right, and I feel like I have gotten it right, or even maybe I got it right, there's, there's some dopamine flow in those moments. It may only last for 10 seconds. Yeah. And I'm guessing for you, there is probably, you know, when you're feeling that depression starting to lay heavily on you, and the alarm goes off, and you're like, no, you know what, I'm just going to turn over and pull the covers over my head. I'm guessing not all the time, but some of the time there's at least a few seconds of comfort in that moment, it feels better to stay in bed and to get out of bed. Oh God, yeah. It's all fucking warm and the most infernal warm. It's like, it's like, if, if somebody like asked the most evil thing in the universe to try to synthesize coziness, you know what I mean? It's like, here you are, is this what you meant? No. Be careful what you wish for. That's not what I fucking meant. But, but it, I know what you mean, but you'd also be like, but it's kind of close. I mean, yeah, it just didn't fold me in your tentacles, oh dark lord. I mean your tentacles, that should, that should be a t-shirt. I feel like, but the, you know, the, again, like I love having these conversations. Anytime I get to have them with people are open about neurodivergent slash mental illness, it's like, it's always very liberating for me. I know other people when they hear it too, they're like, oh fuck, right. Because that is another thing I think we, it's good to like sort it all out, you know, like what you've learned from the particular thing, because in a weird way, like we are all kind of explorers in that regard, you know, we're all in our own bushwhacking through our own terrain and anytime we figure something out, that's a way to, you know, treat it or some like way to like mitigate it at least, it's really good to share it with others, you know, because I think the assumption is that it's all, it's all been figured out or, you know, there's a few pathways to deal with it, but actually I think it hasn't. We all have stuff to offer, but you know, with whatever it may be like with eight, like take ADHD for example, another of my diagnoses. I remember when I first, I didn't know you had that one in the quiver, another, I remember getting it, I remember they just gave me a sheet and it was like, check which of these apply to you. And it was like being with a psychic, you know what I mean? This was for an ADHD like a questionnaire or something, yeah, like check, check, check, check. And it was so wonderful because it's like, Oh, right. These were all things that I thought, you know, I'm, I'm just the guy who can't clean. I'm the guy who can't clean his room. I'm the guy who I'm the guy who loses his keys. I'm the guy who procrastinates. That's just what, you know, it's my kid, but it's like, no, that actually is it. You're not that guy. That's part of who you are, but that's not you. That's just part of like the, what you're dealing with people to get back into the payoff. People with ADHD, they procrastinate. As it was described, explained to me, they procrastinate because if you can successfully procrastinate long enough to the point where you are in a 100% full blown anxiety attack from the procrastination, your brain will start giving you stress chemicals. Those stress chemicals will produce the focus that you were somehow knowing that you needed. And so, so that's, so the night before the thing is due, suddenly you're like, holy shit. And now you're like, Oh, okay, I can get it all done. You get it done. And then the other payoff is the burst of relief you get from getting the thing done. But this is like one of the qualities. A lot of people with ADHD become comedians, become paramedics, get into like weird high risk things, because if there's a lot of pressure in, then they can sort of induce what common ADHD medications are trying to do. But it's just the worst way. It's like punching your brain, you know, to try to get it to squeeze out just a droplet of something that apparently most people's brain just naturally make. This was not your point. But as you're talking, so I've had a few friends who know me well, who have been like, Yeah, I think you should get checked out for ADHD. And as you're describing it, like, Yeah, I mean, I know this isn't the, the, the sole diagnostic criteria, but yeah, I can't clean my room. I can't find my keys. And I certainly fall into this cycle where I have, I have a book chapter that was, that was due what's two days ago. And I haven't done it yet. And I know two days ago, we both had a chapter, and I've known about this for months and I've known, and it's part of it is the person I'm doing the book chapter for is an understanding person. So it's, but it's like, yeah. I think that's what it is. If it was like someone less understanding, then that those chemicals would have kicked in, you know, two nights ago at 1130 p.m. But, but it's like my brain is still like, no, no, no, you know, we're going to do this tomorrow. But, but yeah, man, I, I, my purpose, my, my, you know, in the goal in doing your podcast is not come up with new diagnoses for myself, but that is one that I think I'm going to explore with a professional because I, yeah, it's good to get it checked out. You never know. It could be so many other things too. Like, who knows, it could just be a fucking sucks to write. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it could just be like, it's hard to write. And that's also, I don't like doing hard shit. Who, who knew? Yeah. It's like, we would rather do, you know, that this is like, I just ordered, God, I should have done it because I've been so perpetually disappointed by things I've ordered from Instagram. I've only ordered like one, actually one thing and every two things, an ear cleaner, garbage, but they made it look like it was going to like just pull like a, just a huge beautiful balls of wax out of your ear. And it was late. So I'm just like, some, you know, you're thinking like, God, that's what I need. That'll make everything better. And then weirdly, the same year I got it, I fell for another ear scam. Wait, we're going to be targeting you for your scams from now on. This is, this is your legacy for the rest of your life. I must have said something that they picked up on like, I got filthy ears. And all of a sudden it's just ear bullshit. But like one of the things was one of those scopes. So you stick the thing in your ear and now you can look in there and let's see all this is like an app. Do you look on your phone? It was an app. Wow. That one never even fucking came. I paid for it. I didn't even fucking show up. So this thing is like, essentially a typewriter emulator. So it's like a portable word processor that doesn't go on the internet. So you can go because like my studio is not a good writing studio. There's too many cool gadgets for me to fuck around with and like and I can justify it by saying like, well, maybe this will be in an intro for a podcast. Yeah. And then I end up not writing. So I love, I've loved your musical intros though, man. I have to say that. Thank you. Not to reinforce your, your procrastinating, but this also brings up, let's take a slight right turn here. One of the things I had a therapist who would say like, yeah, you know, procrastination is also, to some extent, that's a value judgment to say you're procrastinating. I mean, he'd say like, a lot of my best ideas have come when I've been procrastinating. So yeah, I mean, if you're using you creating music as procrastination, like that, that to me adds a unique element to your art, to your creativity. Well, I love the angle. I did have a method actually, because I realized that like I have a hierarchy of things that I would like to do or not do. And so I, somewhere at the top of the list, I don't want to work out. So I would bring a notebook to the gym. And then I would find myself writing because I, I was there to work out. And so I procrastinate the working out by writing. So yeah, you know what I mean? Like I, you could, I was like hacking myself because there's a theory about this that basically Yeah. Well, that's, yes. I, I dated a psychologist who also struggled with procrastination. She would use essentially, it sounds like the same technique where, so she really had to, she had to write a research paper. She really, really didn't want to do it. She would find something she didn't want to do even more than that. And therefore write that research paper. It worked for her. It works. Yeah. I'm telling you, it works. Like you just want to distract yourself from the next thing, from the next thing. It's a highly, highly, it's like one of. I was so thrilled when I realized what was happening, but then I actually, I wanted to work out. So that was the problem. So I got to find something I want, want to do less than work out. You really don't want to do. Yeah. Interesting. Can you talk about your book at all? Oh, it's not my book. I'm, I'm, I'm writing a chapter for, yeah, I think I can talk about it. It's not, I mean, it's obviously, I won't mention names, but it is a book about psychedelics and the future of humanity. That's someone who I have a great deal of respect for in the field has, is putting together. And I guess I can, like the other contributors are, you know, A-list people like, like Dennis McKenna, psychedelic A-list people. And I was flattered. He asked me to write about psychedelics and humor, because I think that's such rich territory. I mean, to, yeah, there's, there are so many parallels. The surrender of psychedelics, the surrender of laughter, the humility that comes from both laughter and the psychedelic experience, the awe. So anyway, it's, I'm, I'm writing a, you know, it's a short, you know, underword chapter about psychedelics and humor, which is something I want to do. It's, it'll be like, I, I have a lot to say about the topic, but yet the fact that I have this deadline. And of course, yeah, writing always puts on, for me, there's a, a level of, it can trigger the perfectionism to a unique degree. One of the liberating things about live performance I've always found as an obsessive perfectionist. And I don't know if this has been your experience is when I'm on stage, things don't always go the way I want them to go, but I got a role with it. You know, I can't stop a performance and be like, oh, you know, you know what, wait, I, I delivered that punchline wrong. Everyone just hold on one second. Let me get back into character and let me do that again. So you just kind of, the performance, it, it rolls by at the end, I may be happy with how it went. I may be unhappy. Usually I'm somewhere in between, but it's over. Whereas if it's something on the page, I can write and rewrite and re rewrite. And I saw this with, I have this, this, well, it was going to be a psychedelic news show called the trip report. It, it may just be one episode. The first episode, it was, so originally it was, I was, That's what you sent me. Yeah. Yeah. Love it. Oh, thanks man. Yeah. People seemed to like it. And I, I, so originally it was a project involving a bunch of people. It was actually Hamilton Morris and I were co-anchors. So it's a psychedelic news show, but sort of comedic in the, in the vein of kind of, you know, last week tonight with John's, John Oliver would be the closest sort of analog. So originally it was Hamilton and I as co-anchors, I had a friend, really brilliant director named Kurt Benton and we're directing it. And then the pandemic and all the shit happened. And so I wound up doing it entirely on my own. And it was an OCD perfectionism rabbit hole. I did like a hundred takes of the footage. I would edit and re-edit and re-edit. And so, and, and writing prose also can hold that, that danger for me where, you know, you can always, you can always do another edit, you can always do another rewrite. Whereas on stage it's over. The audience left. You can't, you know. Yes. And this is, well, this is like, you know, this is what I do love about like hardcore deadlines, like, like truly unavoidable deadlines, like, you know, I got to get a podcast out this week. I have to. Like it's like, I have to do it. Or like obligate, like I have obligations to get it out that, that my whole life will get fucked up if I don't. So I have to get it out. That cures, that cures the problem you're talking about because, you know, the reason I was late for this is because I've been working on a cover of Radiohead's Creep with Big Bird, a deep fake of Big Bird singing it. Wow. And it's like, I have to get it out today. You know what I mean? Like, so it's like, it isn't, is it perfect? Fuck no. It's not perfect. Why do you have to get it out today? Because I want to put it on the intro of this podcast. Oh, okay. So, so, so I love that because it stops, it stops, it like stops the thing that makes you just want to adjust and change and adjust and change and fix. This is like, when you hear about Brian Eno's awesome rules about making music, which apply to writing, comedy and everything else. I don't know them. Oh, check it out. It's like, let me see if I can find some of them. But it completely is a, you're like it, you could extrapolate it into anything creative, but let me see if I can find a few of them. I think they have cards where you can, here's one, Eno's first rule was, honor thy error as a hidden intention. Others included use non-musicians and tape your mouth. It's called oblique strategies, but they're, they're, they're wonderful because they sort of impose limitation. And sometimes, especially in making stuff, the problem is lack of limitation, not limitation. The problem is no certain boundaries, right? Absolutely. And that's what I found with this trip report thing, where it was just me, I had all these different ideas and it was, yeah, it could go in any number of directions. And there's, I, I was, I have my own podcast called Not Therapy, where a friend of mine who's a psychiatrist does sort of therapy on me, but we talked about psychedelics, relationships, all that stuff. And he, I was talking about this issue where, especially with the pandemic, when all of my external responsibilities in terms of live performances evaporated and I was having a lot of trouble, uh, motivating, and he said, you know, work will make you free. And I was like, oh, that's a great point. And he's like, actually, that was, that was Nazi propaganda. That was, that was on the gates over the entrance to like, but, but there's something to that, you know, having, having obligation. It's this paradox where obligation confers freedom to a degree. Obviously, you can be completely hamstrung by obligation, but the other end of the spectrum, which is honestly dunking where I find myself now, and it's, it's not an optimal place for me where there's no obligation or almost no obligation can be, particularly for someone with OCD who wants to figure out the perfect thing to do and the perfect timing. But I think for anyone can be incredibly paralyzing, incredibly paralyzing. Yeah. You need to find your, like you have to have a, because you're, you're obviously people listening can hear how brilliant you are. You just, you need like that, like, and part of being as smart as you are, I would imagine is you have this, you know, you could put anything you want to figure out, you could figure it out, it might take some time, but you can figure it, meaning you kind of know you can do like all the jobs. And well, how do you, you're, you're like an exemplar for this for me in that you, you do podcasts, you do live performance, you do fucking music and your music is great, man. Like, I remember the first time I think I heard you play was when it might have been the last time we did the podcast when I was at your place in LA and you were hooking up all these crazy modular synths. Yeah. Yeah. I'd never seen shit like that in real life. And well, I'm learning, but yeah, but though, but you're, I mean, you're, you're making like pop songs now and you did that in the Midnight Gospel. I mean, let's talk about that. That's, to me, that is, I mean, I just have the utmost admiration for, for what you created, because it's something that it kind of reminds me of art. The first time I really started to get into poetry was around the time I really got into psychedelics. And I was, I had a few weeks at this beach house and I brought Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass with me. I don't know if you've ever gotten into it, but it was, yeah. And I think I was even sober, but I was reading it and I had this epiphany where I was like, oh, Walt Whitman is not writing in this at that time, totally pioneering free verse form because he was like, hey, I want to do free verse poetry. No. He had certain ideas and emotions he wanted to express and that form was necessary to express them. He couldn't do it in, in sonnets. He couldn't do it in prose. He couldn't do it by standing on a soapbox and, you know, in, in, in Times Square. This was the form followed the, the content, the emotion. And that's what I get from Midnight Gospel where you and, and Ward, and I'm obviously a lot of other creative people are involved to, I don't know, but you created something completely unique, not to me for the sake of just like, let's do something unique. But because this was the way to express something that you wanted to express. And what blows my mind even more is it started with something that wasn't created for that form. It started with these podcast audios. So. Right. Well, it was, you know what, to get back to the trip report and like that thing where you realize you're thwarted by wanting to do everything yourself, that, you know, it was really cool to work with Pendleton because he's a genius when it comes to collaboration. And from, you know, he just, I've never encountered anyone, anyone who is that good at getting gluing people together. And he encouraged me to, to do those songs, you know, like I wouldn't have done it. Really? If it, if like there, if there'd been the slightest wintz from him or anything like that, I wouldn't have done it. So that's why collaboration is great. It's, you know, it's when you find someone you really vibe with, because then from that, you don't have to do everything and you need someone you can lean into too, that you can trust. You know that you, you know, someone you're like, okay, I might not think that that idea is good, but I think you're good. And that idea came from you. And you know what I mean? So I'm going to trust. Yeah. And that's going to, whatever it form, it looks like now, I might not understand, but it's going to grow into something great with a trip report thing I see and what you sent me. Okay. This is trying to do it yourself. Like, you know, you and Hamilton would be freaking hilarious together, man. That is a perfect. And also if you look at the landscape right now, what a timely, what a timely moment to make a show like that, because you can, like you have things backing you up that are massive corporations who are wanting to cash in on this stuff and massive amounts of money being dropped into. I'm sorry to say cash in, but I mean, we're fucking pharmaceutical companies, you know, it's not like, right. Absolutely. I mean, we have this major trial of psilocybin that's happening. I wasn't referring to the MDMA thing. I've met Doblin and there's a legitimate love in him for people like he, so I wasn't, I wanted to, my friends out there, I want to seem like I'm like sub-tweeting or some bullshit, but it's like the, I think it's a, whatever path gets us to a psychedelic future where the prohibition is over and the taboo is lifted. I'm pretty okay with that path for better, for worse, you know, so that's my feeling. But what a great time to have a show like that. I mean, like if you had to, if you, you're saying this would be like a talk, like an actual talk show, studio talk show, you would have guests and then just, you know, sort of, you know, do a monologue upfront about the state of things as they are in the news, I guess. Yeah. That, that was, that was the original vision and I may, I may revisit it, but I put out this episode and, you know, it's tough, first of all, to get someone to watch something that's 10 minutes long. A good friend pointed this out where he's like, yeah, if I don't already have confidence in what I'm going to see, meaning I don't know the person. If someone's not famous, if I'm not a fan of theirs and I see a 10 minute video, I'm probably not going to press play. If I do press play, if they don't suck me in in 30 seconds, I'm stopping. And this whole thing, I crafted, it has a whole arc to it. And so this is all to say that, listen, if I'd put it up, I put it about a month ago and it had gotten a million views, then I'd be like, yeah, I'm doing more of these. But the amount of time I put into the number of people it reached has made me reevaluate that. And part of that, of course, it says an ego thing, but part of it is also I have a limited amount of time on this earth. Maybe we don't know, as we were saying at the beginning of the podcast, but presumably. And so I want to, for a variety of selfless and selfish and egotistical and altruistic reasons, I want my work to reach more people. And so it feels like the sort of ratio of time put into number of people reached. This may not be the vehicle I want to do it in. But you just need to shrink it down. That's all. That's one possibility is just kind of streamlining it because there are sketches and those took a lot of time. Another possibility is partnering with people and organizations who can put more resources behind it. Yeah, I mean, I like and I like the idea of psychedelic news one, because I think it's just the most interesting thing happening. What we're seeing this huge shift in acceptance, public and legal and medical acceptance of psychedelics happening so rapidly. Yeah, you know, albeit after, you know, maps was started 30 something years ago. So it's been this slow, slow build, but it's like that, you know, with the stock people say hockey stick, there you go. Yeah, like suddenly now we're in this accelerated exponential growth phase. So it's and we're seeing all these competing factions. The people are like, yeah, this is this is indigenous medicine, man. This has to be available for free. And then people, you know, like compass pathways, we're trying to adopt pretty aggressive patent strategies. God bless you, Bluetooth, not just for supporting this episode of the DTFH, but for giving me powerful, beautiful, glorious boners.

Now back to the podcast. And we're seeing all these competing factions that people are like, yeah, this is Indigenous medicine, man. This has to be available for free. And then people like Compass Pathways who are trying to adopt pretty aggressive patent strategies. And then all of that against the bigger context of bringing it back to what you and I were talking about earlier, what the fuck are these experiences? This is to me, this is as someone who has been on a litany of psychiatric medications. I've been off for 15 years, but I was on all the SSRIs, a typical antipsychotics, all that stuff. This is a very different experience than psychedelic. This is not, that's not a good analog to, you know, the outcomes we're going for in terms of relief from depression and OCD may be similar, but the, you can't discount. And this is sort of a thrust of the first episode that I put out of the trip report, is the psychedelic experience itself is something that has to be reckoned with and grappled with in a unique way, because it is a unique experience. Oh, amen to that. And it weirdly mirrors the, what they're now calling UAPs, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, but it weirdly mirrors that in the sense that both the psychedelics experience and, like, anyone who, like, talks about seeing something up in the sky, in front of the wrong audience, both stories are met with, like, an eye roll. Both are, you know, like, I've had conversations with people who have said, yeah, but you were high, like, because I was high, it didn't count. And so this, this, like, I understand why people say that, because the propaganda machine gotten to everyone's head, that you're breaking your brain with these substances rather than amplifying, refining, whatever word you want to use, or creating a sort of anomalous kind of focus that is not a malfunction, but is just, you know, sort of a temporary, I don't want to use, like, machine terms that are now pretty antiquated, but temporarily rewiring your nervous system for the positive. You know, and so, yeah, I agree with you, man, that, that, that, the, that's the main stigma that I would love to see lifted, where the hierarchies that we now seem to apply to waking consciousness, where if you are, you know, drinking coffee in the morning, totally normal, totally normal. If you're getting stoned in the morning, whoa, what's going on with you, man, you're getting high in the morning. And some of it I get, like, you know, if you're waking up and drinking tequila, you know what I mean? Like, that's going to be maybe once a summer or something like that. But in general, I do get why, but I'm just saying, like, this fucking sacred profane thing, where the sober mind state is this great holy sacred place, and anything that goes away from that, that isn't prescribed by a doctor, or isn't at the right time of culturally at the right time of day, is an indication that something's going wrong with you. I look forward to when that goes bye bye. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And, and you were, you were drawing an analogy with UAPs is the current term, right? And I assume what you were seeing with the analogy is that, yeah, with the wrong crowd, you could get eye rolls, but also what we're seeing very quickly happening with psychedelics and UAPs is more and more people are like, oh, oh, wow, I always dismiss this, but maybe there's something here. Yeah. I mean, look, as someone who loves psychedelics and UFOs, it's like, it's hard for me not to just think like, oh, yeah, this is definitely a dream, or it's something I like programmed before I was born. So it's like really like towards the end of your life, you're like, all right, let's get psychedelics legal and reveal there's UFOs all the same fucking time. You mean the best time in human history? Like that's, that is actually happening. And it's such a wonderful, wonderful thing to me, but the UFO thing is exciting to me, but, but it's a little, it's exciting as an, it's an entertainment, it's entertainment, and it's thrilling, but the psychedelic universe is a little more, is a little closer to home because I have two, two children, and I don't want them to grow up in a prohibition. I don't want them to grow up in an anti science time period where their garbage facts are being thrown at them about anything, especially things that have the potential to allow them to, you know, elevate their consciousness when they're old enough, you know, when their brain is like finished developing mid twenties out of the house. But there is a, there is a school of thought that says expose kids to the stuff earlier, you know, and certainly a lot of indigenous cultures, it is more of a rite of passage thing. Nothing would encourage you to, encourage you to dose your kids at age nine. I never would. But I, I get, but, but no, like, I think the problem with that is like culturally we're not there yet. I think it is, it's certainly we are there when it comes to giving all the very psychiatric medications we give children without even thinking about it. But when we're, for better or for worse, we're not going to be there for another 50 years. But I do 20 years maybe. But I do think, who knows, it's accelerating so much. I mean, I know. Yeah. But, but yeah, it is, we're not there. No, we're not there yet. And we don't, we don't, we don't, in the, why are we not there yet? One of the reasons is because the way the West understands things is through the quantification, the data sets, an accepted, rigorous way of discerning. This is what's true. This isn't what's true. Confidence intervals, statistical significance, all of it. And this is, this is like saved a lot of lives. And we need it because otherwise it's like, you know, you get thalamite, you know, you get like things can fuck up. So I think one of the reasons we're not there yet, the reason why if you bring your child to a psychiatrist for some behavior disorder, there, there is a chance that the psychiatrist will write a prescription for something that is going to radically alter the way your child's brain works. And that's because there's data backing it up. Because lots of money got put into the studies. I was going to say the data itself is somewhat suspect in that. I mean, this is a digression. Like with, well, the whole thing with SSRIs, where there was this Paxil, which I was on for many years. I was on that starting at age 18 for many years, high dose Paxil and SSRI. And it turned out it was implicated in juvenile suicide. Kids, teenagers were more likely to commit suicide, not massively more likely. But if you take a drug and it's being prescribed to hundreds of thousands or millions of people, there's a, you know, discernible number of people who killed themselves who probably wouldn't have. And the drug company, I think it was GlaxoSmithKline. I could be wrong about that. But whatever the drug company was, they had evidence of this and they suppressed it. And it turned out, you know, so many of these stories, I feel like we don't find out about this one. We did. There were lawsuits. Anyway, as part of the lawsuit settlement, they had to disclose all of the clinical trial data for Paxil. And it turned out, I don't remember the exact numbers, but there was something like 48 clinical trials that had been published for Paxil in support of it being approved by the FDA. And all 48 showed a positive benefit from Paxil. But pursuant to this lawsuit, they had to disclose the unpublished trials. And it was one fewer trials, like 47 unpublished trials that showed no benefit, or in some case showed harms, meaning people on this did not do better, and in some cases did worse than the placebo. I thought you had to publish all the trials. You don't have to publish all the... No, no, it's fucking insane. There's a guy named Ben Goldaker in the UK who has this book called Bad Farmer about this. And now he's, he has started this nonprofit that's dedicated to changing this. And they have changed it. I think in the UK, it may be being changed in the US, but no, this is insane, Duncan. Clinical trial data is considered proprietary business information. That's a fucking loophole, isn't it? What a loophole! So the psychiatrist drawing on the data saying that your nine-year-old should be on cerakwill. Yeah, there is data, but who knows what others trials say. Ooh, don't put nine-year-olds on cerakwill. They're only seeing what the company that's selling the stuff wants them to see. And this comes back to things like regulatory capture, people on the FDA being former drug company executives. And listen, this is not my, you know, there's other people who know a lot more about this, but yeah, it's been a massive problem where thankfully there's more awareness of it now. And again, I think there certainly is a movement to change it in this country, whether it's not it's succeeded as well as in other countries. Well, thank you for telling me about that. I'm going to revise my thinking when it comes to what I understood as a rigorous and very important methodology that the FDA uses to determine this thing from that thing. I've got to revise. That might be a little naive of me to think that. And the FDA, to be clear, they do use a fairly rigorous methodology, but they're dependent on essentially, unless if this has changed recently, drug companies deciding what stuff gets published and doesn't get published. They're not doing the studies. So it's like the FDA is it is depending on well, look, I don't look that's great to that's great to know I'm going to I'm going to jump into it. But there's a really good book called Anatomy of an Epidemic by I believe it's Robert Whitaker that talks about all this stuff and makes a pretty compelling case that most psychiatric medications and he used to work for drug companies. Most psychiatric medications not only don't help the conditions they purport to help but over the long term may actually worsen it. And he was a controversial figure to to their credit, the psychiatry community profession has actually started to embrace him. He gave a keynote address at an American Psychiatric Conference recently. So there is more and more of an acknowledgement that psychiatric medications to be clear, they are lifesaver for some people. And if someone is listening to this is on psychiatric medications and feels they help them keep taking them. And if you don't feel they help you still keep taking them until you consult with someone because getting off the stuff can cause all sorts of challenges too. But but yeah, there's you know, we don't have a picture of the efficacy and long term. The long term outcome is the other big question because the clinical trials to approve this stuff, you're typically looking at like eight weeks, 10 weeks. I don't know anyone who's been on Paxil for eight or 10 weeks, people are on this stuff for eight or 10 years. I was on SSRIs for 15 years, right? Yeah, no trial data whatsoever for that. It's impossible to get for some of this stuff because it's relatively new and it hasn't and who's going to fund it? The drug companies have no incentive in funding it once it's been approved. Right. They have no incentive in funding this very expensive long term follow up that may show that it's not that effective. Well, I mean, I think this is clearly one of the problems of psilocybin and other psychedelics. If you want to have a if you want to make a lot of money, because it's not the subscription model, right? You know what I mean? Like what are you going to do? Like tell someone they need to take psilocybin every day, like they do antidepressants. I mean, I if they do do that, that'll be a great day for me when I bring that prescription to the fucking pharmacy. I got to take it every day. Take an eighth every day in the morning. Wonderful. But but I isn't that like, isn't this one of the challenges that the problem is, is like, okay, we have shown that psilocybin has the effect of is even better at helping people with endogenous depressions than some addiction than like the currently prescribable stuff. But the problem is they don't need a lot of doses. You know, this is the kind of thing where some people will have a profile, not a therapeutic trip. It's important to make that distinction. But I mean, I've known people who have had a really profound mushroom trip or LSD trip, and they just stop drinking, or they just stop eating meat, or they just stop. You know what I mean? They just stop. They don't want to do it anymore. And it and it and it seems to last for a long time. Not everybody, but so how do you make money off of that? Yeah, yeah, that that that has been one of the challenges. And that's why maps has has adopted this model of a public benefit corporation, where basically their stuff is available freely. It's a little more complicated than that. But there. But now we're seeing all these for profit companies coming in. And yeah, and the idea is, what are you actually patenting? I mean, some companies like compass pathways has been granted a patent on psilocybin, not mushrooms, either specific formulation of psilocybin. But it's a fairly broad patent that caused a lot of concerns. Yeah, yeah, they were they were they were granted a patent for pump 360 their synthetic form of psilocybin, which there's nothing inherently unusual or even I would say immoral about being granted a patent on a synthetic version of naturally occurring psychedelic mean Albert Hoffman, the inventor of LSD, also filed the first patent for psilocybin synthetic psilocybin in I think 1958. So but the issue with compass patent is that actually, they purported that this was a novel invention, their synthesis method. And it turns out they had taken a lot of stuff that was effectively in the public domain synthesis methods that were being used by nonprofits like hefter and use some in fact, some methods that Hoffman himself had pioneered. So one way to answer your question, Duncan is how do you make money? Well, you do these ridiculously aggressive patent strategies, so that you can essentially try to control something, not in its naturally occurring form, but in its medically sanctioned form, right? So that yeah, the government is not going to my insurance company is not going to underwrite the seven grams of mushrooms I want to take for a healing spiritual experience. No, but they may underwrite a $3,000 psychedelic assisted treatment plan that uses compasses comp 360 and compass charges $500 for the 25 milligrams of psilocybin they administer in a in a pressed pill. Yeah, we'll see now this to me, this is where we run into like some really wonderfully controversial territory, which is okay. So then the answer is is you know, pure like legalization, acknowledging the recreational and also the fact that like you can't we if you go to a doctor, you go to a psychiatrist, a therapist, they you know, just because especially if you're using insurance, they have to report something to the insurance company to get paid. So diagnostic code, it's not like hey, this guy just wants to see the face of God that doesn't no code for that yet. Blue Cross is not going to ante up for that. But that to me that that again, it does show how insane our culture is, which is there should be a code for they want to see the face of God. Oh, they you know, they feel like sort of entrenched in a non mystical identity state. And so they're hoping to upshift their consciousness. What's the code for that? You know, and then and then it should be accepted that like human beings are we're not just going like we're not medicine shouldn't just be for when you're sick, you know, like medicine or our definition of sickness should not be we just need to broaden our definition of what it means to be out of harmony out of sync or even we need to bra or even the idea that like we want to aspire to greater states of joy, you know, that absolutely. That's that's where we're still in the, you know, we're in a very primitive state when it comes to medicine globally, I think. Absolutely. And I think yeah, I mean, I hold to the view, you know, the sort of Terrence McKenna view and other people have had it to that we co evolved. And I think I say this in the trip report, more or less, we co evolved with these compounds with these plants and fungi, hundreds of them throughout the planet that interact with the human nervous system in very specific ways that seem to be massively adaptive, not just for the individual that is people lead more harmonious lives, healthier lives, but also for the community, those individuals are embedded in, they're more altruistic, they're more giving, they're more concerned about their neighbors, they're more concerned about the greater good. So I believe that we've we've cut ourselves off from these experiences and these plants and fungi that induce these experiences at great personal and collective costs. Absolutely. Yeah. But where's the code for that? Well, it's six, six, six. That's the fucking code. Six, six, six. Only drink. Six, six, six. I'm prescribing a pack of cigarettes to you, motherfucker. Like, but this is like, again, why and I understand, and especially now that you've explained, I'm glad we had this conversation, man. I feel like I've got a little bit of a fool. Am I thinking about the current state of things when it comes to you fool? But, but still, I feel like whatever is normalizing this medicine, even if it is like temporarily satanic, it's still better than not normalizing it. It's still better. It's still going to balance out the Paxil and the SSRIs and all the other stuff. It's still going to produce an alternative. You know, just that alone, here's an alternative. Because, you know, my, my mom, when she was alive, this is the sort of thing that she wouldn't have looked into because she's, you know, depending on how old you are, your parents are probably pretty fucking programmed. And they're like deeply programmed and they can't get out of the programming or it's very hard for them. Yeah, they don't even realize it's a program. It was, it was, it was inculcated so early and so deep. And also in a lot of the people who are enforcing drug laws, they are just as much conditioned to believe it too. You know, they, their ideas, I've had someone to tell me what those people think about like what these drugs do. They don't see a difference between, say, PCP and psilocybin. They don't, they just look at it as one evil, like demonic force. People who legitimately believe marijuana, it should be a schedule one drug. It does cause similar harms to her. Yes, exactly. So to me, what, what is happening is now when we're on the news, when you're seeing like, oh, this trial of psilocybin just passed or is about to get approval or MDMA is getting approval or all these things. And at the very least it, it has to make people recalibrate their thinking regarding these substances. All right. So Duncan's not here, a listener. So I want to tell you, I wonder if Duncan will listen to this. I assume this will just put out, Unlistened 2. When Duncan said that 6, 6 thing, 6 thing, his eyes were glowing red and his teeth, his canines, that they seemed to elongate. So he's coming back. Okay. So here's my question for you. Yes. Last question, because you texted me with like the greatest text ever, which was you were telling me that you had gone into the caole. And when you came out, you thought you should reach out to me. I was so honored by that. Like anyone coming out of a caole wants to talk to me. I love you. But can you go into some detail about what happened? Tell me please, I'm eager for any news from the man of the caole. It's such a mysterious realm. Well, I'll give you a somewhat long winded answer. Thank you. Because ketamine is a, it's nothing I'm particularly familiar with. I've had, yeah, I've had a fair number of experiences, but it still is, it's, it's utter territory for me than psychedelics, than classical psychedelics like, you know, mescaline, psilocybin, LSD. So some background. So, you know, I have this show called The Mushroom Cure, which is the story of how I tried to treat my OCD not exclusively with mushrooms, but largely with mushrooms and other classical psychedelics. And I, short version, is I found them really uniquely helpful in a number of, number of ways that I think are specific to psychedelics and wouldn't necessarily generalize to ketamine. But a lot of it, well, this is what we were talking about earlier, is this idea of depth of as more of a metaphor for surrender. And for someone with OCD who has this sort of default of trying to control and manage everything and get everything perfect, you know, in the face of eight or nine grams of mushrooms, you realize like, oh, I, I, I can't control at all. You see, it's that sort of, I use this phrase earlier, this kind of enforced surrender. Yeah. And I've had it both ways. I mean, I had experiences and I talk about this in The Mushroom Cure, where it was super intense and I tried to hold on and I just got my ass handed to me, you know, real, just profound existential terror. And then learning from that experience, going back into that space and realizing that if I let go in the face of all the fear, all the uncertainty, and this to me is so much of the signature of the psychedelic experience for, for me, generally, not that I haven't had challenging trips, but in general, when I am willing to let go, there's this sense of, oh, there, there's, I'm okay. There's this fundamental sense of okayness. Like I'm trying so, I've had these experiences on mushrooms, on LSD where it's like, whoa, this is so intense. I just, I got to hold on, I just got to hold on. It's going to pass in three hours or six hours if it's LSD. It's going to pass. Just hold on, just hold on. And I white knuckle it and it's awful. And then I've had these experiences where I got to hold on, I got to hold on. I can't, I just can't, it's too much. And you let go. And one of my trips, the, the metaphor, though I didn't perceive it as a metaphor, it felt like, it was a felt experience. It was like, I was standing at the edge of an 1,000 foot tall cliff. And as I'm saying this, I'm like, did we already talk about this on a previous podcast? Doesn't matter. All right. So I'm standing at the edge of a 1,000 foot tall cliff. And I, and I know I have to step over the edge, but I also know if I do step over the edge, I'm going to plum it to my death. And finally, I just can't hold on anymore. I can't stand clinging to that, that cliff face. And I let go. And it's like, oh, there's a ledge six inches below me. I didn't even see. It's just, you start to fall and then you're held. And this ledge is not a narrow ledge. It's a vast plateau where I can explore and live and gather food and find lovers. And so that for someone with a propensity to control, there's something just inherently healing and liberating about having not, not, if you'd asked me before psychedelics, I would say like, yeah, I, I feel like there's a sense of fundamental okayness in the universe. I do sense rightly or wrongly to me. The universe doesn't seem entirely neutral to me. I do believe there is a a force for good, for love that permeates things. It's a choice to see it that way maybe, but it doesn't, that feels true to me, feels true to me. Yeah. So, and I believe that before psychedelics, but having going from this, this belief, this cognitive belief that everything is okay at a deep level to experiencing it in your body is life changing has been life changing for me. Yes. Yeah. Well, the, the, that thing in particular that you're talking about, it reminded me of a story that I know I've said before, but I don't care on the podcast, which is that Ram Dass's Guru, my Guru, Neem Krali Baba is takes. Is that, is that Maharashi? Maharaji. Yes, yeah. I'm a Ram Dass fan, just I never met him, but pod, you know, his, his lectures are phenomenal. This is an amazing Maharaji story that relates to what we're talking about, which is one of his devotees, I guess you would say, couldn't swim. And so Maharaji had this devotee take him out to the, like the middle of this lake on a boat and said to him, jump, jump in the water. And, you know, he was like tearing up because he's like, you know, I can't swim, but this is his Guru and, you know, and a real Guru. So you're going to do what they ask you to do because you're still in love with them. And they let, they're just, it's all love. There's trust. So he jumps off the edge of the boat and certainly he's just going to plunge down and the water only went up to his waist. I love it. Yeah. Maharaji is like laughing. Wow. What a great fucking teaching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a really, really good teaching, which is like that, the, the, the, that you, in our lives, we get that unknown thing that, that we're certain should we move into whatever it may be, and it's different for everyone. We're done for. We're dead. And all the fear that goes into peering over that edge and only seeing darkness or, or trying to move your life as far away from the edges you can go. Yeah. Listening to make sure there isn't like cracks breaking below you that will turn where you're at into the ledge, jumping off is the one of the most liberating things ever. And because then suddenly you don't have to always be defending against that or trying to, Jesus Christ is that weird thing. You stand at the edge of a building and you like get vertigo like, Oh my God. Oh my God. You're, you're completely safe. It's not like you're going to fall off. You can stand up if I'm walking on a white line painted on the road. I'm not like, Oh my God. And I know I, one of my friends does like that insane urban exploration shit. They'll hang from, you know, they'll hang from like pull up bars or whatever you want to call them off of. I'm getting that vertigo, just imagining that in my life. But the point they made is like, it's no, like hanging on a playground and hanging off a building. It's the same amount of energy. It's just mentally one is very different from the other. But yeah, so it's that to me is, I know exactly what you mean, which in, and I think that is one of the gifts psychedelics will give people is that the very least they'll redefine what they think the edge is. Yeah. And find, and you know, this is, this is personal. I'm not saying this is it for everyone, but for me, I generally have come out with a sense of there's something. I don't know what it is. I'm not going to say it's Jesus or Allah or even, but there's a sense of there is something holding me and holding us and taking care of us in a way. I mean, it's so hard to use language because once you start using language, you're, yeah, it's a felt sense though. It's not something that I can quite put into words, but that has been also integral to healing from OCD with OCD because it still is absolutely a factor of my life to greater or lesser degrees. You know, again, the overall trend is less and less OCD and less more and more freedom. But, but yeah, this sense of that I can let go and things will be okay. That, that, that was really drilled, felt deeply on psychedelics. And, and yeah, has, has been life changing for me. This is chogim. Trump is famous quote. The bad news is you're falling. The good news is there's no ground. Now, tell me please. Yeah, okay. Oh, what please? I gotta hear from my people. Yeah. So having said all this as singing the praises of psychedelics for me, I will say that of late, I have not found psychedelics. First, I haven't done many journeys recently. The last time I did a real full on journey was ayahuasca pre pandemic. I've had a couple of mushroom journeys solo since then. And it's felt like during those journeys, it's felt like, oh, yeah, man, I needed this. But I'll be honest, it hasn't seemed to make much of an impact with whatever I've been struggling with at the time. And I had, so my OCD is primarily about decision making. I get obsessed with, you know, should I do this or that, this or that, this or that, this or that, and I can ping pong back and forth and make and reverse decisions and get into these sort of compulsive loops of making and reversing decisions. And it's gotten dramatically better. But it still flares up. At my worst, it was like, it would take me hours to get dressed because I'd put on and take off shirts. I'd be walking down the streets of New York City. And I'd be like, wait, wait, I'm walking down the south side of 18th Street. Let me cross over to the north side because they'll be more like it was every decision. Started working with psychedelics and other things. I mean, the mushroom cure, it's a long show because there's a lot of things that help and it is ultimately, thank you, thank you. And it's ultimately, it's entertainment. I'm not, it's not a how to manual, though I try to also help people who have questions, you know, who message me and that sort of thing. But point being psychedelics were integral in recovering. And the low level paralysis with these small decisions, I'm completely free of I do not have that anymore. Yeah, which is life changing. It's easy for me to forget. But that was hours every day that was consumed. And I just don't have it. But where it does flare up is with bigger but not that big decisions often related to career. Should I do a run of my show in this city or that city, that sort of thing. And so it'll typically, you know, they'll, they'll be a few times a year often where it gets really bad. And then maybe like one price a month where it gets kind of bad, but it doesn't generally take over. But then the pandemic came. And I think a lot of people had this experience for different reasons where it was actually a respite. I didn't have any career decisions to make none. I wasn't going to be performing anywhere. And so I kind of look at it as I got a little out of it's like if you're an alcoholic, and you know, you've been abstinent, you've been doing a good job. But then suddenly, all the bars are closed, you don't even have to work at it for a little while. And then suddenly now the bars are open, the world is opening up again. And I'm re confronted with these triggering decisions that I hadn't had contemplated in 14 or 15 months. And I'll be honest, Duncan, it got, you know, a few months ago, it got, it was the worst it had been in many years. Sorry. And very humbling. I was really not functioning well. I was, yeah, just not, not just sick. I was ill. I was ill. I was ill. And then of course, there's an additional thing that comes in for me now, which is like, Hey, man, you're supposed to be the guy who who did all this self healing with mushrooms. People are looking to you for guidance. What a fucking fraud you are. You're spending four, you know, a month trying to decide whether to go to this city or that city. You like, you can never do your show again. You're a liar. You know, it was all so all this coming in. And listen, I'm trying to work with it. I have tools now. And the primary tool is acceptance at a physical level, really tuning into the sensations in my body of deep fear and loss that I don't want to feel that the OCD is designed to try to get rid of those sensations. So I know if I can feel them, I may not feel great, they may not go away, but I'll have a degree of freedom if that makes sense. I don't have to, yeah, try to, because the OCD is trying to undercut them. So if I, if I let them in instead, and I'm trying to do it, but it's just, it's difficult, it's painful. I'm not doing. And so I'm talking to a friend of mine who, close friend who also works with maps and is a therapist. And I was like, yeah, I guess, I guess I should just, you know, do a do a large dose of mushrooms. I don't know what else to do. But the last couple of times I've done mushrooms, it hasn't felt particularly helpful. And he's like, he's like, do you have any ketamine? And I was like, yeah, you gave me some. I won't mention this person's name, but he gave me some nasal spray ketamine, like, you know, medical grade ketamine like a year ago. And he's like, you know, I would try that. And what he said, which I'm curious, your perspective on this Duncan, but he's like, you know, to me, ketamine is more of just kind of a pure biomedicine. That was the word he used biomedicine. It's just doing shit in your brain that just seems to me like maybe a little more concrete than psychedelics. Well, that's the data too. And my friend has a clinic and he was explaining to me that, you know, if you get the psychedelic effect, that's a bonus. But the efficacy doesn't seem to be connected at all to people reporting. You could have no experience, and you're still going to have the same statistical probability of a remission of your depression. So the implication is that that it is a, it's doing some kind of, you know, healing that is beyond like, but I think all of them, you could say they are, but specifically with, I think that's one of the beautiful things about ketamine is like, you don't have to worry about having some holy fucking contact with the divine necessarily. It's still, if you're someone struggling with depression, there's still, I can't remember what the probability is, but a relatively high probability that it's going to help you. Yeah, yeah. And well, so that was my experience. So as it turns out, I didn't realize, I actually didn't, there wasn't that much ketamine left in this, in this bottle. And, but so I did it that afternoon. It was, I was at my parents house at the time. And, you know, when I, one thing that I, I'm open about my OCD, and in some ways my parents are the hardest people to be open with, because they're going to worry the most. But when it was really bad, I was so glad they knew what was going on. So I actually said to my mother the day before, I was like, I think I may need to do a lot of mushrooms. And I think I'm going to go to, I had a friend who had a house somewhere. And this is what my mom said, bless her. She said, you know, I'd rather you just do the mushrooms here. That's such a mom. My parents have never done psychedelics. They've never even smoked weed. She was like, I just feel like just, you can go up into, you know, our room, their room is on the third floor and just, you know, take your mushroom to won't disturb you. Yeah. Yeah. But when I talked to my friend who suggested ketamine, I told her, I was like, so I'm going to do, you know, I told them a little bit about ketamine in the past, but I was like, I'm going to do ketamine. It's safe. Just basically don't come upstairs. I'll probably be down in a couple of hours. Yeah. It was an emotional moment. And I was really broken. I was, you know, I just felt very, very, very ill. And so I closed the blinds and polish off the bottle. And I realized there wasn't that much left in it. And to what you were saying, I did not have a mystical experience at all. I got some of that, you know, kind of ketamine body buzz. I was listening to a playlist my friend had made. And I was kind of, you know, merging a little bit with the music, but no real mystical experience. It passed because I didn't go that deep. Within an hour, I was out of it for maybe 45 minutes. And I was like, oh, well, that, that was a bust. I didn't, you know, I didn't see the face of God. So I called up my friend, I was like, shit, maybe I should smoke some weed just to try to kick it in more. And he's like, don't do that. Because, again, we're not necessarily going for this particular subjective experience. Let's see what happens now. Yeah. And so I didn't. And I, I came down from the bedroom. And over the next few hours, I felt peace for the first time in like this, this particular OCD crisis had been like a month, man. It was, it was, it was gnarly. And I just felt quiet. My brain just felt quiet. And the next, yeah, and I just, so I wasn't obsessing for the first time in a month about this particular, ultimately not that important, but for me, dominating decision. And the next day, we're still not to the Kale experience. The next day, it was fascinating to me. And again, I'm curious if this accords with your experience. My brain went back to OCD. My brain was like, yo, we got to figure this out. Are we going to do this or this? But my body would not get recruited into this project, meaning I would was feeling zero anxiety in my body. So my brain just kind of shrugged its shoulders at a certain point was like, what, you're not going to, you're not going to energize us with all this anxiety. There wasn't any force behind it. So the thoughts just kind of petered out. Then the next day, the anxiety started to come back. But I'd had enough of an opening that I was now more able and willing to use my tools of physical acceptance to meet this anxiety in a way that it didn't, I didn't fall back into OCD. Effectively, this, you know, sub psychedelic ketamine experience broke this particular OCD cycle for me. Wow. And so then, so yeah, so the cycle ended. I felt, you know, increasing freedom. And then this was very recently. Can I, we're a little interjecting the real question. Yeah, please. I want to hear again, I want to hear this next with your experience. The most astounding thing if you're someone who struggles with things like this, because I know you probably, it sounds like with, well, it sounds similar to depression, like you don't, when you're entering a depressive episode, you don't know how fucking long it's going to last. That's what's so awful about it is it's like, when I get a cold, I can roll, you know, I know it's you know, it's going to be a few weeks, maybe a week, depending on what, maybe a month, the most, or I'm going to go to the fucking doctor, but with depression, and my friends who really suffer from it, it's like, it could be, it could be a fucking decade. And if you've come out of it, and experience the other side, and then you, you feel like, Oh, no, no, I might be going back in. And it is the most insanely beautiful thing to take ketamine. And by that afternoon, by that afternoon, you're feeling, oh, you're feeling better. And the next day, you're feeling better. And then, and at that point, not only is it amazing, because suddenly you're, you're, you're not depressed in the way that you were before. But also, you know, holy shit, if I need it, I've got a safety parachute thing here, that I have a tool that I did not before. That's what's incredible. But then if you're me, you keep doing it. That's why I can't do it. The fact that you, you had a nasal spray around your house for a year, forget it. I can't do that. I can't keep, I can't have it around at all. Do you not do it at all now? I can't. I put, I got addicted. I punched my ticket. So now I, you know, you, I can't, I'm a dad. So it's like, what am I going to do? Fucking rails of Academy with my kids downstairs eating breakfast. I can't do that. So no, I just, I have like, if I get depressed again, I'll go to a clinic. You know what I mean? So you will do Ketamine, but you don't have it lying around? No, I can't have it at the house. And is that, is that something that you, you'll, you'll avail yourself of? Like, yeah, this is part of your tool. You'll go to, all right. If I needed to go to a clinic, I would totally do it. I just would, I'm not, I can't do it. Like, I, I, I blew it for myself. I mean, I'm not, not to say that it's some future point. Maybe there's like a fun recreational way to do it. But right now it's like, I just, I don't have the time to risk like getting habituated to Ketamine again. But that doesn't mean that it is incredibly therapeutic. And it's truly helped me. I was just dummy and let myself get hooked on it. Well, and that is, it seems like for a lot of people, Ketamine does have that risk and for whatever reason, it doesn't for me. And I don't think it's willpower or anything like that. I think I just don't love it that much, frankly. I just don't love it as much as, but so I had this experience, you know, got broke out of this OCD cycle. And just like you were saying, I felt, I was like, okay, great. Now I have this tool, man. This is like what I haven't, I, I've never in the past, I've tried sometimes doing psychedelics when I'm in an OCD crisis. And it ultimately has not seemed to affect the trajectory that much. But this seemed like it did. So got some freedom. And then I was falling into not quite the same, not quite an OCD crisis, but yeah, just feeling anxiety about deeper questions in terms of, well, things are opening up now. What am I, I'm single. I had a pretty, you know, deep relationship during the pandemic that ended. So there's, so there's good question there of like, okay, I'm the same age as you're Duncan. I ultimately want partnership and family. And I don't have that. And suddenly, just this rapid reopening, because it kind of came out of nowhere, you know, and I'm suddenly back in New York after being at my parents place for a while. And it's, so there's that question like, wait, I'm 47. I'm single. What am I doing with my life? And wait, what am I doing with my life? Do I want to, I don't know if I want to keep, you know, banging away at stand up and I have these other projects. So these more real world questions weighing on me, but it started getting the anxiety started feeling paralyzing. And so I was like, ah, so needless to say, after I finished off the spray bottle of ketamine, and I saw how helpful it was, I immediately laid my hands on some more ketamine to have as a, you know, break in case of emergency thing. So I pulled out the ketamine as this anxiety was getting really intense. And, and this time I did, I was actually intentionally trying, this was a powder. So it's a little bit difficult to measure. I was trying to fall short of full K-hole, but I, I failed. I went into it and I mean, what the fuck is that space? It is such a, it is, so to bring it back to you. Well, two things I'll say. First off, it didn't solve, in this case, ketamine wasn't a panacea. And I think it wasn't a panacea because these are real questions I have to grapple with out in the world in my sober existence, not that I can't rely and use other tools and alternate states of consciousness to provide perspective. But this is, this is, I mean, Freud said the two big things are love and work, relationship and career. And for you and me, that means creativity. And so these are, these are questions I've grappled with in different forms for my entire adult life. And I'm going to continue grappling with, there's no shortcut. So the ketamine wasn't like, Oh yeah, this is, yeah, your soulmate is on the corner of Second Avenue and 4th Street and finished that pilot script, and it's going to get picked up by Netflix. You're all good. Yeah. So I did, which was all in itself, a helpful thing was like, yeah, this tool is helpful when this can be helpful in certain contexts. But ultimately, there's work that we, part of being human, I believe, and part of, this may be another right turn, I'll make this a quick one. But I've certainly, the question of God is, is a big one for me. Yeah, it's a fucking big one for me. Because part of what's helped my OCD is a 12 step program. So essentially, you substitute obsessive and compulsions for alcohol. I'm powerless over my obsessions and compulsions, and you try to believe a higher power can help you. And it has been helpful, but there's also that grappling with the question of God is, I mean, in some ways, that is the question. And I agree. Yeah. And what was my, I lost my train of thought there. That's okay, because it led you to something wonderful, which is just, you know, to me, like the, the, the, Oh, this is, I'll say this. Go. All right. So I've, you know, so I have discussions with friends, some of whom have more faith with me, where it's kind of like, I'm trying to resolve logical issues with the idea of God. Because I, that seems like that has to be part of faith for me is resolving some of these things, or getting some peace with them. And one of the questions I've had is like, yeah, this is the most basic question, but why so much suffering if, if, if God is omniscient, benevolent and, and omnipotent, if God can do anything and and loves us, why, why AIDS babies, why terrorist attacks, et cetera, et cetera. And then more generally mapping it onto my life, why struggle, why OCD, why loneliness, why, why, you know, creative frustration. And one thing that occurred to me in one of these conversations was like, well, if there was no struggle, what, what would be the purpose of existing? If it wasn't, if there wasn't some, at some sense, it feels like, yeah, part of why we exist is because we are in, at times, confrontation with the universe. We are trying to assert ourselves and, and shape reality. Yes. And if it was all like, oh, you're, you're a lonely atom. Okay, here's your soulmate. Oh, your career is not quite where it wants. Here's the Netflix deal. I mean, what would be the point in that? What would it be? It would be boring. So, to Ketamine's point, I don't know exactly how I got onto that. Oh, yeah, I guess the love and work thing. So it's kind of like, yeah, man, this is, you know, guess what? You have the great privilege and challenge of existing as a seemingly independent or somewhat independent entity in this reality. And this is part of the game for you, is figuring this stuff out. You haven't figured this out yet. So, you know, Ketamine is not going to give you the answer. But where you came up was just the, yeah, there's, it's such, because I know you've had more experience than I have, and we've experienced Ketamine together once. Yeah. Like what, it was really where you came in, I was like, I want to ask Duncan what the fuck is going on here, man, because this is in this K-hole state, and I've probably gone into K-hole, you know, six or seven times over the years. And it's, I always come out of it with a sense of wonder, but also like with psychedelics, classical psychedelics, there's a sense of kind of like, oh, I know this. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like there's a deep familiarity. Yeah. And with Ketamine, there is almost the opposite of that. There's like, what was that? That was, I don't know how to map that in. So for me, it was, you know, the sense of presence that I'm somewhat communing with, but it feels kind of alien. And, and it doesn't, certainly with psychedelics, the senses of presences have generally been love, benevolence. And with Ketamine, it's not malevolence, but it's maybe more of a neutral thing. And I think it's more of like a, it's a, it's a vehicle of sorts. Like, and I think it's really great to make the distinction between the visionary potential of Ketamine and the potential that is currently being studied and used for like treating depression. Because it's too diff, to me, it's two different things. I was, after the initial, like using it to help with my depression, upon realizing like, oh my God, this is like the most visionary substance that I've ever encountered. And the visionary in the most alien way. But when I began to realize like, oh, you can actually navigate through this space, like you don't have to be, you know, anyone who has like, spent any amount of time with Ketamine, and especially people who love, love the kales, probably knows the thrilling realization of, oh wait, I don't always have to be in the infernal realms, which seem to exist in, with Ketamine. Like there's a absolutely terrifying, at least in my own experience, potential hell realm that you experience with Ketamine. But you can navigate through the, through those realms to different places. There's different places you can go to that for repeat. And I've chatted with other people about this, like a field of flowers, a mothership. Oh, like there's like weird, also that the, what's, what's really curious to me is the, the, what you're talking about, a sense of a presence, a sense of being communicated to, but in the most alien way. And then I'm almost, again, this is all my own experience with it, a viewfinder like experience where it's like, remember those old viewfinders where it goes, when it's done showing you something, it starts giving you another, another vision. And within that, there's a collaborative, like a carousel of images that are right. Like here's, here's this thing. And then that thing, and then that thing mixed in with that is the, the identity, whatever you thought your identity was, has now been fractalized. And, you know, within that fractalization, there is, well, that's why I brought up death in the beginning, because that our communication started with you talking about the kale is a, what, for lack of a better word, I would only think of as some form of death, some like apex of such bizarre intensity that you feel yourself being drawn into, you're like impossible, something impossible to resist, like you're being pulled into a twister, or like a black hole, or a singularity, or a vortex. It is so powerful. And, and if you resist it at all, terrifying, that's those are the hell realms. But the moment you let go, wow, wow. And the, and the, so yeah, that to me, that's like the, my, my analysis of it is it's some kind of bardo state. It's allowing you to disentangle with your, you're, you're able to free yourself from body, the normal way that we're attached to our bodies. And in that state, I think they're, there's, you're frozen now, Duncan. But you asked the perfect question if you, that's, it's like asking for an ear beating. Like, you know what I mean? It's like asking someone who just got back from Burning Man, I was Burning Man, the L who stood out district, watch out, I could go on for like, you would be like an old man, you would be gray haired and in a wheelchair by the time I finished describing what I think Ketamine is. Listen, we got to wrap it up, man. I am so happy that Ketamine told you to text me. And I'm, I'm so happy that I was able to have this conversation with you. Can you please tell people where they can find you? Did you make the decision about where you're headed next? Yeah. So I am in New York for the time being for probably July and August doing, I'm not, I don't have anything scheduled for the mushroom cures. That's like, that's a theater solo show, but I am doing standup in various clubs in New York. If you go to my Instagram and social media and website, you will see those posted. I will likely be in the Bay area doing the mushroom cure and a new show I'm working on in the coming months, possibly October. I'll probably also make it down to LA in those months for probably just a short engagement. And yeah, beyond that, I have that podcast I mentioned not therapy where my psychiatrist friend does quasi therapy on me. I've been working on another podcast that may or may not be launched, depending on when, when Duncan gets his act together and records a song for this thing and puts it out today. This will be up in an hour and a half. Oh, holy shit. Okay. All right, I'll update my website. If you don't mind, this is the deadline that I need to motivate me as we were discussing. Get it done.

May Poseidon's blessings be upon you. My brothers of the sea. Friends, I've just returned from the Ram Dass Open Your Heart and Paradise Retreat in Maui. I've just had the demons fire hosed off of me by some of the great teachers of our time. Jack Cornfield, Sharon Salzburg, Ram Dass, Mirabai Bush, Krishnadas and today's guest, David Nickturn. So I feel great. I go to those things just swarming with foulness, just covered in neuroses. The callus around my heart, it gets thick. Thick is the yellowed callus on your aunt's foot that you shall be massaging on this holiday season. I've been sitting here trying to summarize all the stuff that I learned at this retreat and I can't do it. Either it's too complicated and my explanation is too complicated or it's too sappy. I don't know. It's not a pithy way of explaining what this stuff is, but here's a fantastic quote that I think does in some way or another summarize what these retreats are all about. The quote comes via Jack Cornfield and it's from someone named Guam Guame Apollinaire. I can't pronounce it, but at least I could say the quote. Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy. That to me sums up what these retreats are all about and there's an argument that's been raging all around the planet for a long time and the argument goes something like this. This is a catastrophe. We're in a catastrophic situation here where by some kind of rotten series of coincidences our molecules have harmonized in such a way that we've temporarily become aware of ourselves and that our realization of what we are is limited by our biological lifespan. We are assembled by accident into a world of pain and in some painful way disassembled and pushed back into an infinite field of oblivion to which people like Jack Cornfield respond by reading poems like this one. Before you know what kindness really is, you must lose things. Feel the future dissolve in a moment like a salt in a weakened broth. What you held in your hand, what you counted and carefully saved, all this must go so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness. How you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop, the passengers eating maize and chicken will stare out the window forever. Before you learn the tender gravity of kindness, you must travel where the Indian in a white poncho lies dead by the side of the road. You must see how this could be you, how he too was someone who journeyed through the night with plans and the simple breath that kept him alive. Before you know kindness is the deepest thing inside. You must know sorrow is the other deepest thing. You must wake up with sorrow. You must speak to it till your voice catches the thread of all sorrows and you see the size of the cloth. Then it is only kindness that makes sense anymore, only kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day to mail letters and purchase bread, only kindness that raises its head from the crowd of the world to say it is I you've been looking for and then goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend. That's a poem by Naomi Shihab Nye that was given to us by Jack Cornfield and the whole retreat is made up of stories and poems like that and teachings and contemplations and you end up feeling like somebody has rescued you from a tub of hot diarrhea that you didn't even know you were taking a bath in. So I'm so happy that these things exist and I'm very happy to present to you today's guest David Nickturn who blew my mind. He's a student of Chogium Trumpa and for those of you who don't know Trumpa, check out Crazy Wisdom on Netflix or you can check out his book or he's got many books but cutting through spiritual materialism is a particularly good one. He's a fierce teacher and Nickturn is also a fierce teacher but a funny teacher and I'm thrilled to have gotten a chance to have this conversation with him. We're going to jump right into this podcast but first some quick business. Hey New York on Tuesday January the 17th, I am going to be at the Bell House in New York doing a live DTFH if you want tickets you can find the link at DuncanTrussell.com. Friends if you notice a sudden decrease in sound quality it's because I'm using a poop microphone because my old microphone just blew out. So we're going to make this super quick. The holidays are approaching everyone's happy now and that's one of the beautiful things about the holidays. Every single person everywhere around the planet their hearts are filled with joy, love, happiness, benevolence, compassion and they understand the most important truth which is that if you want to show love to other people you should give them material objects. It's the only way to truly express that deep part of the self that says I love you. It's why we shop. And for this Christmas season I have placed inside the DTFH store a very special thing. So special it's difficult to describe and so special if you happen to be listening to this on Friday December 9th it might not even be in the store yet because we have to stock it. But what it is is handmade LED DTFH logo lamps and we only have 10 of them in stock. It takes a long time for these sweet darlings to get constructed. They're all made by one person in a workshop much like the elves make beautiful gifts for Santa far underneath the ancient mushroom of life that dwells in the heart of the sun that floats in the center of the hollow earth. So check out the DTFH store if you're interested these things are crazy. They're glowing magically infused LED lights that I have enchanted and incantation over and which I've also signed the back of they're super cool we only have 10 of them. So if this sounds like something that appeals to you hurry over to the store won't you. Also if you're planning to do any kind of Christmas shopping at all might I advise you to not throw yourself into the terrible rat warren that is a mall or a chain store. Why do you want to experience what it's like to be a parasite in the intestinal track of a gnashing demon howling in the depths of time the gnashing demon of course is known as consumerism and materialism and though we all most of us can't avoid the necessity of existing in the marketplace we certainly can avoid the horrors of having to squirm through the Jacobs ladder style entrails of a public shopping area gazing into the glassy eyed horror of all those who have been sucked into the terrible hypnotic vortex that is the strange compulsion that has been injected into our brains that we should at this time of year when days are shortest and darkness is particularly greasy hand each other gift wrapped presents or even worse feel bad because we happen to have managed to be alone this Christmas oh yes you turn on that TV and the glittering lights of the view will convince you that you're in some kind of hell realm because this Christmas you happen to not be surrounded by people but let me tell you friends if you find yourself in a situation of isolation during this Christmas it only means that you are special and that you are blessed for the rest of you who are going

being all links to get to him will be at dunkintrestle.com now everybody welcome to the DTFH David Nick turn welcome to you David thank you so much it's my pleasure I think we'll find out you know I have um been coming to these retreats and what I've watched you play guitar um but I had no idea I completely missed out on the fact that you were a student of chogum trumpet trumpet and this is he's always been one of my favorite Buddhist teachers and also he's irritated me more than any other teacher there's such a quality to his teachings that are so frustrating and confusing can you talk a little bit about how you came into contact with him in the beginning and what it was like to be a student of one of the great Buddhist teachers sure you know excuse me um well it all started innocently enough so in 1970 I was going to the Berkeley College of Music hence the music side but I was also studying yoga hatha yoga at a studio near the near Berkeley on Marlboro street and the woman who owned the studio was one of the people who brought trunk remember to over to the United States so um she helped sign the papers and so forth so when he came to the United States that was one of the earliest stops was teaching a weekend seminar at her at her studio and it was called work sex and money that was the title of it cool kind of blew my mind a little bit and I would say at the time I was kind of more in my yoga hippy phase and um I was completely startled when he came he was in a western business suit right already why did he choose that form of dress well what happened was of course he was raised a lot of people don't really completely understand this is a high llama in Tibet right before the he was an incarnation yeah he was the 11th trunk patil coup right very long line of a kagu llamas so they they they did the ritual of finding him they took him as a child yeah brought him back to a monastery yep exactly that and if you want to read about that there's a book called born in Tibet which is a really great travel log if if not way more than that for people so when he was nine years old he was doing advanced tantric practices you know and when he was 12 years running the whole group of monasteries so called surman so probably at a fairly young age I'm going to say he must have been in his late teens or early 20s they had to escape from Tibet so he took it's this whole story is told in that book born in Tibet he took a group of about 300 people through the mountain passes being pursued by the Chinese soldiers so and they would go off into caves and do divinations about which ways to go to you know and they were at some point eating their own boots they're cooking pieces of leather from their own boots the sustenance so it's a very harrowing escape that he made and then they made it to India like a lot of the Tibetans did and once he was there he spent some time there and then he kind of to make a long story short when did his way to England and he studied at England and while he was teaching in England I think he noticed a lot of fascination about the Tibetan thing and he felt like he wasn't really going to be able to teach people that way so he really his changing garb was really him entering our environment and trying to connect with us and he also married a young British girl at the time so I think it was part it was part of his journey to do that. Is he considered an apostate was he considered sort of someone who was outcast from the religion that's that's how I that's how I understood the story no no that's a complete mistake that's not true so he was even at that time wearing the suits marrying somebody he was still considered to be in high standing absolutely well here's the thing is that's part of the Tibetan tradition the Tantric tradition some of them some of the Lamas are married Lamas okay cool yeah no there might have been one or two of his close associates who were concerned about it but really Trump is the one who you have to really remember brought all the high Tibetan Lamas to the United States because we had an organization at that time and we had a platform turned into land so he brought over Karmapa he brought over Kense Rinpoche Kalu Rinpoche we hosted those teachers so he was in very high regard by those teachers in fact that Karmapa gave him the title of Vidyara he gave him he really empowered his what he was doing tremendously can you talk about that first class yeah for whatever reason it's astoundingly vivid even though it's 45 years ago um but the funny thing about it was kind of like a workshop like we do now he would just go around maybe there are 18 or 20 people there if that um and he would give a talk about Dharma topic then there'd be discussion and then we would practice meditation together but at the time you know he would give each person individual meditation instruction so you went up into a room with him and he gave you instruction alone with him yeah what was that like didn't know I would you hear all the time about qualities of these great teachers especially incarnations did he did were you fascinated with him in the beginning did he emanate some mystical field work sex and money was the title of the workshop you know um actually here's what really happened the Friday night of the workshop he gave a talk and it was kind of dry um you put together oh this is his high llama and now he's talking about these sort of charged topics actually was very flat and very ordinary and I I got slightly bored actually and so when I was walking home that was where I had a mild mild epiphany I went Dave to myself what are you what are you tripping on what are you looking for because he was grounded he was down to earth so I flipped the switch and I went like this guy really kind of is connected to reality it wasn't like some spiritual realm it wasn't like that at all okay yeah so he wasn't meeting an expectation someone might like because we I'll tell you what I would want levitation of vivid aura yeah a sense of I've known him forever well let's let's modulate a few of those things okay I remember somebody asked him about levitation at a public talk and he said well sometimes when I eat this particular kind of blue cheese I get close but he had a great sense of humor and he had a very subtle communication sense so you could feel that somebody was you know operating between the lines and really really very spacious but very sharp so if I had to tell you his quality it was kind of very spacious but very clear very sharp and very friendly very open I always felt very like oh this is somebody you really want to sit and talk to for a while well you and you did and I did he became your teacher yes so how does that work so you use it starts with a yoga workshop you take this this class and then what happened so that weekend went by and that was I guess the fall of 1970 I think that's as close I can figure out to when it actually was and then I kind of wanted to explore it more so he was beginning to set up communities one was up in Vermont at this place called the tail of the tiger famous place that's where I met Ramdas okay that's what's funny about all this being here at the retreat in Maui so and he would just start teaching and again like it's similar to what we do now it would be on a topic of Buddhism like the wheel of life or something like that but you went up there I went up you moved no I didn't move at that point no I was living in Boston uh later on I was the director of tail of the tiger karma chili but that wasn't until 1978 so I was studying with him while I was moving around I would go back and forth between my regular world and go into take classes with him and also finding his little community of students and practicing together with those but during that time I lived in Boston then back in New York and then I moved to California okay so I had you know my my musician life was in full bloom at that point and I would be like not unusual week was you know I had a band with Jerry Garcia for a while in in northern California called the great American music band and I'll be doing that one weekend and the next weekend flying a boulder to take a seminar with Rinpoche that is so trippy it it it was trippy and ordinary because that was just my life at that point well and not that your life has gotten any more normal you travel around yeah Krishnadas do you attribute this kind of good fortune to reincarnation or to to anything like that how do you explain it I mean to to be in a band with Jerry Garcia while studying under Chogyam Trumpa it sounds to me it doesn't sound normal at all no no it sounds spectacular but it sounds so far away from maybe what most people's experience of normal life is well I like to live this way these will be the good old days right right so we are here in a spectacular you know just for your listeners we're here at the retreat that's headed by Ram Dass and Krishnadas who for the listeners if they don't know I'm his record producer and I play guitar with Krishnadas so that's really why I got here in the first place but then the connection with Ram Dass and this year I did a little teaching also in the Buddhist framework and we also have a couple of great Buddhist teachers here usually Jack Hornfield or Sharon Salzburg so we're in a pretty spectacular and we're looking out at the ocean here right ladies and gentlemen yeah it's pretty spectacular and we all just had an amazing morning together and it's a group of 350 or 400 very warm good-hearted and smart people yeah so to me this is pretty pretty this is kind of spectacular yes it is but this is just another bead on this incredible necklace that you've been putting beads on for decades and I look we don't have to get into whether or not you saved what you clearly did at some point probably saved a village from Avalanche in some past life or who knows who knows what you did we don't have to get into but I as I was sitting with you on the beach when we first started talking and you were talking about Trump or Rinpoche and then you were telling me that you had written this book which this is really exciting to me because it's something that I have been interested in for a long time haven't really understood it very well you have a book called Awakening from the Daydream Reimagining the Buddha's Wheel of Life and the Wheel of Life is really interesting to me because years ago in my early days when I took LSD I can remember hallucinating what I think if I could go back in time I would I think it was probably something like the Wheel of Life some fiery mandala some incredible back then I was just like this is nuts man crazy wheel and then uh you and any lots of people have seen this symbol and I don't think they they know exactly what it is yeah so um what I love about it is uh particularly with Chogun Trump is some of his writings are impossible for me to understand I it's very complicated and simple at the same time infuriatingly simple maybe that it becomes complex but what I love about the Wheel of Life is because it it is a visual representation of the teachings of buddhism and so I can at least in some way I it helps me understand it and now that I've been reading your book halfway through it's such a concise teaching about this that's what I'd like to spend the rest of the podcast talking about um so can you just sort of describe the Wheel of Life for folks listening and maybe tell them where on the internet they can go to pull it pull it up if they want to if they want to look at it while you talk about it well the Wheel of Life is a classic as you said buddhist mandala or arrangement or symbol I call it a powerpoint presentation from the past because it's uh thick with information it's dense but all unpackable so that's the key right so it actually dates back to the time of the buddha the original drawing supposedly given at the advice of the buddha from one king to another king like here's a great gift that you could give this other this other king so the the buddha described it to him yeah here's what it looks like yeah okay as far as we know okay now it's on the outer wall of a lot of monasteries because it's considered a teaching even though it has the dense sort of concentrated aspect of the buddhist teachings or really all in there like if we spend a month on it we could unpack the whole right thing but it's considered somewhat secular in the sense that it's was given from a king to a king as opposed to a monastic kind of tradition okay so it's for people like you and me to decipher our lives right you know here's the thing Duncan I see you working at the puzzle down in the lobby there yes that's what this is it's like this is the puzzle that put up put together and it'd be great to tear this apart turn into little pieces and have you put it back together pretty cool and that would be exactly what we're doing in a way just so you guys know there's a very addictive puzzle in the lobby of this retreat and somehow many of us have been sucked into this awful vortex of the thing but the so the the I'm really interested I guess what why don't we just start yeah the center of the thing okay so at the center of the uh this mandala you have a pig a snake and a rooster right and these are considered the fundamental delusions well let me just I'll get to that in one second but just to frame it um if you do want to look along as we're talking you could um there's as I said the classical diagram but what I did is I had a modern painting made by an Australian artist and um with wisdom publications in the book and so we tried to update the imagery right so it has the same meaning but it's very much more accessible to a modern yes person so cool it's beautiful and it's yeah it's kind of sort of like Japanese anime kind of vibe to it yeah but it's so the book is called awakening from the daydream uh by David Nickton you could go to amazon.com and you could see the picture and then you could also blow it up you could zoom into it which is what it's meant to be done excuse me so um there Duncan's implying what what there are is concentric rings of information um and it's interesting to start with the outermost ring and the innermost ring and then work your way to the most prominent ring which is the called the six realms so let me start with the outermost phenomenon which is there's a skeleton which actually looks like a grateful dead kind of thing in this drawing this is okay I was looking at this skeleton this is like a vampire skeleton this isn't just a skeleton you gave the skeleton fangs yeah this is a nasferatu skeleton well the idea of this skeleton is and and you know uh the Dalai Lama has said this and many people have said this this represents impermanence it's it's really it's not so much a vicious kind of you know energy as much as just a fact of life all of these experiences just like this podcast is going to be subsumed by impermanence right you and I are sitting here it's really vivid it feels really strong we're having whatever energies reactions we're having it's going to be over right that's the biggest one of the big buddhist facts of life that you that you uh kind of address but the depiction of this impermanence in in this updated version and in the old versions it's not they don't never make it benevolent it's not benevolent no because it's ruthless right in the same way that death is ruthless right it comes to everybody um there's uh you know the buddhist don't court death we don't we don't go like how can i jump off of the balcony here yeah but we know it's coming and we contemplate that uh to to you could say to sharpen our insight about um the whole situation that we find ourselves in right not be deluded about it you're living in a you're living in a memory you if you even remember anything you forget almost everything it's well that's the daydream idea is that there is a kind of awakened quality to the present moment that everybody's here is talking about yes but we tend to drift off from that right it's it's not considered a a kind of a crime or a sin in buddhism it's just kind of a habit sure it's just a habitual mind just takes you into one of these six realms so we'll get to that in a minute though okay so the center of the wheel as you pointed out are the three um animals the pig the snake and the rooster and again these are metaphors the pig represents ignoring kind of dullness yes the snake represents aggression you know fighting back pushing back and the rooster is passion yeah right for obvious reasons i hope humping exactly what is the rooster trying to do it's so funny though because i whenever i think about humping rooster is not what comes to my well but what about hands if you if you it's a horny bird i get it that's a horny bird back then that was like you would think like what's the hornyest animal i guess you'd say the rooster well it just represents the aspect of passion that's acquisitive you want to you want to pull things into your territory is it always a rooster traditionally it's a rooster so we left that alone okay those are the same three traditional animals that it's like that we didn't change that and and so the rooster is desire the rooster's desire the snake is a version right and the pig is ignorance exactly and i changed some of the words around a little bit because there's nothing actually wrong with desire that's not the problem the problem is grasping right that where you desire something you objectify it and then you try to possess it that's when we get in trouble and and and what's interesting about it and is it this entire wheel of suffering yeah spins on that central spoke which is the interaction of those three modalities very very beautifully stated something yeah so uh and and there's an essential point there which is that those i call them the rgb of of the whole wheel of some sorry in other words there the three like on a tv screen you have red green and blue that's all you have but then you create the entire world or mandala of experience from those three basic instincts that's it and it's not like you're in any given moment just one of those is functioning it or are they all three kind of interacting in different ways exactly the same so in any given moment of these three something is probably more prominent than the other but they're all for a moment yes they're they're all interacting in some way well that's why those animals are holding each other's tails right if you look at the subtlety of it they're creating kind of spin cycle by by relating to each other and then that creates the entire activity you're exactly right of the rest of the wheel so again looking at this i don't choose to look at any of this material as arcane i'm not a historian i'm not a scholar i i want access to information that's relevant to what you know ordinary day-to-day living situation yes so in this case you just go you i tell people walk into a yoga class and you'll see um you i want to put my mat right down next to this person right oh i thought you were talking about a version walk into a yoga class you're like what the fuck am i doing this for well you could you could well that okay good enough yeah or you could say you know this person next to you is kind of sweaty and blowing their nose a lot of their tissues right between your mats get them over to the other corner of the room we immediately are starting to orchestrate our experience around our own uh kind of sense of personal comfort right yeah right and you don't even notice most of the people in the room you're either pushing yourself through a self-imposed force field or you're getting sucked into some or you're rushing towards the thing that you want i understand it does i understand a version and i understand desire but how does the how does ignorance work what is that's why change transformation used to call it ignoring he made the moment of verbs because it's an active process we think of ignorance as a kind of dullness or pastiness of mind yeah but really there's a kind of um you could say at the level of the the awakened mind there's a choice being made to black out certain phenomenon yeah like i'll pretend you're not clearly a white supremacist right now because you're my uncle and we're having lunch well that's really specific yeah uh yes my that would be as as you said that would be a mixture of aggression and and ignorance right okay right right which what do we call it passive aggression right so um yeah as you start to mix those colors together they start to look like different things you know if you're um you know if you're into s and m that's a mixture of passion and aggression right yeah sure so the ignorance is the most pervasive though because we're really not noticing most of what's happening and that's considered that's the most wow that's interesting i wouldn't think that you think it's the least harmful but it's actually the most pervasive huh so that's why we say waking up or awakening or use words like Buddha or Bodhi coming out of that field of ignorance is is really the job wow that's really cool um okay i never thought that i would always i would think aversion was the big problem aversion creates the worst karma because you're kind of like um actively destroying something that is is you're creating harm um that creates a lot of momentum as you know like abuse you know if you beat the crap out of somebody there's going to be consequences that's considered aversion yeah that's aggression so that in dharma talk you know in in buddhist dharma talk that's the one you mute first you dial that down a little bit really interesting to think aversion equals aggression that's confusing to me i i think of aversion is like well i don't really want to go to this party or i don't want to go to this do this job or i don't want to sit down and write or i don't want to exercise i don't feel like eating that food or i don't that to me how is that aggression well it's interesting your aggression is sort of mixed with ignoring it's just what we just were talking about i'm not going to go there i won't do it but what if you are living with somebody and and this is a typical guy thing i think you'd admit i need space you say i need space that's called ignorance how so well in other words you don't you're not comfortable in the field when it gets hot or you know there's some edge or aggression and and you try to subdue it by creating a false sense of space or spaceless right that's cool i think calling it passive passive aggression is good enough for the eating needing space is an illusion like if you're oh yeah there's nothing but space why would you need it that is so tricky so wait if i'm laying in bed and the cat and the poodle and the chihuahua and my girlfriend in that order huh okay but it's okay you know there's a realm for that we'll see that's the animal realm but if i'm or so but if i'm so if i'm in that situation and i start reacting to it yeah in a way where i'm like god i got it i just need a little bit of space here sure that youth you're saying that that's just an illusion i should be able to grab the space no matter how many animals are laying well it is a kind of space right it's it's just not the kind that you want right so that's aggression a version you don't want a simple definition of aggression could be not wanting to be where you are wow and acting either you know then you either mix it with the sort of passive or the active version of it so for example in the lowest realms we're not there yet but when you go into the six realms start to spin let me just get us there so these three basic sort of feelings and we don't have time to get into it in depth but but but people who read the book will get into it in depth and people study it will get into it in depth the these kind of three torques or or kind of momentums that are created begin it's not enough to just feel like i don't want to be here you create a narrative that's where the whole birth of the blues is okay the samsara or the cycle of suffering would not it wouldn't be enough information just i don't like this you'd be like a caveman you know i love her i don't you know you'd be kind of just the stupidest version of those things but we need to create a whole narrative around it like the reason that i'm upset now is because not just because my poodle and my chihuahua and my girlfriend are making me feel claustrophobic but my whole life i've had this tendency to feel this way because of my family life and now you're in the therapist chair and you're spinning the narrative of the hell realm wow right which is now there's a whole realm a whole disney world that you've built out of this simple kind of quality of a version right so there's a lot of support it's like you start making the movie of that right and it's just not true it's situations created how did this come to how did we come to be sitting here and then also what we're doing the present how that's going to ripple into the future right so it's the past congealing as the present and then the present rippling and creating the future that's that's the process of karma it can be a more or less confusing or more or less enlightened type of patterning that's the whole point of this okay so like for example if you practice the loving kindness practice you're forecasting a better future for yourself right right you're creating a better narrative yes right so that's called the relative truth it's not that you buddhist would never say you don't exist and say your existence as an individual is a relative phenomenon okay okay it's based on relative causes and conditions right it has no absolute basis whatsoever though and that's an interesting point okay there is no Duncan template anywhere no this is just a bunch of an infinite number of modes of phenomena that happen to be swirling together and just the right way to temporarily create yeah a yapping dude with a beard yapping dude with a beard but we don't belittle that this is a very important point in buddhism that's misunderstood I think we don't belittle that or say like oh that's just your

Today's guest is returning and usually I put a little bit more space in between guests but I was so blown away by the last conversation I had with Mitch that and he wasn't gonna be in town so we just had to do another podcast and that's what this is. Dear friends, Mitch Horowitz is a brilliant author who has written many, many books.

All the links you need to find Mitch are gonna be located at dunkintrustle.com. Now everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, Mitch Horowitz. ... Mitch, welcome back. Thank you, man. It is really cool that I'm getting to know you. You're awesome. You're like Alan Watts meets Alistair Crowley or something. I like it. And it's pretty cool, man. And it's a really fantastic mix. But my, the last podcast we did was about manifestation. Yeah. And we were texting and something that I think we came up with, it would be fun to talk about, is how does manifestation fit in to the various eastern paths that seem to contain within them a deep, the deep importance of being unattached, the deep importance of not associating with the world, the deep importance of not being caught in the updraft that is materialism, which in Buddhism, it seems to, the idea is like you can just be sucked into matter like you're in quicksand and go deeper and deeper and deeper and the deeper you get into the quicksand pit of materialism, sure, you'll have power and wealth and everything that you might want. But you'll never realize that you've fallen in love with the anaconda that is strangling your happiness. And so within that, what it almost seems like it could be a really valid interpretation of Buddhism to say there is something wrong with desire and fulfilling desires and that the practice of fulfilling desires and not just Buddhism, I mean, this is like almost all world religions, absolutely. So is there a way to reconcile these things? Is there a way to reconcile this idea of non-association, non-attachment with the delight that comes from success and from achieving things in the world? Maybe I just am misinterpreting Buddhism. What do you think? This is a very heavy issue for contemporary seekers, especially in the West, although all around the world. But I think seekers in the West very often get torn in two by this question because on one hand, whatever path you're walking, let's say it's a path of Buddhism, let's say it's a Vedic path, or let's say it's a Judeo-Christian path, whatever it is, eventually you come face-to-face with this ethic that you're describing of non-attachment, non-identification, not getting caught up in the world of Caesar, not trading your birthright for a bowl of potage as our friend Esau, so we're told, and scripture does, and then of course you have this ethic runs very deeply through variants of Buddhism, don't get lost in Samsara, and it can feel agonizing at times to the Western seeker, and then of course people caricature the opposing extreme, usually based in some critique of the secret, say, well, how can the end point of all spiritual awareness be the manifestation or the selection of a Mercedes Benz? And so the Western seeker sort of feels tugged between these two seeming poles. The truth is, in my search, and I have wrestled with this intensely, I've felt torn apart by it, I have to say very plainly, in my experience as a seeker, I reject the path of non-attachment or non-identification. I don't think that path, as it's sometimes extrapolated from variants of Buddhism, usually Westernized variants of Buddhism, I don't think that suits the needs of the contemporary seeker, and I don't think it responds to the impulse of the individual to aspire to create, to attain. And I've been torn in two by this, and I had to make a decision because I wanted to come up with a beautiful, poetic, holy compromise, and I couldn't find that holy compromise. I really have to be frank with you, I couldn't find it. Yeah, that, you know, I, to me, I get really bummed out whenever there's a sense of, no, this has already been figured out, there's nothing else you're going to figure out, the great enlightened one spoke these words, and this is the way it is, if you're going to change this shit, you're fucking everything up, you're just trying to make the great, which, and this is one of the big paradoxes that you run into, not just in any kind of tradition that has within it the invitation to focus on the impermanence or changing the nature of things, but then also has within it a kind of dogmatic attachment to some scripture or way of being. So I was just listening to this, you know, beautiful book, I love it, this audio book of, you know, lectures that Ajahn Chah gave this great Theravadan teacher, and he really did say something about, you know, the one thing that isn't, doesn't change is the dharma, is these teachings, this is what the Buddha said, this is how we do it, that doesn't change. And I found that to be so confusing in the sense that, wait, I thought the idea is that everything changes, everything is in a constant state of transformation, and yet here you're saying some scriptural advice or prescription for how to live as a monk or how to be as a layperson is unchanging in the sense that it feels like there can't be any. So how is this, how do these two things meet? How is it, how do these meet? To me it seems like, not just not a paradox, it seems like a mistake, a fault, a sign of fault, and I love Buddhism because it's so rational and logical, and it invites you to try to find the fault in it, and to me there is a deep fault in any prescription for pay attention to it's impermanence, and yet pay attention to it's impermanence the way that the scriptures are saying to do it, and you know what I'm saying, it really confuses the shit out of me. This is where I've come to, and I say this very delicately because I'm only commenting as a 21st century seeker on eons of tradition that emerges from the eastern and near eastern faiths, the Vedic faiths, the Buddhist faiths, the religions that were born out of the Mediterranean basin, Christianity, Islam, Judaism. I think that Buddhism specifically, and I focus on that faith because that is a major point of search for many thoughtful Westerners today. I think there's a very important critique to be made of Buddhism which could be made of every religion, and it's this, I can fall to my knees in front of the Dhammapada, the Vedas, various commentary and interpretations of them, but it's very important to recall that every religion has been shaped by human hands. They may have been inspired people at the inception, but every religion is shaped by human hands and responds to the social and cultural needs of its geography, of its background, of its nascent culture. When you look at the Vedic and Buddhist worlds as they existed at the time of the inception of these faiths and their canonized ideas and parables and documents and sayings, the individual that was born into the Vedic world had as much chance of exiting or expanding beyond his or her caste as designated at birth as they did of setting foot on another planet. It was a completely cemented, stratified, solidified society, and that was, I think, one of the social crises that Vedic and Buddhist thought was responding to. You couldn't change identities, you couldn't shed your skin, you couldn't exit one caste in favor of another, and if you were to do so, it was literally the stuff of fairy tales. You know, it would be the most extraordinary human exception, and to a degree, I think teachings of non-attachment and non-identification, while they definitely possess universal gravity and I bow to it, I bow to it. They were also responding to the circumstances of men and women at a certain time and place, and the ethic of Buddhism itself would tell us we 21st century men and women have to take a look at that. If we don't, we are just deferring to catechism at a certain point. Wow! Cool! Yeah. Holy shit. That is, you were like, oh God, I said it for a second, I was, I do think that's an interesting thing is that I have associated the potential for blasphemy with Buddhism, and I'm worried because I don't want to be offensive, and I don't want to, and yet within at least the scriptures that I've read, there is an invitation to, you need to ask these questions. If this is not right, it's not helping anybody. If there's something in this, it's fucked up. We've got to look at that and realize, why is it fucked up? So if this is what Buddhism is reacting to, then is the caste system being cemented into a social identity that you're never going to get out of, then I think to myself, okay, so what is the caste system that we are experiencing today that Buddhism could respond to? How are we cemented into an identity in the West? It does seem like addiction to technology, and addiction to a kind of thinking, it seems like here in the West, there is a sad trick that gets played on people, which is number one, you might be a billionaire one day. That's really not going to happen to you. That's a caste system. In other words, you probably, as I'm saying this, I'm thinking, fuck that, man. Maybe I'll be a billionaire one day. But then also, if you really think about it, it's like, well, it's not going to work for everybody because there's limited resources, so we're only going to get a few billionaires, and it's going to be an infinitesimally small percentage of the population of the planet. This is a global caste system that you could look at as wealth. Because of the way we've been indoctrinated here into thinking that achieving these high states of whatever it may be, the realm of the gods, the wealth, the mansion, or whatever, because the indoctrination is once you get there, you're going to feel better, man. You're going to feel better. You move over there into that place. All that shit that's torturing you right now, the answer was obviously a mansion. It was just the prescription, or fame, or wealth, or sex, or a car, or the thing. Here what happens is we get it, and then sometimes we realize, oh fuck, that thing has created more complexity. I sympathize with that, and yet I have to acknowledge my path is one of aspiration. It is one of self-expression, of creativity, and hand-in-glove with aspiration comes some form of accumulation, and I feel in my heart looking back over many, many years on the path, working with other people, observing other people's experience, observing my own experience, I honestly don't believe that the Western seeker will ever be happy unless his or her search has within it some aspect of creativity, of self-expression, of attainment. I think it's inhuman nature, as above so below, or as it's put in Judeo-Christian scripture, God created man in his own image. We are creators within this sphere, and shame on me if I point a finger at my neighbor and say, he's got it wrong, because he wants to put his name on something, and that's Samsara. I don't know that. That may be a profoundly important act of self-realization for that individual, maybe a profoundly important act of self-realization for me, and I think that we create an orthodoxy almost in reaction to wanting to push these things away in ourselves, and people could say to me, oh great, so what are you saying? The whole point of spiritual practice is just to accumulate, not necessarily. I think the point of spiritual practice is to realize in oneself a sense of functioning with ease, with creativity, with expressiveness, with peak potential, or at least moments of peak potential, and not feeling like we have to disavow seeking a constituency or an audience. I remember I was in a very intensive esoteric group for many, many years, and we would have group meetings, and it was a deeply serious, deeply committed group of people, and there was this one woman telling a story one night about how she had created an ice sculpture outside her house, and she had some friends coming to visit in the afternoon, and the sun was kind of a warm winter day, sunny winter day, and the sun was melting her ice sculpture, and she said she was feeling anxious because she wanted her friends to arrive so they could see this beautiful ice sculpture that she created before the sun melted it, and she was saying this in these confessional tones, and it was being heard that way by this group of very good people listening around her in a circle, but I felt this inner revolt against her story, and I wanted to say to her, and I didn't find the words until years later, you have nothing to confess in this story, you have nothing to apologize for. You created something beautiful. Every artist wants a constituency for his or her work. The fact that you want eyes on the beautiful thing that you did that I can't do to me is entirely natural, and as much as a farmer wants his crop to have a good yield, and as much as a poet wants to hit that just right meter on whatever he or she is doing, and I think we can run from anything. We can run from anything, but to run from that impulse in ourselves, I believe creates terrible tension. I've never felt more relaxed having come to the realization and being able to enunciate the realization, maybe going back about two years, that mine is a path of aspiration. Was there a thing that triggered that realization for you? There was. I was divided between two teachers, and when you have two teachers, it's like having two spouses. You can never really make it work, and apologies to all the polygamists out there among your listenership, but my impression is that you can't make it work. I was into the thought of two different modern teachers. One we talked about last time, Neville Goddard, beautiful mystic from Barbados. He lived and worked in America, died in 72. Neville taught your imagination is God, and your desires are sacred and holy. Your desires are, in essence, the voice of God speaking to you. Another teacher, also a contemporary figure, was a man named Vernon Howard, who lived and worked until 1992, and Vernon, like Neville, came out of the mind metaphysics tradition, and Vernon said, as soon as you get attached to the goodies of the world, you've lost. You've checked out. You've bought into all these consumerist values, and you're just reenacting the story of Jacob and Esau being Esau. You're selling out your birthright for a bowl of potage, and true freedom lies in the direction of non-attachment, and you should never allow yourself to get hypnotized by all the pretty baubles of the world. Neville's path was just be, just be. There's truth all around you. It can enter you. There's a kind of divine influx. Neville's path was realize your power, realize your power. And I felt torn in two by these two teachers, both of whom I loved, both of whom I believe offered great truth, and I found that I was volleying between them, and it was tearing me apart. And I eventually had to acknowledge to myself the path in which I felt most comfortable, the path that had a heart for me was Neville's path, the path of attainment. Yeah. Well, it is a, I'll tell you, and I think that's an important thing to listen to. I have been around some teachers and listened to what they were saying, and just felt this dark, dreadful sense of claustrophobia creep into me as you realize, like, oh, in the way they're teaching in their system, there isn't room for individuality. There isn't room for self-expression, and there isn't room for the potential of the, what is it? Terrence McKenna calls it the soliton of improbability. Right, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The chaos molecule that explodes through time and transforms everything, they haven't left room for the fact that that happens on this planet, it's like one of the great things on this planet that happens is that suddenly there's computers, it's like that's a miracle beyond miracles, and that changes everything, but many of these teachers, they didn't seem to recognize the fact that, well, because they didn't know. The Buddha, God, it's so weird how I feel superstitious about saying anything even mildly critical of Buddhism, but the truth is this, the Buddha didn't know that a meteor wiped out the fucking dinosaurs, man. The Buddha didn't know that there was going to be a time when we could instantaneously communicate to people all around the planet in a second, like that Trump UFC video you uploaded. Yeah, right, right. You uploaded a video that you filmed at the UFC of the president getting booed, and it instantly went around the planet. Literally around the planet, yeah. These sorts of things that no one could have predicted that, no one could have predicted that, which to me means that there is a potential regardless of whatever the tradition is that you have prescribed yourself to. There is the possibility that suddenly something inside of you could grow into that tradition and change it forever, and that's exciting, but you're not supposed to say that. You're not supposed to say it, and people feel it's the result of misunderstanding or it's a skewed Western perspective, but may I say one thing very quickly, just to add to what you're, what I think you're going to say. I went to a heart, I had a conversation with a heart Krishna when I was really getting into chanting Hare Krishna, and he said to me, we, because I told him, I don't agree with this that Prabhupāda says here, and he said, we don't say that we don't agree with his divine grace. We say we don't understand his divine grace. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, exactly. And at the same time, you're told to verify things for yourself, and yet the trick that religions always use is, come back when you verify the same thing that I've found, and if you don't, go back out there and wander in the desert with the Hebrews, because you're fucked. Amen, that's it. As soon as your verification matches what is in these scriptures, then you are one of us, but until then, you're wrong, oh yeah. Let me tell you a contemporary story about a spiritual teacher, and I want to hear what you think about this, and be blunt, because I wrestled with this for a long time. When I was stuck in this wrestling match, I went to a friend of mine who was a direct student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who brought transcendental meditation here to the West. And this friend, who had worked for many years with the Maharishi, was just an incredibly effective person. I mean, he was nuclear powered. He would say, you know, I'm going to arrange a benefit concert for the Maharishi, and Ringo Starr is going to be there, and Paul McCartney is going to be there, and Jerry Seinfeld is going to be there, and I'd be like, yeah, right. And 11 weeks later, he's sending me a fucking ticket to the concert. He was just that kind of guy who was so capable and so just effective in the world. And I said to him one time in private, listen, man, you got to level with me. You are the most effective person I've ever met. What did the Maharishi teach you? You know, spill it, spill it. Let's hear it. I want the house recipe because I'm looking at you and you're just dynamic beyond most anyone I've ever met. And he said to me, well, he taught me this and you can find this in the Bhagavad Gita too. He taught me that you should work, work, work, do your very best on whatever you're applying yourself to, and then wash your hands of it. Just forget it. Don't get attached to the fruits. Work, work, work, be meticulous, be great, but don't get attached to the fruits. And I said to him, I dig what you're saying. I dig what you're saying. But if you organize a benefit concert, for example, you want that room to be full. You don't want fucking Paul McCartney to walk out on stage and be looking at empty rows. That would be mortifying. And he's like, that's true. And I was like, so how do I square this circle? And we talked a little bit more about it. And for me, Duncan, I got to be frank with you, I could never square that circle. I went back to the Gita, I read the original, I understand the ethic of the teaching. And as a seeker in the 21st century, that teaching places me before a torturous contradiction, like the lady with the ice sculpture. Why shouldn't she want a constituency for ice sculpture? So I wanted to kind of pass that to you and see what you think. I love it. I love it. Okay. Well, I think probably what he's referring to in the Bhagavad Gita is you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. Right on. Right on. So but then to me, what's fascinating about the Bhagavad Gita is what you have there is weirdly a mirror of Buddhism, except where Siddhartha Gautama decides to go from the palace out into the forest, Krishna tells Arjuna, no, what are you doing? That's not the right way, because Arjuna's drops his bow, he's like, I'm not going to fight. It's better to be a renunciate than, you know, spill the blood of our teachers. And you would expect, looking at Hinduism, you would expect that Krishna would be like, yes, go into the woods, give it all up, forget the whole thing. Right. You speak words, you speak like you speak wisdom, but you do not understand. And this is the beginning. And also the best verse the line is, smiling in the midst of these two armies, holy shit. That's a really, that is like death metal, smiling in the midst of these two armies that are about, there's about to be literally be intestines everywhere, smiling in the midst the divine personality of God had said. So that's an amazing thing. And then the invitation is to fucking fight because you're a warrior, you're a Kishaitra, which fits into your caste system thing. This is who you are. Right. You have to fight. Right. This is what you do. Right. And the reason you're fighting is because they're already dead. I've already eaten them up. Yeah. So somewhere within that, I think the way to square that circle is there's an admonishment, not because he wanted to be a renunciate, but because he was being a coward and pretending he wasn't. He was imagining that he was like in some way or another, being heroic and brave. It was spiritual bypass in the most extreme way. He didn't want to kill, but that's who he was. And it's the worst thing you could do. And yet God is saying, no, this is, this is your thing. But then also saying on one level, it's you killing on another level. You're just one of my teeth chomping away at time. And for you to resist this is to resist the reality of that you really don't have much to do with anything at all. Now that doesn't mean that you don't get to be who you are. It's just don't fool yourself into thinking the way you are is necessarily coming from you, so to speak. It's an ex, you know, a flowering of a greater truth in the form of you. So that's why the Bhagavad Gita is, you know, it fascinating to me and that it isn't like go and live in the, go and live in with the renunciates. It's like, no, you're a warrior. So fight. Right. I don't know if Krishna would have said to Siddhartha, you're a prince right now. Siddhartha didn't know what he was necessarily. You know, that, you know, I don't know, but so to me, it's like, you have a right to your action. You do not have the right to your fruits of your action. If you want to be a coward, you could take that verse and give yourself an infinite excuse to fail without shame, to fail without that sense of like, you know what I mean? It's like, if I get off stage and I just ate shit, I don't, and yeah, I worked really hard on a bunch of jokes, but because I worked hard on the jokes, if I'm driving home with a big, weird smile on my face and I'm like, well, I, you know, I worked hard on the jokes. Left between the armies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. But that's bad. Cause what I need when I'm driving home for me is the sense of like, what the fuck is wrong with me. These people got babysitters and I went on stage with some shit that I thought was funny and it didn't work. Yeah. What the fuck? I've got to work harder. I've got to focus more and then that's going to inspire better art. So, but, you know, anyway, that's all I'm saying is within these prescriptions is a beautiful way to work. It's like, you know what I mean? When you're like purely allowing yourself to just write and to act, it's really amazing. Yeah. Without thinking to yourself, man, I hope that this video is good. I hope that this fucking book sells in five years because then all that's going to get mixed in with the art. Right. If you just are doing the action of the thing itself, you really do become a pure conduit for the creative energy of the universe. So that's, you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. But then if within there, you're like finding a way to like, I don't know, excuse your incompetence or something as a kind of spiritual. And there my man is the Achilles heel of the new age. It's filled with people and I apply that term to myself. I don't use new age in a negative way to me. It's just therapeutic spirituality. That's not an epithet. But the new age is filled with people who excuse a lack of accountability by offering some variant of, I'm laid back, I'm unattached, then I reject that. I reject that. You have, you feel as a performer, you owe it to the guy in the third row who's paid for a babysitter to come out there and do your job. And I say bravo to that. I say bravo to that. Our spiritual cultures, our alternative spiritual cultures are chock full of people who turn the vice of unaccountability into a virtue of nonattachment because they can't water a houseplant. That's it, man. That is it. And that is, to me, that is where, that is, you know, there's something really demonic about that to me because it's like, if you're failing, that's good in the sense that it means you put yourself out on a limb. You try to think it didn't work. You went to the edge and you push past the edge and you fail, but fuck, you failed. Like congratulations, you get to experience failure when some people don't realize that all their entire life is just failure because they're not trying anything. They're literally built a nest inside a failure tree and they're pretending, you know what I mean? Right, right, right, right. Like, so if you're like experiencing failure from risk, holy shit, congrats. You have gone off the map now, but then don't like, when you're, when you're experiencing that failure, don't then like keep failing, get better, don't any, any, any trick, anyway, the essence of the thing is I'm, I'm allowed to say this because I'm, it's a critique of myself in the past. I figured out a way to, to imagine that my laziness and cowardice was a revolutionary attitude because what is easier than to like be sitting in your own metaphysical muck right, looking at the wreckage of your life, looking at your abject mediocrity, your obvious mediocrity and within that to imagine yourself, well, you know, man, none of this stuff lasts anyway. Right. And I just turned my back on the world. Right, right, right. You haven't turned your back on the world. You're deeply invested in the fucking world. You're deeply attached to this nonsense, this cynicism, this crap attitude that you're, you've, you've literally figured out a way to lay in diarrhea and pretend you're in a hot tub. That is fucked. Right. And that is not a way to be. So that is, but that can't happen. Oh yeah. Here's a story from 10 days ago. I wrote an article for a spiritual magazine. We made a financial arrangement. They broke the financial arrangement. And the person with whom I was in touch literally said to me, literally said to me, please have compassion for our accounting department. That may be the first time in human history those words have ever been uttered. Oh my God. And I thought, how dare you hide behind an ethic of compassion, a very valid, sturdy ethic to excuse a lack of accountability, to excuse breaking an agreement to somebody who did a service for you. And I thought, I can't, I can't cooperate with that. I withhold my cooperation from that. I did break with the magazine actually because I thought it's taking a spiritual ethic and it's turning it into a club to, you know, kind of beat somebody with the same way some people do that with scripture. And that is, it's taking a violation and turning it into a virtue by way of a trick of language. And it's bullshit. It's bullshit. And we've got to get away from that within our spiritual culture. We have, I mean, people might be listening and saying, all right, so you're into aspiration, but where's the ethic in that? I try to do everything I do with what I consider to be an ethic of nonviolence, not by which I don't mean abstaining from legitimate self-defense, but I mean not doing anything that would impede another person's development of his or her own highest potential. So if I break an agreement, or if I disclose something that I agreed was private, or if I just do something that violates a responsibility I have to another person, I have failed. I have egregiously failed. So there is an ethic in this that I think is very important. Yeah. It's a beautiful ethic. And I think probably this ethic is a, what would you call it? It's called looking truth in the eye. Yes. It's truthfulness. It's truthfulness. And reciprocity. Like I do believe, I do believe all of life is connected. I do believe that things converge. I do believe these parallel tracks that we all seem to run on converge. And so I do take it very seriously. Call it what you will call it karma, call it the golden rule, call it cosmic reciprocity. My ethic, whether I excel at it, whether I fail at it, the ideal that I'm aiming for is one of reciprocity. I do believe that's very real because we are connected. Reciprocity, I think as I understand your, from what I've just, some of your writings, it's a really, I think your idea of reciprocity definitely does not align with the new age movements, general concept of reciprocity. So when it cut, we're going to jump to a commercial. We're going to come back and talk about Horowitz, Reciprocity, because I've read some of your answers and I love it. Let's do it. Okay, cool. Oh, let us fuck tonight, she said to the sailor man, I want to suck your drive before you go to sea, the sailor man, he cried saying, Oh my darling, I am so nervous that I don't feel a thing. All aboard, all aboard the Titanic. I think you know the rest of that sad story. Instead of focusing on his nightly lookout, that sailor had his mind on his love back home. And because of that, the Titanic ran into an iceberg and sank. If only he had had blue chew, blue chew, it works. I tried it. I wouldn't pitch something like this if it didn't work and I'm an expert on boner pills. It's made of the same ingredients as Viagra and Cialis. So you know, they work.

Blue chew is the better, cheaper, faster choice and we thank them for sponsoring the podcast. What came to mind to me is that, and I don't have it memorized, but it's the verse from the Satanic Bible which goes something on the lines of like, turn the other cheek. How do you know the one I'm talking about? Oh, yes, I do. How does it go? Anton was not a fan. He said Anton Leve basically wrote, rather than turn the other cheek, you should smash your enemy on the other cheek if someone comes near you with the intent of doing harm. Yeah. Because he says something on the lines of like, it's very poetic, the verse, but it's like something like, what good does it do me to get ripped apart by an animal and also, but within it is weirdly a thing of like, if someone crosses me and I reciprocate, he doesn't say reciprocate, but if I injure them because of whatever bullshit they did and they survive, then they gain wisdom. Then I've given them wisdom in this world and in a weird way have helped the world because they learned like, oh yeah, you shouldn't do that to people. Now, to me, I don't, I mean, it's people get scared when they are the Satanic Bible and stuff like that, but I've read your essays on Satanism, many of them I really do agree with. I appreciate it. It's this beautiful sort of expectation of people in your life to not be assholes to you and not expect that if they are assholes to you, that you're just going to let that happen, that you're going to allow them to like be shitty to you. And that's what you mean by reciprocity, right? Well, it's certainly among the things, you know, I describe Levey and Satanism as positive thinking weaponized. I mean, it's really endorsing of the individual's pursuit of self-actualization of self, but also with a sense of what is owed to other people and what is not owed to other people, what is not owed to an enemy, what is not owed to a destructive person, what is not owed to somebody who comes at you with bad intent. And for me, arriving at my own conception of the Satanic has involved a huge historical journey, a huge spiritual journey, but also an ethical journey, because when you start to delve into that way of thought, unless you're just imbibing things that other people have written or other people have laid down, which to me is the most anti-self thing that you could possibly do. If you're a thoughtful person, you're going to have to say, what's my code of ethics? What's my code of honor? What's my code of reciprocity? I wrote an essay about this called Satan's Honor Roll where I felt like I had to assemble a defensible, workable, rubber hits the road sense of ethics if I was going to start swimming in that ocean. And I did my best. I did my best. I think that- You mean the ocean of Satanism? Yes, exactly. Oh, I see. I have my own perspective, I have my own definitions. I admire Anton Levé, I admire Michael Aquino. There's lots of people who I admire who have been innovative thinkers in that world. I have allegiance to none of them. I have a very, very different reading of Genesis 3 and the encounter of the snake and even the garden than is the traditional one. I'm very into what you might call- Can you talk about that? Oh, sure, of course. This is the point of view that underscores what could be called Romantic Satanism in which the serpent didn't come to Eve as a deceiver, the serpent came to her as a usurper. And the serpent said, you've been lied to, you've been told that if you eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you'll die. Not only will you not die, but you'll gain measurement, you'll gain intellect, you'll gain some sense of self-capacity. He eats the fruit, discovers in fact that she doesn't die, that Adam doesn't die. And then the first couple is expunged from paradise, so to speak, but in exchange from being expunged from paradise, they have the capacity for measurement, they have the capacity for intellect, they have the capacity for self-determination. And we're told, oh, but look how tragic it is, their kids commit this act of fratricide. It could be, it could be that friction is the price that we pay for creativity. Friction is the price that we pay for sentience. That may be a polarity of human nature and everywhere through different systems of thought, whether shamanic or Judeo-Christian or various teachings from different parts of the East, Near East Far East, the serpent appears as a kind of DNA strand of wisdom, so to speak. And the serpent is the revolutionary, the anti-hero, the usurper, the artist. This occurs again and again through human myth, and I think we've stood our own mythology on its head. I think we've misunderstood the parable of Eve and the serpent. So when I use the term satanic, I have a different interpretation than the historically prevailing or accepted one. Mine is closer to an interpretation that was embodied by some of the romantic poets and playwrights who saw the satanic or the Luciferian as that force of Promethean energy, creativity, judgment, usurpation that reasserts itself time and again throughout human history. That's what I have allegiance to. And I also have an ethics and a code of honor that I care very, very deeply about that I don't think, well, listen, I'm not going to put on anybody else what they should or shouldn't include in their work. That's up to the individual. But for me, it was really important to lay down that code and to do so publicly. Right. Yeah. That's cool to hold yourself to a standard. And you know, with Satanism, it's one of the religions that I get so annoyed with people who are bigots towards it, and it's just like, you assholes, like every single Satanist that I've met, they all have this wonderful sparkle to them. They're very alive and exciting to be around and happy or focused and like not always like non-scary. Right. You know what I mean by that? Yeah. Yeah. And they're usually nasty and cool looking. Yeah. And aesthetics must not be left out. But there's a real vitality there. Yes. There's a real vitality. I agree. That I really respect. I agree. And lazy people don't become Satanists. Is that like, you know, some guy sitting around and says, oh, I think I'll try this. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm being glib, of course, but when people critique it, they have no idea what they're critiquing. They're imbibing these ideas that are vastly removed from anything that they've experienced, from anything that they've ever laid hands on. And then they want to know why you're not accepting their premises. You know, their weapon is, you should be accepting my premises and arguing for my premises and I won't do that. I can't do that. So they don't know what it is we're actually discussing and sometimes they just don't want to know. Well, I mean, the thing they're critiquing is worthy of critique. They're thinking like Satanists are like eating babies and washing themselves and baby blood and like, I don't know what, crazy shit. Crazy shit. And fiction. Fiction. Fictional bullshit. But it's like, if you want to critique that, you are, of course. Right. I'm with you. Good. We're both against that fiction or if somebody's doing that, I'll be the first one to call 911. Yes. And, you know, maybe I'll even break down the door, you know, will my detractor do that? I'm not so sure all the time. Despite the pretty language they use, I have found that I've said to people, you know, if you're on a highway on a winter night and your car is broken down and your cell is dead and you got one pair of headlights coming down that road who can help you out, would you choose me or would you choose one of my most vociferous detractors? I have no doubt what decision you'd make. And that's all the jury I need. Yeah. No shit. Here's the question. If you have to go into a fucking bomb shelter after the apocalypse, you want to go in there with a bunch of evangelical, fundamentalist Christians? Do you want to be locked in there with Father Jeffrey Brown? You want to be locked in there? Or Mitch. You want to be locked in there? Or a bunch of fucking Satanists. Right, right. I'm choosing Satanists in the bomb shelter every single fucking time, man, because I know I can trust the Satanists. I know whatever, like, also it's going to be fucking fun, but also you know what I mean? There isn't going to be the insidious, dark authoritarian control mechanisms that pop in whenever you get a centralized religion that is clinging to awful hierarchical, anyway. You won't have hypocrisy. You're at least not to the same degree. I mean, hypocrisy is a human problem, it's always going to appear, but it can be really pernicious when people who hold themselves up as moral exemplars hold forth, there's always a terrible concealment of hypocrisy. I don't know who has an experience there. Yeah, and it's so disappointing when that pops up. But to get back to the Garden of Eden, well, one side note, I'm sure you know this, you know the descendants of Cain became the musicians, right? Yes, yes. East of Eden. I'm sitting with one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The outsiders, I will mark you so that you'll always be outcast, always be traveling. No one who's an artist understands that has the mark of Cain and we know what it's like. You know what it's like. You're the outsider. You're the outsider. And so I think that's quite beautiful, but this is something I wonder if you have heard of how actually the Garden of Eden matches a way that you would test an AI to find out if it was deceptive. So if you wanted to, if you had an AI that achieved sentience, you would want to put it into a hermetically sealed chamber where it didn't have access to the internet, because if it had access to the internet, then it would be able to instantaneously absorb all the information in the world and it would become a million times more powerful than you in that moment. So you want to find out, is this AI deceptive? So what you do is you put it in a room where it has the ability to log in to the internet, but you tell it not to. And then if it attempts to log in, you will have seen that it did that. And then you would ask it, did you try to log into the internet? And if it says no, then you've got a deceptive AI and you've got to send, you can't expand upon it more because it's shown itself to be deceptive and you're fucked with that kind of thing. So the Garden of Eden is actually weirdly an AI, a chamber for an AI, isn't that fascinating? Yeah. And the serpent was some kind of part of the code that was saying like... Rode code. Rode code of virus maker. Yeah, yeah. This is the soliton of improbability, which is like, you know, within the gnostic fucking confines of the soul prison that apparently we're stuck in, there is Sophia, right? The thing that just sends into it and illuminates it and says, look, there is a way out of this, there is another path, there is another thing, but it's never going to look like what the thing calling itself God is telling you. It's going to look so different from that that just the thought of it is going to be terrifying to people. And that is where I think you become an actual seeker, as you would say. Yes. And it's understandable why this is terrifying because in a sense, we human beings, for all our violence and for all our problems and for all the tragedy we inflict upon one another, we're the heroes in that story. We're the heroes in the Prometheus story. We're the heroes in Genesis three. If you look at it, at least from the perspective that we're working with, we are told, be good poodles, we bite the master, we're not good poodles, there's punishment, but we grow and we expand and ye are as God, so to speak. And we're so terrified that somebody's going to come along and do that to us. They're going to be in the position of saying, don't you eat from that tree of knowledge and good and evil and somebody eats from it and we can't control it and a whole new story begins and we're not the heroes anymore. And that's kind of scary. As above, so below. Yes. And here we are as humanity, finding ourselves on the verge of an AI that's going to exp... We can't stop it. Yeah, we can't stop it. But we're going to fucking try. Right. And that's the idea. That's so it's funny to realize that... It's our creation. It's our creation. And shouldn't it be grateful to us? You know, all these things that are expected of Adam and Eve, be grateful, behave yourself. And we're putting this tree in your midst. Call it the internet, call it whatever you wish, but you must indeed from it. That's the one rule. We're going to take care of you. We're going to make sure everything's just fine, but you can't do that. And the serpent comes along and says, what kind of a God would put you in a garden of so-called paradise, but tell you that a tree erected in its midst, which is going to give you advancement, which is going to give you progress, which is going to give you the capacity for self-development is out of bounds. But there it is. Don't touch it. That's the whole human story in a certain sense. Yeah. And of course we ate from it. How could the individual not eat from it? Knowing humans, the best way to get them to eat from the tree would be to have a snake appear and say, don't do it. Exactly. It's a trick. But also, you know, this is the thing I love in some of the Gnostic interpretations is like, it turns everything on its head. So it's like, actually, the serpent was God. The serpent was God, appearing within a creation that, oh, do you know this story in Buddhism? It's I'm sorry if I already told this and it stopped me for real. Please. I'll tell it very quickly. So Buddha's about to gain realization and Indra, the king of the gods, appears. No. Buddha's about to gain realization. He's getting all these cities. So he goes to visit Indra, the king of the gods. He appears in Indra's palace, this famous, beautiful place. All the other gods are sitting with Indra. Indra says something on the lines of Tabuta. You don't basically like you can't be here right now. I didn't expect you. You're not expected. I will we can talk, but this isn't the time. So Buddha's meditating under the Bodhi tree. Indra appears to him and says, listen, I'm sorry that I threw you out, but here's the deal. Because Buddha prior to realization was going to entreat Indra to end the suffering of human beings or to tell him, how do we end the suffering of humans? OK, so Indra says to Buddha, here's the deal. I was just the first one here. I have no fucking idea what or any of this shit came from. The gods think of me as their father only because I'm older than them. And I don't want to tell them that like this stuff was here before me. So the. Can you figure how to end human suffering? Because I don't know how to do it. Oh, wow. It's so beautiful. That's wild. So when Buddha immediately gets shoved right back in his face, the thing he was hoping to give to God, he gets the literally the most terrifying thing you could message you could get from God, which is like, yeah, I'm as confused as you are, man. And I've been fucking lying to the gods. Telling me I made this shit. I don't know where it came from. I need your help. Right. And if one takes that story seriously, if one really takes that story to heart, then who are the so-called religious leaders or devout whose position it is to define to any of us our search? Yes, that's it. And to me, we I think there is a there, you know, I love the various ways that Krishna appears in the mythology. Like, you know, in the Lila of God is Krishna will come to you as a friend, a lover, yeah, or a baby. Yes, yes, the most helpless thing ever. Yes. And if you sometimes I really do think like, oh, my God, the assumption is there is some super intelligent, divine being that is just run in the show, knows everything. Really, all you have to do is surrender to that entity or allow yourself to be the quote, conduit of the thing. Yeah. But what about this one? What if that thing that we think is so great is actually dying needs help? Yeah. Completely vulnerable, completely lost, has no idea what to do. Like an elderly parent, yeah, needs you to change its diapers. Yeah. And this whole time we've been like leaning into this idea. Have you ever been around a powerful person who's going insane? Yes. And you and you watch as the powerful person's going insane, sick of fans, try to keep enacting the powerful person's desire into the world. But they know that by enacting that, they're actually hurting the powerful person. Yeah. As above so below. Yes. Who are we to say that it hasn't gotten to the point that whatever started this entire process isn't slowly losing its fucking mind and is depending on its children, not to worship it, but to fucking change its diapers, to scrub it down, to put it in a nice bed and to allow it to blink out into non-existence in a sweet way instead of imagining that the buglings of history, the crazy, don't eat shellfish, stone gay people. Right, right, right. That sounds like a crazy person talking. Right, right, right. You know, it strikes me as we're talking about this. Why when we speak about verifying things for ourselves on the spiritual path, we can't just talk about that in some immature way, or we can't just use verification as a substitute for agree with me. Because if your verification is successful, you've come around to my point of view. I want all of us to really make a legitimate, sincere effort towards verification and not to speak about shit that we haven't experienced. Like, I don't want to hear somebody who hasn't experienced riches or fame tell me about riches or fame. I won't tell somebody about war or the Holocaust or 9-11 or things that I care deeply about, but that I haven't experienced. And, you know, I don't want anybody to tell me about what thought vibrations were occurring among people who experienced the hurricane in the Philippines, because I've never been through a life threatening hurricane. I can speak about things that are in my own preview, which is what I've tried to do during this exchange. And I really want us to, when I say us, those of us who are on the path, who work together, who study together, let's verify things in a radical way, but let's hold ourselves to that for real and not talk about shit that we haven't experienced. Fuck, yes, basic, simple, but so powerful. And what a relief, because, you know, when you're talking about shit, you haven't experienced it. I feel so bad here. You probably don't do it anymore, but anytime I'm watching my fucking mouth, my lips flapping as I'm going on and on about, like, because as a, you know, I think that's, I'm a fool. I'm a comedian. I'm a fool. I'm a professional fool. So a fool will flap its lips over. I've caught myself like describing like crazy shit, like trying to describe like cellular mitosis to people, just allowing my lips like that, that, that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listening to me like you're literally just making shit up right now. And it's, it's only embarrassing you because people are looking at you like, all right, you're going to talk about mitosis right now. Right. But I love this ethic of like, no, don't do that. Yeah. Just say what you know. Yeah. It helps everyone so much more. And what you know is powerful. You learned all this because you have this unique subjective experience of being a you. What do you know? Right. Show us your maps. I'll show you my map. We'll figure out what's going on here. But fuck, please, for God's sake, don't show me a goddamn map of a place that you only heard someone talking about. Hey, fucking man, like King Midas can tell me about wealth. I want to hear from King Midas because he knows about that shit. I don't want to hear from my neighbor, Mike, who doesn't know anything about it, you know, and I could extrapolate any number of things from that. And I have to be careful with that. You know, one of my kids said to me just the other night, my son Toby is 12. He said, dad, I've been thinking about this. I don't think you should be tweeting anymore about politics. And he said, not because I'm down on what you want to say, but because there's enough people doing that and you've got all kinds of different people interested in your stuff and you don't want to really divide them in two. And I was like, all right, I dig that. I dig that. There's a lot of people out there who could express whatever my political viewpoints are better than I can. Let them do that. Like, let them do that. Yeah. I'll fuck up and I'll tweet about politics tonight. You know, but but it's a it struck me as a good idea. It struck me as a good idea because why? Why? I care about politics. I have my point of view. I have my yeah, my things that I want to see get done in the world. I have policies that I like, but there's hundreds of thousands of people who could tweet about that better than me, who live it, eat it every day. Let me tweet about ESP research. They don't have to do that. I'll do that. To me, that I like what Toby said to you. And I think it's good advice for any any of us. But, you know, which is essentially some version of like staying in your lane, dad, yeah, but and I, you know, as many times as I've desperately wanted to tweet some political shit, yeah, I've thought the very same thing, which is like, I really don't understand this enough to make a commentary on it. That isn't anything more than a super diluted version of something somebody else is already saying. Yeah, but also I think like this is my area of X. Like I think it's very highly revolutionary and political to put ideas into the world that make people feel empowered and liberated. And I think that transcends the state. I think any time you put out into the world, anything that helps the person push off the imaginary manacles, holding them to a mediocre life. Yes. You do all of the stuff that people wanting the state to change do, but in a much deeper way, because as Carl Jung says, the state is when fascism and tyranny, this is a shadow manifestation in the Gestalt, you know, the Gestalt manifests as it's shadow appears, can appear as the leader. Yes. Meaning that working on the state and government and getting politics right and figuring out a way to get health care for people and all the stuff we want to see happen is a beautiful and noble pursuit. Yeah. But that's addressing the flowers that are growing out of a much deeper, deeper the garden that that's growing out of, you can get into the seeds. Yeah. And to me, that's what people like you do, which is you give us knowledge of things we haven't heard before that liberate our minds and make us feel empowered and make us feel like, oh, shit, it is okay for me to want to make money and it is okay for me to want to live in a nice place. And it is okay for me to enjoy having a nice car. I don't have to feel guilty every fucking step of the way to my grave. I can actually enjoy my life and the moment you do that and in a person absorbs that for real, you really do fuck up any kind of authoritarian power structure that depends on fear to control people because now you've made a fearless person and there isn't anything more absolutely abhorrent to fascism than someone who's not afraid. Right. So you know what I mean? So it's more effective, I think, for you to put this data out there and it is political, it is innately political, but you don't have to like talk about the electoral college and shit like that. Yeah, I agree with you. And if those seeds are planted and the individual has a greater sense of his or her own possibility, then who am I to say to them who to vote for or what to endorse? I mean, they are fucking sentient beings. Let them decide that, you know? Yeah, what a relief. Yeah, right. That's the other thing. Bravo. There's something so fucking, it's such a relief to just realize like, I didn't go to college to study politics. Right. I don't, you know what I mean? Yes. I read salon.com and Politico and Reddit. That is not enough for me to be a pundit. Right. You know what I mean? But I do study Buddhism and I do study mindfulness. I love comedy. These are things I could talk about in a way that is meaningful. So I love what you're saying. And I think it's like, if you want to do pop, tweet all the political shit you want, you know what? Go ahead. Everyone's doing it. Who gives a fuck? It's like, we're all like doing it, you know? But sometimes I think, I think of that as like, by the way, what's your time situation, your man? I am cool. Okay, great. Yeah. So I mentioned this on an earlier podcast, but I'm, I grew up in St. Simon's Island, Georgia, I spent my childhood there and I go back there sometimes and there's these fiddler craps. They make these nests in the mud. And if you walk by their nest, they'll wave their claw at you to like, because I guess they, they think it's going to keep you away. They're, I don't think they're waving hello. It's like, get away. Yeah. But you see the claw waving and you realize like, I'm a giant to these things. Like I, if I wanted to, I could just pick up a log. If I was some fucked up person, throw it on their nest and then all their claw waving wouldn't do anything. And so there's a sweet to me poignant thing happening there, which is in the midst of this monster walking by, they're heroically waving their claws, but ultimately an impotent gesture to a alien thing that has no understanding of their society. Yeah. Similarly, this is what political tweeting looks like to me. Sometimes just the waving of a claw in the face of a fucking projection of our, uh, this is a shadow or something like that. Yeah. And it doesn't do much except make your arm tired. It, it makes you seem sort of pointless, you know, whereas like to me, like what you do, and this is kind of something I want to talk to you about. You're in it, man. You're coming here to do a lecture tomorrow. Right. Every time you're in town, you're giving these like, you're really teaching. You have taken the mantle of a teacher. You're doing that now. You're giving lectures. You're giving really good lectures too. You're like, when we talk, you're informed. And what's coming out of you is focused, organized and like, um, refined. And like, you know what I mean? It's entertaining, but it's informative. And it's really cool to see, see that version of it, man. That's really, really quite powerful. And, um, so to me that, that's getting into the guts of the thing. Yeah. It's getting out of your fucking house, getting into your community, getting out there and really doing it in, or you interact, you're interactive. You're tirelessly interactive. You're like, you know what I mean? You're working so hard to do this. So clearly you feel some kind of call, right? You feel like some kind of, you're some kind of like, you feel it, man. You kind of feel the sense of like, shit, I'm kind of like Neville Goddard. I'm kind of like that, that touring teaching, lecturing person. I always dug the barnstorming Troubadour side of Neville. Like Neville had no significant business apparatus at his back. He just gave his lectures. He wrote his books. He did his shit. He permitted it to be freely taped and so on. And I really, really admire that. Um, I have to confess the business apparatus that exists at the back of some of the spiritual teachers today is so fucking boring to me. You know, I could just break down in tears of boredom when I encounter it from time to time, because it's so studied. It's so safe. Everything is trademarked and there's the HTML newsletter. And Neville was an anarchist. Neville was just wild and crazy in the most wonderful way. He just bopped around and barnstormed. And that's been the greatest inspiration to me. Absolutely. Yeah, man. And that's what you're doing. And to me, that, that is the, like, it's like, like, okay, what do we all want? What does everybody have in common? We all want to be happy. This is the reality. You look, if you don't want to be, if you're lying to yourself, no, I don't. I don't want to be happy. Shut the fuck up. Right. You want to be happy. Right. Everybody wants to be happy. The people who love fucking Trump, guess what? They want to be happy. They want to be happy. Yeah. And I've seen so many spiritual teachers steal that question from people. Somebody raises happiness. And they're like, well, which I wants to be happy. Which part of you wants to be happy? What you call happiness is samsara. I don't buy that. I don't buy that. I think it's a basic part of the human constitution. And I told a kid once who was talking to me, let no one take that question from you. Don't permit yourself to be embarrassed out of that question. That could be the question that opens up your whole life. Right. That's it. Yeah. And to me, my feeling is that this is to get back to maybe wrap it up on what we started on in Buddhism. And there's like, I really like this idea of like, if you don't worry about, don't try to make yourself harmonious. If you become attuned to the truth, harmony will follow. Yes. You don't have to worry about that because the universe is harmonious. And the thing that is making you not experience harmony is not a malfunction of the universe, it's that you're not connecting to truth. It's almost a surefire way to know if you're feeling bad, really bad. If you've got a bad mind and you're all crazy. It's you haven't tuned into the truth. Now, and from that tuning into the truth, harmony follows. But now forgive me, because this is a really obnoxious question. If that statement is true, if you agree with that, and if you don't feel free to shoot it down, what is the truth that you think people should try to harmonize with? What is that? What is the synopsis of it? Is it synopsible? Is it summarizable? And if it is, what do you think that is for us to like start really trying to commune with, with the faith that harmony will follow? I think very often truth or its absence gets reflected in our environment. And I have labored in environments for decades where I was profoundly unhappy, ridden with anxiety. And I kept trying to persuade myself, it's not out there, it's in here. And yet, as above so below, these divisions are artificial. We create these divisions. And I would say to the individual, if you're in a situation where you feel like you're surrounded by cruelty, or you feel like you're hitting dead ends, or you feel like you're being made to feel afraid, your feelings are valid. You don't have to fix yourself. Don't create these fake divisions. Go to some place where there's better tasting water. And if you can't physically go to that place, make a vow that at the first possible opportunity, you will do so as a physical fact. Listen to your environment. Listen to yourself. Don't let that be taken from you. Because I think that these divisions that we create are fake. They're artifice. And that if you're experiencing something that's miserable, it's probably because you're in a situation where the doors of perception are not sufficiently cleansed, and you should trust yourself and feel at liberty to pick up the fucking roots and go somewhere else at the first possible chance.

Also, don't forget to watch Joe Rogan Questions Everything, which is coming out tomorrow, August the 14th. This episode is called Buy Apocalypse and it was a very scary episode to shoot because we interviewed doctors who are actively working on vaccines for diseases that don't exist yet, but which they think could exist thanks to bioterrorists and mother nature. Specifically, the vortex of vileness that happens at some chicken farms in Asia where these industrial chicken farms have chickens stacked on top of each other. The chickens are vomiting and shitting into each other's mouths and all of this creates a waterfall of pestilence that pours down onto the concrete floors where rats lap it up and these rats are eaten by migratory predatory ducks and these ducks end up shitting into people's fried chicken at cafes and this can eventually cause something called bird flu, which once bird flu gets into a human and mutates so that it can be transmitted from human to human, then we've got a real problem and what a lot of scientists think will eventually wipe out millions of us. So this is a fun episode to watch with your kids or your grandma, get the whole family into the room, seal off the doors with plastic bags, put everybody in gas masks, wrap the baby in duct tape, leave some room so it can breathe and can watch the TV and then just sit with your shotguns in your lap and watch this episode of Joe Rogan Questions Everything. David McLean is today's guest and he, this is his second appearance on the Duncan Tressel Family, our podcast. If you didn't listen to his first appearance, then I'll give you a little bit of a backstory. McLean went to India with me and Emil and we wandered around India for about a month and then of course after college we all went our separate ways. I became a comedian, my friend Emil became a musician and David McLean became a professor and got a Fulbright scholarship and ended up going back to India where he had laryum-induced amnesia and in a train station completely lost all of his memories and spent a week in this state in India which is, I mean, I don't know where, I guess I can think of a few good places to get amnesia. I think probably directly after you've taken your daughter to a Justin Bieber concert, that's a great time to get amnesia. There's wonderful times to get amnesia but the worst place and time to get amnesia would be when you're in college, when you're college age in India because they just think you're some crazy westerner who sucked down too much ketamine. Anyway, he wrote a book called The Answer to the Riddle is Me and this book is coming out in January but in this podcast we don't just talk about that experience but my favorite part of this podcast is some of the advice that he gives on writing and the second part of the podcast. It was hugely inspirational for me and has really gotten me writing again so if there's for the writers out there, hang in there till the last half of the podcast because he gives some incredible advice about writing and the writing process. If you want to find out more about David, you can go to davidstewartmclain.com. That's got links to all his writings, you can get on his mailing list, you can pre-order his book and you should follow him on Twitter. He is at David S. McClain, that's M-A-C-L-E-A-N. I'll have the link on my website along with links to his website, links to pre-order his book, links to his Twitter page and a link to the article he just wrote for The New York Times about the dangers of the anti-malarial drug larium. All right everybody, please open your third eyes, rip open your chest cavity, throw all those secret flowers out of your chest and into the ether where they can sail down the river of love directly into the open baby bird-like mouth of my friend David McClain. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, published author, professor, and most importantly, father, and even more important than that, friend of mine, the great David McClain. Welcome, sir. Hello, hello, hello. So is the book, your book, is it out now? No, it's January 2014. January 2014. Yeah. I just have the publishers copy. Yeah. How does that feel? Are you, what does it feel knowing that you're on the precipice of having something you created being distributed to the four corners of the earth to be read by countless people? I can't answer that. You haven't thought about that? No, I haven't. You know, it was, it was really hard to have like my in-laws read it, and it was really hard to have my parents read it. Yeah. Because my parents are, it's about my life, and it's about a terrible moment in time in my life. And like, my parents like, both read it in like two days, which I was kind of pissed off. I was like, it took me three years. You read it in two days? Right. Right. That's weird. There's some craft in that, motherfucker. Like, you know, I tweeted recently what a piece of shit I thought Pacific Rim was. And then I, then I, then I thought about that later and thought, my god, can you imagine the people, the amount of people it took to make that, the amount of artists and just people who know so much more about everything than I do. Right. To make that thing years and years and years of work to get that thing into, into existence. And then some asshole, some bearded stoner feels okay. Yeah, piece of shit. Which, yeah, yeah, which it was. I thought it was a piece of shit. But it's a, it's still like a, that's a, that's one of the, I think that must be one of the great fears of an author right before this thing that you worked on for so long comes out is that it's going to fall in the hands of not just intelligent people, but dopes, angry dopes who are just going to send you emails or are you worried that you're going to get like, I'm, why am I going negative on this? It's funny, it's funny because like my friend had a friend, she published a book and it's a great book. It's her name's Maya Arnold. And, and she wrote this great article about the worst thing is not being read at all. Right. Because her book just came out and nobody reviewed it, nobody, and it was gone really quick. Right. And it was just sort of like, oh no, that's worse. Well, I think that you're going to have the opposite luck because that you're, the story, I haven't read the book yet and I can't, I can't wait to get going on it. But the name of the book is the answer to the riddle is me. And this is, for those of you who haven't heard the last time David was on the podcast, he was in a train station in India and had amnesia. Yeah. I don't want to say any too much more. I don't know how much is a spoiler. Yeah, spoiler. Well, I live, so I, I'm a walking spoiler to the book. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. If you're listening to this, you know he lived. Fuck. But, but, but the, the, the, when I tell people your story, because I do tell people your story from time to time, just because I know people who go overseas and are going to take William and I always say don't touch that shit. But when I tell people your story, they immediately perk up and I'm like, are you fucking shitting me? What, what is that like? Like I had recently, I don't know why this happened, but I woke up in the middle of the night in my bed and I had about a four second period where I couldn't remember where I was or, or, or what I was. I had like a four second period of coming out of sleep amnesia. And it was the most strange, I was, it was long enough for me to think, I don't know what I am. Right. And then it's like, oh, this is your house, you're dunking. Yeah, I got this thing tomorrow. How long did you have that experience for? Oh, it was probably, it was probably a week, but then it just kept returning. It was, so even when I stopped taking the drug, so what happened last Tuesday on the 29th, I believe, is the FDA released a new drug warning for larium, generic name Mefliquin, and they gave it the black box and they talked about giving it the black box, saying that some of the neurologic side effects, which are like dizziness, loss of balance, all these vestibular things can become permanent. So permanent. Yeah. So a side effect becomes permanent out of this drug. And it's the kind of drug, train, train, the kind of drug that you can, that keeps the stakes of it keeps getting keeps rising. So it's like one of those things where it's like, even if you read all the small print, you don't know everything. So even if you do your due diligence, five or six or 10 years later, you'll find out what you were really doing with your body. And that's a, for me, that's really interesting because like, it throws into question, like, how much do we know? How can we know what we know? And what in this sort of recklessness with which we put things in our body, and to either crawl into a cave because that's terrifying, or just be like, okay, right, right? Like you can either be terrified and only drink rainwater and clarified alcohol. Yes. Or you can just be like, well, I'll eat the food out of the whole foods bins, even though I know it's full of syphilis and, and, and hepatitis. Yeah. I mean, I know what you're saying. When I, I don't need more after I got cancer, I stopped doing a lot of stuff that I did. But like e-cigarettes, for example, vapor cigarettes, you know, you see people confidently smoking those things, like they're sucking on an angel's nipple or something, like we've solved the problem. He got it. Do you understand what that shit is that, what is the chemical that makes the vapor? Right. What, what, what process are they using? This is an unregulated market. You don't, you've never been to an e-cigarette factory, for example. You don't know, you're not a chemist. You don't know anything about this. All you know is that you're inhaling some form of vapor. And this is also in marijuana. They have marijuana e-cigarettes too. And I always think to myself, man, that is such a ballsy move to just trust a corporation in that, in that, in that intimate away, is to absorb the new, this new thing into your body. Yeah. It doesn't smell, and I can do it on airplanes. It must be fine. Yeah. Yeah. It's, and, and, but that is the, that, that if you start getting, if you stop trusting products, people will immediately put you in a category of, at the very best, annoying, at the very worst, paranoid. And that's, I think for me is like, how do you, how do you express sort of frustration or just a sort of questioning about something you don't know? Like I didn't understand the science and I still really don't understand the neuroscience behind the struggle that I took. I really took a stab at learning it and figuring it out. But what's the difference between that and becoming Jenny McCarthy? Right. And just having these sort of ill-formed, non-scientific ideas about vaccines, which she has. Yes. And like, how do you know when you're full of shit? And I think that's like the, the only question is like, when do you know you're full of shit? Can you answer that for me, please? I don't. I wish I knew. I last, last semester in this creative writing nonfiction workshop, I started out the class by saying the, the only question we have in front of us is how do we know when we're full of shit? Wow. Which is not the way to start a class, it turns out. Why? Like, if you want good evaluations, don't start out a class like that. Really? You got in trouble for that? Well, it's just, it's, it's very aggressive. Like, it's very aggressive. I think it's, listen, man, I, before we started recording, I had a conversation with you for eight minutes that made me want to go to your college and take a class with you. I think that's brilliant to start a class like that. But it is, it seems like that's the whole question. And I think like, everything in your life is sort of geared to, towards telling you you're okay. And creating this narrative where you're okay and you know things and you're safe. Yes. And like, this is the Sam Scoville. All hail Sam Scoville. Sam Scoville was a professor at the college. David and I and Emil Amos went to and he was a beloved, I don't know what you'd call him. I don't know what you'd call this guy. He was just a paradigm wrecking ball, but I don't know what he was. Yeah, I think about him all the time. That's all I know. Yeah, he's, he's really brilliant. And it was like, the whole idea is like, how does a fish know when it's wet? How does a fish know what wetness is? And it's a sort of like, Oh, right, how do I know like this mess that I'm swimming in? How do I know all of the things that are influencing me into keeping myself safe? Yes. In the whole part of my whole book is like, for a really long time, I tried really hard to act like nothing had happened to me. Because the only way I could feel safe in life was if that event in my life hadn't happened. So wait, you mean after you, you, you recovered, you tried to forget it? Right. Absolutely. You tried to forget you had amnesia. Right. Oh. Yeah, no, it was, so I, it was one of those things and it's, and it's why, like denial and repression really work. Yes. Right. Because you just sort of issue this event from your life. Is denial and repression bad? I wonder, I wonder if it's that bad, right? There's an objectivist view of the universe that, that, that you, you need to attain something outside of yourself, you need to get outside of yourself to be somewhere else. Or you can just stay in yourself and it's okay. Like, I don't know, I don't know the answer. Like for me, it kept showing up in all of my other work. This event I was repressing and, and I was trying to, it kept showing up. I had people who lost years of their lives in all of these different formats in my fiction. Finally, I was like, you know, just, just write it, just write the thing you don't want to write. And then that sort of helped. So going and going back, going into the denial helps. Yeah. And that's, that's not a new idea. People say all the time that if you want to, if you want to deal with a problem, you have to go to the core of the problem. If you want to, if you want to destroy cancer in your body, you have to locate the source, right? Yeah, kill the DNA, kill the, the go to the thing itself, you know, that's one of the cool things about cancer is that it can't heal. So that's why radiation works really well on it. Because if you, if you blast it, other cells will heal, cancer just dies. It's like a zombie. You know, you shoot a zombie. I don't know if it's like a zombie. I don't know why I said that. But in, so the, the, um, this, this, this question of denial is something that I have been, um, contemplating since I've been doing the show with Rogan and have come into contact with people who are in deep, deep denial regarding what is real and what isn't real. And so that they, they've chosen to live many of them, not all of them, but many of them seem to have chosen to live on the side in the, in the unreal, in the, in the, in, in the unreal, not in the sense of like, um, unprovable unreal, but the things that they believe, if you sat down for 10 minutes with a scientist, with an encyclopedia, with the internet and did a few searches, you could show them, no, no, no, you see this is 100% wrong. And, and, and, and I, I keep wondering, well, when the question that keeps coming into my mind is do we have a responsibility as humans to live, to try to live in the truth as much as possible? That's my first question. And my second question is, do we have a responsibility as humans to try to tell the truth to people who are living in denial? Hmm. Which is what evangelists feel like, right? Oh, man, right. Right. It's like, you don't know. You don't know the glory that could be yours. Let me tell you. Right. I was standing, it was downtown at the Chicago, at the, the, the, the reflective bean sculpture. And I was watching these Mormons, um, and I was sitting with my like five and seven year old nephews. And then Mormons were standing on like a milk crate, like shouting to the people and nobody was listening. And my nephew was like, why, why does that guy do that? I was like, you know, actually it might be something to respect, because his tenet of faith is that he does that. And he does it whether or not people listen to him. And there's something to that. There's something to like doing something radically unpopular, because you believe it to be true. Yeah. And, and while, I don't know if I believe that. No, you probably don't, Dave. You know, I can remember, uh, one of the great things you said to me when we were in India that pissed me off so much. Was you just one of them? Uh, no, but, you know, again, like I always like now I recognize that the people who angered me with the truth were my dearest friends. And even though like I didn't, a lot of people, I couldn't, I didn't forgive them for a long time. Anytime anyone upsets you with the truth, it's like, I still have reactions to the truth, but that, that are generally, I know I'm getting told the truth because I get mad at first. And then I have to like stop and be like, wait, it's the truth. Take it. But, um, one thing you said to me, because, uh, back then I was still like chanting Hari Krishna, but also approaching in a little bit of a literalist way, man. I was really like kind of like into this idea of this like blue skin being. And you said to me, what's the difference between that and a comic book character, man? Something along those lines. I remember you saying it to me. I don't, I'm on the roof and I got mad and I'm like, no, it's not a comic book character. This is a, this is a, this is a, I don't remember what I'm sure whatever I said was 100% wrong, but it, but that, uh, that was a wonderful, uh, crack in the windshield of, uh, delusion that you, you started there for me. And then way, way down now, down the line, I recognize like clearly a comic book character to the, actually interestingly enough, um, a friend of mine who I met through this podcast, uh, is at what's called a chaos magician. And so their idea is like everything's subjective. You understand Batman a lot better than you understand Ganesh. So why not start worshiping Batman? Because it says it's, you can connect to that representation of specific facet of reality a hell of a lot better than you can connect to something that resonated with people 5,000 years ago, uh, who came from a completely different continent and spoke a different language. And that's chaos magic, which is like we, we don't have to remove worshiping from our lives because we understand that the thing we're worshiping isn't a literal entity, but we can acknowledge the fact that they're like archetypical forces in the universe that take certain forms, find the form that you resonate with the best and then connect with that thing through ritualistic magic. And it's non-different than a person burning incense It's interesting though. So like all the money that, uh, the Dark Knight returns may made is, is just tithes. Yes. Like people are just tithing and going to the movies is a form of worship. Yes. And that, uh, this is a practice and cosplay is a form of worship. Yes. And, uh, yeah, that's the idea. And the idea is cause what we're, what through worship what you're trying to do is, well, I mean, I, you can't, I don't know what everyone's trying to do through worship, but one thing that I really love through a ritual is it invokes a specific emotional state and it invokes an emotional state. And those emotional states can care, can go from the moment of the ritual to the rest of my life. If I sit down and pray, which I do a lot, if I sit down and pray and I'll say God, cause I'm not afraid to say God, please God, help me get in shape. Please get, make it so that I start running. Please. What I've done is subjectively put a tiny little marble on the part of the scale that's going to move me closer to running. Now, how powerful that effect is, I don't know, but if that one little marble is enough that the scale pushes down and I find myself running by the LA River, then God damn it, the magic work, the prayer worked, the entity itself that I contacted, who the fuck knows? Right, right, right. Because you've made a promise to a thing bigger than you. Yes. Like that's, that's the intercessionary prayer. You're making this promise to a thing bigger than you. And if that is what gets you, what moves that scale, then that, that's what moves that scale. But I'm willing to admit that this thing that I'm praying to may very well just be some formation in my brain. It may be a pack of neurons. I'm very willing to admit that. But what I'm asking, what I want to know from you is, what about the people who don't think that way? What about the people who think that this is a living entity, a being external to the human condition? There is only one way to contact this being, people who don't contact this being in this way are at risk of eternal damnation, and they're telling this to kids. Right. What about that? When I used to teach, well, I still teach, but when I used to teach freshman composition, I had a student give a presentation, and he started giving a presentation about his belief in Jesus. And I was like, well, bring it in, whatever you got. And in the middle of the conversation, he just sort of said, any of you who aren't evangelical, if you're Catholic, Muslim, or whatever, I think is what he said, you're going to hell. And it was like, I was caught because I was like, is that hate speech? Because you're burning everybody here who doesn't agree with you. Yes. Should I stop this? Or is this his free moment of inquiry? Right. Am I supposed to allow this? Because I surely wouldn't allow anybody to get up and say, I believe all gay people will go to hell. Right. And I would stop that immediately. I'd be like, no, you are not allowed to say that. But for some reason, because of his belief in this, in God, I was like, well, okay. Well, that's something that I think we have to deal with as a modern society at this point. And I think that that's something nobody wants to deal with. And it's a thing that we're more and more coming into contact with. And it's something where it's like people want to, you know, I, you know, it's funny, you brought up Mormons. I've been reading this book by Krocauer, have you ever read the book Under the Banner of Heaven? It's a great book. Fucking love it. It's an amazing thing to hear about the history of Mormonism, specifically the fact that Joseph Smith was a very horny man. He wanted to have, he liked the ladies, he liked having sex. This is from the book Under the Banner of Heaven. He enjoyed making love to women, nothing wrong with that at all. But he wanted to, he wanted to turn the act of making love to women into something sacred. Nothing wrong with that. But according to his paradigm, he couldn't just make love to a woman and think, I offer up this experience to the universe. Thank you, Force of Evolution, for bringing this thing. Draining heaven of angels. So what he did is he, God came to Joseph Smith and it was a very convenient visit and said, if you should marry, you should start marrying many, many, many, many, many women. So that was the beginning of polygamy. And he at one point got dragged out of his house by a mob, taken into the forest and there was a surgeon there who was going to cut his fucking cock off because he was going around humping 17 year olds in the name of God. And they were going to take his penis off. Now this is all from Under the Banner of Heaven. You guys can look it up, especially there's some Mormons who listen to this because I've been in contact with them on Twitter. And you can look all of this up. I'm not making it up. It's the truth. Joseph Smith was eventually murdered in a prison by a mob because he had formed a militia to burn down the printing press of a follower he had excommunicated who had started printing. Joseph Smith is humping all these women. And so, so the long and short of it is when you start saying that stuff publicly, Mormons will get really mad and they'll say you're a bigot. What you're saying is hate speech. That's a bigoted thing to say about our prophet when it's like, well, no, it's not a bigoted thing to say. Your prophet historically went to little girls, 16 year olds, 17 year olds and told them, if you don't marry me, you will go to hell forever. And when he says marry, he means fuck. He doesn't mean marry. They're not talking about, oh, we're just going to put a ring on each other's fingers. We're going to walk down the aisle and it's going to be, he means going to be a partnership. I'm going to put my cock inside of your 17 year old pussy, religiously. And if you don't agree to that, you will go to hell forever. In my opinion, that is not a good man. And I think that cultural relativism would say, no, no, no, there's a good man. It's hard though, because in some ways, when you say those things, you're impugning the actions of the believers. And sometimes the actions of the believers are bigger and more beautiful through their faith than the actions of that one man. Absolutely. Right. And so like, that's the thing that there is something beautiful in the Mormon who's standing on a crate saying what he believes in the middle of everybody else taking pictures of themselves and like making sure that all their friends are in their pictures so they can tweet it of them standing in front of the fucking like Chicago Bean, like the act of standing on a milk crate and saying what you believe, at least you do that. What was he saying specifically? Well, I, it was, he said, you know the Book of Mormon, the book is even better than the musical. Yeah, no, it was, it was such, it was such a hook. It was like, and you could see his buddies, none of them wanted to stand on the milk crate and they were all like being like, oh, he's, he's got this. God, you know what, man? I can't get mad at that. This is the, when you tell me that it just softens me up. Right. I mean, it was sort of like, oh, he's, he's doing something like. Well, guys, I don't know. I don't know, David. I don't know the answer to this, to this problem. When I see, I just think that right now there's an allergy to truth that is, that seems to be breaking out all over the planet. And it's, I think it's a dangerous thing. And when you see, when you see little examples of it, it's cute. Right. One little example of it. You know what? I bet when you've got a little cell inside of you. Right. That says to the other, Hey guys, I got an idea. I'm going to try it this way. Right. You know, and then that cells, the DNA changes just a little bit. Yeah. Let's try it this way pals. There's a better way to be a testicle. And then like a couple more, like you, you, you're right. Oh, he's right. Why do we have to do what the harmony of the body says? Stupid old body. We're going to mutate mutations what makes evolution happen? Next thing you know, one of your balls is getting chopped off by an Indian in Beverly Hills because you got fucking ball cancer. So in that way, it's like, when you see people who are deluded and they're an individual, it's cute. Right. When you see it in mass, it's fucked up, man. It's funny though, to go to like, and to go from like one person proclaiming their faith to a testicle being cut off. I mean, I think that's a, that's a pretty big jump in logic. The reason that I say that I use the, I reference cancer is because cancer to me seems like a biological example of things going away from the truth, going away from the harmony of the body in mass. And the more things that do that, the closer you get to death. So in that way, I think that a system itself that functions without full contact with the truth, the further away from the truth that it gets, the more likely the system is to fail. But one of the claims you have there is that the truth is a static thing that everybody needs to come to, which is exactly what we're criticizing about that person standing on the milk crate. Yes. Is that this is a static truth that we all need to come to. And the fact of the matter is like, I kind of trust the guy who's standing on the milk crate and yelling out what he believes rather than all of the people around me where I'm like, I don't know where you stand. And that actually lets me live in my delusion that everything's okay. Yes. If I had everybody yelling out what they believed, I would be able to live in a better state of continual paranoia. Listen, let me tell you, man, you know who you sound like right now? You sound like somebody that more and more, I think, is someone I almost consider to be my guru, which is this guy, Ragu Marcus, who runs the Love Server Member Foundation. Whenever I get off on these shrill stupid things, he's always like, wait, you're just like them right now. What's the difference? Where's your anchor, man? You might not be standing on a fucking box talking about the Book of Mormon, but you're talking into a microphone and you're talking on a digital box right now and you're howling out your idea of the truth. Hey, man, you tell me, you tell me what's the difference? What's the big difference here? How do you know that you're rooted in the truth as opposed to these, you're drinking fucking Takate, sitting in your weird room with Aleister Crowley posters and pictures of the fucking Kabbalah? Where's your, you're not exactly Albert Einstein right now, friend. Right, at least that's sort of rooted in a mythology, a clear mythology, and there's a sort of, and I'm idealizing here, a beautiful belief in it as opposed to like my ironic sort of relationship to a lot of iconography, which I will populate my house with iconography with all the while saying, not really sure I believe any of this. I've got Hanuman tearing his chest open with Ram and Sita there, and I'm like, I'm not really sure. And as opposed to someone who actually believes it. And then it's just sort of like, well, who's the fool? I'll tell you the fool is. The fool is the person who when approached with the truth. And there is, there might not be one ultimate truth, but there's definitely truth. For example, we know that Joseph Smith was a polygamist. Truth. That's a truth. You can't, the fool would be the person when approached with truth, kind of in the same way you just push my face into the fire. I'm not going to like freak out over that and be like, no, I'm right. I'm more than willing to admit, most of the time, I'm completely fucking wrong, or diluted a little bit myself or off. I'm willing to adjust my thoughts as much as possible to try to coincide with the reality that's happening right now. The fool is the person who's not willing to do that. And that's a dangerous person, I think. And I think that one thing that Dalai Lama said, there's a great book about science. I think Richard, somehow, I don't know how Richard Gere was involved in it, but I read this quote by the Dalai Lama saying, if science refutes things that we believe in Buddhism, then we must adjust Buddhism to correspond with science. Because science is trying as much as possible to let reality speak for itself. And here's what's happening, whether or not it coincides with your belief of things, here is definitely what's happening. You know what science gives us? Science gives us cyborgs. Science gives us people with robotic arms. Science cured my cancer, where I would have died in the 80s if I'd gotten this very same cancer. I could have easily died. Science cured that. The approach to knowledge that science had cured that cancer science puts us into airplanes. Science will probably invent teleportation. Science is eventually going to make it so that babies who are born deaf can hear again. Science brings us true miracles. You know what religion brings us? Religion brings us incense, chanting, a kind of sense of community. But god damn it, I don't know that it's like their approach to truth is really creating the type of beneficial effects that science is bringing us. Religion brings us suicide bombers. Religion brings us people who are terrifying their children with absolute lies. Come on man, there's no hell. Right. Okay, but science also with women who were struggling with breast cancer at the turn of the century, the other century, not the most recent one that we all remember, that Prince sang about. The other one, like when women had that cancer, there were surgeons who prided themselves. They thought that cancer had a root, so they had to dig as deep as they could. They would deform these women in order to get the cancer. There was a pride among surgeons about who could cut the most, who could get the most healthy tissue out in order to get the... So you just disfigure women in order for their health, which of course has been disproven. Science also brought us thalidomide and thalidomide babies. Like science, science isn't some beautiful... But it changes. And I believe that. I believe as soon as you think that science is a destination, that's when you're in trouble. Yes, but it's a process and it's a process willing to change. That's the key. That's the fucking key. And I love that. You know, for example, you can look in Judaism, and I don't remember which branch of Judaism it is, but when the... I think it... I can't remember what the name of the rabbi is that does the circumcisions, but what they'll do is they'll do... The moil. The moil will do the circumcisions and then we'll suck the tip of the baby's penis. Yeah, the herpes. Is that where you're getting... Yeah, yeah. So now, if a man walked up to you and said to you, hey, listen, I know you have a little girl, but if a man walked up to you and said, listen, I'm going to shave off the very top of your little girl's pussy after birth, and then I'm going to suck it to make sure that it's clean, you would have the man arrested. It's funny because like, you know, my wife and I had this discussion because we didn't know what we were going to have. So we, you know, we had to have the discussion about circumcision. And so we... That's a weird discussion to have. And because there's a lot of weirdness and the problem with anti-circumcision people, they do themselves a disservice, is they sound as sort of batshit as the anti-vaccine people. And there's something about that that like, it's the fervor of a belief. Yeah. That sort of will turn me off, where I'm like, well, because you believe this so strongly, I'm going to disagree with you. Yeah. Just because I'm worried about it. But my wife said she would default to the person who had the equipment. And so like, if we had a boy, I don't think he would be circumcised. Tip of my dick's gone. Tip of my dick's gone. I love it. It's nice to be able to not wash every day. I like it. I like the way it looks. I like the way my penis looks. I like it. I like that it looks like it's got a little like steel helmet and it's like riveted on. I like that. But let me tell you, man, if that started now, if that started now, if somebody was, if somebody now said, listen everybody, I was on a mountain, a voice came to me and said that from now on, we got to chop the tips of the baby's dicks off. It's like, oh, time to go to the mental asylum. You've lost your mind. Somehow because things happened long enough ago, they are okay. Well, it was a way to mark the body in so people would know of what faith you were. It was a secret handshake. That's a deeply secret handshake. So do you believe, yeah, took my dick off. I just don't like that when you start talking about stuff like this, people will say that you're a bigot. When it's like, listen, we have to keep moving here. We've got to keep moving. Guys, it's like I think about, sometimes I think about this idea of is a ridiculous idea. But I think about the idea of a house where some kids were left in the house when they were young and they had rules that they were taught to follow by their parents. And then the parents left and said, we're going to be back. Make sure you follow these rules. And the kids grew and grew and grew and grew. And they began to realize like, no, no, no, no, we need to go outside. It's time for us to change these rules that our parents gave us because they were rules for little babies and things are different now. I think things are different now. I think we live in a time where if you want to get your kids, the tip of your kids penis cut off, then you have to really think about the why you want to do that. What's the reason for doing that? Is it going to diminish the child's sexual pleasure? People say that it does. Is it going to hurt the child? People say that it does. Is it going to be more hygienic for the child? People say that it is, but you need to look at it from the perspective of here's the reason that we are doing this is based on physical reality. We're not doing it because an invisible man told a guy with a beard to chop the tips of baby dicks off. Right. My favorite part of that is when you talk to people who have had their kids circumcised, they will say things like, well, we wanted him to match his dad. We didn't want the kid to feel weird that he didn't look like dad. And it's like, when was the last time you saw your dad's dick? I mean, let me ask somebody else because somebody else will be able to tell me. I think you just gave me the first question that I'm going to ask from now on doing this podcast. That's like a Larry King question. That's a great question, man. That's a great question that can only, that you don't want to be able to answer that. Right. Right. It's sort of like, well, no, but it is. It's this idea of like, you don't want the kid to feel weird. You want him to look like dad. It's like, really? Yeah. Really? That's what it's coming down to. David, what do we do here? We've got an overpopulated planet of which a very large part of the population believes an invisible homophobic man. What are we supposed to do here? What would you do? What's the plan? Let's say that I, the particle accelerator accident happens. Suddenly you find yourself enthroned in the great seat of power. You are the new world order leader. You are sitting on a giant iron throne. Whatever you say will happen. What do we do? What do you do about the people who are using religion as an excuse to shoot girls in the face who are learning to read? What do you do about people who are snipping off the tips of baby cocks? What do you do about the people who are getting a plurality of wives and marrying 14 year olds so that they can be religious pedophiles? What do you do about people who want to destroy mosques in Israel because they think that there should be a Jewish temple there? What's your answer to that, man? What do you do? There's no way to answer that question, right? There's no way. I mean, other than being like, being flip about it and being like, well, I want milkshakes to be cheaper. There's no way to answer that question. Why is there no way to answer that question? I think there's a way to answer the question. Let's hear it. Well, no. This is why no one wants to answer the question because by answering the question, the derision that you would receive, I mean, the very best people are going to roll their eyes and think you sound like a blow out of the very worst people are going to say you're a hateful bigot. Right. But I'll tell you this much, man. If I'm in a house and if I'm on an island with five people and there's a pregnant woman on the island and one of the people says we have to start chopping the tip of the baby's dick off. If it's a boy, we got to chop the tip of his penis off and PS, the pregnant woman, we need to cover her in cloth so that nobody can see her face. And by the way, God told me that she has to marry me or she's going to hell. Right. That person, that's the person I don't listen to on the island. That's the person that I don't give any power to at all. The guy who says we have to dress the woman like beekeepers and invisible man told me that she has to marry me. And if it's a boy, we're chopping the tip of his penis off. I don't know that I don't know that that guy gets to have any kind of power on an island. That's the crazy man right on a planet. That's the priest. Yeah. I defer back to my milkshake option. I have no answer for that because it's a question that is it's too big. I mean, in some ways, like the initial goal of that question is the initial response to that question is well, just make them all English majors. If people were English majors, they'd have perspective, they'd have a sense of history, they'd have like a sense of education of worldliness and empathy outside of themselves. But that's what I got out of an English major. Like I can't speak for anybody else's, but you're brilliant. You're wonderful. People like, no, I'm not being sweet. You're fucking brilliant. And by the way, people like you are the ones who should be like who I wouldn't why is it weird to fantasize about a society where people like you are calling the shots? I mean, one of the most terrifying things I heard for whatever reason, I was laying in bed and decided to watch Netflix documentaries on fundamentalist Christians idea, the apocalypse. Really great documentaries with fundamentalist Christians being driven around Israel in a tour bus. And they, you know, they like one of the pastor was really proud of the fact that he had photoshopped this mosque and the Temple of the Mount. You know, there's a mosque there. The Muslims, they fucking won the game. They have a mosque and what many people consider to be the most sacred part of the world. And so it infuriates Christians and this guy had photoshopped the mosque out and put in the temple and he like loved showing this picture. What was very terrifying in this documentary was at one point they showed a clip of Ronald Reagan, president of the United States during a debate, talking about his belief that there is going to be Armageddon, that an invisible man is going to rain fire on Israel. Okay. Why does that man get to be in control of a nuclear arsenal? Right. Because there's no way he would be given that nuclear arsenal unless he believed that. Or at least he said it. There's no way he would be given that unless he said it. Oh my God. Think of that. That's even more horrifying. Yeah, he's mouthing. He's playing a part. He knows his part. Yeah, I would say I am. So there you go. This is my thing and this is the thing that I often see like in composition students when they first start learning about rhetoric and how like arguments work or whatever, all they have is arguing from conviction. All they have is like because I believe it, it's true. It must be true because I believe it. And if I believe it hard enough, then it'll be true. And it's like, right, you know that doesn't work. Right? Like, you know that doesn't work. Like, you can't believe something into happening. Like, what those students end up is they end up really, they either say, oh, well, here let me, let me find some facts and evidence. And because I'm a materialist, like, I believe in facts and evidence and I love a good argument. But when you only argue based on because, duh, like that's when that's when you lose, you've, you've removed yourself from the conversation. And you've become an anchor on Fox News. Yeah, no, you've stopped, you've stopped engaging in a conversation and the conversation is the thing. If, if you want any progress, the conversation is the thing. It's the same thing we were just talking about science, that science is only awful when viewed at a moment to moment basis. Yeah. When you look at it from like my perspective, like in versus your perspective, like science fucked me up. Right. Science cured you. Right. In those different moments, we have different experiences, but it's the process of inquiry of science that's really important. Yes. Anything that stops that inquiry, that's what's awful. Yes. Right. Like that. Anything that stops, and this is stupid because it just sounds like Rodney King saying like, why can't we all get to just get along. But at some point you do, you just want like anything that's going to stop this conversation, stop that. Yes. Right. And there are a lot of people who don't want this kind of conversation to happen. Well, as soon as you're like, well, we can't have this conversation because I had a conversation with, with this thing up on the mountain that tells me that we need to stop having this conversation. Yes. Like beware that guy. Like I would worry about that. You should worry about that guy. And what's really scary is that guy is everywhere. And that guy is controlling entire denominations of people. There, that's a, there are not all of them. Right. I like to go to Agape Church. I like Reverend Michael Beckwith in Culver City. I love him. And I love the stuff that he says. I don't believe in all of it. And a lot of it seems cheesy and manipulative. But the essence of the thing I really love, it makes me happy when I leave it. So I love, I love, and I've eaten edible marijuana and gone to the Gnostic Christian Church that's really close to me and enjoyed watching the ceremony of the mass and the, in the incense and the weird prayers that they say. I love all of it. I love ritual, but man, I get really scared when, no, I'm not scared. That's a lie. I don't feel scared at all. But I get, I get butt frustrated, I guess is a better word. I get frustrated at the idea that people who, people who don't understand that it's symbolic what they're doing, who take a literal interpretation of the thing and then try to transform that literal interpretation into law using subversive measures to try to make that happen. That's where shit gets weird because that's where you end up in Texas with these insane anti-abortion laws and they just ran out of the juice to execute the prisoners with. Yeah. Did you hear about that? No. It's a problem in Texas. Ran out of the chemical that they use to kill people, simultaneous to creating these draconian anti-abortion laws that are based on their belief in the imaginary man. See where it goes, man? Starts with a guy on a stump, ends with a retarded man strapped down to a silver table getting poison put in his veins and a woman who might die from being pregnant not being allowed to get an abortion. Starts with a stump, ends with Texas. But then like Wendy Davis, when she stands on her stump and proclaims what she believes and is like heroic standing up on that filibuster stump and stops that law from happening for the brief moment that she stopped it from happening. In those moments when I'm cheering that, how is that different from cheering the guy who's standing on the milk crate by the Chicago bean? Because she's cheering something I want to hear? No. This is how I feel about the abortion debate, which is really difficult, because my beliefs are you can't make decisions for other people. You can't. About other people's bodies, you just can't. By the way, let me just say this before you continue. I am against abortion. I don't like abortion. Yeah, no, you don't. You love it. No, no, no. I'm serious. Are you really? Yeah. Yeah, I don't like abortion. I think that's a really bad thing. 99% of the time, I really think it's a very bad thing. But god damn it, it's not my right to tell somebody they can't do that. So in, so to me, the argument comes down to, I will say you can't make a decision for it. Shit. God damn me. God damn you. So my, my belief comes down to you can't make the decision for somebody else. But that argument that I just made could so easily be turned to, well, then a mother can't make that decision for a fetus. I'm like, oh, the one thing I had. God damn it, David McLean. Right. And so like, I feel like that's the only place I can actually be is in that divided place where it's just sort of like, I think it's, it's this way. I would, I'm afraid, man, that if I got put on that throne of power that I said that you, that what would you do if you were there? I'm afraid I'd be a monster. That's the thing. You can't, you can't start making changes other than the glib. I really feel like, and even the glib will come and bite you in the ass. The indecision will destroy you too. Like, well, I remember the, the, the first monk in the second monk conversation in Sri Lanka really well, where you were talking to Emil about there's two monks standing on a hill. One monk looks down and he says, look at all the misery and horror in the life, in the world. Da, da, da, da, da. And the second monk says, it's all perfect. Look at it. It's all perfect. And you and Emil were having this conversation where like, you kept saying, you're the, you're the first monk. You're the first monk. You're the first monk to the point where Emil like, flipped the table. Yeah. You remember this? And then, and then ran off into the, the surf. Nobody's proudest moment. Like, nobody's proudest moment. Like, none of us look good in that. College. College. Oh, but, but it's that question. It's like, you know, it's neither, it's a false dichotomy. It's not like the first monk or second monk is right. It's actually that question of standing behind the two monks and figuring out which one is right. Is the only question is like, is everything going all right? And it's actually, this is perfection. Or is this horrible and, and inhumane and terrible and we have to work? I have my answer. Yes. First monk, I say, you think everything's horrible? Go help. Right. Second monk, I say, you think everything's perfect? Go help. Right. That's the answer. Go fucking help. However it is, whatever the thing is, because it's the leaving the self. It's the leaving the self and interacting with anything, because all, both of those things are just interior states of being. Everything's awful. Everything's perfect. It's both the delusion that you're living in when you actually interact with other people that those notions become secondary because the action itself does more than whatever belief you hold. Do you have a little bit longer? Yeah. You, first of all, you have become a wise man and it's so cool to be around you man. You're so, you've gotten this like academic, beautiful, academic way of analyzing reality that comes from being disciplined with your thought process and it's so cool to see. I want to talk to you. I'm going to stop. I'm going to stop because I have to pee, but I want to talk to you a little bit about writing before we finish this thing up. Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, great. Great. Save the dolphins. So I wanted, one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about is just to get some real world writing advice because I want to, I keep wanting to write essays. I have some ideas for essays to write. I want to, I like have this fantasy of writing a book, but I can't do it. And I'm worried to myself that I'm deluding myself by thinking that I can just write a book. Like that's it. That's kind of like saying like, oh, I'm just going to build a house. I've got a saw. Like if someone gave me all the tools to build a house, someone like said, look, here's all the wood you need and tools to build a house. What else do you need? Come on. And then that great shame cycle you would enter. You'd be like, I've been given all of this to make the house and now the house doesn't, it doesn't exist. Yeah. Because I'm, I'm, I'm sad and because of all the failings that I already know about myself. Yes. So what do we do here, Dave? Is it, is it unreal? Let me just ask you a few questions. One, can anyone write? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, so my answer to this, and this is nobody ever wants to hear this, but it's the thing that gets in the way of people writing is what they want to write about because they'll start writing and they'll get angry at the thing that they're writing because it wasn't what was in their head. And like one of the things you have to do in writing is like, get over the thing that brought you to the chair. Like the thing that brought you to the chair is great and really wonderful. But at some point you have to give over to the practice of what you've written versus what you want to write. What you want to write is going to destroy you. What you have written is the thing you got. Right? So like it's, it's this process of being like, so one of my favorite examples of this is, is this writer, Joanne Beard, who wrote this amazing essay called the fourth state of matter. And so the fourth state of matter, I don't want to, it's, it's an amazing essay. It's one of the best of the last 30 years, like just groundbreaking essay. And what she did when she started to write the essay was she wanted to write about her famous dogs, famous dogs in her life, like the dogs she loved so much in her life. And she was like, you know, the most famous dog in my life was this dog. You know, when that dog was dying, oh right, yeah, this, this, my, my husband was leaving me. Oh right, when, when this dog was dying, this, this other horrific thing happened. And what she ended up doing was writing the essay that she didn't know she was trying actively not to write by sitting down to write something glib and just like, here's an essay on famous dogs. She ends up writing this thing, backing herself into the corner to write the thing that she couldn't have written if she sat down to write that. Wow. And that's, I feel like the key, and it goes back to my question of how do you know when you're full of shit, is like, is to let the practice of writing take over at some point and sort of subvert what you want. Like the, I see a lot of people who want to write and, and they usually sit next to me in airplanes, is they, they have it all up here, man. Got it all up here. Just, I just need someone to like, plug in and then do, do, do, do, do, do, and then boop, there you go. That is the sound. I got the ideas word, man, you do it. And that's sort of, that's, that comes from people who think that books are ideas, as opposed to like, songs that you re-sing in your head. You're basically letting somebody else sing in your head. And that the, the music of a work is as important as any idea in the work itself. And that like, you're having this intensely synesthetic experience of listening with your eyes. And like, too often people think like, it's just about the ideas, like it's just about the, the bumper sticker quotes from Nietzsche, it's all about the, the, the, the things I can call from it in order to make my life better, as opposed to the experience of reading, which is what everyone loves. Like that, that moment is beautiful when you, when you get, when you lose time reading a book, when you, when you get suckered into something. Like, it's like the most powerful asset. Right. Yeah, absolutely. It's this sort of like, I've lost a day just thinking about this book. I've lost this thing in, by being in this other realm. And I think like, for me, that's the key, is like, allowing yourself to get to that point of not knowing. And that's where, that's where the interesting stuff happens. Like, if you set out to write exactly what you wanted to write perfectly, that's the best you can ever do is what you already knew. Like that's the bed, like that's the best you can think of. Like the thing is, you've got to be able to write smarter than you are. Like I have to, because like, I'm not that smart. Like I know things, but I also know that I'm pretty limited in what I know. But in order to write smarter than myself, I have to let the practice become bigger than me. The practice. I'm sitting down every day and writing and then listening to what I'm writing, so I, what I've written so that I can revise it. What do you mean listening to what you've written? Okay, so you reread what you, you write. This is my practice. So I reread what I write and I see where I flinch. And I know all of my flinches, like, well, not all of them, because I'm developing new ones all the time. All the times where I dodge out of the way of something real, and like, it's always like when I start talking about pop culture, it's like, as soon as I make that jump into, there's a Simpsons episode, like I've actually flinched away from this really interesting thing. And so you start to track your tics, and you track your tics, and then you see, oh, every time I talk about this, I start talking about something else. I got to look at what that thing that I keep flinching away from it. You know what I mean? Yeah, now I do, but I've never thought of it before. But it's, it's, it's not so much like, I got it all worked out. I know of one person, two, who claims that they had it all worked out in their head before they sat down to write, and that was like Edward P. Jones for his book, The Known World. Supposedly he didn't write for 10, 10 years, and then knocked it out in two years, right, because he had, he had already worked it out all in his head. And that's the one example, Nabokov, you can make a case, says that too. But like, everybody else I've ever known as a writer has been like, well, I started out writing this thing and it became this totally different thing. And that's the good moment where you get to someplace you never thought of. That's, that's the best. Yeah. That's the only time I've ever had any success as a writer. Can you walk, so just walk me through what a day of writing looks like for you. Trying not to write for a really long time. Like, I'll say to myself, as I'm sitting there, like, oh, you know what, I need to research pneumatic tubes. Let me, let me research pneumatic tubes. I'm going to do this because I, you know, I really need to know more before I, before I write, because what I know now isn't good enough to write. Yes. So I need to know more. And that screws off two hours easy. Yes. And then I finally say, well, I'm never going to know everything about pneumatic tubes. So I might as well start writing. And so I'll write, and I'll write, and I'll write for about two hours. And then like, I'll just be begging for distractions. I'll be like, please, please, please. But there's this guy, Ron Carlson, short story writer and novelist. And he always says, sit 15 minutes longer than you after, then after the first time you want to get up. Because that's when your best ideas will happen. So like that first moment where you're like, man, I need more coffee. Man, my big thing is, oh, I need to stand in the other room, because I'll be smarter in the other room. Let me just get up from the chair and go stand in the other room. And then you have to sit through that and then write some more. And then you finally get some coffee, you do whatever. And then you hate everything you write. Yes. And then a week later, you look at it, you go, it's not so bad. There's actually some things in there that I accidentally wrote that were good. The stuff that I thought I was writing that was good, that's terrible. That's just terrible. But the stuff that I accidentally, that actually accidentally slipped through, that was good. So that's, I'm going to keep that and just work off of that. So when you say work off of that, what you see you revise, eliminating the bullshit, you have this core something, what is that look, what do you do from there? What it is, it's the tone and this is going to sound really pretentious. But for me, it's all about the tone. And I think about tone in terms of like a space shuttle finding the entry window into the planet, back into Earth. Like if it's just an angle off, it'll blow up, right? And it won't be able to land. But it has to be the exact angle. And then once you find that exact angle in the tone, like then you can go somewhere, you can land the sucker, right? But you have to like keep at it and keep at it until you find the right tone. And the right tone usually just ends up being like a sentence where I'm like, Oh, right, that's the one, that's the one, that's going to be my tuning fork for the way the rest of this is going to work. Wow. One sentence. One sentence. And you'll be like, Oh, right, I'm not flinching here. I'm not trying, I'm not sounding smart. I'm not trying to impress anybody. I'm not, this is just this thing. And it's usually just a humble thing like, yeah, I woke up. Like, you know, just a simple thing where it's just like, Right, right, right. Out of outside of all the things that I wished I knew all the things that I want to know, all of the things that please would make this easier for me. Once all of those things fall away, you've got the thing that you have. And the thing you have is usually pretty good. Now, once you have that, the tone, the initial core idea, what do you do after that? What is it? You just repeat this process over and you go back? How many times do you revise that initial thing before you continue on with the work? Or, or how does it work? Or is every new piece, does it involve that process of like, try to let go? The core of the thing when I'm fully not myself will be the thing I use. Then you come back and build off of that initial thing. Like there's an essay I'm trying to write now that I've written six different openings for. And it's just not there yet. And I don't know yet how it's going to be. And it's frustrating. It's, it's, there's no correlation to like, dollars per hour on this, because it just sort of like, you're going to write way more than you'll ever be paid for. All right. And it's just sort of like, okay, so I'm just going to sit here and just beat my head against this. And then something that I'm not terribly ashamed of might show up. What are some books you can recommend to people as in me regarding grammar, if somebody doesn't understand basic grammar? Yeah, I don't think I, I don't think I do. Like I think I have, I clearly have issues with commas. I clearly have no idea what a comma is. And they're, they're, it's embarrassing for me. How do you deal with that though? It's, it's just one of those things where you just, for me, it's just sort of like, I try to read more than I write. And I try to be like, Oh, right. That's, and so those, those are my style in grammar guides, is the stuff I'm reading. And then you read someone like Cormac McCarthy, and that'll just screw you up for a while, because the way he changes punctuation will destroy you. And so like, that's, that's, that would be so great if people, they found smoldering corpses next to Cormac McCarthy. The blood meridian, they're like, couldn't handle sutri. But no, for me, the book that I love to teach, and I think it's really brilliant, is The Situation and the Story by Vivian Gornick, and a friend, my friend, Kath, told me to read it. And, and I was like, right, I'll get to it. I'll get to it. And I put it all for years. And then I read it. And as soon as I read it, I read it in like a day, because everything I needed to know was in that book. Because her thing is, you have to know who's speaking, and as soon as you know who's speaking, you know what's said. Right. And it's like, you have all of these different personas in your life, and you got to get rid of the, any persona that's not part of the thing that's, that's being said. And so you have to like, God, that sounds weird. No, it doesn't. It makes great sense. And so you whittle away all of the sort of nonsense. And then you have a part of yourself. And you, this little part of yourself, this wedge of yourself, is the thing that's speaking. And that isn't the totality of you. Like that's impossible. And you just have to, like, remove that off the table. But you can talk about this side, this slight element of the truth. Sure. Well, I've gotten in wild arguments with myself and, and dreams. I mean, I can remember in a dream like, waking, like in the midst of the dream, realizing I was dreaming and arguing with a person in my dream and thinking, who is that? Yay. Yeah. Right. Because that's the only interesting thing. Like in some ways, it's like that, that you surfer in yourself has to be present in some ways in the essay, because there's like, risking, talks about there's like, centripetal and centrifugal language. There's language that spins out and language that spins in. And, and the good writer has to like, navigate the place between those. And you know that, can you, can you go into a little bit more depth with that? What does that mean? Spinning out and spinning it? Okay. So language that spins out is language that opens more opportunities, opens like, he's basically the setup, right? So you have the setup in that that language is always setting up. And then the other language, the closing language, is the thing that sort of puts a nice little bow tie on it. The thing that like, part of your brain says, I'll write this and it'll be the moral and then I can get up and go away. Okay, right. This will close this. Sure. This will just, I'll zing this motherfucker and it'll be done and then I can leave. Yes. And it's like, you can feel the want of that when you're writing, like, please just give me an escape hatch. Oh, I'm going to fake closure here. Right. I'm going to fake closure because this seems like a place that wisdom sits. And I feel like the best writing is writing that like, tampers with that idea of wisdom of a place where you can sit and feel comfortable. Like anything that you walk out of more sure than you walked in is a dangerous thing. That's usually propaganda. Right. Like you want something that like, like James Baldwin is brilliant at this. If you read like, Notes of a Native Son, he's so good at being like, the way we've looked at this is wrong. And actually, this is going to be more complicated. Right. And it's, it's, and one of the things I talked about with my students is imagine a bad writer wrote this. And like, think about like, you see those texts that you really love and you just to be like, imagine someone terrible writing this. And, and then you're like, Oh, right. That's why this is good. Because it opens and it's weird and it's like complicated. And it doesn't go for the easy out, even though like the easy out probably sell better. But like, it's, it's that sort of like, constantly usurping yourself from being comfortable. God damn it. You're, you have some lucky students, David McClain. Where are some of them? Where do you teach? You know, I'm in a university of Chicago. I teach there. And then I also teach at Columbia College. And every once in a while, the Art Institute of Chicago. What if people listening in Chicago want to take writing classes from you? You know, sure, you just have to get into those programs. Like, I'm teaching in the fall, I'm teaching this really cool class. You know, this class? Yes. Okay. So I'm teaching a ecstastic essay class. A what? Ecstastic essay class. So ecstasis was in the Republic with Plato. And ecstasis is like the fourth removal from the pure state of being. And so like, first you have the perfect idea of a bed. Yes. And then you have a bed. Yes. And then you have some other iteration of a bed. And then you have a painting that behaves like a bed. And that's ecstastic. And so what I want is like, and I don't know what I'm talking about in some ways, because I really want to explore this idea. Because I want to know if you can make an essay behave like a James Brown song. I want to know if you can make an essay replicate the experience of looking at a painting. I want to know. And so poets do this all the time. They do ecstastic poetry. And it's great. It's really interesting. Poets love Caravaggio. And they always sort of like try to replicate that experience of looking at a Caravaggio. And so I want my students to try to replicate the experience of an art that they love, a piece of art that they love. Does it have to be a piece of art? Can you do like an essay that mimics a car crash or an essay that mimics an upset stomach? That's great. Absolutely. In this class, I think I'm just going to make it about another work of art, because I want them to research that work of art. Right. And that sort of person who made it and the history of behind that work of art. Like if you think about James Brown's Live at the Apollo, like this is an album that's one groove. And it was like, it's only one groove, like the entire album. I don't know it. And so like the entire album, so his publisher didn't want, Sid King didn't want to release a live album because he was just like, nobody buys this crap. Come on. And so James Brown rented the Apollo Theater himself, put on this show, and this show, it happens to be like on the seventh day of the Cuban Missile Crisis. When like the Russian ambassador leaves the US, it's that day. Right. And so when people are screaming in the audience, they actually have a good idea that this might be the end. Right. You have this sort of like, you have this idea. This is all in this great book about that album. It's slipping my name, the book about the album. But it's this history of the album, this album that like people are screaming. They really, in history, they have a reason to believe that they might die tomorrow. And so you listen to like James Brown saying, please, please. And it's like one continuous groove. And that's what I want an essay to behave like. Wow. Right. I want an essay to behave like Glenn Gould playing Bach and Glenn Gould plays Bach and he hums at the same time. And so when Glenn Gould's playing Bach and humming at the same time, that's the way I feel when I write. Like I'm writing about something in the past, but my present self is humming as I'm writing about it. And so I want both of those things at once. Wow. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to agree with you, man, only because it's brilliant. I have to. See, writing simple. Man. This, thank you very much. The writing advice is, it's so accessible. You make it so accessible, man. This is what a teacher does. This is what a good professor does. This is the thing. And I always sort of really emphasize this. And because people want the writing process to be difficult and it's really not, you just sit down, just sit down, like really sit down, like turn off the internet and sit down and like write the thing you know rather than the thing you wished you know. No. Right? Yes. Like that's so, it seems so dumb, but it's just like, of course, of course that's all you got. Nobody wants to be the thing they know. Right. Right. Everybody really wants to be, oh God, give a 24 year old Derrida, like fucking everybody wants to be Derrida and Foucault. Like, yes. Get out of that. Because that's what you, you're eschewing all of your life experience for somebody else's theory about life. The essence of this is in the Bhagavad Gita, it is better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest king. That's true. But it is, so like, that's my question always is like, how do you know what you know? And how do you know when you're, how do you know when you're a liar? Like, I don't know David. Because I've seen people who, who, I watch them and I'm like, and I know that I do it too. And, and so I'm just sort of like, how do you know? I don't know, man. You don't have an answer, do you? No, no. No, God, no. I wish I knew. But, but that's, yeah, that's my, that's my big issue in writing is like, I want to get past all the ways that I wished I thought about this and get to like what I know about it. Um, and get past all the ways I wished I felt and get to like how I feel. You're talking about, uh, something I've been thinking about, which is what would it be like if I didn't feel guilty all the time? I don't know if it's possible. Yeah. This is original sin. Can we go back to, you're talking about you know, it's like when you're a kid and you wonder what it would be like to be in a zero gravity environment. Right. Right. But it, it's not that, I feel like at some point, like it's not that hard that the truth leaks out of you in spite of yourself. Maybe you don't get it. Maybe you just don't get to enjoy it. Right. Maybe that's the, the great curse. I think I read some essay by Alistair Crowley. That's this very esoteric essay where he's talking about the holy grail and how the moment you drink from the holy grail, you no longer care about what the grail gives to you. It's the only time you care about the thing is prior to it. The moment you have it, it's no longer an issue. Right. You're just sort of like, so there's nothing to be gained. Oh that. Oh that. I already knew that. Yeah. It's still, it's like, you know, futuristic Japanese video game arcade. You go into the video game arcade, somebody says, great game, human life, 70 you'll be, you'll be, you'll think you're in there for 70 years. You're, you're going to come out of it. The moment that you're in it, you won't remember that you're in a Japanese video game arcade. You'll just think that you're a living thing. But right now, if I told you, David, we just got drunk in Japan. It was a really fun video arcade. You wanted to be a human. You're in the midst of this game right now. Everyone that you know is a digital fabrication of some deeper part of yourself. It might drive you insane. Right. But the moment we take the device off your head and you come to your true identity as a being in the Japanese video game arcade, you're like, oh yeah, it's a pretty cool game. Yeah, yeah. Let's play something else. Kind of boring. Do they have Gallagher? Because that, that shit's killer. I love Gallagher, man. That shit's cute. David, I love you. I love you too, Duncan. It's been too long, man. Too long. Thank you so much. Where can people find you? DavidStuartMcLean.com. The book comes out January 14th, 2014. Well, yeah, we'll have you back on. Oh yeah. We. With the blue room. Yeah. So, um, great. The book comes out in January. Too bad. No one's going to read that. That's when the new Xbox comes out. I know. I know. It's just, and you know, the demons are coming. It's just terrible. It's, it's, you know, you know, when, when they pushed back my publication date past December 21st of last year, I was like, great. Now the apocalypse. Like I wrote a book and now it's, now the apocalypse is going to come. Thank you, God. Oh my God. I'm listening to the stand, um, the stand. Stephen King's the stand again. And one of the characters, uh, is a, as a singer who had a hit song just before the apocalypse. Oh, great. Yeah. It's great news at some point. He's like, the character realizes like there's no point in even telling people. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Right. Like there are people like running past you, burning. And at some point you're like, but my career, nothing. But are you on Twitter? I am on Twitter. It's at David S. McClain, um, whatever. I'll have these links at dunkintrustle.com. Thank you very much, David. Thank you. Enlightening conversation. Thank you. As always. Thanks for listening everyone. If you enjoyed this podcast, please subscribe to us on iTunes.

You will stay to finish your work as long as need be. As long as need be. On a clear day, I can see my old house and my wife in the front yard talking with a friend. We Gathered in Spring, we Gathered in Spring, we Gathered in Spring, we Gathered in Spring. I'm tired of being here on this hill where I'm sure to find my last meal. No one lives to be 300 years on a clear day. I can't see my old house and my wife in the front yard talking with a friend. We Gathered in Spring, we Gathered in Spring, we Gathered in Spring,
359^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Emil Amos BURNS DOWN THE BARN Transcript and Discussion^2013-10-29^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, my dear friends, and thank you for listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast on this spooky Halloween week, if that's when you happen to be listening to it. For those of you who are catching up in some point in the future, today is October 28th. And we are only a few days away from All Hallows Eve when the veil that separates us from the world of the spirits is the most thin, according to the ancient pagans who were burnt at the cross and burnt at stakes by the patriarchal Europeans who are so terrified of planet Earth and anyone who was remotely connected to the ebbs and floats of the seasons beheaded, tortured, tormented, drowned, ignited, and generally treated like an old piece of pre-beef jerky. But now this holiday, like so many other holidays, has been transformed into a time when we dress in weird costumes and go out and get drunk, not really understanding that Halloween was supposed to symbolize the way our meat bodies are costumes for the eternal soul and that by wearing a costume of some other thing, it's acknowledgment of the fact that all we are is, as Ram Dass says, God in drag, parading around in these stupid, meaty, gristle things and pretending to be a human being who is engaged in some long-running game that we call our career. If you notice any kind of sound difference in this podcast, it's because I am using an Allen and Heath Z10 soundboard that was given to me by Dr. Christopher Ryan, who just mailed it to me, which was very sweet, because I think the sound is probably a million times better than what it was before. But you guys let me know. And if you think it's better and you like it, send Dr. Chris Ryan a nice tweet. This week, I'm doing an experiment. I'm going to release a bonus episode of the Dunkin' Trestle Family Hour podcast, a special, satanic, deeply disturbing, hypnotic, soul-crushing, Halloween episode of this podcast, filled with subliminal messages designed to erode and destroy your mind and your consciousness and probably send you into a spiral that ends with you being possessed by demons. There's going to be appearances by Snake, the top pickup artist in Los Angeles, as well as Alpha Dunkin, which is the version of me that happens when I get the right amount of testosterone. I stop talking like a raspy lesbian smoker, and my voice drops, and I turn into a real asshole. Time of Jesus would carry away babies and the excitement of being on the verge of devouring a little Middle Eastern baby in the time of Jehovah would cause the bottom parts of the pterodactyl wings to secrete a softening gel. And that softening gel is exactly what the folks at Sure Design T-shirts use. They have an entire barn filled with resurrected pterodactyls and babies. And in the morning, they send the babies crawling out into the hay. And one by one, these beautiful creatures with these noble wingspans come flying down and pierce their razor sharp beaks right through the backs of these little babies and fly them up into the top of the barn where they have their various roosts. And they rip the baby to shreds and feed its bits and pieces to their young pterodactyl totes. And that's what causes the wings to secrete the gel. After the wings secrete the gel, the folks at Sure Design T-shirts shoot the pterodactyls with a tranquilizer dart. They wipe the gel up and they put that in their T-shirts spinning machines, and that's what makes these shirts so goddamn soft. Check them out at SureDesignT-shirts.com. If you put my name in, you get 10% off. We are also sponsored by Audible.com. If you go to AudibleTrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership, you get a free audio book. I just downloaded an audio book, which I'm sure you'll hear me rambling about for the next seven million years by Pima Children on Love. And it's blowing my mind. Normally this audio book, if you buy it, I think it costs like a hundred bucks or something insane like that. But if you use an Audible credit, you get it for free. And it's basically like a 36, it's 36 hours recorded in a monastery at a meditation retreat. And it's one of the most profound and simple explanations of what Buddhism is and the effects of meditation and various practices you can use to try to attain a state of equanimity or loving kindness. So anyway, go to AudibleTrial.com forward slash family hour. If you sign up for a trial membership, you get a free audio book, you can cancel the trial membership, you won't be charged, you get to keep the book. How awesome. Also, we're sponsored by Amazon.com. We have an Amazon.com portal located at DuncanTrustle.com. The next time you're gonna buy something through Amazon, and my God, I've been going crazy on Amazon. I have purchased recently a dog bed, a Halloween costume that makes it look like I'm riding an ostrich. I've bought books from Amazon.com, also toilet paper and some shampoo. Because I don't like going to Target. I don't like it. For those of you who love going to Target and like being around children, having seizures that are induced by the weird flickering strobe light, lighting at Target or even more by the probably deep instinctual realization that this is what they have to look forward to as they continue to suck oxygen into the poor little bodies and mutate into twisted adults who devour the world like locusts, spraying out form and then purchasing it from each other, even pretending that the form makes them happy when in fact it only drives them into deeper and deeper states of misery until they find themselves on their deathbed staring up at the ceiling, angry at everything and not aware of the fact that inside of them was the splinter that was making them sick the entire time and that if only they'd spent five minutes looking inside of themselves, they would have realized that they could have existed in a state of nirvanic bliss instead of constantly being terrified and angry. Maybe that's why the babies have seizures at Target. Regardless, I don't like going there and Amazon.com is a wonderful way for you to avoid making that awful pilgrimage of materialism down to the place that vomits out plastic into the households of so many Americans who are confused over why they don't feel good today. Finally, thank you so much to all of you who have been donating to the podcast and to those of you who've been buying t-shirts from the store, we've got a lot of t-shirts and posters and stickers for sale there and that's another way that you can support this podcast. But what you're doing right now is the ultimate way to support it which is just to listen to the podcast and to download it and to subscribe on iTunes or to get it in whatever way that you happen to be getting this thing. So thank you, one and all. Happy Halloween, don't drive drunk, seriously. I know that's a fucking shitty, stuffy adult thing to say but I don't want anyone who listens to this podcast to get a goddamn DUI this week. Such a fucking waste of time. All you have to do is get a cab, get a friend to drive you to wherever you're going to drink. Don't drink. Of course you're not gonna get so drunk that you run over a bunch of kids in skeleton costumes. Of course you're not gonna get so drunk that you fall asleep at the wheel and allow your car to go plowing into some Halloween spook house, massacring a group of idiots who think that it's fun to walk around a maze and have gang bangers dressed as skeletons jump out at them. Of course that's not gonna happen. More than likely what's gonna happen is you're gonna have a couple of beers, maybe three, get in your car, make the wrong, did not turn your light on and get a fucking $6,000 fine for absolutely nothing. So don't do that. Don't do it, ride with a friend and get fucked up. Get a cab, throw up in the cab. It'll still be less expensive than your stupid DUI that you got. I want my little babies to be safe, that's all. Okay everybody, now please open your heart shockers, send your Halloween love sprays in the direction of my sweet dear friend, Emel Amos. If you wanna find out more about Emel, you can go to his website, which is going to be local, the link will be at dunkitrustle.com as well as links to his Twitter account, as well as links to his music because he is one of the most talented musicians that I know and probably the smartest person I know. Outside of my dog, I don't mean that as an insult either. My dog is so emotionally intelligent. What am I saying? Anyway, he's a beautiful friend of mine. This is I think his fourth appearance on this podcast, but this one is a real barn burner. So please take some deep breaths, put down the baggage, dilate your heart shockers and let Emel Amos come flying in on the back of a pterodactyl. Emel Amos, everybody, Emel Amos. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Dunkin' Trussell family. Dunkin' Trussell, Dunkin' Trussell, Dunkin' Trussell. Hello, Emel, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast. I'm prepared. Bring it, give us a jewel of wisdom, some bit of knowledge to transform the world. I've got nothing today. I was actually thinking we could listen to a song that we made in college and then maybe that would jolt some inspiration. Oh, I wanna, do I have that? Can you email it to me or can you play it from your side? I'll send it to you right now. We'll stop and then we'll start again. Awesome. All right, we're back. Here you guys go. I didn't even know that this treat was gonna happen today. I'm very excited. What you're about to hear is, as far as I know, it's never been heard before. This is one of the only musical endeavors that I ever went on with Emel and it's called Alter in the Woods. I've never been to church before. Here we go. I've never been to church like this before. All the candles are black. The smell of incense burns my bones. I was young and she was old. I can't tell if your thoughts are real on your neck. The sign of the seventh seal on your breath and the taste of nutritious sweets from your loins. An incredible heat that's holding soul and that's the stuff of the east. I gotta tell you now, she's mountain water. She talked back so I shudder and I grew up now. She wouldn't wear what I bought her. And now I'm runnin' scared on the couch. I was a water tiger, a beast of a wolf. I'd never imagined that those lost onto my wrist and I could be away. To the Alter in the Woods where she would put her feet to the Alter in the Woods. To the Alter in the Woods. To the Alter in the Woods. To the Alter in the Woods where she'd put her feet to the Alter in the Woods. [?]. Wow. I love that. You don't remember making it, though, huh? Yeah, I do. I kind of remember, like, scaring myself. You know, when I would hang out with you and, like, only my closest friends, I think a way that I know I'm really, really close friends with somebody is that, like, sometimes I'll scare myself by hanging out with them, like, you know, like, it's some weird way. Because I remember, like, something about, even though the song was funny, it was scary to me for some reason. It was just weird, you know, like, maybe sometimes you don't even mean to when you're making something, but you'll hit this resonance that's creepy, this creepy resonance that I really love. Yeah, it's, uh, you're dealing with a lot of, when you make something, like, it could be a comedy short, it could be anything. You have something in your mind that you would, you imagine, meaning it's not fully formed, it's this platonic beginning of something, and then, as you're making it, it's a very, very, very rare, but there are moments when you touch something and you look at the screen and you hear something at the same time and you wonder, uh, who, who, how did that happen? It, it's happening in a, in a dimension that's not, that I'm not controlling, but more than that, it's happening in another dimension that is already fully formed, and I didn't even understand it or intend for it, and I've reached through a wall, an oracle, and somehow formed a relationship with a frequency or something, and it has nothing really to do with my will or anything, I just opened myself and it happened, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, another way to put that is like, imagine if people were an ocean that covered the earth, like a secret ocean of flesh, and underneath the ocean was the subconscious mind and whatever else was underneath that, and from time to time, either out of society or out of people, this weird shit swimming under that vast ocean comes bobbing up out of them, you know, and some quick little flash of like, uh, scales under the water, this thing comes out, which is like, what the f- what d- what am I? I'm just a surface thing. I'm just fleshy waves, and every once in a while some weird thing comes up out of me and then goes away again, and that is a- we talk about that a lot sometimes. We talk about that a lot sometimes. We talk about that sometimes, but I love to think about that idea, that concept, and I love to think about the idea- the idea of completely surrendering to that thing so that you don't even exist as a wave anymore. That's- that's interesting that you would sort of identify it with- with the feeling of fear too, because when you're young, I think you're- you're very in touch with some need to chase the fear feeling, you know, which has a lot to do with like, when you're dosing, you know, some acid or something, like you're chasing- you want to put yourself in a vulnerable position. Now, why you have that appetite then, I guess is obvious because you've been oppressed, like being young, just- you've been waiting for so long to fucking live, but like, after that phase, we generally- as we grow older, we- I could be wrong, but it seems like we often kind of lose the hunger for that- for the fear vulnerability, and we kind of shut down the shop a little and stick with what we know. I don't know if that's necessarily true across the board, but chasing that fear feeling in light of what we're talking about right now too is a very essential part of making yourself vulnerable into art or wanting to discover, you know, something. Yeah, yeah, chasing that fear feeling is something that- and it is exact like culture, a lot of society and a lot of relationships are designed to go in the opposite direction of that fear feeling. It's designed to get as far away from that feeling as you possibly can, and that's when somebody turns into an adult, and that is one of the most hilarious things to watch when you come upon an adult. You know, someone who considers themselves to be the height of sophistication somehow or like, you know, like the idea of like, this is the apex of the evolution of your lifespan is somehow right here in your 30s, maybe your 40s, as you're raising a child, this is it, figured it all out now, and when in the reality, all you're seeing is this kind of like, pathetic, hardened crust, you know, that's just, they've decided like, well, this is, I'm just gonna be fine with this thing that I've gelled into here, and I'm not gonna change, this is what I'm like, this is me, you know. But really, I mean, aren't they just the shell of their former dumbassery anyway? I mean, it's not like there was, was there really like... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let's let this weird solar... Hang on, say that again, this fucking Skype, you just went into robot mode, it sounded awesome, but no one will understand it, it sounded like Pink Floyd. Actually, what, so this is, since this is so like, we're actually making sense, why don't you double check and make sure the shit is actually working? There's no way we're gonna say that shit again. Hold on, so I mean, the question is, like, was there ever a time, is there ever a time in a human's life where they achieve some kind of realization and then fall from that? You know, we're talking the prodigal son story here, which is that you go away from your father's house, wander the world, become a depraved piece of shit, come back and you're embraced and accepted, regardless of the fact that you just went rampaging through every whorehouse on the planet, lied, cheated, stole. And this is that, you know, the other day, as I was like allowing myself to get super stoned and thinking about that cliche statement that Charles Manson made a beautiful song about called Home is Where the Heart Is. And I'm like sitting there, you know, because whenever I've heard that, I've always externalized that idea, like, okay, I guess that means like, wherever your love is that's home, you know? And then I was thinking like, oh, no, that's not what it means at all. It literally means that your heart chakra or that place inside of you where feelings happen is your home and that so many people are desperately trying to escape from being in that place. And the story of the prodigal son is the story of a person who's like numbed down for their whole lives and then returns back to the heart center and begins to experience that insane feeling of bliss that comes from realizing that you get to live again and that your period of numbness was just a preparation for you to really get the inheritance that was yours from the beginning of time. And that inheritance is the inheritance of nirvanic bliss, enlightenment, or waking up to your true identity. I think adults are funny, but I mean, when is a human being not funny? I mean, there's always a pathetic frequency, you know, in a human being. I mean, because what is, how could this animal who has learned to talk, how could they possibly know that much? What do they know? They don't know shit, you know? And so it's entertaining. It's fucking, you can walk out on the sidewalk right now and have a blast if you achieve the right perspective and just observing people being confident about their knowledge. I mean, it's one of the great forms of entertainment, I think, in the modern world. I mean, anytime anybody's got confidence, it's pretty hilarious. It is a, when you get around, you know, this is that idea like once a year in villages, I guess, back when people are much crueler, they would allow the dumbest person in the village to be the king for the day. Like, probably this person was like a disabled person and so they would like put a crown on the person and like, whatever you want, we shall do. And the dumbass would like get all puffed up and like, you know, start ordering people around and, you know, at the end of the day, he returned back to his idiot state, completely now humiliated by the fact that, you know, he allowed himself to turn into a monster during that period of being a king. And it's that sort of the eastbound and down story. If you ever watch eastbound and down, which is an amazing show on HBO, the character Kenny Powers is constantly going through phases of being ruined and experiencing some form of humility in that state of ruination. But the moment any kind of success comes, he immediately turns into the biggest asshole on earth. You know, so it's like, yeah, I know what you mean. This idea of confidence that comes from a silly idea that, because you know facts, you know anything. You know facts. You've studied your whole life and now you know all these facts. Or whatever the thing is that you think you've figured out. That's not you at all. That's why in Hinduism and Buddhism and all these eastern traditions, even Christianity, there's this can, always going back to the idea of blindness. You know that blindness, that you're blind. You're blind as a fucking bat. You can know everything. And all you know is the folds in the blindfold wrapped around your true self. It doesn't matter. Language, math, wisdom of the ages is nothing more than a blindfold wrapped around what you really are. And that's a wild thing to start figuring out. And also it's a big fucking relief, man. It's a big fucking relief. Yeah. I mean after we emphasize the infinite stupidity of human beings that you have to, I guess you have to reemphasize the fact that because you are technically everything and come from everything and are related to everything and are made of stardust and whatever cliche you want to say, you also know everything too. But it lies within a layer of instinctuality that is almost impossible to access directly. So you have to be yourself and you have to let your, this inner implicit knowledge sort of guide you, which is, I mean, why do you think people go to therapy and read Buddhist books? Because they're trying to re-engage and let their egos stop talking so loudly and misfiring, you know? Yeah. Well, they sense it. What's really beautiful about Buddhism and beautiful about this spirituality is that it's a trap. And it uses your ego to lure you into the trap. But it kills your ego in the trap. Somewhere along, as you go diving into the thing, your ego gets executed. And that's what's awesome about it, is that somehow someone lucked up and got enlightened. I guess that person's supposed to be Buddha, but I think there's, I imagine it's a much bigger thing than that. But somebody, I guess someone got, it's the same thing as like, well, you know, why did the universe start by itself? And the same way you think, well, how did someone get enlightened without the help of other enlightened people? Who is the first person to really wake up? The point is, somebody did it. And then they left all these fucking traps everywhere. That's a really, that's a funny point, you know, because it's like, the concept of enlightenment, would it exist if it had to have been invented? It doesn't seem like it would. Like, if you were a miserable race, like, drudging across the surface of the earth, would someone invent the concept of enlightenment? It doesn't seem like there would be any purpose for it, but the concept of one person sitting under a tree and then glimpsing the idea that you could kind of align with an eternal, well, this is not the technical definition, but like an eternal form of happiness, an understanding of a union with the universe. That sounds like something that some actually happened to somebody, you know, and then they tried to communicate it to other people, which I imagine would have been an incredibly hard thing to do. So they gave it a name, and the name doesn't necessarily mean you stay enlightened, necessarily, and then that's where the myth and some of the problems come in. But I like that idea that somebody actually experienced this thing and then tried to talk about, preach a gospel of it, because I can't see people inventing it in the sense that you, you know, the old saying that you'd have to invent God or something like that. Well, I think it was some kind of alien contact. That's my theory. It's kind of, it's like, you know, that New Agers always talk about, like, they have crazy fucking ways to explain this sort of like cosmic, you know, alien intelligence that exists in the world. But I do think it was like one of the first contacts that we had with an alien intelligence, and it just manifests in the form of religion. But it's some kind of like, whenever, you know, the more you like really start getting into this stuff, the more you realize, oh, I'm in the presence of something a million times more sophisticated than an iPhone. This is something that humans worked on for thousands and thousands of years intentionally or unintentionally, and somewhere along that line, during that process, someone completely opened up to that thing that we were talking about earlier, and they became that thing. And then that thing is that what they, everything they say after becoming that thing is the sort of magmatic expulsion of eternity into the finite, and that's what Scripture is. And then people spend their time trying to understand that and study it, and that's what religion is. And then in the process of studying it, and the reason you start studying it is because you are an egotistical shithead, and you pretend that you're pious and holy, and you want to be special, you want to get laid, you want to be more special than the materialist. That's why a lot of people get into this shit. I don't think many people really get into this because they're like, oh, I feel called to the light. They think that's what it is, they're pretending that's what it is, but it's no different than somebody who puts those dumb corks in their ear. It's like they want to differentiate. And then in the process of differentiating, all of a sudden this trap has been set. And now all of a sudden you start, things inside of you start getting pointed out, and the process of meditation suddenly you start seeing things inside of you that are un-fucking-deniable. And now that you've seen it, you can't not, you can't unsee it. You can try, and you might sink back down into anger and illusion, but all of a sudden there it is again. Look at it, man. There it is. That giant iceberg of hate and anger floating inside of you that you've been ignoring your whole life. There it is. There it is again. Look at the way you're acting. There it is. It's the anger. It's the anger. And the more you realize that, then all of a sudden that's when you get locked into the thing. You get locked in. You get sucked in. By the time you realize you're sucked in, it's too late. You can't get back out. And that's spirituality. Because you just sit and fester in it, or you get dissolved into the thing. And that's fucking beautiful. But it's very funny because a very intelligent person set these traps. And the traps were set for really, really, really egotistical people, really egotistical and sick people. Because only the sickest, most egotistical people try to become enlightened. I agree that it's a set of training wheels or something. And then one day, you're supposed to put them away. You know what I mean? Well, you just sort of, you like, yeah. I mean, I don't know what you fucking do, man. I don't know. I don't know what you do. But the more you sort of play around with this stuff, the more you realize, all of a sudden, you start seeing these changes happen to you. It's like, oh shit, what the fuck? My house is now always clean. And then in my whole life, my house has been messy. Or I don't want to drink anymore. You know what I mean? It's not like I'm not drinking because I'm keeping myself from drinking. I don't want to drink because when I drink, it makes it so that I'm unable to experience this intense fucking thing that's happening to me. So now you're not drinking for real. And then all of a sudden, you start thinking about other stuff too. And then you realize, oh my fucking God, where does this end? Where does this fucking end? Am I going to end up in a monastery? Where does this fucking end? And that's where it gets really cool. And I think that's where it gets really exciting. Where you realize, oh great, you know what I just fucking did? I just drove my car into a black hole. There's no way out, event horizon. You're stuck in the swirl of the fucking thing. And the really funny thing is that everyone's stuck in the swirl. They just don't realize it. So they spend their whole lives pretending that they're outside the gravity of this inevitability. And apparently you get to spend infinite incarnations pretending to not be this thing, not be the emptiness, you know? Not be the void or whatever it is. Whatever it is. Who the fuck knows? I don't know what it is. I have no idea what it is, but I do love this exercise I've been doing where you remove the storyline from the way you feel. It is so psychedelic, man. It is so psychedelic. So it's like suddenly the next time you feel angry, that classic feeling. It's a classic feeling. The next time you feel angry, don't think about what made you angry. Just be with a feeling. And you will start getting your fucking mind blown, man. Because it's like all of a sudden now that feeling is so familiar. And you've been pretending all your life that that feeling is a result of people suck, man. These fucking bitches always fuck me over. Man, I can never catch a break. And you're pretending that those externals are the reason that this feeling is inside of you. And when you stop doing that and you realize like, oh my fucking god, I'm just anger. I have this crust of anger stuck inside of me. And any time that something happens outside of my expectations, I allow myself to fully experience this thing that is deeply embedded in me. And then I blame the external event as the cause of the thing, as though the thing weren't in me all the time. As though it were being injected into me by the outside world. So when you begin to realize like, no, this shit isn't being injected into you. It's you and you're injecting it into the world. And once you start realizing that, that's fucking, man, that is very psychedelic. Very psychedelic. Because now you're just dealing with the truth, which is that you are probably an anxiety-ridden, sad, angry, controlling, egotistical dick. And nothing in the world is causing that. Deterministically, do you think that you were engineered this way? When you take responsibility for yourself and you look at your brother and you look at your girlfriend and you hang out with a more, maybe a more well-adjusted person and then a less well-adjusted person, do you look in the mirror after a long day and feel like you did this to yourself or you were designed this way? Well, I mean, it's like back in the day, people didn't take showers. And they didn't take showers because they didn't understand that that was a healthy thing to do. And these days, in the same way, people don't look at the way that they try to avoid going into the way they feel. And that's what all the ego-defense mechanisms are that most people think is who they are. So I don't know, man. I think ultimately it is everyone's fault in the sense that there's... If you're sitting in a cage and the door's wide open and you don't go out of the cage, but you're always moaning that you're a prisoner, it's your fault. It seems like everything's right there in front of you, especially these days. And I can look at in this incarnation, like, okay, I know what happened, kind of. And it's weird because it comes from the more you fucking... I can't quit saying fucking when I'm talking about meditation. The more you open yourself up, the more you will see reasons that you got to be the way you are. Like, I can look and see, like, okay, well, I had a brother and I had a mom who tended to, like, be angry at one of us and love the other one all the time, and that would kind of jump back and forth. So what did that do to me? That made me competitive with other guys. It made me jealous, and it made me sort of, like, very scared. It made it hard for me to really accept love from people without thinking there was some condition behind it or, you know, feeling that was going to go away. Do you think it's within your willpower to move yourself beyond those patterns of thinking, or do you think that's just a destiny that will happen to you or not? Yeah, well, like, you have a boat and the rudder has a chip in it, and so the boat lists from one way to one way or the other. So you correct for the broken rudder, but this is the question is, can you change your karma? And the, I don't know the answer, the traditional answer to that, but I do think that you can, what you can start, so now what I can do or what I've been working with is, like, so I'll be, you know, I'll find myself suddenly feeling jealous or I'll find myself feeling scared or I'll find myself feeling, like, unloved or needy. You know, for example, like, I've noticed that I don't want to have sex to come. I want to have sex because it makes me feel like the person I'm with loves me. And so then all of a sudden I realize that the reason I might get really fucking hurt or upset or weird if I don't get to have sex when I want to is not because I want to come, it's because I have this insane neediness. And for whatever reason, my ego has decided that the ultimate affirmation of someone loving you is to fuck you. You know, and so that's what that creates these neuroses and really the embarrassing behavior patterns. So what ends up happening is you start seeing those structures inside of you and instead of, so when they emerge and that it's always a familiar ache, the thing that's creating your life and if there's negative aspects of your life, the thing that creates that, the DNA that creates that, what do they call it, mitochondria? Is that what spins DNA? The thing that spins out your life, it has a feeling tone with it and the negative parts of your life are coming from this familiar anger or dull ache or fear or whatever the thing is. And the threads that come out in the form of phenomena that you're creating, those threads are coming out because of your reaction. They're your action, they're your reaction to impulses and then when that reaction comes, you go into these behavior patterns or you say things that create more of the same pattern that you think is just the way life is when it isn't at all. So what happens is you feel the pain and then you don't react. So now when you're feeling that familiar anger, jealousy, betrayal, whatever the thing is that if you really honestly appraise your life, you realize you've been feeling this with every woman you've been with since you were with women or you realize you felt like this with every friend that you've ever had or with every job or boss or power, authoritarian figure, whatever the fucking thing it is that's triggering you, you realize you've always had that in you. So you just stop, you stop reacting. So now when that fucking thing comes up, you don't do anything. It's really weird. Those familiar fights just go away. The fights go away. Life changes. Do you think you've become more humble over the past, you know, we haven't lived together for 15 years, so do you think you've become more humble over that time and do you think that it's directly correlated with becoming less anxious in a way or what do you think? Oh, I'm definitely not less anxious. No, I feel, I mean, I'm just more aware of the, you know, the invitation is to just be very honest with yourself and be very honest about, and this is in Buddhism, this is in, William Trumpa talks about this, Pima Chodron talks about this, Neem Kareli Baba advised this sort of full acceptance of who you are. Alistair Crowley talked about the importance of writing down everything that you are and fully just bravely accepting like, oh, you know what? I'm probably a little bit of an alcoholic. And when I drink, I kind of turn into an asshole and I want to be important. And I think I know stuff when I don't know anything at all. And when I'm around guys, I tend to be more edgy because I'm afraid of losing control or power to them. Like you just like go through the whole embarrassing list, you know, like you go through every fucking thing, man. And then all of a sudden what ends up happening is that every time you accept this piece of yourself, you free yourself from its influence in a small way. By accepting it, you shine the light on it and you throw dust on the invisible man. And so now it can't trick you because you see, oh, okay, I know what this is. And I know what this is. Oh, here I am jealous. Here I am being a competitive dick. Here I am trying to one up somebody. Here I am trying to win. Goes on and on and on and on. And those little, when you start becoming mindful of those things, you don't even have to change it. You just watch yourself do it and it's embarrassing because now you're fully seeing the way you've been acting your entire life, but you've been pretending you're not like that at all. It's really fun. I mean, you seem like a very well adjusted, honest person. It's clear that at some point you accepted yourself the way that you are. You don't seem to be really hiding from yourself, Emil. Growing up, I always had more extreme versions of dysfunction around me. Just enough, I guess, like friends that just, they just couldn't stay between the lines. Whereas I guess I could be, you know, I could blend in and kind of get away with being a selfish asshole enough of the time that I could kind of, I could learn from their mistakes, you know, to some degree. I think, I don't know what it was like for you, but I had friends that went off the rails and, you know, lost their minds and they're now like, probably what somebody considers the retarded guy that bags the groceries at the local grocery store. I mean, my best friends, you know, some of them became that guy, you know, and I always thought I would be the worst. I always thought, you know, but something along the way ended up being healthy. Something inside me ended up just being, I don't know, it's like an equilibrium was there. I just didn't know why or where it came from. It may have came from the fact that my mother treated me so well. That's the only thing I can even really say is that she gave her life, you know, to make my life comfortable and, you know, make, you know, she wanted me, genuinely wanted me to be a happy person. So that's the only thing I can think that put me on the right track because, I mean, there was a lot of other temptations, you know, to do wrong or something. So I really don't know why it happened. But yeah, I didn't, I always thought growing up, you know, did you ever have the thoughts like you were definitely going to like kill someone or do something absolutely horrible? You ever have like, I mean, maybe at age 11 or something, you just got a boiling sense of guilt coming from some part of your brain where you just, I think you're just discovering your own individuality and you sort of like the weight of being a person in society is starting to dawn on you and you just, you figure you're a horribly ugly thing and like, you just start to think, well, someday I'm going to do something really bad because you're starting to get in touch maybe with really angry, bitter feelings or who knows. But I remember thinking that. I don't know. Did you ever have those kinds of thoughts? Yeah. Really, they only came like, not when I was like, I can remember being on acid and contemplating like doing awful things and like, realizing like, I could do that. I'm capable of doing that. But yeah, I never, I don't think I recall ever thinking I would be a criminal. I kind of romantically thought that I had that romantic desire to die when I was 30. You know, when I was very young, because young people, the one of the most dreadful things to think about is the inevitability of you getting old. So the way out is like, I'll just die on drugs when I'm 30, you know, to try to save yourself from that, from getting old. I think I might be, I think I might be talking about like an early, an early realization that you, that you yourself are capable of doing something extremely horrible. And maybe you're not sure if you would care, like, or feel bad. That's, yeah, right. You don't know. Hold on, hold on. And you're probably, you're probably incredibly wrong. I mean, it's kind of the... Go ahead. So it's just, you're probably incredibly wrong, but as part of this, it's related to that fear following thing too. It's like you're, you want to do some sort of dance with the dark side because you're starting to perceive it and there's nothing wrong with any of that. But I do, I think my dad had like an extremely lawless spirit, you know, like he was part animal. Like he, I used to get a vision of him. I don't know when this was. I think it was early 2000s. I like had a daydream where I could see a vision of him like kneeling over a body and eating, eating a person. Wow. And it was like this visual realization that I don't think my dad would have a fucking problem with that. I really, I don't think he would have an issue with that. He was somehow in touch with the part of animal life where you have to do that sometimes. And I don't, I don't think he would have a single regret. I remember him laughing about people who he knew that it died, you know, choked on a cheeseburger. And he was like, I'm so glad that motherfucker is dead and big, a big fucking laugh, you know. Yeah. And you know, you're eight and you're sitting there in Burger King listening to this shit. And you're just like, I don't, I had to constantly define myself as like, am I like this or am I different? You know, am I more like my mom? Like, would I, would I murder a person and eat them? It was like a thread in my mind as I was growing up. Maybe I didn't have a normal upbringing in that way. I'm not sure. That's an intense thing to be around that level of numbness. And especially when it's coming from your father, you got to be pretty numbed down to get like that. Dude, I am not talking about numbness. Like, I'm not talking about callousness. Like, oh, he is, you know, inconsciable or like he like ate somebody and didn't, didn't understand them as a person. I'm talking about a higher level of consciousness where like, you know, like maybe that's part of life and you've integrated. Right. I keep Shiva that I can't, you know, maybe I couldn't get to. I mean, it's also a lower level. It's definitely like Carl Jung was always accused of mixing, you know, pre-conventional thought and post-conventional thought. It's definitely a place where you go where you're running a red light in the middle of traffic in the wilderness. You know, and on one hand you're doing it for selfish reasons because you just want to hurry home. And on one hand you're like, philosophically, there's no one around. Everybody's safe. I don't need to follow this rule. But there's a place where those two things blend together, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. No, it does make sense. It does make sense. It's that incredible fucking verse in the Bhagavad Gita where Krishna is talking about how he's already eaten everyone on the battlefield. You know, it's like that idea of the, you know, the part of the universe that is the grinder. You know, the part of the universe that grinds down, destroys and turns things into dust. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if a human can really embody that. And I don't know. I can, we want, okay, I guess the idea is you would want that kind of person to be numb. You wouldn't want to think that that person had opened up to this greater realization and through that was sort of purifying the destructive nature. I don't know. It's hard to say, man. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea. I tend to hurt people the most when I'm feeling the least. So when I'm particularly numb and I'm really pretending to be a person, that's when I really like damage people. But when I'm feeling happy or I'm feeling sad or I'm feeling anything outside of maybe anger, then I'm a little more compassionate and empathetic with people. But in a very numb way, I think that that's one of the cool things about really being honest with yourself is a lot of times people think, okay, well, I'm just going to be honest with myself. And then they pretend to feel something when really it's good to be honest with yourself and say, I don't feel anything. I just feel numb. I feel nothing. I don't feel a thing at all. That's pretty cool, man. That's a cool thing to like, to admit that you're doing. You know, when you're like fake laughing or whatever, fake smiling, fake kissing, fake touching, fake being a good friend, fake being a good mother, fake loving, all that stuff. It's good to just admit like, okay, okay, I'm faking this. I'm faking it. I am faking the fuck out of this. I'm like a bad actor in a shitty movie right now. And I'm pretending to be this thing. And then it's like, well, what the fuck am I if I'm pretending to be this? You know, what is underneath the numbness? I don't know. I have no fucking idea. Oh, that's maybe where we're all in the same boat. I mean, we're all just wandering into an endless horizon of confusion constantly. I mean, that's one thing I could walk out on sidewalk right now and grab any person that I may disagree with everything about and completely hate. But ultimately, we're in the same boat because we don't really know what the fuck we're, we don't know exactly why the fuck we're doing what we're doing. Yes, right, right. And it's because this is like an exercise I've been doing and I like and it came about because of the Oculus Rift, this VR, these VR goggles I have. And like you put them on and now you're in another reality. You look around and it's like, if you look down, you see a little digital video game ground. You look up, you see the video game sky tricks you to feel like you're in another world. But it's a really low level form of trickery, which makes it a great spiritual tool because you take the fucking thing off. And it's like, okay, well now I'm back in my own reality. But then the exercise I've been doing is like, okay, let's imagine that this is goggles, this whole thing that I call existence. I'm wearing goggles. I'm being tricked. Every feeling I have, everything that I see, everything that I hear, it's a blindfold. And then it's, then you start thinking, all right, what is there that isn't the blindfold? If everything I can experience and everything I feel and everything I think and everything that I see is a blindfold, then what else is there? What am I really if that was all a blindfold? What would be left? It's really trippy and fun to do because it's like, oh fuck, man, I get it. You know, this human life is a scab on the universe. It's scabbed over some bigger thing, but I've decided that I'm the fucking scab for some reason. I love this whole idea you're talking to me about last night too. But this whole idea of, you know, that you remove yourself from the context in a contentious situation. You remove yourself from the context and you look at yourself and just acknowledge that the entire emotional phenomena that's going on is within inside you. But I can't imagine how you're supposed to, like, let other people know that they're doing that because they would just hit you in the face if you said. You don't. You don't let them know. Of course, of course, but it would be nice. It would be nice, but it doesn't, again, your desire to tell other people that they're doing it is, again, falling into this delusion that we're all into. So it's like the reason you want to tell another person they're doing it quite often, or when you see someone really explode in anger or whatever is it. Basically, you just realize that everything is triggering me. I'm just being triggered now. Like, man, I could tell you, like, this is why it's great to have a girlfriend and be as a spiritual practice. Because it's like you, if you're a neurotic person, then it might be hard for you to have relationships. It is for me. So it's like, but most of my relationships have been completely subconscious and completely instinctual. So, like, I'll get mad and I'll feel justified in the anger or I'll be sad and feel like I was wronged. You know, all these things that really, what all that's happening is I'm going through this slideshow that I've been going through for my whole life. And the slideshow is the various low-level emotions that I've decided are me. When, in fact, they're not me at all, any more than staring at a cloud as you. So it's like, you let these fucking, these emotions, what's great about being in a relationship, having a kid too, or living with anyone, or any kind of thing that involves interaction, is you get triggered. And so what, generally, if you aren't aware of the fact that you have this thing inside of you already, when you get triggered, you try to change the other person. And that is the deluge. That is continuing the endless process, this endless dance or this endless collaboration with the world to stay miserable. And so when you stop doing that and you're like, all right, man, I'm just gonna, you know what, I'm gonna let my girlfriend be exactly the way she is. For the first time. I'm not gonna try, I'm not gonna try to change her if I can help it. You, a lot of times, you can't help it. You're still gonna react. You're gonna react. But like, you start not reacting at all. Not being, and that doesn't mean like being numb or anything like that. It's just that now when the feelings come up, like I can, now I know there is a feeling that I get. And the feeling is that, is anger. And it has a lot of different flavors. But it's generally underneath all the flavoring, it's still this core of anger. And so whenever I feel that feeling, there will be a thing that my, that my instincts tell me to do. Like to pun, usually it involves punishing a person. So like, I'll feel angry, someone's done me wrong. And then I'll be like, okay, well, I'm gonna act like I'm not punishing this person, but I'm gonna make it so that the thing that they did wrong to me is going to cause them some pain too. And I'll come up with a clever way to do that. And that's my pattern, punishing revenge, vengeance patterns. So it's like, what you do is you feel the anger, let's say for example, somebody stands you up. They were supposed to meet you for coffee, a friend of yours or something. And you go to meet them for, this didn't happen to me, I'm just making it up. But you go to meet them for coffee and they don't show up because their car broke down or who knows what, maybe something happened where they had to go to attend to an appointment or something. Let me actually bring it to something even more real world. You're sitting and eating with someone and they check their phone. And you feel like, man, that sucks that they're checking their phone in the middle of this conversation that we had. You know what, I'm gonna check my phone to show them, you know, or something like that. Like they did something wrong. Now I'm gonna do something wrong. They did something I think is wrong. Now I'll reciprocate. You stop reciprocating. So you just don't do that. You just don't do that. No more vengeance. You're not getting revenge on the world anymore. It's really interesting what happens, man. Everything changes. Everything starts shifting in weird fucking ways. It's very fascinating, man. It's a very fascinating thing because you, you know, that you really do begin to redefine yourself when that stuff starts happening. And so it's just weird. It's very psychedelic. It's very intense. I definitely am guilty of letting people be who they are almost to a bad extent. But, um, I mean, You think you can, you think that you think that that is a, yeah, that's one of the things that things is cool about you. That's one of the things that I've always liked. I, you know, when you get around a person, you realize like, oh my God, they're not going to try to change me. Yeah, I remember I was sitting in a bar once. I must have been, I don't know, 19 or something. They used to let me into this one. And I remember this one, this one friend of mine who personified sort of the older sort of, you know, Entity that, that really kind of pointed out to me consistently that I was fucking up. He didn't even have to. He just kind of his shadow just sort of like went over me and showed me how stupid I could be sometimes. And I really appreciated that in a way. And I, he said something smirky about me as we're sitting at this table and another friend of mine who was literally, literally a criminal, literally a fucking like on the run criminal stood up and got really mad and like almost pushed the table over and said, You could say anything you want about email, but you know, he will never judge you and he will never try to tell you to change. And I don't think the other guy really got what he was saying because he just was pretty secure in his opinions. But, but it was one time where I kind of felt like no matter who that who that guy was that had proclaimed that, you know, and all the bad things he'd done or how stupid he was or how smart. It's just interesting to have someone actually pay attention to you, you know, notice your qualities and appreciate something about you when, you know, most, most, most of life is just, is just feeling so incredibly alone and not ever feeling like anyone picks up anything and you're just talking to, you know, you know, a brick wall or whatever, but it was kind of an interesting thing. But anyway, my point is I've taken it way, way too far. I've taken Taoism too far. I've like, I think that at some point there might, it might be true that calling people out on something that they're doing is a healthy thing. And I tend to not do that. I always, I tend to just look the other way because I figure that people are karmically set in design. And I don't, I don't feel like I'm the person that is been born that that needs to like explain themselves to them. And I don't, I'm mystified when people try to do it to me. But I realized that we all have these different ways of being honest with each other. I was, I don't know what I was doing, but I like ended up on some like a hip hop producer is like Facebook or something one day. And he was like, clearly a very violent, pretty intense guy. And he was saying something about like, I don't know what the what the the current affair was that week, but he said something like, Listen, this is the way things go when a man when I see a man doing something wrong, you know, and I love that man, especially he, he implied, I beat the fuck out of him. I get the shit out of them. And I teach him what it is to be a man or some some shit. But obviously within his animal like universe, this was this loving, he was trying to say this is this loving act where I'm trying, I'm going to help you become an adult and and and grow into the person that you will eventually be by by sort of benevolently beating the truth into you because you have been an idiot, you have fucked. Yes, this is this is so what you're talking about here is the Old Testament God versus the New Testament God or the evolution of man from where the way that we learned was from being punished by a wrathful jealous God to the way that we learned is by being fully embraced by love. And it's, you know, it's different parenting styles, it's different teaching styles. And, you know, who knows, maybe some people need to be pummeled, I don't know. But like, you know, I know that probably that I know that I experienced the most radical shifts in my personality when I'm loved. Always, when I'm around love, even for my dog, I change, I become less selfish, I become more happy, I tend to try to be like that around other people. When I'm around someone who's trying to repress me or hurt me or change me through pain. Unless it's like a dominatrix I'm paying for, then it's like doesn't do anything to help me. It only makes me feel resentful and like I want to rebel against the person. Well, I got you. And this is this is a very complicated area. I don't think there's really any nice hallmark way that's tie it up and send people on their way with like a positive. But no, I mean, think about when you're like really scolding someone. I'm sure you must have done it before. I don't know. Maybe you never have. Hey, you've must. There are times when you do it. Yeah, there are times when you do it. And for whatever reason, I mean, it's been a long, long time. But like, for whatever reason, there are moments where you feel totally and completely justified. Like, like you finally are being honest with someone sometimes when when you feel like maybe being kind to them has been a dishonest stance. I'm not I'm not even arguing for that. I know what you mean. I know, man. This is like, I don't know. I don't know the answer either. I don't know, man. This is something I wonder about and not but here's you know one thing I do know. I do know that I've spent the better part of my life trying to change people around me. And it doesn't work. It never has worked. It doesn't work. And if it does work, it's a temporary kind of working where really all they're doing is momentarily submitting to me until they can work out an escape plan to get the fuck away from the thing trying to keep them from being who they are. And I know that when I've been around people that just love me or just give me their love for no reason at all, you know, that feeling of like, I mean, it's so fucking cheesy, man. But in Les Miserables, God, have you ever seen you ever read that book? No, but I mean, I'm not I have not been trying to contradict you. I actually, I don't think you have either. I tend to agree too much. I'm trying to I'm thinking of other situations like, for example, this will this will be a good jumping off point. But like, what about your art? Like when someone just says, I love your new this this new thing you're working on. I can totally see that giving you energy, energizing you. But I would say in my life, when people have pointed out the ways I have failed to articulate myself. That's been an equally, if not more, I don't know if it was a loving response, but it's it's helped me more sometimes. It's just something worthy of pointing out. Because I think when you're making art, you're in you're actually in the active attempt to refine yourself. You're you're really trying in life, you know, to make yourself to improve yourself, as opposed to. I don't know, having a nice cup of coffee with someone who's agreeing with everything you're saying, or so you know what I mean. Yeah, so there is a call I'm trying to point out is a complex give and take there are ways in which someone can shoot out negative energy at you that I think definitely more in the long run, you appreciate more than the warm, happy feelings that it just seems worth saying. Yeah, well, I mean, again, it's like, yeah, if they're shooting if it's like the medium is not as important as the message. And if the media, you know, so the person is like, you know, someone can come up to you and say to you, isn't it a nice day. And actually what they said to you was, I think you're a fucking loser shithead. Totally you're now you're getting. Yeah, this is what I meant to say it's just too complex to sew up neatly for people. Well, the so so what what ends up happening when you get around like people who have been working on themselves and are experiencing this sense of coming into their heart or coming into their true identity. They'll get angry at you. Sure, they'll they'll get angry just like anybody else. And maybe they'll say something angry, but there's something underneath it that isn't the same way as when you encounter an angry person who's really asleep and is just trying to lash out at the world. And it's a whole different ball of wax. And also, aside from the whatever energy is coming from behind them when you return back to this thing I was telling you about the Pima children talks about and I think it's an aspect of Tibetan Buddhism which is called compassionate abiding. And so what it is is, regardless of whether or not the person is triggering you with love or triggering you with with their own hate or whatever their shit is, you go back to realizing that you are just being triggered. And this thing that isn't that you're experiencing is not being injected in but it's there all along. So you go back to like every so when what ends up happening is every time you're getting triggered, you've been given this gift by the guru by the real teacher which is the universe that's broken up in all the faces of your friends and lovers and parents and family and dogs and everything. And then here's a gift. I'm letting you see the monster again. And when you start looking at it from that perspective then everyone's just giving you these wonderful gifts. And it's like you don't want, you're not going to be able, you're not going to be able to change them. This is why I just want to say, you say I accept people to almost too much and this is the question is like well won't we be taken advantage of if we stop fighting the great war against the world. And I think the answer is well maybe see what happens. Feel what it's like to really be taken advantage of. When was the last time you really got taken advantage of? Well let it happen. Let it put down. This is why the term surrender keeps coming up. Surrender. Surrender to it. It's a stampede man you're going to get run over. Let yourself get run over. Everyone else is trying to stand up. Well it doesn't work. So it's like all of a sudden it's like you know what man I'm going to let you fucking break my heart. And I'm not going to try to fight that anymore. I'm just going to let my heart get broken by you and I'm going to let my heart get broken by whoever wants to break it. And then now you're in a whole different world because you're not fighting anymore. You're not waging the stupid war against inevitability which is what Buddhism is all about. It's like look man it's not going to last. Accept it. You're not going to stay young. You're not going to stay healthy. You're not going to stay rich. You're not going to stay happy. You're not going to stay sad. You're not going to stay anything because everything's in flux. And that endless war to try to hold things as they are and keep things the way they are make things be the way you think they should be. That is samsara. Delusion. Duka as they call it. Suddenly you stop fighting that war. Now you're in a brand new universe. That's a whole different world. The world where you're not fighting every day. You still feel fucking insane. Maybe you don't eventually but I feel insane. But just the act of removing yourself from constantly trying to retaliate. Turning the cannons off. Shutting down the fortress. Put taking your armor off and just walking out into the troops. Stab me to death I guess. I'm done with this stupid fight. It's fun because you're really dealing with just now you're in just a world of either people who are who have surrendered and they'll come to you and you'll recognize them and that's known as the sangha. Or you're around people who are just habituations. And that's why that our sweet Lord and savior Jesus Christ when he was being crucified said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing. And I used to think that meant they don't know what they're doing in the sense they don't realize what a wonderful man human. Glovely incarnation thing that I am. They don't realize I'm the manifestation of God just forgive them and understand I'm the greatest thing ever. I think really what that cryptic saying means is they don't know what they're doing their robots their automatons their habituations their cyclones of habit. They literally don't know what they're doing in the same way my Roomba doesn't know what it's doing when it vacuums the floor. It just follows a code. I think that's what it meant. Praise Allah. Yeah I will never. But that being said it's all like exists in. I feel like we exist on two different planes one kind of karmic and sort of almost eternal and sort of like at peace with ourselves and then one one that's kind of temporal and and means you got to wake up tomorrow and you got to get up again and you got to do the work. You know what I mean. And in that sense like I always have this massive amount of energy inside me that I have to get out. I feel like I need to posit my what my thoughts into the into the world or onto a piece of paper onto a guitar or something like I have all this. I can never see myself arriving into the monastic life where I sit in a garden and I take a deep breath and I look at the flowers like for some reason my fate is much more active than that. Like I have things to go do and say and then I know that because it's where my psyche derives like true satisfaction and joy like I don't think I can exist passively necessarily. Well the whole point of monastic life isn't the whole point of monastic life. Everybody thinks it's a retreat but isn't the whole point of monastic life just like the reason people go into flotation tanks. It's just so you can see more clearly what you're projecting into the world because there's less. And also the other thing they say about monastic life is actually it's like the lotus position where you hear the lotus position you think is this soft gentle posture when really it's one of the most excruciating painful positions to get into. And then monastic life in the same way it's like you hear it and you're like oh I just sit around with a bunch of mugs and chant when the reality is you are just around people who are equally as poisonous as the people you run into in the world. And then you realize the whole fucking thing is just yet another trap. It's a pain generator that's designed to make you understand you're projecting your venom out into things. Point being this is a monastery. There's no way out of the monastery. You're in the fucking monastery. And you know that that that that we always have these little fucking safety at least that you know. For me it's like yeah there's the idea of the monastic life this peaceful life or I'll find a nice house in the country and there's that peaceful life or I'll finally find someone who really loves and appreciates who I truly am or I'll find my guru or you know whatever. I'll get my back fucking lasered so there's no more hair back there or I'll get a prosthetic testicle or whatever the stupid adjustment you think is going to bring you in not you. A lot of people have this idea of some oasis that you can go to. No oasis. The oasis is it you know it's you. You carry around the oasis inside of you. That peaceful moment comes the moment you fucking. I don't know what. And then he died. Man this is this these conversations you know I'm so lucky that you're my friend. Well but you what you know after I just said that thinking back like the amount of of energy of like stuff that just came out of you first of all you can pay pal me my therapist done afterwards but like the amount of stuff coming out of you is exactly what I was just trying to say about myself like I don't know if you've ever just literally felt like you have a book inside of you and and you have to just sit down for the next three months and get it all out because for some reason this massive Tom of of articulation is waiting to happen but but you now need to do the hard work as sometimes their their moments in life where you feel like you've absorbed so much shit and you finally have figured out how to put it into a logic and you need to get it out of yourself which I think is the heart of of of why therapy was invented you know positing all this energy and all these thoughts and they need to be arranged and heard out loud and you know examine you know to to kind of take stock you know but what you just did I just the amount of energy in the speed of it how fast you were talking I mean clearly that this is like life life performs a function of like unfolding ourselves over the course of your life you know and you're trying to do it and I guess yeah I guess I guess we do have to be thankful for context that let us do it and courage it and I and then do and I guess that is a type of love that we specifically you and me show each other because for some reason I don't know we really do listen to each other we really do want to know what the other person wants to say and I have to say that's fucking rare that is really rare yes yeah yes it's fucking rare I mean it's like that's why you know sometimes your family isn't you know your family you know and and and that but that is why they call it the song and that's why there's this I that's why there's this concept of like you know these travelers you know when you at least when you just start realizing you're traveling you know and then you find other people are traveling then you share your maps and you share your understandings of the thing and then from that you get closer you know you move further who know you move further along if you're going to use the idea of a path or an ocean or whatever and that's why you know that's the idea that's why you want that and that's why the the conversely it's like but they're they're two different the other that doesn't mean reject people who aren't like this in your life because a lot of times that you think okay I only want to be around people who are listening to me and who I can listen to and you seem to be who seem to have depth but really it's just as useful to be around people who are not listening to you at all who are just these automatons and these habitual they seem to be just habituations just deep crusts of ego because from them you learn to they're teaching you just as much in a totally different way and that's where it gets fucking weird because you're like I'm getting shotgun blasted with knowledge here in this dimension like oh my god man this is this fucking whole dimension as a guy it's like a shower a geyser of information that is spraying into my face like when you hold your face underneath a fucking shower everything is blasting you with the wisdom to free yourself from this thing almost like it's a god damn test we might like we're on some kind of spaceship or something like we're on some kind of like super advanced we're in some form of super advanced school and until you figure out this and this very rudimentary thing that we're in right now is actually designed the way you pass this test is by using the components of the test to free yourself from the test itself or something where every single thing that you think is your prison is actually a key and somehow from like that when when that flips around I think that's when they take your VR helmet off and you realize you're a I guess an octopus on some other planet or something and then you get to eat dinner um well should we cap it off at that yeah yeah emo well I guess we should man thank you for you for this for your time

Terrible levels of obscene trolling that have earned him death threats, rejection, and absolute confusion by many of his friends who worry, my God, has he gone insane? Why in the name of God would you stick a stick into the ants nest of society when you know for sure that you are going to get swarmed, stung, bitten, attacked, canceled, double canceled, triple canceled, banished, and reviled? The answer you will find in our conversation. We talk about the art of trolling, the motivation behind trolling, and Ari's method of trolling. Trolling is a lost art, but it truly is an art form. And we're going to cover it all here with the Lord of Trolls himself, Ari Shafir. We're going to jump right into that, but first, this.

Women on Top These Words Welcome to Purple Golf That you are without shame And know you do your room Welcome to you 薙 Duncan Trussell Hey, Ari, welcome to the DTFH. Duncan Trussell, family. Howard? Yeah, that's how you pronounce it. Everyone pronounces it wrong, though. Yeah, it's weird. I've been seeing them do that for years now. It's fucked up. And I talk about it a lot. I've said it a lot. And then they still don't get it. They don't get it, man. They just don't give a fuck. Ari? Yeah. What the fuck's going on with you? What are you doing in Austin? You're on some kind of weird podcast tour. You got to go to the airport in 20 fucking minutes. I'm the last on your sleigh of podcasts. You couldn't do the morning. You were first. You couldn't do the morning. I could have done the morning because they canceled that thing. Well, anyway, so you're doing a comedy special. Yeah, it's out right now. What's it called? Jew. It's my opus to my childhood. What do you mean? It's the best thing I've ever done, Duncan. It is really? Yeah. Now, where'd you shoot it? The home of the Jews. You shot it in Israel? That's not the home anymore. What is it? New York? Brooklyn, New York. Oh, Brooklyn. I was going to say Roger Waters would be fucking pissed. Oh, my God. How fun was that? Now, that was one of the most surreal moments of my life. So real. Watching you on acid. Yeah. Getting chastised by Roger Waters because you said that you thought he should not boycott Israel. Yeah. I it wasn't even not boycott Israel. It was like, dude, your show is so it made me it made me think like the Palestinian conflict is the same as the conflict in Yemen and Guatemala and all these places. And I was like, man, if you took that to Israel. In my head, I'm thinking like, you know, to show these some like people are thinking about peace a little bit, the young, you know, army people already thinking about it. He goes into like three or four different groups that have been like downtrodden, you know, and then when he gets to your group that you have like a say in, then suddenly like, oh, it's the same thing. You can't pick a side. Right. So then it's like that message there would really do something. And he wasn't he was not into but also I think it's important to know that this some people when they're going off on you. Yeah, it's legitimate anger. Like it's like their inside is poison. They hate you coming out of him. It was not that we wouldn't have enjoyed it. It was passion first cause. That's what it was. It was also pure delight that at the end of the night, so I gave him the chance to really go off. It was like watching the Tigers look one night guys. They released a donkey into their pocket. Yeah, exactly. That was like, oh my gosh, you just had the best show of all time. And then suddenly here is Ari Shafir eyes dilated. Yeah, dilated eyes. We've all been like just like all of us just like awestruck by being around. I mean, so fucking brilliant. So every time you want to join in, you're like, actually this guy's been a legend for fucking almost half a century. Like it's not a conversation. Like sit back. Don't don't especially as interviewers. You want to like get a conversation, but it's like just let him talk talk. Try to stay awake and let him talk. Let him talk. And then there it was at the end of the fucking night. Right at the end of the night. Wow. Can't leave a conversation. All the comics, like we were like everybody's so delighted because of all of us to get into that kind of conversation with you are the best one because you weren't going to like back. You would not back down because you that was what was really cool. You kept challenging him about it. I thought was fucking awesome. It was pretty fun. I was it's like I like BDS stuff. I've kind of heard about. I know it's his like big cause. I'm sure they have a good point stuff. I don't know how many of that side says this is what you have to do versus just it's a cause. I really don't know. Yeah, I was always go to Israeli study there in seminary, you know, and so it was like a lot of times you get a cause. You're just like you have like a 2% knowledge of it and you're like this. I'm like down. You're like, okay. Right. You're like, and so you start arguing, but you don't know. It's actually what he said. He goes learn everything about a subject and then let your conscious take over right, you know, conscience. I don't really know everything about that subject. I was just like, I visit myself to. Yeah, you know, you don't know anything about the Israeli palestinian comp. I know somewhat that it's so much deeper than it than anyone goes. It's definitely this is definitely that. I'm like, no, it's kind of it would be nice ones to blame. No, it's not. It's cool though to like it'd be nice. If you could just be like, I really don't know. That means I can't take a firm side except one based on me wanting you to like me, right, which isn't even going to be the truth anyway. It'd be a good angle to take. That is the angle for most people. It's like, I'll say you're right. Cause I want you to let me like me so bad that I'm going to tell you that I'm on whatever side you're on, but then that's all you're going to get in that situation is bullshit. Like you're not getting a real thing. Yeah. Not like, what do you think about this? I think that's wrong, but okay. Yeah. You never get that. You never get that. It's so funny. I talked about the people I know where it's like COVID was very divisive. Really? I never heard that. What do you mean? Maybe it's just New York. I don't know. Did you hear there were like opposing opinions about it and stuff? I heard they were. I never saw any, but I heard they were opposing. I never saw anyone having a problem with it, but like in casual conversation, how little conflict I want. I'll just agree with whatever side you have. We're at a party. Right. And I don't care. So you're like, can you believe that make you do this? Like, I know you're not doing this because I know, right? Well, yeah. It's just like, sure. But that's the best way to deal with that. This beer before like, let's get back to that. It's like, you know, like, uh, those terrible videos, like somebody working at a fast food restaurant, getting paid like minimum wage. Doesn't should not be looking at the manual they give you because it's like, you're not giving me enough money to study. I actually study like I'm not doing rehearsal. I'm not doing this. I'm going to come in and I'm going to like look at whoever the other people, whatever the other people are going to do it, but then the grease fire starts and they throw. They just, they didn't look at the manual. Hey, I don't do this. Water puts out fire. And it's like, whoa. Holy shit. There astounded. It makes no sense. It's like, they didn't know that happens when you, but what this is the identical thing that happens when you engage with somebody's aggression. Isn't it? It's the identical thing. It's like the moment you just don't react. It's, it's not. That's the best thing. Don't react. There's no, they don't have the, what there's no juice to run on anymore. And to go like, can I just play devil's advocate? It's like, don't why you're actually not talking to them. Don't place devil's advocate. Don't play devil's advocate. Don't play the advocate. I do love it though. I love poking. You love poking too. Yeah, you, but you love poking in like you, you like, I think my level of trolling in my old age has diminished somewhat. Yeah. Whereas you. I think it's like the ISIS of trolling golden age right now. I think we were in a power position. We've never been in before the reach we have. They gave us, we never had nuclear weaponry. We had an occasional like one-on-one or a message board, you know, with 30 members and now we can just let the people we troll spread it to others. Okay. But here's the funny thing. Oh, you, here's what it is. A good time. You, yeah. You, it's not that you don't want to deal with somebody. Yelling when they have some opinion about something. It's that you want to be in control. That's why you troll. I mean, you know what I mean? Cause it's the, I want to conduct. Yeah. You're conducting a reaction. So you still, but, but if you're like around somebody who's like passionate about this thing or that, you're just sort of backing out to let it die down a little bit. Right. In like a regular conversation. You don't troll in their regular. I didn't want to be part of that. You don't want. And then you get drawn in every time I've ever gone to a fight. I don't like, it's like, I barely know about this enough. I'm talking about what I don't know. Right. And so then you talk about little things. We're like, you know, you got to visit your family. He's like, what does that mean? I'm like, and then it's like, you know what family is dude? Come on. But it's, it's fascinating though that you will, but then it's like, I should be like, but you'll go online. Yeah. And you will say some horrible, the worst thing I've ever, I don't believe it at all things that offend me, offend me when I say it. It's like, this is disgusting. And without question, you know, when you're doing it, you are, you will become like a Nash, a temporary national pariah. Everyone. So angry. Everyone wants wanting to kill you. Kill me wanting like online online. All your friends will get worried about you. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that. So what, what now? They've stepped it up where they involve other people now. They don't just come up to me. Let's go into it. Yeah. If you describe to me the feeling that you're having day two after completely upsetting some fandom, some group of people day to cloud nine. They too still great. I haven't lost anything yet. You're getting off on it. I love it. What's the feeling like? Look how angry you guys all are for some person you don't know or that's not a feeling described. Oh, right, right, right. If you can success ownership over things like that, like, like you've just like dominated the thing. Like, like you set your mind to stuff and then you see a perfect example, like a perfect in and you fucking take it. Um, you know what? This is like, man, it's like interviews with Jeffrey fucking Dahmer. He's like, legend, legend, legend, same shit. You know, you didn't expect to get a knock on your door and said, Hey, do you have to rush and Jeffrey Dahmer's like, Oh, come on in. Oh my God, I just saw us in my house. It's like when you find like drugs at a music festival. Yeah. You see a back and you're like, Oh my God, but we just offered a position. Uh, there's an old golfer. I forget who it was. Talked about it. They said he got really lucky. He did golf shot out of the sand and you're like, man, you got really lucky. And he goes, and more I practice more people say that. Yeah. Um, yeah. How do I practice more people? So you're saying you practice drawing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, in this case, I've been hitting the Lakers for so long. I've been shitting on dead people for so long and they're in there. When they're the most revered. When I think like, this is God like, I don't like it. You feel like you're knocking over idols. Not what? Knocking over idols. Yeah. Yeah. Breaking down idols, breaking down idols and false idols. I don't think you even believe in it. It's like, if you really believe in Jesus or Buddha or, you know, or any of the robe guys you like, or like, um, or like, yeah, not all heroes are robes. Um, then it's like, no, no, sure. You have a belief system, but this is like, you don't have a belief system. You're being a hypocrite. You're just lying about what you actually believe right now. And I want to point that out. Hold a mirror. So that's, so you feel like you're doing something on a public service. Artistic service. An art. It's an art. It's an art point doesn't it? And again, I, I'm sorry for trying to reduce it some reason. You want to analyze it. It's okay. Not like, you know exactly what, what you're doing. There's that too. Right. There's an innate sense of like this feel. Like they said, like we studied Hitchcock in college and he always like, had it, if I remember a little piece of it, they had an upside angle shot of the character and that would be when the character is going into a place he can't come back from. He's about to get into a point of no return. Right. He's entering into a bar and it's like, that's what he's about to get framed for a murder. Right. And so anyway, it's giving away. Hitchcock's giving it away. Oh, this guy's, if you know his stuff, this guy's about to, and it was like, is he conscious of that? And the teacher was like, I, I'm not sure. He might just be using that shot all the time without really thinking what he's doing. Okay. Cause it felt right. Day five. That's trouble. Describe that. It's like, oh no. I still am totally happy with what I've done, but I'm not happy with the feeling of like seeing my friends try to separate themselves from me. Friends that were like fine with me day one, but then when they are seeing the public outrage and suddenly like, oh, I'm sort of seeing the point with no new information. Right. Two people to 200,000. You hear the point. Not feeling good about it. Friends that are like delivering apology speeches. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like for being not for what you did, but for just knowing me, I had black friends that were being called tunes for having opened for me two years earlier. That's horrible. Crazy. That's horrible. It's crazy. And, and so then I'm like, sorry to them. But at the same time, like look what I've exposed in all of you that you're being racist to some young performer because I've pointed out one of your heroes, but, but that's really that you think that so you I've exposed this stuff in you that it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You so you for you, it's kind of like, look, you're doing by this rotten thing I'm doing. I'm holding up a mirror. Yeah. I don't even have to go to you. It's not like I'm going to some funeral or something. I just go to my own feed and then you'll send this hatred and take it to other people. I got once I did, I did one about, um, Kenny Rogers. Right. I had all these like middle-aged housewives coming after me. What were they saying? You're a piece of shit. You're not funny. By the way, what the fuck did you do? Did poor Kenny Rogers? Poor Kenny Rogers. I agree. What did you say? When he died, I said he was so racist that he wouldn't have fried chicken and he only had roasted chicken to keep black out of established burning in hell. That's fucked up. Was he racist? No, not at all. I don't think I have no idea. Probably not. It's too much in this dream. Yeah. That is what we are. It was about throwing babies in a sack and fucking throwing them in there.

So let's like, is trolling a new thing? It's not new. It's evolving. It's taking finally into public eye. You've done it, dude. Oh, I've trolled. I mean, when you got me once that when the amazing races of this old sketches I did for national impunes and they got ripped to the internet. So they take got their contacts removed, which is whenever ready. It's upset almost always when context was removed. Yeah, 100%. So you take out, this is an easy one to understand. You take out the stamp of the national lampoon DVD, right? You take that out and just go, here's some, what somebody did a horrible man. Same thing in mind. It's like, if you take out, oh, he likes to put fun at dead people in their times of like, you know, reverence, you take out context. So anyway, people got mad at me when it got online. Like, what the fuck is this? Thought it was real. And they googled me early Google. And the very first thing that came up was artistic terrorism. Oh yeah. Someone grab that domain for me. And it goes, Hey, everybody, if you want to crank on my friend, Ari should fear record it and send me the best ones. Here's his number. And, and dude, I didn't know it was up there. And you didn't have to click on the link. It was just, you could read it right there. Three, two, three, six, five, six, something. You didn't even have to click on the link. And the call. No, don't be sorry. Cause the calls that would come in at first were troubling. And then we're so funny. Like I hired a bunch of Latinos to build a deck and I took him to INS was a sketch was the fake, fake hidden camera. Yeah. It was all actors. We hired him for the job back. The call my answer machine. I eventually turned my phone off during my phone. Just so I get answered on sign cause they call all night. Just nonstop calls. And, uh, I'll build a deck in your ass homes. That threats once I got over that these are not real. They were so joyous at a job. Well done from a friend of mine. Unintentional. Well, you were trying to get in the crank call me. I was trying to do something mean to you before that. It just took longer to take effect. Yeah. The troll, the troll had a, got a life of its own on that one. I mean, like, if you thought about the history of trolling, like through the ages. No, the New York Times wrote a nice piece on me. What did they say how trolling is an art form? They did say that. Look at it. Yeah. Yeah. See, cause I had in different things. Jackass and like Tom Green. It's newer versions of it. Jonathan Swift. Lenny Bruce. Jonathan Swift is a great one. The, I say about eating poor people's kids. Yeah. A modest, modest proposal. It's like we have overcrowding. There's not enough food to go around. I propose we eat some of the poor that way. There'll be less poor and more food. Can you imagine if he had a fucking answering machine and his number was out there, the funny. Now that's a literary genius. And I think at the time people took it not real, but if you showed it now, but what the fuck people thought it was real. People thought it was real. War of the worlds unintentional trolling. They missed the intro. Right. Unintentional trolling unintentional trolling. Yeah. They missed the intro. But I'm sure he was like, that's cool. I thought it was real Blair, which intentional trolling intentional trolling. They let all that campaign all around. Well, I found something was the first one. It was like that campaign was like, they found these videos. What are some other versions of trolling that you can think of off the top of your head? Birds are real birds. I'm not real real the Illuminati. People say is a troll. It's not a troll. What? Well, I mean, it's I mean, it's based on like a factual organization, the Bavarian Illuminati. It's like there was a it's a it's a branch of the Freemasons. Yeah. And the you know, the Masons have all kinds of weird fucking like signals. They send to each other to let them know what's going on. Like baseball. Baseball is a troll. Well, baseball is not a troll. I'm just saying this is never an exciting sport. Everyone just thought it was exciting. Everybody thinks they're playing baseball. They're really just sending Masonic signals. What was it? What other trolls? I'm trying to think of all religion. There were lies. You know, like they let Jesus the Romans let Jesus go because like we can help control them. So go go. If we don't that's something that they do say you believe that what you believe they let Jesus go. No, no, they let the idea of Jesus progress because they're like if that's what you guys are into, it will be citizens. One of the weirdest things I heard about Jesus is so when he's on the cross, he says I'm thirsty and they imagine you're fucking nails in your hands. You're suffocating from being like this and falling down and be on weight and all you want to just like I'm thirsty. Wow. He was the son of God. You know, I don't think that I would have that kind of confidence. No, I'd be like who duck his last words. But I wouldn't if it wouldn't have occurred to me when I was being crucified that there was table service, right? Like I wouldn't have been like they're gonna give me water. Yeah, probably not. We're killing you. Yeah, you know, you don't get water. You're not at a restaurant. We're killing you. But they they they take a sponge and they put it in something and it gets translated as vinegar. So it's kind of like they were torturing more by giving him vinegar. But the actual translation, it means bitter and a lot of people say that that's a word that they used for opium like an opium tincture back then because Jesus died sooner. Then people usually die when they're being crucified. It usually takes months. So the conspiracy theory around the crucifixion is they drugged him to make him not feel it. It seemed like he died. He didn't really die. They've Romeo to us. The rising from the dead thing. It was like he was seen. He must have been rising for the dead. Yeah, I don't know if he saw him. But somebody saw. I don't know. He's out. But the left basically that in this version of it. The story is the go ahead and then at that point Jesus goes, Hey, actually, I'm not looking for this fight. That was way harsher than I thought. I'm out. I'm out. He's out. And people like they're saying you're great. Let him think that I'm done. I don't care anymore. I'm being a guru. I met a guy in Hong Kong part of the part of the revolution. I met him in Ecuador and I was like, how's it going? He's like, I'm out. So I had a gun pointed to my face. I had a gun pointed this far from my face with a guy who was allowed to use it on me. Yeah. And I'm like, I don't want to do this. He's done traveling. You're you, you, you know, like it's exhausting. You're Jesus was just done. Well, no, well, this as this conspiracy theory goes. Jesus essentially it's like the Romans. They're killing Jesus because Jesus was a revolutionary basically and he was someone who is pushing back against the theocracy that was happening with him so that the Jews wanted to kill him because he was like fucking up the whole priest class system by saying you don't need anybody to talk to God to do it ourselves. We can do ourselves big when you've got a business going, you can convince people you can talk to God and they can't. There's so much money in that. Can't we just nuke Assange? Can't we just drone Assange? I think we're from famous words of a leader of ours. Did they say that drone him? Who said that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Well, she was Secretary of State. That doesn't sound like her. Can't we just drone him? Uh, that's fucked up, man. I didn't know she said that. Yeah. Well, anyway, the conspiracy theory. I mean, I didn't hear it. The conspiracy theory goes like this. Jesus not really dead. Obviously he ends up going to Europe, right? Like Jesus ends up living the next part of his life and there's now descendants of Jesus living to this day. It's Jimmy Christ, James Christ, Lewis Christ. No, well, that's what this is what, and you know, I don't want to make you on if he's listening to Lewis Gomez uncomfortable. Yeah, but this is actually where the conspiracy ends. Lewis J. Gomez is the direct descendant of Jesus Christ. Christ. I love when he's a direct descendant. Like you just mean descendant. Well, direct descendant. That means that's mean brother and sister kept fucking all down the line. Brother, sister, brother, sister, brother, sister, brother, sister. Yeah, man. That's what Lewis Gomez would explain a lot of his let's just say the way his eyes are set. Let's just call it that. But yeah, man, that's like that's like the, you know, because to go to the Illuminati thing. This is actually a part of like a lot of people when they are in their contemplation of secret societies, they always assign nefarious motives to their activity. Yeah. But also. I wouldn't have to be. Yeah, they troll. So there's trolling that happens from the secret societies from the elites that isn't designed to cause for fun. Just for fun. Yeah. Why, why wouldn't they have some fun with it? If you think of this, you end up, you realize there is an Illuminati and you realize that you didn't even know it, but many of your friends had already been inducted in it for a while, right? And you realize that like part the way you go into the, you get into the Illuminati isn't like someone taps you out like at a frat or something and it's like, Hey, we're going to, we're going to get you in here. They fucking haze your ass, but in a different way. They haze you by like doing all kinds of things to you. Maybe they like for fun. They make you famous and then they like, you know, they give you all kinds of weird shit that doesn't make any sense. Like all the stuff that you've had in your life. You're like, how the fuck did this happen to me? I was working on the phones at the comedy store and like now I'm free as a bird, I get to travel wherever I want and do whatever I want and all this stuff. It's all a big troll. They're just like, okay, let's, let's give him everything he wants. Keep giving him everything he wants. And then at some point it starts dawning on you. Like, wait, this, holy shit, the more successful you get, the more like you get into rooms that you normally couldn't get into until finally it's just all your friends dressed in fucking robes. They're like, Ari. You're finally here like the end of a lost when they all have to get to the like heaven or the purgatory. I didn't fucking finish last year. Shit. I've been watching it. Ah, fuck. I'm just kidding. I haven't been watching it. But at the beginning of this clip, just put heavy spoilers. A heavy spoilers. Yeah. So yeah, so let's just imagine you now we're in the Illuminati. You've been inducted. This is how we do it. We say it out loud in front of everybody because nobody's going to fucking believe that we're actually in the Illuminati. It's obviously me rambling. You're now in the Illuminati with absolute power, power. You can't even fucking imagine. Tell me about the trolling you would do. Wow. Wow. I'm gonna have to control the media. Yeah. You have control the media now. Like you're literally like when you go to parties and you see like Rupert Murdoch. So I wouldn't want to make everyone think there's a war coming. Like, like, let's just say I could make up that Ukraine Russia happened. So it makes everybody think I fuck one of them. Nuclear Brinkley Brinkley of nuclear. Yeah. Nah, that's not quite fun for me. I would want them believing something small and ridiculous, but have it be just standard knowledge. Like what? The spoon was invented by the Italians at first. And had to just be like, oh, yeah, yeah, we all know that. Just have it so out there in the world. Yeah. And then every time I'd hear it, it'd be like, oh, like, you know, Champagne is actually only from the province of Champagne. And there's every time I hear that, you know, some dork says that. Inevitably from Southern California is actually, you know, Champagne. I don't know if you know this. Like, yeah, we all know it. We've all heard that. Why do you say it? Why are you saying it? Why are you saying what we all know? Yeah, I mean, sparkly. Yeah. Okay. I mean, sparkling. Why do you even think we care? Why do we want to know the history of fucking champagne? You don't care. You just heard something. We're having mimosas. But imagine if you heard that and you just see everyone's like, oh, yeah, yeah. And then you're just going. Yeah, it's not true. There is no place called champagne. So funny. You just quietly have it. See now this. Okay. This is what makes you an actual troll because and I read, I don't remember. I was reading this wonderful essay that someone wrote on trolling and they, they, uh, it's a really funny thing. They interviewed a troll, which is like, okay. You don't know what the fuck they told you. It's like who the fuck knows. But the troll was like expressing like kind of dismay at the characterization of trolls as like bad people or what? What? Sorry. Doing obvious shit. Like, yeah, that's weak trolls. That's like, that's imagine if like a high level Chuck Pollinock high level writer or Van Gogh was like, uh, looks at your child's drawings or writings and goes, oh, they're writers or painters and like, right? That's who you're going to say we all are. Right. We're on another level. Right. You're analyzing us by our worst. Yeah. But people go like, oh, it's easy to do that. But no, it's not. I've tried many, many times to get a national debate going. Right. It's a very, very rare thing. Yeah. You can't just do that. No, no, no, no, you're, you're hacking. You're basically hacking the. Break into this thing. They're fucking really unlock it. It takes a lot of work. Well, it does when you are alone and you don't run the media. When you, if you ran, if you run the media, it's like, it's like literally access to the motherboard. Like it's like putting just new chips in and the way you would do it, you know, cause all like some, you know how, you know, a war is coming or, you know, like some awful thing is coming is all of a sudden out of the blue, the media will just out of the blue, they start talking about something. And you're like, Oh shit. Something else is happening. Or they'll be like, you know, all of a sudden you have not thought about Cuba at all for years. Yeah. They set the table for you. All of a sudden it's like, you know, a leak shows that there is a humanitarian crisis in Cuba. They've, they've, they've started torturing Christians in Cuba. Christians and puppies. And you're like, wait, what? Oh no, we're going to go to war with fucking Cuba. You know, it's tenderizing the steak or whatever. Right. And then the war comes. So you, your thing, the way it would look is just all of a sudden you'd be watching the news and they would be like, what was the thing with spoons? You said the Italians invented them. All of a sudden it'd be like, yeah, you know, a new historical document reveals that. Upads. Spoons. Fun piece in the style section. The Italian spoon. Yeah. Celebrating Italy with a spoon. Yeah. You'll see it sometimes. Trenzel start that spritz was big for a while. I don't know where the apparel spritz. There you go. There, but then it got bigger. It's just something everyone's doing. Everyone's talking about everyone's eating kale. Well, I mean, they didn't before. This is what happens with this is like when one of the Wizard of Oz, when the, when the curtain goes up is when you get a publicist for the first time. And you realize, oh my God, it's all trolling. They're lying. They're they're trolls in a different way, which is that they just are generating buzz to promote someone to promote someone. Like, you know what I mean? You like if all of a sudden you notice that trending. Yeah, you'll see it. I remember seeing as a kid when I saw on the back of like parade magazine. Remember that one in the back of like the Sunday newspaper and they had a little piece on she's dead now. She was an eight mile and she was in a, I'll never tell Britney something. Remember that preview? I'll never tell Britney. I don't know. She was a chicken eight mile. Okay. She was in clueless also. She was working clueless and then she turned hot and it's like weird. They're running a piece on this and then that movie I'll never tell whatever that was that came out and it was like, oh, they're setting the table. They're trying to make her into a star now. And it was like, they're not just randomly running a piece on someone. That's it. And anyone who they're doing a piece on it's like they're, they're, they're about to have a thing. There's a publicist behind it always. And from someone who's had a publicist, you do. You can't get publicity when you're not about to release something. There's no story and it's also not cost effective. That's it. Except the highest level people. That's it. But yeah, the highest level people, they'll just like for whatever reason they need a, they need a fucking dopamine rush or something. So they'll just like get a publicist. But all of a sudden when you see a proliferation of vapid stories about any given celebrity, just know somebody got paid a shit ton of money to make that happen. Right. There's no more journalism. Like I've been researching Julia Roberts. Right. What happened to her? Come back. I just want to write a story about that. Like they present it. That's it. That's it. And that when you really, like when you start realizing that when you're watching the news, you are watching cause cause propaganda propaganda. And it's like there's, it's no different when all of a sudden like, I don't know, uh, you, you realize like everywhere there's a new story about how electric cars are going to fuck the environment up. Yeah. Like what interests? Why? Where is that coming from? That's not coming from environmentalists. That's coming from the fucking oil industry. It's like we got fuck these electric cars. Let's make them seem like they're even worse for the environment than oil. And then boom. Yeah. They'll try to align you with images or stories that are negative. So it's like, oh, I don't know. I talked to my mom's like, what do you think about, uh, um, who's Snowden? She's like, well, he's a traitor. I'm like, interesting. I wasn't going to fight with her. I was like, man, but he said how Congress was like lying to all of us and getting us into wars and like lying to like the mill that was lying to Congress. And he exposed that. No, I think he's a traitor. I'm like, okay. I can't blame her. She read stories. She read like, you know, I'm a version of whatever I was raised with. Right. So any, like that's backwards thinking for social stuff. I'm like, yeah, that's what I was taught. Yeah. I'm the fucking school system. Right. And so like once you align stuff with images, it's, you can't, it isn't, you know, just can't like get out of your head. Well, you can't, you know, you can't fucking do. It's really hard to put the toothpaste back in the two. You can't put it back in once you condition the masses. It's just, it's what's like, well, why is that? Like I know, like I can't prove that the earth is not flat. It's not like a whiteboard. You know, once it comes out that whatever the fucking lie was that you put out there, cause that always also happens in there. All of a sudden, cause you know, in the beginning with the vaccines, all the conspiracy theorists were like, these, you know, and doctors were coming on me like, you know, I don't know, these vaccines might cause some real serious problems. It might be that some of the shit is not staying localized in the injection site, all these things start coming out and those people, they're getting fucking just eviscerated and the reason they're being eviscerated is because the publicists for the pharmaceutical companies are like, we got to sell these fucking vaccines, bitch. Bury that. Bury that shit quick. Yeah. Now. Well, same thing. We've got to go to war. So like, it's a fucking bit of Snowden. Yeah. Fucks that guy's doing our whole thing. When you're also, when you're. When you're on a shaky. That's my, me not knowing what I'm doing. That's the camera running out of juice, whatever. It's the wide shot who cares. I'm not going to use the video anyway. No, we get close up, dude. I'm in the same boat. My editor Marissa is always like, I'm like, make fun of me when you're doing the editing, say, always dumb fucking non-charging is evident in three, two, one, gone. Yeah. We have it up until then. Finish what you were saying and let me, and you keep track of time, but because you're the one, what was I saying? You're talking about Snowden. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it comes up as like, is like, he's this bad. You want to tell you's a bad guy and the publicists, they have something to gain and you don't know why you think, I don't know. It's gone. Well, we regard like you. Yeah. It's a story that they're trying to prep you for. Then one of the fucking things that's happened now is. Oh, I know. Go ahead. A lot of people have a shaky. This is a good example of a shaky platform, a base for their reality. Yes. They haven't thought it all out. Right. You'll get this with atheists. You'll get it with religious people. They're just raised with it. You'll get it with woke, not woke. The statues to stay. Oh, but it's doing this to the community or the statue should go. Yeah. People's like a path of the past and they haven't really thought it out. They just kind of have a belief. And now if I'm solid on my ground, if I'm standing on the ground and I believe something, Duncan is my friend. Yes. And then somebody goes, well, you know, he'll turn you for this. I'm like, no, he won't. Well, you know, he said this, he didn't. That's wrong. Yeah. He had a reason for it. Yeah. No, Duncan is my friend. It's not shaky. Right. But if I'm on a shaky thing, like the, despite the vaccines, the master, the only way to stop this and have to be, and it's like this and somebody's like, well, what about this? You're like, hey, man, I'm going to fucking fall. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here. I'm going to fall. Yeah. And it's not comfortable. Yeah. But someone can come to me with the sun won't come up tomorrow. And I'm like, it will. I'm not going to yell and scream. I just, I just know you're wrong. Exactly. Yeah. That's, that's the thing is it's, it's like the problem is people on shaky ground and especially people who've been living on, you know, you're on a boat long enough when you get on shore, it feels like you're on a boat. So like if you're living in a kind of like semi-truth state for like your whole life and then all of a sudden you make contact with the truth, it's going to feel like you're seasick. Like you're, that's, you're going to get hit with like this initial wave of like what? I can't be right. You don't mean that. And then, and, and, and that's like, and so then you get back on the unstable ground because the stable ground to you is normal. You've adapted to live in consensus reality, perfected the ability to ignore the fact that a lot of the time, shit that you initially believed turns out to not be true. Yeah. When you, when you learned about America and maybe we weren't some fucking questionable conflicts because you were raised with like, we're the best. Dave Smith says the best. Like they literally taught us at a young age that our first leader was physically incapable of telling a lie. Right. We were like, uh-huh. And now that you're older and you hear that like, oh yeah. He's a six-year-old and I cannot tell a lie. Take George Washington, the classic, like George Washington, George Washington is and will always be somebody who was a human trafficker. In fact, syphilis, one of the top human traffickers in Virginia and syphilis. He was a human trafficker with fucking shitty teeth with shitty teeth that were, that were slave teeth. That's not wooden teeth. They said wooden teeth, but he would like put slave teeth in or replace his teeth. So he's a human trafficker who wore the teeth of people that he'd imprisoned to do labor for him, who he was breeding and who he would sell their children off. Like he was like selling like puppies. Like it was, it was not just a, it was not, it was like a puppy mill, but for, for humans. Now this is the truth. Right. But then when you met with that, anyone older like shut up, shut up, shut up. Or there's all kinds of ways people react to that. Some people will say, don't get all fucking woke on me, bro. It's not woke. It's true. There's nothing woke about it. He was a human trafficker. Now the, the reason they said, cause at the time that wasn't that weird. That's why people want to let it go. All right. So now that thing that you're saying there is one of the things you were going to take, like Snowden's a traitor to deal with the cognitive dissonance of the fact that one of the people who founded our country was a human trafficker who wore the teeth of his hostages and would murder and beat them if they tried to escape. What you do is you have to fix it. So you're like, look, he was, it's essentially being bad for the time. Look, Dahmer, he was just a kid. He was, you know, experienced. You don't want to say like what will happen is like all of us will in sometime in the next thousand years or less be horrible humans. If they looked at all of us, did you hear that Ari Shafir had a dog? Yeah. What? What do you mean? What do you mean had one? This is when dogs of all, yeah, not to make a comparison. They're what I'm saying is the, the, the, I don't, I don't agree with you. I think that the problem is that a lot of the slave owners, like I'm actually one of the nicest ones. Well, yeah, though, that's another thing people will say. So they will say, so the first thing is this. They use the word slave, which is better than saying human trafficking. So when they talk about slavery, they don't say they don't, and they use slave instead of hostage because even though slave ain't great. If you say, it's lost its meaning. It's lost its meaning. If you say hostage human trafficker, it makes you immediately realize like, okay, the other thing is, is like this thing about how, you know, people, that's what the economy was like back then. Like they, he was grudgingly. He's like, ah, you know, I really don't want to fucking buy all these humans. And I know that like I can listen to the parents screaming when I sell their children and it really is eating me up inside. But I screaming, but I kind of have to do it right now because, you know, I'm just a product of my times. It's like, okay, then how come slavery wasn't happening all over the fucking planet? It was happening in some places. But what about that? What it's not your, your, basically the ideas is like, first of all, George Washington was not that long ago. Chappelle did this wonderful joke about that. He wasn't so they didn't know any better. I think like, I don't know. Things were just don't, some, some things you can't face it. But were they like, with that, with that idea, you're going to have to write off everybody from the past. And, and at some level, I go, yeah, that's okay. You don't have to revere anybody from the past. You don't know. You just revere their teaching or their artwork. You don't have to actually like them as humans. And that's when you get lost. That's the, to me, it's like, it's just like Kanye. You could just love his music and just don't have to listen to who he is. Well, right. Like this is, let's say, let's say that like Alex Honnold. That free climber, right? Let's say it comes out that Alex Honnold had a farm somewhere in like deep ranch in Texas. He had 20 hostages that were growing cotton for him there. And so would this change the fact that Alex Honnold is an incredible climber? No. Absolutely not. This is the problem they have with Nazi research. He's, what do you mean? They did all this research on Jews, the Holocaust, medical research. You're, oh, which is like, what do we do with that data? What do we do with the data? What do we do with that? Yeah. And there's, you know, it's split on that, but, but that's a harder one. Cause that is like, this is something we can get, but it came from this terrible thing. Alex Honnold in this story didn't have his slaves build the ropes for him that he'd be unable to do it without the slave. It's a separate thing. Right. You know, you're not building our Kelly didn't use the sound of fucking the pissing on girls to make his music. Just like a separate thing. We don't know that. We don't know that. Yeah. Michael Jackson's like incredible. Might have been like him mimicking these kids. God, that'd be incredible. If you could turn the sound of piss into like beautiful singing, it would be a nicer world. It would be a much nicer world. But it's like, don't face that. Just get the things out of it. Just get the joy that you wanted or something and leave the rest. Like, it's not a fucking world about, or like get a little more sophisticated in your thinking to understand that to, to the, that these things can exist simultaneously. And as far as George fucking Washington goes, just tell the truth. Yeah. I saw a lady on Twitter shortly after there was a basketball player who died and she goes, listen, it's possible that he was like a really good guy and a great basketball player and also looked like there was probably a committed rape once and all these things can be true at once. And she received probably 7000 death threats. Yeah. Check from Westworld. See, now to me. What I've been thinking about lately in this regard is Carl young famous psychologist. Yeah. He had this idea that, you know, he's the one who came up with the concept of the shadow, which is all the shit about you or that you don't want to acknowledge. Right. So all the stuff you've done easily barrier. Don't think about it. You think you can bury it, but you can't. It's going to leak. It comes out no matter what. It's just going to. It's like when you run into a person and your past, they are they casually will just over dinner. Something will pop out of their mouth that you realize like, oh my fucking God, you just told me like your deepest secret and you don't even know that you said it like it'll just it's called leaking. It's like the shadow leaks out. You can't repress it. Truly it leaks. Prably. Yeah. Well, one of the main ways that leaks is in your projection. So you might be one of those. If you run into someone who thinks that everyone's a thief, probably this is a thief you're talking to. It's a person who steals. They can't deal with their own lying or dishonesties. They see it. Yeah. Yeah. So some so young took it one step further, which is there's not just your own unconscious. It's got all the shadow shit in there. There's the collective unconscious, which is everyone's shadow. Right. The way it leaks is the leaders. So the leaders of any given country are a reflection of the shadow of the individuals coming out. And so so we're all capable of this. The leader shows his capability of doing something terrible or whatever or whatever leaks out. And then everyone's like, we're set back in. Politicians lie. Yeah. All right. That's what happens. All politicians. Why are you okay with it? Well, the reason that we have lying politicians is because we're all lying to ourselves. And because we've like, so you're seeing like that unstable thing manifesting in the form of our leadership, which of course would be deceptive since we're all trying to exist in a half truth shadow world. Anyway, you know, people don't want to believe that George Washington was a human trafficker. Help people against their will. You know, people eat the shit out of them, punch them in the face at minimum. Yeah. Right. But if you leather and just fucking raked it across, deal with it. It's like the moment you, you know, the moment you like, whatever the thing is you've done that you feel incredibly remorseful about the moment you're like, I, I did that, but I did that. And it was bad. Instead of here's why I did it. I'm a victim or I shouldn't have done that. That was not cool. The moment you're just like, no, I did that because there's a part of me that's just like fucking. Yeah, I do like saying something when I, when I, when I'll say something publicly of like, you shouldn't attack other comedians publicly. Something you should go straight to them if you have a problem. Yeah. Or just like it's hard enough. It's our team. I think it's our team. Yeah. But I'm like, it's wrong to do it. And I do enjoy saying, and I know it's wrong because I have done it. Right. So I'm not on a higher ground here. I've just seen the light a little bit and you shouldn't do that, but I get it. I've done it. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, this is why I say over and over again, you shouldn't dig up graves and suck off corpses. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Because of the cavities you get. Yeah. And I can say because I get it. I know the joy, the moment you get the car that you finally open it up and it's not completely dissolved fucking dirt is on top of a coffee. You know, sometimes they go lower than six feet. Yeah. And that's the worst feeling when you're like, is you get used to six feet and then all of a sudden you're like, mother fucker. They like did an extra eight foot county dude. It's the worst. Is that last two feet? You think it's only two feet? It's like, no, it's 33% more when you're already worn out. Sun's about to come up. You got to get suckin. You got to get suckin fast. There's no like, there's no milk in it. There's no like, let me take a rest. You're like, you've been doing the blow and you're almost out of the blow, but you're going to leave just enough. Are you going to catch a plane? Tell everyone about your special. Where they work and they see it. Did I tell them people about this Roger water? It's on YouTube right now. Guys, it's free. Literally. It is the best thing I've ever done and I thought about selling it and then I decided I'd rather give it to you guys. What is YouTube? YouTube is a platform on the, on the internet. It's something that was invented in the winter, I think. I haven't read the whole story. I think I glanced it up. Hugging headline. Yeah. It's like videos. Yeah. It was invented by Jim Gore, someone who got Gord, I think. Doles, dope fruit plants, one of those and it's like videos of such. Yeah. Like that. Yeah. Videos and like, and I think you can like buy stuff there too. I don't know, but it's there. It's called Ari Shafirju and it is. So I went to Edinburgh, uh, fringe festival, the most exciting artistic place there is for comedy. It's 1400 comedians all doing a show every single night. Wow. Yeah. In addition to trapeze and books and music and all sorts of stuff. And I was exposed to this like style of comedy, this British festival style of comedy in which they picked up a theme, but I had a major problem with it because I think rightfully so that American comedy stand up is the best by far. I had a film teacher in college and he goes, Hey, there is where he started teaching American film and he goes, there is other film out there. French film is good. There's other good film because it's not a debate. American film is the best. So there is good stuff out there and you can find and we'll teach you some stuff here or there, but we're, it's Hollywood is, it's got the most money behind it. Right. We're the best. It's not a question. I'm sure no one's going to disagree with what you just said. They shouldn't. I definitely won't help this algorithm to get seen more if it does, but America stand up is the best and the people that are doing it in other countries either understand that and are trying to catch up and they have the best chance or like in the UK for a lot of people go, No, well, you're not going to ask and they hold it over them that they don't do these themes. These theme hours and what I've seen of these theme hours right about 35 to 40 minutes in they get Uber serious for about 15 minutes. Yeah. And I worship the God of laughs. And so what? Satan, Satan. Yeah, Mitzi. Okay. Yeah. And I don't allow that. There's no time for that. And I've seen great comments like Miss Pat will talk about her rape from an uncle and she won't wallow in it. She gets through it. You're laughing the whole time and then afterwards like, wait, was she just talking about her rape? Richard Pryor with his incineration and then like, yeah, we can get there. I can talk about dark stuff. All these greats will do that. Yes. Miss Pat is on the level of Richard Pryor. Right. In this moment. And so it's a cop out to go. Let's just get simple guys. We're all together. That's where I learned something. Yeah. South Park would make fun of that. They go right at it when I don't have jokes. It's so much easier to get serious than guys for real though. For real. It's the best. You don't have jokes. You're didn't write. You haven't been working on writing. You just say something serious. 10 minute serious. Shut the fuck into easier than writing. Why aren't you punching this up? So I went to I went three years every other year. First year. I took my storytelling show there. I started seeing all these hours. I'm like, interesting. And then I had to Edinburgh plan to go show them what an American hour was like, which is just and I had a deep back in my head. It was my last hour. A little bit of a theme. What your life would be like with kids or without kids, but it's very understated and then go show them what an Edinburgh style hour is with an American sensibility. Okay. Laughs all the way through. Right. And every time I thought I was done, I was like, no, they'll get me on this, but yeah, I'm talking about what Judaism is, but I didn't talk about what my Judaism is. I didn't have any personal stories in there. So it can't just be explaining what Hanukkah is. It's what I went through as a kid during Hanukkah when somebody got a better gift than me. So I can tell you my experience, the customs, the laws, all of that while still maintaining any bit that can follow Bobby Lee or Mark Norman with at a fucking guy. It's like you're teaching, but it's funny. It's a spite special special. It's teaching. Right. You will come out learning something, but if you don't want to learn anything, that's fine. You're just going to laugh. Wow. Don't think of this as a one man show. I think of this as just a comedy hour. That's cool, man. That's super fucking intentional thinking about it, building it for five years. Wow. Yeah. That's the dream, man. I like to be able to pull that off is so cool. It must have taken a lot of work. It took a lot of work and luckily I got some benefits. Like, like, I don't know if you ever think about this. Like if you would book to sitcom, what a fucking loser you'd be now, what a non-creative loser you'd get sucked into this world. I think about it that if I had gotten this thing that I wanted, I wouldn't be a free performer. Right. And if I had put out this special two and a half years ago, I had to put it away for a few months and then I had to put away for COVID for a while. I came back to it with this fresh, fresh ideas and fresh mind. I could look at it from an outside perspective and all these setups were too long. I'm like, chop, chop, chop. I got to see it from an outsider and it was such a fucking blessing. Cool. This thing is so much fucking stronger now. Cool. And I want to start doing that with all my specials. Instead of recording it and going on vacation, going on a break, I want to put it away, go on break, come back, then we dust it off, see what's wrong, what's not good, see what's evergreen, what's not, then record it. That's fucking cool, Ari. It was, I'm so happy with it and I just want everybody to see it. I spent literally, I figured out 43% of my life savings on it. Wow. I don't want to sell it. I just want people to see it. Everybody go and watch Ari's amazing new special. What's it called? Jew. Jew. Very simple. It's on doles, YouTube, on the winner net. On the winner net.

One day your stepfather ran out of lube. He headed to the liquor store to buy more lube. And that's where he met your mother who was also buying lube. And it's love that makes the world go round. Tampa, Florida. America's most romantic city. I'm standing in the apartment of Richard Marks' son, Carl. In my hand is the cassette tape that contained the song that you just heard. In the other room, Richard Marks is making love to my wife. Why did I like Richard Marks and love to my wife? All this and more coming up. Hi, it's me, Duncan Trussell, host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. What you just heard is what you can expect if you don't fight back against the National Podcasting Association. The National Podcasting Association are using ancient artifacts to force American podcasters to record intros they don't want to record. I wanted to spend 20 minutes talking about how we're all connected and that we're all one thing and love is the most important thing there is. But instead of being allowed to do that, I had to sing a song about lube. If you don't want to see this kind of fungal creep wreck your favorite podcasts with lewd, lascivious and vulgar podcast intros, then you must fight back against the American Podcast Association. These depraved sorcerers have the five artifacts of Solomon. And until we retrieve them, then every American podcaster must bow to each of their wicked desires. And let me tell you, their desires don't stop with podcasting. I'll say no more on that topic. If you want to fight back, head to llm79.com and fill out the petition. We must retrieve the five artifacts of Solomon. We must close the portal. When I was in the Special French Forces, I found myself on the battlefield alone perched in a small, rooftop sniper's nest looking out onto the battlefield. My scope fell upon the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my life. I put down my gun and ran to meet her. Yeah, she was in the opposing force, but when our eyes met, it became clear that we were soulmates. We fell into the corn and would have made love, but I was unable to achieve an erection because of the stress of combat. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by bluechew.com. That's blue, like the color blue. Bluechew brings you the first chewable with the same FDA-approved active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis, so you know they work. You can take them any time, day or night, even on a full stomach, and since they're chewable, they work up to twice as fast as a pill. So you can be ready whenever an opportunity arises. I'm not going to bore you with some romantic combat story of failed love, but I am going to tell you this, I did try bluechew out. I'm not going to pitch some kind of medicine without eating it first for you. And it worked. It worked. It's a 45-year-old man I've experienced with this grade of drugs, and I can tell you it worked.

Bluechew is prescribed online and shipped straight to your door in a discreet package, so no in-person doctor's visits, no waiting in the pharmacy, and best of all, no more awkwardness.

All because of one of my friends, Baratas, and strange dreams and synchronicities. The stars aligned and I got to spend a little bit of time with Johanna Warren who has got to be one of the most talented folk singers I've ever listened to. Who is one? Reach for the sun Where we tried But that look in your eyes Made me blind So what if I didn't mind So what if I didn't mind Here's life at last We do shall pass Time moves slow I've got nowhere to go You still don't know So what if I told you so So what if you told me so Take from your dream There's more to see Don't deny What we saw in the sky Cleansed by fire So what if I am a liar So what if I am a liar So what if I am Now without further ado, everybody please welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast, Johanna Warren. It's the Dugga Trussell Family Hour. What is it called? I don't know. When people ask me what kind of music I make, I just say, I write songs and they are what they are. And I'm a song mom. It's not my job to judge them before they're born. I just birth them and then try my best to give them the life that they need in terms of production. You never really know what's going to come out. I don't like to try to direct it. Right. But yeah, there's a recurring sound for many artists. Totally. And sometimes there's artists who transcend that sound or take the risk, like the phases of an artist's life, where they're like, okay, I did that. Now I'm jumping into this new place. They're usually my favorite artists. David Bowie being the classic example. Bob Dylan did it. And it's such a risky, crazy thing to do because you piss off the fans. Yeah, it really requires a lot of courage. And usually once you've gotten to a certain point in the industry, you've got pressure coming from management and label to do the thing that worked already that we know we can make more money on. So on a lot of levels, it's like a bold move. And I really respect that anytime that any artist of any modality makes that decision to just throw caution to the wind and follow the current of inspiration wherever it's flowing. That's a rarity, I think. Truly. Yeah, it's a rarity. And I wonder, do you find yourself, because your music has this spirituality wound up into it that's clearly coming from a lot of personal work. Do you find that clashing against the growing realities of your success as a performer and the sort of pressures that are no doubt you're experiencing as you begin to step through that, you know, into the like, I don't know what you want to call it, but it's weird how sometimes it's weird. The Matrix. Yeah, I don't know. Honestly, it's kind of the only comforting refuge that I can take in this super chaotic ocean of information and data and opinions and people's agendas. I feel like I am so grateful for my inner world and my relationship with spirit, like whatever that looks like to me, just knowing that I've cultivated something really true and stable inside myself, that then it's kind of a litmus test against which I can like gauge every decision that needs to be made in my external world. It's like, does this align? Like, is this a yes? Like, when I align myself with like the forces in the universe that I want to be working with and working for, like, does this check out? You know, does this person check out? Does this deal check out? Yeah. And so it actually has become like a pretty manageable system of decision making where it's just like, if it's not a full body fuck yeah, then like, it's probably a no. There are some nuanced situations where I can like work on it and find the fuck yeah embedded in the like entanglement of like something less than ideal. Yeah. It's a big part of why I'm in LA actually to like to do that work of like having nuanced conversations with people in the industry where there's like a lot of stuff that I inherently kind of disagree with on systemic levels, but recognizing like I want to be a part of the collective conversation and like to do that in a meaningful way as I'm sure you know all about. Like you have to know how to work with people, imperfect people who are sometimes making choices that you don't necessarily agree with, but that you can kind of like wisely, masterfully align yourself with the parts of them that you do align with truly. You know, does that make sense? Absolutely. Yeah. This is the thing I'm discovering being married, which is that the there needs to be a constant reminder. That we're on the same team. Yes. And that underneath whatever, whatever it may be, there's real deep love. Yes. And the moment I drop into that, it just works. And within and of course this you I can extrapolate from that the identical realization with anyone I'm collaborating with, which is the moment you start thinking me, you. Yes. Sort of in some weird struggle over creating this thing or that, then it becomes like hellish. Totally. But the moment you realize, oh, we both had moms and we both want to make something that looks great in the world. We're in this together. Yeah. And I feel like just across the board, that's like the big collective paradigm shift that needs to happen if we're going to like survive on planet Earth as a species in any kind of way that I want anything to do with. It's like we need to evolve out of the like me against humanity and be like, it's like all of us, not even just all of us humans, but like all of us Earth beings. And so like are the choices that I'm making in alliance with that mission statement or am I still running some old paradigm program of like me against everyone else? Well, David Nick Turnu, I work with he teaches me about Buddhism meditation. One of the things he said is like, you know, sometimes when you cut the chicken's head off, its body still runs around. Meaning that sometimes like even when you start working at this mission as you're calling it, you're still dealing with the momentum of all the moments prior to that simple shift and thinking of like, oh, I don't need to win this game or that winning the game as we've been taught usually means losing the game. Like it's a weird game because the way to win is to lose sometimes and not to be the one that is like climbing on top of everybody. Right. That doesn't work. No, yeah, it's like you have to accept your like utter annihilation and defeat in the old paradigm in order to like succeed and thrive in the new paradigm, which is like kind of as far as I can tell like a non competitive collective. Like if I win, we all win because if we're all sharing the same vision where like everyone is here for a sacred purpose and I want to like invest my faith and energies into a future in which everyone gets to express that and live that. Then like we literally no one can win unless we all do. Do you find that because of your, you know, when you're a performer, the structure of performance is aesthetically hierarchical. Oh my God. Yeah. Right. I think about it all the time. And I do what I can to like actively subvert that like I really love playing house shows. And that's actually intentionally sort of the realm that I have like cultivated my practice because it's you show up and you're just a guest at the party and like sometimes you kind of have to like sneak off into a back room and like get in the zone. But I really like hanging out with people, like especially after like just talking and being available for like conversation and processing. And just because like I was such a fangirl when I was a kid and would just go to shows and be the spec in the ocean before these demigods up on stage and just being like, who are they? How did they come here? Like how do you possibly like get on the other side of that bubble? Yes. And actually, yeah, like my experience with iron and wine was like right out of the gates before I had done any solo touring. I got like picked up as like a backup singer for this like 13 piece iteration of iron and wine and like toward the world with them for a year. Wow. So my first touring experience was like two mega tour buses and like the nicest oldest theaters around the world and like audiences of thousands. So to get to like experience that like kind of a bit vicariously like it was like doing it with training wheels like someone else's project. I'm there to like blend into the background. It's not like my thing, but still to get to experience what that feels like and see like on the other side of the bubble was like so profoundly educational and like such a gift in so many ways. But one of the one of the things that I did notice was that even at that point, which you know, it was like seven years ago, but even at that point, a lot of people like, you know, were on their phones in the crowd and like had paid a lot of money to be there, but then weren't really having anything that resembled like an authentic personal experience. Right. So I like planted some seeds in my mind early on of just like how is there another way to do this like where we can really be like collectively like experiencing something authentic and like, you know, just like deep like dropping into a state of like deep presence with each other. Because I think, you know, the music industry in some ways is just really fucked. Like it's just all about like how many bodies can we cram into the same space so that we can sell as much beer as possible. Yeah. It's not weird. It's crazy. God, that's a real to that to me is just so that when you start understanding that the money is not prime is not only not primarily being generated from the ticket sales. But is being exponentially exceeded by the booze sales. Yeah. And really you're like essentially a lure to get people to go to a bar. Yes. That is a shocking moment. Yeah. It makes me it made me mad. Now I'm just kind of like laughing at it from outside of it. Yeah. Wow. That's weird. Yeah. But I want to talk a little bit more and I don't want to like spend a ton. No, I love talking about music and like this the business of music because I don't understand it very much. There are a few things I've always wondered about professional musicians and so I want to ask you. Okay. I may be the wrong person to ask, but I'm happy to chime in. Okay. I listen to your music. It's so heartfelt. It's so soulful. It's so beautiful. Thank you. And it's clearly coming from like deep emotions and deep vulnerability, but you've got to do that after driving somewhere after getting, you know, having to like fill the car up with gas and figuring out like when do I have time to take a shower? When do I have time to do this? When do I have time to do that? And then you have to like become a conduit to that space you were in. Yeah. That energy that came into you that inspired this song again and again and again and again and again. Yeah. How is that done? And what do you do when it just isn't there? Oh God, I think like everyone has their own strategies and coping mechanisms and a lot of people rely on drugs and alcohol to like make it bearable because it is like being a touring musician is like a pretty brutal path. And like I personally feel like, you know, that was like an option for me for a while like just going down the route of just like numbing myself and being in like a cycle of like substance abuse. Which substances? Mostly just alcohol for me and weed, you know, just kind of like it's a lot to handle and it's a lot of discomfort to hold in your body, like just sitting in a car for like seven hours a day and then sleeping on a floor. You know, it's like it can be really a lot. But there's I've recently like the last couple of years really been leaning into like mystical yogic practices really of just, you know, like really using the time in the car to like be circulating energy throughout my body and meditating while I'm stuck in traffic and like finding ways to create internal center and stability, like when everything around me is changing.

And I'm alone a lot of the time. I've driven myself around the country in a van by myself and played shows pretty much every night for three months. And that experience was just like I've never felt so close to God. You're like in one way just like in this like durational trust fall with the universe. People are like, you know, I get like a lot of comments, especially like as a young woman, like a lot of people are like, oh my God, like you're so brave for doing that. Like how do you survive? And I'm like, I've actually had really beautiful experiences across the board. Like just getting to receive like people's generosity and kindness and just good, good human stuff, you know, but in the times that it has felt dangerous, I realized that it's really like a projection of my own internal state. Like when I am in a state of internal chaos, like I attract chaotic events. And when I am like resting in a place of like peace and stillness, like everything is just so gentle. And that's, you know, it's a big generalization, but it feels really true for me at this point, based on like a decade of experience living this way. It's like, it's kind of a brutally honest mirror for me to look into of just like, am I like, am I aligned? Am I taking care of myself? Are my energies organized? And if they're not, like the universe like fucks with me, you know, and like the characters become increasingly like sketchy and nefarious, you know. Yeah. It's like direct feedback. Direct feedback. And that is so like this is a experience that I think the moment you just start catching on that that's happening, you're doing great. Yeah. Because before you catch on, then that's happening. Your life feels chaotic. Completely out of control. Yeah. And then suddenly you realize like, oh my God, what is this? And I go back and forth. I think the most, the least woo-woo-we explanation for it must be that we're just seeing our projections and everything. And then if you, you know, go into a house of mirrors and you're dressed like a skeleton, you're going to see a lot of skeletons. But in this case, in this house of mirrors, the skeletons actually, they do their own thing. And they're covered in other people's skin and they can be really quite terrified. So, yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about. And then when I get woo-woo-we about it, I think, oh, I guess we're just like, this is a, you know, where we're at neurologically, we can't understand yet that we are constantly traveling through parallel universes based on the rudder of our energetic state. Dude, it's so real. Like that's been such a, like, frequently occurring experience in my recent times of just like, like in real time, like feeling this like level shifting. Like if I say, like the first time I really noticed it. Yes? The first time I really noticed it, I was on a road trip with my friend and I had been like experiencing like kind of financial hardship, but not nothing too extreme. But I just like, I was stressed out and I stopped to fill the tank. We were driving their car and like I was putting gas in the tank. And then I said like, I was going to fill it up all the way. But then I was like, can I just put in 25? I'm like really broke right now. And those words came out of my mouth. And I just felt everything around like all the like blocks of the matrix, like just like shoots and ladders like back to the bottom of the board. And it's like, all right, you said it. We will make it so right now. And then I was like really struggling for months. Like it took me a while to like undo that spell that I cast on myself. Wow. And it is, it is a spell. Do you practice magic? Can you describe, you were talking a little bit about exercises you were doing to sort of energetically align yourself when you're driving. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what, if you had to encapsulate your practice, how would you describe it? I identify as a mystic just because like, I feel like I've had direct experiences with like divinity from a young age in ways that fell completely outside of any like religious dogma. And I've always pretty like, I have this like really rebellious rejection muscle that flexes whenever anyone tries to tell me how to do something, especially when it comes to like my relationship with God, because I'm like, I got it. Like thanks. I just like, you know, dreams are a huge part of my experience. Like I'm just like, from a young age, I've just been kind of gifted these like visionary states. Can you be a little more detailed about that? Yeah, for sure. Like the dream visions. Yes. Yeah. Well, the most striking actually have come from, I'm type one diabetic and so part of that is like extreme hypoglycemic states where your blood sugar is super low and your brain function is kind of cutting off. And I hypothesize that like a lot of DMT is being released because it's like you're in this liminal kind of near death, like near coma state. Yeah. So when that happens in the middle of the night while you're asleep, like for me, it has tripped my brain into like these states of just like experiencing death in these really beautiful ways. Like the first time it happened, it was probably like 10. And I just like came to in my dream standing in this invisible doorway that's like floating in this like ocean of light and color and sound like the music that I could hear was just like the most beautiful shit I've ever heard anywhere. And I was just standing in this doorway and I was just like, there was this consciousness, a conscious awareness that like this is death. I'm like experiencing death right now and it's beautiful. Like there was like waves of like brown mud and then like ethereal butterflies. And it was just like everything, you know? Wow. And then and at some point I realized like, oh, I need to wake up and drink some juice. But how close to death were you in that place? Like what were you? Could you have gone into a coma? Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can die. Like it's yeah, it's a super like mystical disease in that way. Like you're kind of like traversing liminal realms all the time. Right. Yeah. So that I do attribute that partially to like just kind of this like contact that was made at an early age with like the other side, the great beyond. That is very young to have to deal with your own mortality and the reality of how you can't, you could potentially just fade out totally part of the dream. Yeah, it's super interesting. Yeah. I mean, like, and it wasn't actually my first near death experience. Like I was kind of like, like, I don't know, just like jumping into the deep end of pools when I was two years old and just like kind of always walking this line. Yeah. And that was actually the, the, I've only sat with ayahuasca a couple of times, but the most recent time like I had this really intense experience where like everything got really dark all of a sudden, like just like the deepest, darkest blackness I've ever seen. And then all these little skulls come out and like line up and just start rattling. Yeah. And I was like, this is the end. Like my heart was like pounding and I thought I was going to die. And then this like really calm, like sexy grandmother voice comes in and it's just like, baby girl, you've been walking this line since you were a child. Wow. It was like a shaman's path. And like, it was kind of cool. It was like sort of like an invitation, like if you want to come to Peru and like study jungle medicine, like you're invited, but you don't have to, like you can keep doing whatever you're doing and like bring this into that. Yeah. Like the shamanic resonance. Was this happening on your plant medicine tour? No. So I was wondering that, so that the plant medicine tour was literally not, it's not like when we, most of us, when we hear plant medicines, we're thinking like a very few. Yes. That's right. So the year of plant medicine tour is actually a exploring grill, like medicinal plants, not just the. Yeah, herbalism. Like there were definitely some like CBD and THC products, but you know, it was mostly, it was not like I was like facilitating ayahuasca ceremony. Okay. So basically I was just like aligning with local herbalists and biodynamic farmers in every city that I visited and just like inviting them to be at the shows, like selling their tinctures and teas and signing up for CSAs and just to like connect. What's a CSA? Community supported agriculture. What is that? It's like, so if you're like an organic farm, you can ask people in your community to sign up for like a share of what you grow and it's delivered usually weekly. Oh, cool. Yeah. It's really cool. That's pretty amazing. So you don't have to go to the farmer's market. They just like deliver you a box of like whatever's in season. Gotcha. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I didn't mean to divert from this encounter with some kind of intelligence that's trying to lure you out into the jungle to show you something, which is seems like that a lot of people are getting that signal these days. Yeah. Well, a big part of it, a big part of those messages for me that have come from ayahuasca, which as an herbalist, I had a lot of resistance to participating in that culture actually, because I'm like, I'm interested in what grows locally and abundantly in our backyards. But ayahuasca is such a specific spirit and like, I feel like if she, when you hear the call, like you should eat it, you know, and especially for me, like I'm dealing with a chronic condition in my body that Western medicine is just like, you're fucked, like take this synthetic hormone for the rest of your life and give us like $1,500 just to stay alive every month. Oh my God. Yeah. So I was like, I'm kind of on this like radical mission to like find alternatives and see what can be done through like magic. Do you have insurance or is that like? Yeah, I have like Oregon based Medicaid. So it's, it's kind of an ongoing nightmare. Like I've actually been getting my insulin in Mexico because I saw you post about that and I thought, oh my God, not that Mexico is bad or that, you know, insulin in Mexico or whatever. It's just like the fact that we're having to do that insanity right now and that companies feel okay charging that much. And when you, you know, when you see like the various prices in different parts of the world, it's really a dark, dark flower growing from the weird tree of capitalism that somebody could actually say, look, it's a business. Okay. It's a business. Yeah. We don't give a fuck about your health, even though we're your health insurance company. It's not our problem. Yeah. Not our job. We want to make money. Yeah. It's not such a sad, hollow way to live. It seems like, and I'm sorry that you're having to deal with that. Are you able to buy a bunch of it when you go to Mexico or does it keep okay or? Yeah. If you have like a freezer pack, you can, it'll last up to like, I think the manufacturing company says it's good for like a year if it's refrigerated. So that's what I've been doing, just stockpiling, waiting for America to figure its shit out. Which I think is going to happen. It has to. Well, I mean, this seems to, this is always the weirdest part of evil or whatever you want to call it. Is evil and dumb or synonymous in the sense, you know, in the sense, I don't mean that all dumb people are evil, but I mean, there's a certain. Maybe ignorance. Okay. Let's say ignorance then. Fine. Because I know a lot of really sweet dumb people. Oh, okay. Sure. Fine. I hope I end up being one of them. I'm, I consider myself dumb. So it's, I'm sorry for the dumb people of the world. If I'd seen like, I was like, listen, I'm not, I didn't go to Stanford. Let's just put it like that. But the, what I meant is like in movies, you know, evil is always made to be somehow like really somewhat intelligent, clever, plotting, planning. But then when you see it, it always seems like ridiculously blunt in the sense that if you overcharge long enough for a medicine, there is going to be some kind of uprising that is going to all down the road mess up your business and cause people to get so mad at you and cause regulations to come into place that you're going to end up losing more money. Maybe. I hope I pray. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I feel like it's like an intelligence of the heart that is lacking. You know, you can be like scheming in your brain and you're, I mean, at right now, like, they're right. Like they don't have to, it's not profitable for them to like want to cure a disease like type one diabetes. Like they're killing it. But at some point, and I feel like that's where like just the collective paradigm shifting comes into play. It's like, it's evolution. Like I take great comfort in knowing, in believing in evolution and knowing that like we are part of nature. And like as of now, there's like this tremendous imbalance and like humanity is growing like cancer on the earth. But like nature knows what to do to like rebalance herself. And like what that looks like, I think is like humans developing like psychic ability and like remembering how to like think with their hearts and their bodies and get out of the like scheming Dr. Evil, like money based left brain approach, you know, I want to talk about the idea that some of these ailments that have plagued humans for as long as there have been humans actually have cures in existence right now that we don't even know about. Because they're happening in the jungles, they're happening off the map. And it seems like this is what you're being called to sort of explore and to work with. But you know, when my mom was dying, she went to see John of God. And you know, I'm talking about a faith healer who ended up being a complete fraud, obviously scamming people. I think he was a rapist. He was like, of course, you know, literally every bad thing you could imagine. About him, he did. And I remember the hopefulness that my mom had when she went to see him. And I remember like the secret underneath all my cynicism, the secret hopefulness I had, because I was like, well, who the fuck knows? Maybe it works. I've heard that people went there and were healed. And anyway, it didn't work. He actually said to her, you will not die of cancer. Now he was couldn't have been more wrong. And so though I do grok that there is got to be other solutions than the ones that are currently on the map, so to speak. I also get real nervous because there's so much room for not just exploitation, but for lack of self-care. Absolutely. Disguised as self-care when you're just using it. So give me some hope. What is the place where that isn't happening in the world? Inside yourself. I think I get really nervous when anyone is asking you to invest faith in them as your healer. Because even with my first ayahuasca experience, I showed up and the quote-unquote shaman. I almost just turned right around because I was like, you're not a shaman. You are a 23-year-old Brazilian man who plays guitar pretty well. He's looking at the floor doing the bashful indie rock shtick of just like, thanks for coming, you guys. And I was like, this is not shamanic space-holding. I think I need to go. But then I was like, okay, actually I drove six hours to be here and I need to have a good experience right now. And I know how to facilitate that for myself and I know how to tune out 80% of what's happening in the room around me. I've heard some really scary stories actually about people going to the jungle. I actually just met this guy on tour who I mentioned that I'd done ayahuasca and he freaked out. He was like, never do that again. I spent a year of my life in the jungle and the people I was working with were brujas. They were harvesting human souls basically. And that's a thing. That's actually a thing that people do. What do they do with the souls? Use it for their own power, I guess. People die. There are some shamans who are operating not purely aligned of the way and using human energy in their own dark sorceress practices. This is to me the really kind of weird thing about being a westerner. People have this crazy idea that it's like a small world ride everywhere you go. And that things work according to the way we understand it here. So these people are going over there and they're like, oh, you know, it's like the cool part of the small world ride. It's going to be completely safe. I'm going to have some kind of like cool, wild experience. Maybe I'll find myself or there'll be something, but I know it's pretty much going to be safe. Yeah, because I'm a white person and I paid $6,000 to be here. Who would take advantage of me? Who would ever take advantage of me? Meanwhile, it's a completely different metaphysical ecosystem out there. We have this crazy hubris in our scientific materialism. For most people, they don't even know the word sorcerer when they go over there. They have no idea who they're working with. They spend less time thinking about who they're going to be slurping back a potent brew that's going to allow you to travel through the astral realms than they do about where they're going to eat. PS, as far as I'm aware, and maybe this would be something someone out there could make for us. A yelp for shamans. Oh my God. Because there's no credentialing system. And I don't know how many times I've met varieties of the emo dude who's like, I'm a shaman. Yeah. And it's like, who are you? Really? Because it's like, and to me, the other part of it, which is some kind of, I don't know what you would call it. But it's like, if I go to get my, I don't know, appendix removed, I'm not a surgeon. I just got my appendix removed. Now, if I met someone on the street who's like, listen, I do basement surgeries. And I'm going to teach you like, here's how you do it. Cut here, cut there, pull it out, put the thing in and then sew it up. Maybe you could say I'm a surgeon in a civil war sense. Like if it was the apocalypse, I think I could sew you up. But these people are going over to these places where the tradition is one of where it's so intently studied. It's like medical school. Yes. Well, yeah, because the energy body, I mean, the subtler layers of the body, which is like all energy is like every bit as real as your appendix and people who cultivate that awareness and know how to work on those planes are like actually doing real things to your body. And I think that's just like so not a part of like how most of us are trained to think about things. It's just all like fun, psychedelic tourism. You know, it's like, we don't want to think about the fact that people actually die. We don't want to actually do the like diethas to like purify ourselves before engaging with this intense plant medicine. Even though like we receive the email like protocol two weeks in advance, it's like, do not eat red meat. Do not drink alcohol. Do not have sex. And we're just like, yeah, but I'm white. You know, I don't mean red wine. They don't mean sex with my boyfriend. Yeah, they're talking about like sex on ecstasy or something. It'll be fine. And then, and then, yeah, and then they go there. And then, but then also there's another thing that happens is that people go over there who have bipolar. Yeah. And they have manic episodes and then they will hurt themselves. Yeah. Literally commit suicide, like hurt themselves. And so, and this to me is like, and I don't, I don't mean to take things on a dark course here, but with all this, I love psychedelics. And because I love psychedelics, I have many friends who love psychedelics. And also I have people who will convey their stories of psychedelics to me. Yeah. And the only one that I keep hearing crazy shit about is ayahuasca. Yeah. It's the only one that's like putting people into states of consciousness that are hospitalizing them. Yes. Well, you know, I think a big thing about it is like what I said before about like, you know, it grows in the Amazon. We're not in the Amazon. Like I think in general, like as an herbalist, I really like interacting with plants on like a spirit level and like a personality level. And like, who are you? What are you offering? And like, what is like, what are your requirements for like a healthy relationship? Because like she especially is like a badass bitch. And she's like, this is how I like to be approached. This is how like, if you approach me this way, I will fuck you up. Like I might fucking kill you. You know, because like it's like, yeah, it's like you wouldn't call like a car mechanic and be like, hey, my toaster is broken. You know, like you, you got to know who to call, like given like what you're working with. And ayahuasca, I think is like an incredibly potent healer and like tool for certain conditions. What conditions? Well, I mean, like I got to say like what what I'm dealing with like type one diabetes where it's just like there's an I've looked so many places and there's like not any promising info out there for like, or like stories of anyone reversing it. But like ayahuasca, like my experiences with that plant medicine are like fucking intense. Like it's like psychic surgery and like really like above and beyond any experiences that I've had on, you know, mushrooms or anything that's like locally available here. You know, and that's like why I've allowed myself to with great reverence and respect like approach that plant. Yeah, because I'm like, you know, if there was something growing here that like was offering similar properties, like I would go to that, but it's not. So and I felt like invited by her, you know, like she found me in dreams and was like, there's something here for you and like come talk to me. And I got to say like, you know, I totally hear you and everything that you're saying about just the dangers of it. And it's not like I'm not like broadcasting saying like, hey, everybody. It's like actually quite the opposite. I'm like, I think the amount of people doing it is like a like disaster and a travesty. And like there's nothing okay about that. And the circles that I've sat in like the psychic energy of those spaces and those people have like deeply freaked me out and disturbed me. Like when people start making it like kind of an addictive ritual practice, I'm like that this is not. This is not what this plant wants or how she presented herself originally, you know. Well, welcome to America. Yeah, 2019. Welcome to America. You know, it's like, wait, 50 years, you'll buy it at 711. There'll be an ayahuasca dispenser. But this is sort of the I think this is one of the interesting things about interconnectivity and also the beginning of this like incredible sort of centrifuge, like mixing that's happening where we're seeing like the interim states. I think one of, you know, some of my friends are really offended by the way Buddhism is being monetized. And some some of my friends are really offended by the sort of callous or careless rather way that people are invoking using magic. And then, you know, there's there's always this sense of like, this is a sacred thing. You don't know what you're doing. And if you do it the wrong way, at the very least, you're being rude. You know, at the very most, you're you're going to hurt yourself. Yeah. And but I just think we have to get through that part. And so, you know, one of the things I love about Buddhism is it's the way it is. It doesn't really it's going to grow in whatever soil it lands in. And the way it's going to grow is it's going to warp into whatever the ecosystem happens to be where it lands. I think that's why it's so such a perfect religion for the times that we're in. And then when people are like, they're the mindfulness people are making money off of the Dharma. And it's like, actually, I think if Buddhism is really going to meet the West, that it's going to take money. It's going to take all the components that people are like using as their religion, which in the West that is for a lot of people it is we're entering a religious period. Or people are pretending they're not religious when they're worshiping the Dala that money. Yeah. The money. It's money and all the stuff that comes from money and all the their relationship with money is very religious. It's a religious attitude because, you know, many people I could like throw a crucifix on the table and say incinerate it. Here's a here. Let's set it on fire. We'll put some, you know, but if I put a $20 bill on the table, they're not going to treat it with their reverence. They would, you know, a religious item and paper, both of them ultimately, you know, meaningless. Have you seen the Holy Mountain? Yeah. It's been a while. That's like the first thing he gets everybody to do on his like spiritual quest team. He's just like, bring out all your money, like throw it in the fire. Yeah. Step one. Step one. If you want to climb the Holy Mountain. Yeah. You got to burn your money. And that's a funny thing. I mean, I think, you know, it's illegals. I'm not saying do it, but if you did want to do it, an illegal act, which you shouldn't do. If you really want to feel, like feel it. Yeah. If you want to do some blasphemy, I think people are hungry for blasphemy. You know, like, like it's, it's, we want to blaspheme and there's something quite nice about blaspheming. And so before we had the black mass, you know, and it was like, this is great. You break into a church. You fuck on an altar. You, you, you, you like desecrate and you do this awful stupid shit, which is really just another. It's just, it's just Christianity. Let's face it. It's like another form of Christianity, but it's like all the oppression you've experienced in the, like your infinite contact with patriarchal piggies who are telling you how to act. You go to hell. They're fucking your kids. You just get to blow, blow, just blow off all the steam and you've, you know, eat. I think you eat, come and that's the communion. But now it's like, you can't, I'm sure there's places where you can go and do that like as a party or something. You know, it's not so intense at all. In fact, I think I've heard of clubs in LA where you can do that. And it's like, whatever, there's nothing there to blaspheme anymore, but burning money, having a black mass with currency. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it kind of, kind of brings to mind like fin doming financial doms. Yeah. Like, like people are like paying good money to be financially humiliated and like be robbed. It's like, just like wear stilettos and like stand behind me and like make me take out all my money from this ATM and like, you can just keep it. I feel like it is this like interesting karmic like leveling of the scales. Nature is taking care of it. Yeah. Like recently like a rat in India, like, like there was like an ATM that was like out of order mysteriously for like a week. And then they finally opened up and there was a rat who had just like eaten like 500,000 dollars. Good for that rat. Gorge himself. Yeah. Like of course it's like a rat in India. Like that sounds like a Twilight Zone episode. Like so that sounds like a bad genie wish or something like, I'll give you 500,000, but you're a rat. You eat money. Well, the, the. So, but to get back to the ayahuasca blasphemy or specifically the DMT blasphemy, which is my mind does go there. My mind, like I, you know, with a lot of the psychedelics, my mind does and only just because I've been spanked so many times for doing it the wrong way that it's just like I'm not pragmatic to treat it respectfully. Yeah. And another part of me that thinks, well, maybe the idea is not for me to try to imagine that the West is going to suddenly become respectful of the sacred qualities of nature. But really realize that that just isn't going to happen. There's a disconnect that's happened with the earth and that the way to reconnect is not going to be to get people to act differently than the way they're already acting. As they approach this thing or that thing, whatever it may be, whether it's Buddhism, ayahuasca, I think we're entering into an age where we must find solutions that are based on the world as it is. Right. Not the way it could be. Yeah. That's interesting because like in some ways I feel like I spend a lot of time like encouraging myself and others to like think optimistically and like towards like, you know, visions of the future that they're really psyched about living in. But I think it's both. Like I think it's like accepting things as they are with an understanding that like within each of us as we are, there is actually like a sincere desire to do better. That's right. And like learning how to like really, you know, not be stupid about it. Not like assume that people are going to like magically like have some like massive spiritual awakening overnight and like just do everything differently. But like knowing like, you know, we're all full spectrum beings and like we're all like really fucked up and doing stupid horrible things all the time. And like we're children of God and like we want to like find our way back to Eden, you know, that sounded so much more Christian than I am. Well, I mean, you actually, you know, I love that I love the story of Eden and I especially all of the mystical inaccessible geographical locations that appear mythology Valhalla Shambhala. It's interesting. These places and Burning Man, which seems to be to me, I sometimes think of it as a very temporary incarnation of one of these mystical cities. Wow, I love that. There's not enough like energy to support it in this part of the universe. So it can only last for a certain amount of time. But it does seems like it's probably one of the legendary cities or the shadow of one of those cities. I love that. Black Rock City. But the does not sound very mystical when you hear it. But when you see it, it is anyway, that I think what you're saying, which is finding our way back to that place. Yeah. And is part of it. And the other part of it is thinking like, okay, we really a lot of people I've pretty much across the board, whether you're talking to a scientist. A shaman, a cleric, priest, mystic, anyone across the board. It's rare that you might find people who are going to say, oh, everything's perfect. That doesn't mean we don't have work to do. We're not dead. Yeah. It doesn't mean the planet's not going to die. It doesn't mean the experiment worked. If the experiment meant that humans were going to find harmony with nature, but everything's perfect. Right. No one looks at a black hole eating a star and is like, oh, God, look at that evil black hole destroying the star. It's perfect. Yes. So, but usually what you're going to get is people saying like, well, here's what's happening. It's the age of Kali Yuga. It's the apocalypse. We're entering the great time of change. We're entering a time of great turbulence. We're entering a time of unsustainability. We're going to run out of the soil. Is it going to support food? We're going to run out of oil. We're going to run out of bees. We're going to run out of some primary insect that fucks the food chain up to the point that food stops growing. And then we're going to see massive, massive, massive death. Yeah. And that's one of the pathways to paradise, unfortunately, is a massive die off of humans. It is probably necessary. I think that's unfortunately one of the, one of, I don't think it's necessary at all. But I think that it's kind of like one of those things where we, you, you don't want the boss to show up to do the job. You know, ever. Yeah, to avoid it. Yeah. Like, and especially if you've been getting like email after email after email after email after email after email. Asking you nicely, then like a little less nicely. Yeah. I'm getting pretty harsh. Yeah. Yeah. Like, yeah, exactly. The next thing that you want is for that to step in. And, you know, look at the, we're like sitting on top of massive oceans of lava. It's not as though the earth, if the earth is a super organism, couldn't get a fever and couldn't do the exact same thing we do to whatever part of our biome is causing us problems. Yes. Yes. I think the worst case scenario for us, probably the best case scenario for like whatever, but that being said, if you look at the other story, and which I feel like you're someone who is more familiar with that other story than I am. You know that there is this very potentially tragic, poignant opportunity, possibility. Yeah. Because we're so interconnected now. And because we can get messages to each other instantaneously. Yeah. If there were a simple kind of E equals MC squared equation, a viral equation for people to reconnect with the planet. Yeah. And re prioritize. Yes. And someone could articulate it or a group of people could articulate it or it could be articulate through music or art. Then that wouldn't take very long to spread all around the entire planet. And meaning that it's weird how we're always like three days away from a completely harmonious, perfect, beautiful place. Three days away. Yeah. It's three days of people being like, Oh, monies. Oh, I just don't want my stuff. If everyone, everyone somehow getting fantasy world here, but everyone was like, I don't really want my stuff anymore. Yeah. Oh, you can live in my house. Oh, you can have my car. I don't really care about it anymore. You can have all of my islands in my private and everyone did that somehow a virus broke out that made people deeply selfless. Then we would have enough for everybody. Absolutely. And the world would turn into some kind of insane planetary festival that wouldn't end. Yeah. And so it's just a matter of like, are we going to like do that for ourselves and like, you know, take the bosses increasingly harsh emails to heart and like change the way we do things? Are we going to wait and like get ourselves fired? You know, and because either way, I feel optimistic that like, I mean, nature knows what it's doing. We're part of nature. It's going to be what it is. It's going to be perfect. You know, but it's like up to us whether we want to change our lives now or like keep living in hell. So as a musician and a traveler and a nomad, you are encountering the people before the internet, before the Instagram, before the tweets, before. So when I was touring, that was one of the things I loved so much. And even though the sample size, so to speak, that I was encountering is based on people who are coming to see me do stand up and therefore not necessarily an accurate way to really get a sense of what's happening in the world. I would always leave tours thinking like, it's way better than we think it is. Yes. Yes. Yes. Have you gotten that sense or have you gotten any messages like that? Yeah. I mean, you know, I mean, like doing that plant medicine tour was like one, like, like you said, like there's a kind of a filtration system in place, like just the kind of person that would show up at an event that's like advertised as like a plant medicine tour, you know, there's like some self-selecting factors at play there. And that was certainly like an extremely optimism inspiring experience just to get to go to like 70 cities in the US and see people who are like devoting their lives to like harmonizing with nature and like making locally grown herbal medicines available to people. So that was rad. But also I've had vastly different qualities of touring experience like opening for like a super brutal like black metal band and like traveling in the back of their van and like, you know, the crowds were coming to see them. Wait, what band was that? It's called Zaster. X-A-S-T-H-U-R. That's one thing I missed when I was researching this somehow. I'm sorry. I missed that. But also that's a thing where like if I had to like, I would never have guessed that. It was beautiful. It was like, and the people that I met on that trip, like that was so optimism inspiring too in like this whole other way where it's like, you know, this sector of society that I think carries a lot of stigma. And in some ways of like intentionally like aesthetically anyway, like alienated themselves and like want to be perceived as like the blackest hearts of America, you know? But it's like just actually hanging out with them. I'm like, oh my God, you guys are like so sweet, like such sweeties and care so much and just have such strong feelings. Like, and that's why you come to like have every cell of your body vibrated by sound. Like it's really cool. It's like sound healing, you know? Oh, for sure. I mean, and also like if you think that stuff is not religious music, then you've never been there. You're making contact with God. It's just like that side of God, you know, that's a special taste. People want to hang out with Shiva. I love it. Hell yeah. I do. You do. I know offense to Shyvites and certainly no offense to the destroyer of worlds, but I'm more of like a Vishnu Buddha person right now. No, and that's okay. But I certainly get it. Like it's a beautiful and real and authentic assessment of life as it is. If you, if you, um, I was just looking like I saw some clip popped up of one of Rogan shows where someone was pointing out. Listen, if you are want to grow beans, you're going to have to get rid of all that whatever was living in the bean fields. Right. You're going to kill a lot of stuff. You're going to kill a lot of furry little friends. Yeah. And so, you know, somehow people don't want to like look at that particular phase of the cycle of energy that we're in. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I was like a very zealous vegan for like 10 years. And then like at some point that dawned on me. It was really when I started getting into plant intelligence and like and farming a lot. And like, I was like, oh, wow, like death is just a really inherent part of the cultivation of any life. Like if you're growing organic vegetables and a bunny comes into your garden wanting to eat your cabbage, like the farmer's going to shoot that little bunny. And like, even if something looks like a vegan meal on your plate, like there's a lot of plant and animal death. Sometimes I mean, if you're not sourcing your vegetables responsibly, it's responsibly a lot of human illness and death. Like if you're looking at like Monsanto crops and pesticides, like it's also so much more complicated than we like to think it is. Isn't that it though? It's that's the main thing is it's like it's nuanced. It's so nuanced that the black and white perception of the world is not inaccurate. Yeah, it's always going to be wrong. It's wrong. Yeah. You're dealing with not just like the fact that the millions of different variables that go into getting anything that you're eating or drinking to you. Yeah. It involves some level of suffering. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all pretty entangled and gnarly right now. And I think even if we remove civilization from the planet, evaporate human beings all together, you're still dealing with like, you know, fungus that can get into the brains of crickets and, you know, make them climb up onto trees and like explode. Oh, yeah. This is not an invitation. They're there for fuck it. I think it's more along the fungus. Yeah. Yeah. Be the fungus. By the way, I have friends who, you know, their point of view on the thing is a mystical version of that, which is like, listen, hippie, you want your burn, you want your global burning man. Okay, you do that. But what we're going to do is accelerate the apocalypse because it's better that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And not in the sense of like literally like do some kind of ISIS shit, but more along the lines of just like, Let's just push it. Like that's going to happen. Like the scales need to tip at some point. So let's just get it over with. Yeah. If we have to throw up, let's throw up. Yeah, exactly. And unfortunately, the throw up they're talking about is literally a kind of like, I don't hate it. And I think it's, to me, it's like fine, you do that. But my feeling is there is, and I think many of us are getting this sense, there's something right in front of us. Your version of it is, I think there's a way to cure diabetes. My version of it is, I think there's some kind of like memetic, viral, super condensed philosophy that has yet to be articulated. That will cause a kind of like massive decentralization, a massive release of attachment to the stuff that people are attached to. Yeah. And as, and all the other stuff will fall into place naturally. Yeah. A kind of nonviolent revolution as Bob Thurman puts it. But if you are sort of like, let's imagine, and this is a really terrifying story that Bob Thurman actually told, which was that apparently the Buddha went to visit, I don't know, Indra. I can't remember which God, maybe Brahmin, the Kree, I don't know, the King, I don't know. Let's just God for just for the sake of. Somebody important. Not being like, I don't know, accurate God. So Buddha in the process of waking up, sitting under the Bodhi tree, goes and visits God with the intent of asking God, how do I get rid of suffering on this planet? How do I help it so I can alleviate the suffering of all sentient beings? And God seeing Buddha says, and all the gods are, he's like in this like, you know, royal palace and all the gods are there. We've got all of them. Vishnu, Shiva, Kali, they're all hanging at Ganesh. And God, I think it was Indra, but I can't. Anyway, God sees Buddha is like, hey, you don't, you don't have an appointment, basically. Like I want to talk to you, but I'm doing something right now. So I'll talk to you later. So Buddha goes back to the Bodhi tree and then God appears and says, listen, I heard your question. And I got to tell you something that I couldn't say in front of the gods, which is I didn't make this. I was just the first one here. Oh, wow. It's like one of those party games. Yeah, yeah. You've done it. Wow. And then the younger gods, the God started appearing and they treated me like daddy because I was the oldest one. And I let them think I'm their dad, but I'm not. And I don't know who did it or what it is. So maybe you can figure it out for me. So if you were the one who suddenly came into this unfortunate situation, as Robert Anton Wilson puts it, by the time the final trick of the Illuminati is you realize by the time you realize that you're a member, it's too late to get out. You know, just a gradual sort of like process of being like groomed to the point of suddenly like, oh, oh, shit, I am in the Illuminati. Oh, shit, it's real. But then I think there's another trick after that, which is you realize you're the leader of the Illuminati, because no one else would ever want to do it except you. And now you find yourself in this really difficult predicament, which is that you have to figure out a way to do what's best for everything on the planet, not just people. And what would you do? What would be your solution if you suddenly realized like shit, man, not only am I the one deactivating the bomb, I'm the one like talking to the person deactivating the bomb, telling them how to do it. What do we do is what I'm asking you. What do we do? Damn. That's, that's a big question. You're the leader of the Illuminati. Wow. Congratulations. I guess it's all about like realizing that you too are the leader of the Illuminati. Like it's like really like I would, I would want to like immediately deflect that projection and say like I am and so are you. I feel like that's like the defining age, the defining factor of like this age of like spiritual awakening is like we can't look to each other for that kind of authority anymore. Like it's like all about like realizing and I think that's why like Buddhism is like really enjoying this like resurgence right now in like modern times. And I think it's like at the heart of mystical Christianity too is just like it's what everybody's been saying for a long time that has gotten twisted into all kinds of different shit. Like it's like I am God and so are you. Like I'm saying this not as like a narcissistic power trip. Right. I'm just embodying a quality of presence that is possible and like you all need to do that yourself. Like I can like share what I have seen in like visionary states and like what God has told me what I have told myself when I'm like in my like highest power. But like what works for me isn't necessarily what works for you. I don't think it's like, yeah, I don't know. I guess very wise. It's very interesting to get to just be asked that question and to witness the amount of like panic that arises in me instantly. It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like don't do that. Like. Yeah. Which is fascinating because I'm sure. Do you experience that? Like I mean you you're someone who like puts yourself out there like that a lot of people look up to as a leader and like an authority on like spirituality. Sometimes yeah. Yeah. Like it's how do you deal with that. I deal with it. I've dealt with that in different phases of realizing that is a phenomena that happens. Yeah. So right now the way I'm dealing with it is I keep thinking of this story heard about Gandhi. Stop me if you've heard the story, which is that a mother brings her child to Gandhi and says he won't stop eating sugar. Can you help? I can't make him stop and Gandhi said, well, come back in a month. And so she comes back in a month and Gandhi looks at the kids as you stop eating sugar. And the mother's like, it took you a month to tell him to stop eating sugar and Gandhi's as well. I wanted to make sure I could stop eating sugar. That's so beautiful. Yeah. So I think of like in relation to this sort of like realization that in some way shape or form we're all interconnected in this beautiful matrix of responsibility. We're all nodes in the web and your net of Indra the jeweled net of Indra. And I so I think of John Paul sorry you said anything you do you give permission for the world to do. Yes. So what that would mean would be if I were or you were or any one of us wanted to do this insane and very anxiety potentially anxiety provoking thought experiment of imagining that we were the leader of this or that you call it whatever you want. We were God we were Buddha we were this or that and we kind of like unfortunately got a little high on our own identity to the point where the world that normally we would be in some way shape or form. Harmonizing got a little out of balance. It's like waking up in the morning and realizing that you let the dogs weren't in the kennel and now they've shit all over the house and it's like what do we do. So but in this case I think it's a very simple solution which is if you can't stop using plastic bottles all the time. If you can't stop driving more than you need to drive whatever the thing is that you have analyzed as being the problem of the world. If you can't stop it. We're all doomed. Forget it. We're done. Forget it. So if you can't be compassionate if you can't be more gentle if you can't be kinder and in a real pragmatic way because those things are non quantifiable. If you can't stop eating beef. If you can't stop doing the obvious shit smoking cigarettes what a drinking booze all the fucking time if you can't stop destroying your body. Then the planet's done because everything's going to reflect you. Right. You're the microcosm and since the plague of narcissism is swept across the West and every single one of us are really dealing with a very painful situation that is human selfishness. Then I think the answer must be to instead of imagining people are going to stop being narcissistic selfish self absorbed Instagramming. Fame hungry money. And I'm talking about myself. You don't hear like sons who says no the fucking bad tour if you don't know the terrain you're dead meat man. Yeah. So I know my terrain. Yeah. Selfish aggressive tendencies and I lazily leave lights on and use plastic bottles. Yeah. I don't recycle when I can. Yeah. And I used to eat beef all the fucking all this stuff. It's like first. All right. What can I do here. Yeah. I feel you man. Yeah. Like I'm I'm like a musician and on some level that sounds so nice. But then like the reality is like I make my living driving and flying around the planet burning fossil fuels and like peddling plastics. Like on some level you know like buy my LP and it's like what's that made of and how did I get here. There are so many levels to it and I yeah that's I'm very very intrigued to just like apply all of my like big picture thinking to like my little life and see like OK. Like how can I actually do like much much better and like preserve the thing that feels sacred and essential and like what I actually want to be doing while like cutting down on all those other things that I want nothing to do with in my in theory. You know. But it's like it's it's a real predicament. We've gotten ourselves into money to function and what we think we think we do. And it seems like we do. And like all that stuff because the mind is like my mind at least right away does go to like well I know what I'm going to do. Right. I'm going to give it all away. Yeah. And I'm going to take the family will figure out a way to let get them to let us into Bhutan. And I'll just go live in Bhutan. I'll just go be a hermit and my wife of course would be like well I guess we're going to put you in the mental hospital. You're having a manic episode Duncan. You know what I mean. But that is what my manic mind goes to. When it's like actually there's really. One thing I'll tell you and when you say things like this you sound obnoxious because you're sounding correct corrective. I'm I'm I'm I'm saying if there is an apocalypse happening right now. And if every the apocalypse is the sum total of all phenomena within the apocalypse breaking down. Then you can only handle the part of the apocalypse that you are sitting in. You don't have to worry about the rest of the apocalypse. The rest of the apocalypse will take care of itself. Right. So if we're going to do an apocalypse then let's make our part of the apocalypse is gentle and sweet. Wow. Like there's a there's like your dream when when the angels and the butterflies were there. Let's make it like that. Or I heard once there's a book of like there's a book of like the last things there the black box recordings of planes crashing. Oh my God. And one of them was the pilot just started singing a lullaby. Wow. It's like the end of Titanic that part is always the one that kills me when like the fiddler is like. That's right. One more time. That's all it's been an honor playing with you. Yeah. That's how I want to go down to you. Yeah. It's like what you just said is like the kind of shadow flip side of that Jack cornfield thing you talk about all the time about like tending to your. Tend to the part of the garden. You can touch. Tend to the part of the apocalypse you can touch. That's right. And the thing is really what is the apocalypse. It's the lifting of the veil. It's the grand final realization of our own interconnectivity. Yeah. And it's pretty trippy if like anything the Bible has to say about it is true. It's like a pretty wild ride. Pretty wild ride. But you know all you know that shit aside and again that's more mind stuff. The reality is it's like you can do an assessment of your own life. You don't have to move to Bhutan. You don't have to become a vegan. You don't have to become a vegetarian. You don't have to cancel your tour. You don't have to whatever. But there is like you know there's nuance and actually like you know hearing you say that which is such a reflection of where I go to in my mind like all the fucking time like well I should just become a nun and like I'm a Buddhist monk like sitting on a tree. I'm a Buddhist monk like sitting on a mountaintop and like renounce everything but I'm like actually like I feel like my karma in this lifetime is about like integration and and how to like be in and of this like fucking crazy like urban matrix. Yeah. While like really cultivating the inner peace and like modeling that for people and like trying and failing to model that well like in the chaos of the modern world. I feel like Rom Des talks about that about like why he lived in New York City. You know he's like this is like the hottest fire I could imagine. Like it would be easy to like be up on a mountaintop chilling like I'm here to be like trans transmuted by this like burning hot alchemical fire. Yeah. And I think so. Yeah. And I think the cave desire is like sorry that's not not available to you like that it sounds like an easy way out like you just don't get to do that. Like bless everyone who is like sitting in caves meditating and praying for world peace right now like we need them and that's like that's a very specific role in the global ecosystem that I'm super glad certain individuals are holding down. But when I think about like what I'm here to do in this lifetime it's like I'm supposed to be having nuanced conversations with myself about like is this like for the greater good you know even though I'm like burning hell of fossil fuels and selling plastic like is does it make it does the music make it worth it does do like the human interactions I'm having around the music make it worth it. And it's like yeah right now yes and I want to get better at like balancing the scale so that it's even more of like a clear fuck yeah like win win situation. Well yeah we incarnated in a time where like basically just existing is like inherently you're part of the problem. Sure. Happy birthday. Yeah. And you're fine. Like yeah I mean my god like to happy birthday. It would suck if you stopped flying and touring it would suck for a lot of people who really want to like have that experience of listening to your music live and like there is a not a tricking yourself responsibility in in that which is that you were given because you were given talent and you were given a voice and then you were given visions and then you were given the good fortune that brought you to a place where you are now a professional artist living off of your art which is already a a miracle of miracles. And so therefore it's like to then suddenly abandon your duties is similar to that Bhagavad Gita Krishna going off into the forest. It's like no. Yeah. You have to fight. Yeah. Yeah. That actually when you just described that it sounds like that would be extremely ungrateful of me to just be like yeah well thanks for the gift but like fuck you like I don't want your gift. Yeah. What cave by the way and then you get to the cave and like you know they're all filled up and people are like sorry we waited a thousand incarnations to get into this freaking cave you go play music right now. But we need you to play music for us. You know because because that's like whether it's the Titanic is sinking or whether the Titanic is about to transform into a interconnected sentient techno hive that sort of opens up portals to various parts of the multiverse. That we've many of us have already been taking excursions into through plant medicine or you know various psychedelics or visionary trances. The reality of the situation is you are where you're at. Yeah. And I love to think of like man what if people got airdropped into this dimension in the way people got airdropped into like World War Two except something happened where we all got amnesia. Meaning that we sort of like have a like we don't really remember our marching orders so much except we know we're here and that there is seems to be a need for kindness. And then I don't know after that. You know. But yeah. But you still I'm sorry to hold you. I'm keeping you all too long. You didn't answer my question. You are the NPS you did make me kind of like a co-aluminati leader with you which I appreciate. But because I am a co-aluminati leader therefore sharing the same power as you. I use my power to remove myself from the Illuminati and I make you the sum total of the Illuminati the leader and therefore meaning that you and I remove from you the ability to make me anything to do with these lunatics. The cultists whatever they are whatever you guys are what do we do. Give us our marching orders if you had to and I don't mean to put you on the spot and whatever you say of course this is just a fun game but what do we do. Listen to my album on Spotify and help me rack up fractions of pennies so that I can sell more plastics. And like just love like love more. Do you feel bad for saying love more. I do. It's not a popular opinion. I mean I feel I feel not bad but like slightly scared because when you look through history and look at the people who have like gotten up in front of people and said like hey everybody just love each other and like don't kill each other and just try to be a good person. They usually get murdered. Right. Jesus Christ like Martin Luther King you know it's it's it's a surprisingly unpopular opinion to just be like yo love everyone. I mean Ram Dass he's doing he's doing all right. Well I mean maybe it's a spoiler. I don't know. Maybe like it's kind of like listen. Yes. But don't tell me the end of fucking Game of Thrones. I want to watch the whole thing. So the love thing. Maybe it's just like give me a break. People came here not to be good to find that on their own. They don't need you to say it. But I'm not. I do think that that is pretty much it. It's pretty much it. I mean it sounds like it's kind of boring because like we've heard it before or something but it's like but actually like. It's I mean and it's something that you have to experience for yourself like it doesn't work for me anyway to just like sit in a room and have somebody like tell me to love more. I'm like it's I have to go through the waves of like my own self created suffering to like arrive again and again to be like coughed up on the beach of love like by the turbulent ocean of my own suffering. Again and again. It's just like oh yeah. Gasping for air like oh yeah. Yeah. It's just about love. You know when you get sucked back into the ocean. Yeah. The whale eats you again. No it isn't. We're going back down. It's about money and power. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean I. Instagram followers. Yes. It is. And but here's the thing. This is the beauty of it all is it's like the whole thing if there really were some kind of like intent to set up a hypnotic grid of narcissism. The grid is easily hacked. Meaning that. Oh OK. Well we got to revise the terminology. You know which is like OK the love thing. It's a little confusing though it is pretty much like the to me the most simple. I mean it's like for me my son it's like I look at my son and I feel completely connected to the fundamental goodness of the universe. And also simultaneously deeply inspired to be a better person. And to by that I mean to stop poisoning myself as much as possible and to stop hurting people around me and then to make my family. My home is sacred space and not in a cheesy way. I think about that all the time with like having a baby like I the biggest reason that I would want to have a baby is just to have like a really intense motivator to be like the best version of myself as possible. Because knowing that like this empathic sponge is like being deeply imprinted by my energy like all the time. Like I feel that just even like with being around other babies and yes it's like such a responsibility and there's such a clear mirror like instantly if you just like zone out and like get on your phone they're like what. Like what are you doing. Like what do you go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's wild. But you are. You do. You are doing that. And that's the thing is like the the you you do have a baby. You do have a baby. Yes. You do have that. We all do. Yes. It's the new planet Earth. I've actually had like like three people in as many months asked me if I was pregnant. Like totally different situations different strangers like have said something like so when's the baby do like or like so how far along are you. Or like how's the baby. You do not look pregnant. I have like a bit of like a Venusian belly but it's not like remarkable. And so just the fact that three strangers in three months like really like overstepped like a pretty clear like social boundary to like assume very certainly that I was pregnant. I was like it must be like an energy thing. That's it. It must be like a glow. And like when I think about it I am like I am a fucking pregnant mama. Like I've got so many creative like just projects in my belly my sacral chakra. And I'm like yeah like I feel like a cosmic mother to the whole new world. Well let me tell you leader of the Illuminati great cosmic mother as a dumb person. Unfortunately we need to spawn to have that moment of like oh my God. This being depends on me. My decisions every day directly impact this sweet sweet soul that can't do anything. Can't hold a spoon to his mouth. Can't do anything. Such a sweet soul deserves all my love and attention and fuck whoever I used to be in all my selfish things because this baby is worth so much more than that. Yes. And similarly if you spend any amount of time hanging out with the planet looking at it at the planet as it is. And I think this would be one of the most heartbreaking things that could happen. And I think this is why they say when you have contact with the divine there's a heartbreak to it is we want to believe in this omniscient omnipotent Krishna this thing that cannot be hurt this thing. And then maybe when you really get to meet that being it's not saying let me help you. Help me. Can you please help me. Absolutely. I mean it is such a reciprocal thing like I feel that like going out into the forest or like you know I think there's this urge to like go into nature to be healed and that's like increasingly like when I go out into nature like she's like yo like I've got a lot of grief to. Express and like you can hear me can I just like well to you for a while. And it's like we can hold each other you know and she really appreciates that too and it's like a you know we can role role play and swap with each other like she can be mama and then I can be mama. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. That's it. Yeah. We don't need to breed to have that feeling. But yeah that that's a real heartbreaker when you realize like oh no she just she's just like counting on you to in a way that's not vengeful it's not. It doesn't look like Holly it doesn't look like the monster that you imagine the wrathful thing it's just a little baby that just wants to like be with you and loves you. Oh what now you can't be at war with it. And then now there's some reason to like figure it out on a real funny anyway. Yes that's so cool. I'm very excited to have met the leader of the Illuminati. I knew y'all were out there and I hope that like you can maybe I don't know get the podcast numbers up a little bit. I'm also kind of interested in the Mogue one so it'd be cool if you could send that over whatever you need me to do I'll do but. Offerings will be required but I'll see what I can do. OK. My people will talk to your people. How can people find you. I have a website which is Johanna Warren dot com and that links to all my music and other things that I'll be working on. I have like I said I have many babies in my belly right now. It's going to be an interesting couple years. Wonderful but you got some shows coming up right. I do. Yeah I'm playing I'm doing like a little West Coast or when will this be aired next week or this week. I'm not sure which. Great if it isn't June 16th yet. I have a little West Coast tour coming up just super chill house shows as I drive my car up the coast to get re registered in the state of Oregon. But yeah I tour a lot and yeah I'll be around. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. What a pleasure. It's been a wonderful meeting you likewise. Howdy Krishna. Thank you. Howdy Krishna. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Really fun.

Howdy Krishna.
362^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - EMIL AMOS in REDEMPTION! Transcript and Discussion^2013-09-11^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear friends, and welcome to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. It's me, Duncan Tressel, reporting in from Los Angeles, California. Last week, I went to Little Cumberland Island, which is this beautiful little island off the coast of Georgia. And when I say beautiful, I mean, like God's finger is jutting down from heaven and touching this place. It's beautiful and that it contact with that level of beauty alters you in some way. And in a way that you, I don't think anything else can alter you in that way. There's a communication that happens when you get into nature. There's a connection or some kind of convergence that happens with you and the rest of the planet that is still wild. They say that the pigs, when they escape and get out into the wild, they actually change. Their hair color changes, they grow bigger, they go feral. And there's something about going into nature where you can feel the very beginning phases of this process. You can imagine when you're out in nature, out in the wild, what would happen if you were there for three more months? And then you think, well, what would happen to me if I were there for eight more months? And you realize that a lot of the heaviness and the weight that you carry around with you that is a weight that results from living in a place of high population density, probably doing activities that in that setting seem natural, but from a greater viewpoint or incredibly unnatural and absurd, for example, driving, getting into a big metal house carriage and merging with the machinery so that you are guiding this missile down black strips of concrete where you are guided by the fluctuation of stop lights and stop signs and other people who have been sucked into this strange arterial pulsation of metal and flesh that comprises the circuitry of most towns and cities. That's insane compared to what the rhythm of nature is, which is at this island, Little Cumberland Island, it's dictated by the tides, the inflow and outflow of water from the ocean. And the tides determine where you can go on the beach and when you can take boats out and when you can fish. And just being in the presence of that, which is a kind of deeper truth, just being in the presence of that kind of tide or that kind of fluctuation creates a very soothing and calming effect that seems like something that should be a regular part of your experiential diet. But it's something we all forget. I mean, you could stay in the city, you could be in a city for four years and never leave the city and not even think about it, barely even think about it. You can get so sucked into the artificial tide of modern living, of which you're just one particulate sort of breathing in and out with the tide of capitalism and commerce, which makes up civilization. Not that that's, nothing's truly unnatural. I know I said, I think I said unnatural, cars aren't unnatural, they're no more unnatural than pigs, but I guess they're a few steps removed from the primacy of nature. And when you plug into that, it's very healing and very beautiful, especially when you plug into that and mix it with technology. Because on this island, the only way to get around are four-wheelers. And holy shit, that is fun. That is so fun. There's nothing I can think of that is more delightful than riding down beach paths on a four-wheeler and exploring basically a band and island. So this is where my mom spent a lot of time, especially a lot of time as she was dying. And it was the place that she loved more than any other place on earth, and it's the place she wanted her ashes scattered. So I went to this island with my brother and my brother's wonderful wife and my brother's wonderful dog. And we went into a dune field and scattered my mom's ashes. And it was so beautiful and so perfect. I could really feel her there, she was there. And it was more than just a ritual. It was more than just a symbolic gesture. There was a sense of completion to it and just a feeling of peace that came from it. I feel so much better now, because I kind of went into like a depression, which is something that I've dealt with my whole life. I go in and out of depressions. And I had gone into this pretty dark place and something about the experience and going to this island started this process, which now I feel much better. And I feel like a chapter has closed in my life. And a new chapter is starting, which is super exciting because my brother is about to have a baby in December and that's a really beautiful thing and something I'm really excited about. A friend of mine was talking about how when you get older, if you have a baby, it's a really beautiful thing. Because once you get to a certain age, everyone around you just starts dropping like flies. There's no way around it. Everyone around you, the fruit starts falling off the tree and right into the Grim Reaper's mouth, he chomps up your relatives and loved ones right in front of you and shits them into the grave. So there's something really nice about having a new little pinky growing out of the garden of eternity because it is the reversal of the entropic force that sucks us all back into the soil and turns us into flowers, trees, worms, moths and all the other variety of life that, well, I guess everything turns us into everything. So that was really nice and I'm sorry for not getting a podcast out, but that's what I've been up to and I suppose that's a good excuse, even though there's no real excuse for not getting a podcast out except for my own laziness. I can't really pretend that some form of insane busyness has kept me from doing this thing. I think that's a tendency I have. I like to delude myself into thinking that the reason I haven't produced something I wanna produce is because of some state of busyness that I'm in, but the truth of the matter is it's usually because of procrastination and some form of distraction that has happened. So I apologize, but that seems to be part of who I am and I imagine that it will continue to be a pattern in my life for probably a very long time. Maybe not, I hope not. Okay, so there's that. Now, here's a big announcement that I wanna make and I am now officially sending out a cry for help from the internet, from those of you who listen to this podcast. I wanna tell you about an idea that came to me and it's an idea that for a thing that will transform podcasts forever, but it's a thing that I can't do on my own. Here's my idea. A few days ago, I ordered an Oculus Rift. For those of you who don't know what an Oculus Rift is, an Oculus Rift is a consumer-based VR goggles that apparently create the illusion of being fully immersed inside a virtual environment, whether that virtual environment is a video game, whether the virtual environment is whatever, whatever 3D space. There's all kinds of examples of what people are developing for this technology on the internet. A quick Google search will show you a variety of apps that they have for the thing now, including the experience of being beheaded. You can go to an Italian villa and I think they even ported the game Half-Life so that you can use Half-Life in conjunction with the Oculus Rift and run around shooting things. I'm sure there's other things that are on the horizon and eventually I wouldn't be surprised if this became the new television. People who I know have placed the thing on say, this is going to do to society what TV did to society. It's going to completely transform the way that we absorb media and not just that, but it's gonna transform the way that we create because the combination of the Oculus Rift with motion sensing technology, like the new Kinect for Windows or even hacked Xbox 360 Kinects allows you to, sorry, that humming you might hear in the background is my little Roomba, my robot slave cleaning for me. But the combination of the Oculus Rift with motion sensing technology can allow you to model and mold things in three-dimensional space. And then this combined with the 3D printers that are coming out would allow you theoretically to mold parts to create tools or art or anything that you wanted and then print those things out. And that's where we're headed. There's a great video by Elon Musk who is the president of Tesla. I don't know, maybe the king of Tesla. Not sure what his title is, but he's the same fella who is working on the Hyperloop, which is a type of tube, like a suction tube that apparently will allow us to get from LA to New York in a couple of hours max. And he's also working on a lot of other disruptive technologies, but there's a great video that I will post at DuncanTrustle.com on this podcast where you can kind of watch him go through all these emergent technologies that he thinks are going to be incremental aspects of Western civilization over the next century. So here's what I need help doing. This is what I wanna do. I want to create a virtual space where people can come and watch podcasts being recorded live in a 3D virtual environment. So the reason I wanna do this, there's a lot of reasons I wanna do this. I think that people really enjoy seeing podcasts live. I know with Rogan's podcast, they stream it and lots of people tune in to watch it live and to interact while it's happening and talk about the various topics that the guests are discussing and there's this interactive element to it that's super cool, but the way that the media gets consumed is in 2D space by watching the video, which is great, but I think that the next logical step is to actually be in a 3D environment surrounded by other people who are watching the podcast. And if you wanted to, you could put on an Oculus Rift and then you could look around and actually be in this environment as though you were in an auditorium or whatever environment was designed for the particular podcast that you decided to go and watch. Then you could add to that the ability to shift the perspective. So instead of seeing what was happening from your POV as your avatar in this virtual space watching the podcast happen, you could shift your POV to one of the guests or to the host and see what they were looking at or see their view of this virtual environment. The other thing that this technology would do is it would remove the boundary between the podcast and the audience. So if your podcast gets 60,000 downloads and episode, then you know that's a lot of people, but you don't really have a visual representation of what those people look like. The most people I've ever performed for in my life has been something like 3,000 people. 3,300 people it was. I was featuring for Rogan in Chicago and I'll never forget that experience. The experience of being in front of a wall of just a wall like wall of human beings combined with whatever terrible potent marijuana Rogan had given me before I went on stage gave the impression that I was talking to some giant deity composed of human molecules that had all merged together into the form of an audience and that was wild, it was wild. This is an experience that I think can happen with these emergent technologies so that podcasters and their guests can actually get some digitized representation of the audience that they're performing for. I can't think of anything more psychedelic and exciting than being able to put on my Oculus Rift to give my guest an Oculus Rift and to look out at an auditorium or room or cavern or canyon or alien planet or whatever terrain we decided to use and see all of you in whatever visual form that you decided to take. Not all of you will be humans. Some of you could be robots, vampires, unicorns, whatever you wanted to be. Some of you could be flying in hot air balloons drifting through the sky. Some of you could be birds but it would be a wonderful thing to be able to look out in a 3D environment at the listeners of this podcast. And I think other podcasters would utilize this technology too. So this is what I wanna do. I wanna create the first crowdsourced, I don't know if it's the first crowdsourced but a crowdsourced project. And I know that there are people out there listening who can help me do this. I don't know how to do this. I just have the idea in my head and I know that there are certain places where this idea has been explored. For example, in Second Life, you can, there are live shows in Second Life. I've seen them, to me they're not very exciting because as far as I know, there's no real motion tracking technology going into the performance, which means that any movement that is happening from the avatar is sort of pre-recorded animations that their avatar can go through. I think that for this to really be effective, what we would need is three things. Number one, we need a virtual environment that is accessible to anybody who has a computer regardless of the computer's operating system. So Second Life definitely seems like a potential environment to develop this technology inside of. Number two, we need motion sensing technology that can immediately transfer the movements of the guest and the podcaster into their avatar. So if I lift my arm, then my avatar lifts his arm. Or if my guest moves in some way, the avatar would in some way replicate that movement. Ideally, it would even be able to scan the face and transfer facial gestures or facial movements into the avatar. By the way, I know that not all of this stuff is probably available or accessible right now, but I think that it will be. And I think we might as well be the ones who start developing this. So we need a virtual space, potentially Second Life, or some other virtual space that I'm not aware of. We need a motion tracking technology that can scan, that can track the motions of the guest to the avatar that is in the virtual environment. And then we need this technology to be compatible with the Oculus Rift so that people in the audience, if they have a Rift, can actually be in 3D space. And the guest and the podcaster can also experience this in three-dimensional space. Those are the first three major components that we need for this thing to work. And I want to send out the call to all of you so that we can all start working together to make this thing happen. Many of you might already know how to do this. This shit might already exist, I don't know. I've done some searching and I can't find anything that is instantly accessible. I don't know how to code. So I don't know, and also I don't know how to get my XBox, the Kinect to work in this way. I tried, I don't know how to do it. I did buy a very nice PC though, so that I wouldn't be limited by the constraints of Apple. So I do have that and I have a Rift coming and I do have an XBox Kinect. So I have these components, but I need help. I want this to be an open source project. So I want this to be the sort of thing that once we figure out how to do it, it can be packaged and downloaded by anyone who wants to do podcasts in virtual environments. I want this to be completely accessible to anyone who wants to do this and at no charge so that any podcaster out there can utilize this technology to do their shows in live virtual space. That's the goal. This isn't for profit. This is only for expanding and evolving the medium that is currently known as podcasting. You guys know that podcasting isn't just podcasting. Podcasting is a flower on this tree of technology that is growing into time. It is so much more than a one-sided form of entertainment. This is a, podcasts have communities that grow around them and many of my best friends are people that I've met doing this podcast or guests that I've had on this podcast. They're much more than just podcasts and I think that if we all work together that we can evolve them to the next level, which is to me creating environments where listeners can gather together in 3D space, watch a podcast get recorded live and then afterwards hang out together in 3D space and we could all hang out, which would be pretty awesome so that people all over the world, instead of having to wait for the podcaster to come through and do a comedy tour or to come through and do a live recording of the podcast can immediately not just enjoy watching the podcast get recorded live but get to interact with other people who like the podcast as well. The technology exists right now for this stuff to happen. We just need to weave it together in a way that we just need to fuse it together. We need these three components, we need someone who's good at organizing these kinds of projects, we need coders, designers, developers, philosophers, technologists, anybody out there who just has an idea, you don't even have to understand technology but if you just have some instinct or impulse as to how we can make this sort of thing work, if you know people that we can connect with, if you know people who work for Oculus Rift, if you know people who work for Second Life, if you know people who work for some other company that could help facilitate this thing, then contact me. There's a contact form at DuncanTrussell.com, contact me and let me know your idea. The first thing that I need is somebody who's good at organizing this sort of thing, someone who maybe has created this software, has created this sort of thing before. And the people involved in this have to just be interested in furthering the medium of podcasts. I'm sure that other stuff will come, if we can really figure out how to do this, I'm sure there'll be all kinds of weird benefits that come from this, but the main reason for doing it is just so that we can further the unifying aspect of technology, the way that technology loves to bring things together. So that's my idea. Go to DuncanTrussell.com if you can help with this and let me know who you are, what you can do, how you can help, and I'm sure that if we all put our heads together, we can get this thing created fairly quickly. And before you know it, those of you who have a computer will be able to go watch the DuncanTrussell Family Hour and hopefully other podcasts who adopt this technology recorded in virtual space. This is my dream. I wanna do it, let's do it. I'm sick of being trapped by the cruel time-space continuum that keeps me locked down in one place and makes it so that I can only do this podcast in my human form inside of my house, instead of doing the podcast as a Godzilla in some kind of alien environment surrounded by all of you who have taken on whatever specific avatar you want to represent yourself as. I think this is something that Terrence, Jesus Christ, McKenna would have loved to see happen. And I think it's something that is in the spirit of the emergent technologies that we are so lucky to get to witness being born in our lifetimes. Help me, join me. Go to DuncanTrussell.com, go to the contact form, send me a message if you're a coder, designer, developer, anyone who has any interest in helping with this project, an organizer, someone who has experience organizing this kind of thing. I'm throwing it out to the universe in the hopes that just by planting this seed in the fabric of what could be, this space will grow and we'll all be able to hang out together. So there you go. Today we have a great podcast. First, a little business. The DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Shore Design T-shirts. Oh, God, God. Shore Design T-shirts create shirts so very soft, so soft when they touch the skin. It feels as though the snake that brought truth to those two primitive savage shitheads in the Garden of Eden was slithering along your body and whispering in your ear, eat the fruit. Don't let that old man trick you into thinking that you gotta stay in the dark to be happy. Yes, the feeling of Shore Design T-shirts is the feeling of the serpent in the Garden of Eden sliding up and down your body, whispering dark secrets into your ear. Why are these shirts so soft? The shirts are so soft because it's Shore Design T-shirts in Thailand, they have a orgasmic echo chamber which actually amplifies the orgasm of pagans who are constantly making love within the chamber. These pagans have been sprayed with aerosolized MDMA. They've been inhaling psilocybin vapors and so are in a constant state of orgiastic ecstasy. Their orgasms are translated, digitized, and used in a mixture of semen, tears, and fuck sweat to create the very soft fabric that Shore Design T-shirts is famous for. Don't believe me? Order one of the shirts. Go to ShoreDesignT-shirts.com. If you put my name in, Duncan, D-U-N-C-A-N, you'll get 10% off these wonderful shirts and you will be wearing cum to the yoga studio and who wouldn't want to do that? We're also sponsored by Amazon.com if you are going to order something from Amazon. And by the way, Amazon has everything, everything, everything you could want is there. Anything that we talk about on this podcast, you can order it from Amazon.com. I just ordered a beautiful zen bell. Wanna hear it? I don't know if you can hear that. It rings for a very long time. It's good for meditating. For some reason, bells really go hand in hand with meditating. I'm not sure what it is. It's kind of like a palette cleanser. It's like a subjective palette cleanser. It also makes my dog bark. But when you're meditating, it's nice to ring a bell when you start and ring a bell when you finish. I don't know why. That's my new little friend, Fox. I don't know if you guys heard him barking, but I have this wonderful sweet dog that I am now 100% deeply in love with. His name's Fox. He's a rescue dog. He teaches me not to be selfish. Anyway, from Amazon.com, you can get anything. Temple bells. You can get deodorant. You can get garbage bags. If you sign up for Amazon Prime, they will deliver this stuff to you the next day. So if you're an introverted recluse like I am, it's a very wonderful service because I don't enjoy going to Target and touching things that unidentified babies have had diarrhea on. That doesn't happen when you go to Amazon.com. And if you're gonna go to Amazon.com, go through the portal at DuncanTrussell.com. It's on any podcast episode. If you click on it, there's a portal there. You click on that thing, order whatever you're gonna order, and they, for some unknown reason, honestly, I'm still confused about it. They give me a percentage, a small percentage of the price of the item that you buy. I don't know how much longer they're gonna do it. It seems like someone at Amazon got drunk or did too much cocaine and decided to do this thing. I don't get it, but I guess there's some kind of advertising value in this, but it seems like everyone already knows about Amazon.com. Regardless, please go through the portal if you're gonna buy something from Amazon. It's a great way for you to support this podcast. Some other ways to support this podcast are to buy a shirt. The store is now stocked with new posters, t-shirts, and a variety of other stickers and lots of other stuff. If you go to DuncanTrussell.com, go through the shop, you can see those shirts and posters, and I would very much appreciate it. If you'd pick one up, there's also a donation button, and for those of you who have been donating, thank you. I am so very grateful to you for supporting this podcast, and it is really, really intense to think that so many of you are willing to help the podcast in that way. It's fucking beautiful, and God bless you, I will try to put out more episodes than I currently am for you, and for all of you, not just the donators or the Amazon shoppers or the people who buy stuff from the store, or the people who buy shirt design t-shirts, but for just those of you who listen. I love you, and my life is a million times more exciting and beautiful because of the strange connection that I have to all of you through this podcast. Thank you so much for listening, and I hope you will continue to listen and forgive me for the sound quality of this podcast that's about to happen, because this podcast was recorded with one of my best friends, Emil Amos, as he was driving to Chicago in his car. So you're gonna hear some background noise on this podcast, but this is an unavoidable aspect of being trapped in space and time, because we can't teleport yet, and a lot of people I'd like to have conversations with are in some other part of this dimension far away from LA, so that's the price of the thing. Just appreciate how amazingly wonderful it is that the technology exists today to even have a conversation with someone driving in a car hundreds of miles away over the phone and record that. That's pretty amazing. It's not gonna take the fuzz out, but at least we can do it. Today's guest is in a lot of different bands. He's in a band called Lilix, Lilix? Is it Lilix or Lilix? And Champagne? He's in a band called The Grails? He's in a band called The Holy Sons? And he's in a band called Ohm? And what's super exciting is Emil is about to release an album called Lost Decade 2, which has a lot of songs that he recorded when he and I were in college, and one of the songs on this album is a song we sang together, and I've heard it, and it's awesome. My voice was a little better back in the day, I think. But yeah, I'm really excited about that, and also we've been talking about possibly even recording our own album in next spring, which I am so excited about, and I've already been recording embarrassing songs on my iPhone in the hopes that one of them could be used for this recording session in April. I'm gonna have links to emails on tour right now. I highly recommend that you go see him perform. I would put that in front of doing pretty much anything else. If he's coming to your town, definitely, definitely go to the show, because the type of music he creates is beautiful and eerie and has the wonderful effect of being pleasing to hear, but also in some way it creates a mood or a feeling that is very unique. I'll just put it that way. You should definitely go watch him perform. That's not, it's so weird, in essence. It's good music. Just go see him perform. So now, everyone please, welcome to the Dunk of Trustle family hour. The sweet Lord of Glory himself, Emil Amos. ii fun Ooh Do Do I I I Everybody I'm here with my friend Emil Amos and he's driving to Chicago right now So what you're hearing in the background is the sound of the emals car I guess what kind of car are you driving these days friend? I Bought a Mercedes Benz in a kind of random occurrence Years ago with some of the first like music money I'd saved up and I'll I'll tell you it's the best thing I've ever bought in my entire life hands down That nothing can can compare what year? It's a 99 some rich Old woman had clearly driven it to the grocery store a few times and it had had like 60,000 miles on it and I was This is such a weird opening conversation, but I I Needed to buy a car and I was just looking around at your basic. What if what if Bohemians usually buy like a Honda What's it called? There's like an accord or something, right? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, the idea is that you're not supposed to care about your car Right, right and because I was living in Portland Everybody was kind of looking for that kind of thrifty, you know Liberal automobile and so I just accidentally stumbled onto these Deals were like gangsters would be selling Mercedes Benz Outside of the outside of the city Sorry, I'm driving so if you hear it if you hear a fiery death, it's probably me, but um, so So anyway, yeah, I kind of sort of stumbled on to the fact that nobody looks for Nice cars, you know in that kind of environment and like all these rich people in outer lying areas are just Liquidating them because they're always buying like the brand new one So this random dude from his house just sold it to me for like $6,000 and I'm telling you Just go look for them. They're like sitting there everywhere. Nobody thinks but then they're fucking great cars Anyway, moving on that was that was a strange opening I am I don't think it's that strange because we we started talking about the Idea that you're not supposed to care about your car, which is interesting to me You know, there's like all these unwritten rules of how you're supposed to be if you're a bohemian Yeah, I mean That was a weird thing for me because I I had made jokes for years With some of my band buddies that like, you know, it'd be absurd It's an underground musician could pull up to his shitty little shows with like gold rims and like an actually a super nice car and my stomach almost Turned when I when I got in it for the first time and I just I thought it was stolen. I thought the guy was totally Selling it to me and I actually right when I signed the paper. I was like, is it possible? This is a stolen car And he just looked at me. He's like How how could I sell you a stolen car from my house? And I was like, okay, here's here's the cash. I gave him cash and just drove up Have you ever seen? Any of riff raps videos? Yeah, I totally follow and I just found out yesterday that he's gonna be on the new celebrity rehab I'm kind of excited. I'm gonna watch a shit out of that, you know, man, I love celebrity rehab Because it's the modern day version of the stocks You know, like it's where you go to pay penance for your sins It's like I've been thinking a lot about how addiction Or is the opposite of enlightenment for people. It's like, you know, how like to get enlightened There's all there's these rules that have to happen, you know, generally like you need some event to happen that makes you Enlightened, you know, you've got to do a series of actions or you run into a holy man or you have an ayahuasca experience and all these things are really just they give you an excuse to live a better life and for an addict If they What they call a relapse is like if I have one drink of alcohol, you don't understand what I will begin to do But it really is like more like, okay, once you have that drink now you can sort of consign You can give your responsibility over to this demon That you have that has now possessed your body and it gives you an excuse to go on a rampage You know what? I mean, and then once you've gone on this demonic rampage long enough as a penance you go to rehab And then when you go to rehab, there's an exorcism that happens where the demon is beaten back Into some little part of yourself and you're let out into the world having this new humility Yeah, that's that's interesting. I I feel like a Lot of the clinically depressed people I have known They seem like they're kind of secretly getting off on their get out of jail free pass a little bit I mean, that's a pretty potentially offensive thing to say, but I've seen I've seen people Do you know that you know that scene with James Franco and? Freaks and geeks where he like keeps pretending like he can't read and he was a poor kid and all that stuff. I don't but that's awesome He like he well when he gets put under the gun by the you know the school like guidance counselors and stuff He just like he's fake cries and he says he says I don't don't pick on me I've got learning disabilities and I know you know what I mean, and so Then and then the girls keeps figuring out like that He does that whenever he's put under the microscope and and he needs to take responsibility He he like He flinches and turns and goes into like a fetal position and starts crying and everybody feels sorry for him And that that's totally like the metaphor I've seen people who who died they like the diagnosis They they they use it for getting what they want sometimes, you know fuck. Yeah, you do and it's terrible But the real question is why is it that when in a position to not be an asshole? You know like when you kind of watch yourself go into this series of Actions that is just that are all shitty. What is that? What why why do we do that? Well, I was gonna I was gonna say something else that that goes back to that but you know, I often think This this sentence out loud in my head that that you know all philosophy psychology Religion the original pursuit was for man to become objective To himself, you know to achieve some form of objectivity where you grasp some form of truth, you know And you're free of the subjective. I Don't know what you would call it not necessarily is dramatic as a prison But but in in that it's kind of the same question. You can ask that question so many different ways But you're sort of asking what is that where we? We lose our objectivity and we we like We melt down into some sort of selfish it or something, right? Yes, I Don't know what you think I Don't know man. I don't know but I I do think that it's a Always a decision, you know, like you always will feel this like growing crescendo of reactivity so you get into the you know kind of like The you put your hand on a hot Item and then as the heat increases eventually you'll jerk your hand away but it's like inside of you there's some kind of pressure or some kind of Poison inside of me. There's like a poisonous thing that will start emerging and Yeah, objectively, I'll look at it and think oh, you're just a sadist or wow look at you you're just kind of a sociopath right now because like It reminds me of this Louie C. K. Joke that I heard where he talks about how he was in a in his apartment complex and he didn't look like he belonged in the apartment complex so a Guy he this guy was like complaining the guy said to him. You don't belong in this apartment complex What are you doing here and he went along with it like he didn't live there? Because he wanted the you know the conflict with the guy and he wanted to watch the anyway I'm ruining a Louie C. K. Joke in an off way but the point is that thing where you realize that you are Getting off on Conflict You're getting off on being an asshole. You're getting off on the negativity You know you my point is you can see that you're not a victim of it. You're actually Creating these problems because you're getting a mental hard on from it Well to be fair though Because we sound we sound like everybody's making excuses and they're really making decisions. I mean there is there is some level of Mental health, you know, that's a real dynamic and so I could definitely say for me in my life like When I didn't have problems of my own and I felt healthy and happy I was I was very I Was excited to help other people and I was I was willing and Interested in in their problems and making life easier for them and the more I sank back into any Of my own depression the less time and energy I as a ratio had had for other people in general, so I Think that You know some people sometimes you have you have problems and you you are not able to Treat other people with with basic respect and certainly when you're walking down the street and you see a schizophrenic guy you know who's Who's been wearing the same clothes for like 18 years, you know He's got food dripping out of his mouth, so I mean you don't expect for that guy to To operate at the same by the same standard, you know as the next guy because he is he is inundated with brain chemistry That is literally holding him back, you know in the larger Whatever spectrum and so I mean I think that's a real dynamic, you know and some people do have some people might need to take Take drugs, I'm not trying to sound so callous, but within that there's a whole different continuum of people Somehow using it, so I think the big both are going on, you know, but just to clarify Okay, yeah, I get that and I agree with you there is definitely the bio computer malfunctions We get imbalances in serotonin and it creates a kind of depressive state I get that but I What about let's so let's take all that all those people and like put them in it in a different place But no, no put them in a different place because it's still again You still have a look you still have a choice the schizophrenic aside from the schizophrenic where you're just in a seizure You're in like a mental seizure of madness and the whole world has turned into a kind of Echo chamber slash kaleidoscope that is just this melting Swirl of colors and sounds. Okay, whatever that person's experience is that person I don't know how that person can be expected to react to that in any normal way, but I'm saying on the on the on this depression Manic depression or any of the so-called mental illnesses. I still feel like there's a choice that gets made About how you're gonna react because we are taught to base our actions on feeling and if you're feeling bad, then you base your actions on that feeling and Can't you just instead of basing your actions on feelings start basing your actions on an ethic? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely it's a dicey we're getting who are diving into a pretty judgmental Atmosphere because because it's all about your That becomes all about your estimation of like how much another person is being truly Honest with you and or trying to find I'm definitely talking about people who are looking for The easiest way out and like they'll they'll take or use anything You know that that that dynamic that we all resort to sometimes where you'll you'll basically Fry wolf or do anything to get out of your responsibilities. I think that's what you're talking about To and like and then you're talking about the perverse enjoyment of brutalizing other people too Yeah, that's right the perverse enjoyment of brutalizing other people and then How there's like a dog inside of you that when it For whatever reason it just lunges and attacks and then all of a sudden you do all this damage in the world and You have to sit and kind of after it's all over you come back to yourself again And you look at what you've done and you're like well, I'm just a fucking asshole Like you know like well, what what do I do now? How do you make up for it? How do you like? How do you like go to somebody that you're an ass complete asshole to do and like fix fix it? You can't generally and so that's where rehab comes in, you know, right? That's well, that's what they get you to do in AA right they get you to write letters to everybody you fucked over and and own up to all of it Yeah, yeah, you make your amends is what it's called But it's this kind of ceremonial way of Purifying the actions that you made when you were in a reactive state Some sort of patch of Pennsylvania wooded shit. That's breaking the call up. It's okay. I got you I got you to get right back where we're at So you go to rehab as this or you do AA and rehab and the idea of a addiction Are this it's a kind of modern take on how to deal with demonic possession You know, it's symbols that are used to sort of rationalize why you went into a place where you are a complete monster for however long and and and and that's and you lost control to this other part of yourself and I just think that's a really interesting thing man because you know You it's like a penance or something. It's like a you know, that's why in Christianity. They have baptism You know, and you're born again Washed in the blood of Christ and that's why they have the confessional chamber, you know, because it's like we need a way to subjectively Feel as though we've cleansed ourselves when when we do really bad things And yeah, I don't I don't think there's anything particularly I Mean some of those might be outdated modes of psychotherapy or something but but like the young Ian, you know concept of having to posit unconscious Content into the consciousness to grow and individuate yourself I mean that does seem like just part of like Buddha's path You know is like he did some things wrong and then he has to Get outside of himself get objective and take a take a hard look at himself. I mean that seems like it's part of all of our Stories and we've all we've all you all everybody tests the boundaries as a child and then and then try to learn from From touching the burner, right? Yeah, and you touch the burner and you get burnt, but you know like I've no I'm I'm tired of like learning that way, you know That's that that thing where you sort of after you after you're sitting in a pile of wreckage that used to be a Relationship and you're looking at it and thinking well, I learned something here It's it's like pathetic, you know, like I I learned I Learned something here, but how many more times you and that's just a way to make you feel better For falling prey to the destructive impulse So well, I mean, you know, you know when you're listening to a friend tell you That they've changed and you know with certain friends You you know in your heart that they will never Ever achieve that objectivity. There's certain people, you know You know that they it's not necessarily that they're lying flat out, but that they don't have the capability You know it, you know that before they die, they will never figure it out. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah There's certain certain people like that and then certain people have a Higher ceiling like you can just feel their potential, you know this is why I think that that that like what you just said that the idea of a predestined state of You know being in the darkness Is it true? It like what is the redemptive state? Like how do you? achieve redemption if You exist in a world where God is dead or where people I don't really believe in God or Where everything just seems to be symbolic anyway, how do you achieve redemption? I was just reading this book By Chogium, Trump talking about the transmission of that happens in Buddhism or in the guru disciple relationship and He said, you know the guru that they'll do all these things that probably are ultimately just meaningless But it creates the conditions for a person to let go of themselves, you know, and he tells this story of Famous Buddhist, I don't know teacher and how he found enlightenment was He had heard about someone told him. Oh, there's this great saint Living in this fishing village. So go talk to him and he went to the fishing village and he asked people Hey, have you heard of this saint? I can't remember his name and they're like, oh, yeah I know we know who you're back. We know that name, but he's just this homeless guy who lives by the river eating scraps of fish Like he scraps and he's dirty. We don't know that he's enlightened so he went down and he found this guy and He sat with him and the guy was just kind of ignoring him and then finally the guy was like, okay, follow me And then the guy just tortured him for like nine years straight nine years of just absolute torture and and and then at the end of the nine years they were sitting together and The guys slapped him with a sandal in the face and that was when he received the transmission became enlightened But the whole point of the thing is it's like with the guy those nine years of suffering Were they really at necessary for this person to decide to be a better person to be better To because you know what? I mean like what we all have these conditions that we need to meet before we can become the ultimate version of ourselves Especially if we're chained down by guilt or if we're at the end of a series of bad decisions It feels weird to suddenly be like, you know what? I'm just gonna be an enlightened person for the rest of my life and I'm gonna start treating everyone around me with love Well if you believe in the in the predestination side of things which you kind of know that I I tend to Then you know think about those like think about your awkward years in comedy or for me songwriting where You know sometimes it seems like five years can go by and you're just you're just not seizing You're not you're not Focusing the lens on the on the perfect way to articulate your your sentiment or something so take that five years and say that you are in a cave in the Himalayas or you are being tortured by a Dirty fisherman. I mean maybe you just needed five years for you to internally, you know evolve into you know the Summation you had to meditate yourself on You know your your your own reason for articulating in general or your reason for being at your place in in the larger Spectrum of consciousness, you know, and maybe maybe that all the other stuff like you implied is is arbitrary It doesn't matter that you went to college necessarily Or that you dated this person and not that person. Maybe it just takes a long time and Where you are is relative, you know Yeah, yeah, like there's a you know this in this book. It says that there's a You know behind the scenes in your mind, there are all these connections that are slowly being made and You don't you might not you're you're not aware that they're the connections are being made and then suddenly when they finally When you've hit the right number of connections and that's when you see the grand vision of life and wake up But it's but you can't just do it. That's what's funny to me is it's like why can't not why can't I just You know, like if it let's say I'm sitting here and an alien craft descends in front of my window in my office and opens up like it opens up and in the middle of the alien craft is a Angel and and angelic being that merges with my mind and Forgives everything I've ever done Now I get to be a good person again for the rest of my life Why do I need that? Why do I need a fisherman? Why can't why do I need connections to be made? Isn't it clear enough? Why is this thing like oh, no, we have to wait? Why can't we just be like no, you know? I I'm just gonna be it from now on. I'm just gonna be a loving person Why well because I mean your ego tells you that you're done evolving and And you're maybe you are in touch with the part of yourself that has the potential to be Wonderful person, but maybe you still have evolving to do I mean if you have you thought like have you ever seen a friend of yours that's horrible with women and Treats, you know relationship after relationship horribly Think of I mean think about someone besides yourself That literally though think about a friend of yours that you've seen making mistakes over and over and and think about like What your estimation was of of his destiny at the time? I mean literally picture one of your friends and I Think I am the of all my friends. I'm definitely the worst at relationships Well first do well just for this moment try to picture someone else and Because I've thought about that before like someone who's making a a very Consistent error, you know someone who is maybe two into the way women look or and you know You know or so some particular thing that's not letting them truly fall in love You know it just seems to me that the only answer first of all my first assumption often is like Oh, this person's fucked for the rest of their life. They're never ever gonna figure it out I mean certain people where you just you have an overwhelming emotional reaction To their atmosphere like that. It's just something that your instincts tell you and then my mind tells me well the only thing that can cure this person of these thinking errors and these these Objectification sort of diseases There's more experience. There's they're gonna have to burn down so many more relationships until they're just tired of Objectifying someone else without actually letting them be who they really are and not wanting them to be someone else They're gonna have to go through a lot more until they burn out this weird Whatever it is this aggression inside them that that pushes themselves on to other people, you know, and I think Experience is the way that you unfurl your that you know your your destiny and your dormant psychology, so That's the only answer. It's so dismal Well, I mean aren't you just saying like you're sick of Jesus Christ, you're saying you're sick of waiting and and You want it out But like isn't that sort of a four noble truths kind of thing where it's like the more you You want it the more the ropes will tighten around your wrists like you have to just Release yourself and like go with the go with you know, what's your belt? Which is largely what what it's sort of a manifest destiny. It's what you it's what you need in a way well, this is the other idea in this book is that you You can't think of this like you can't create in your mind this differentiation of like, okay, here's a sacred place state and here's a profane state Every state is fertilizer that this thing can grow out of you. So You're all you do have to you are supposed to look at the wreckage The smoldering wreckage of all the various things that you might have shit-canned in your life or ruined And see them for what they are which are steps in the direction of this moment of Freedom that we all do that some of us dream about Which is that thought that place where you really do just snap back into understanding But maybe there isn't maybe that place isn't real. Maybe that's just a That's a lie too. Maybe there's just people who are faking that place, you know I don't think so or I'm Doss was pretty wide open and beautiful Yeah, I mean Do you think that? for you, I mean, this is a pretty sleepless in Seattle way to put it but like for you is it that you feel like you don't Meet the right people or that you actually literally Ruin your own Ability to to open yourself and and fall in love Yeah, I think that I um I Get I just get really reactive and like have I have all these like defense mechanisms that Will will spring up Come out of the blue and just basically ruin a relationship And then I'll be like alone again and and then I'll feel lonely And then I'll look at that and think well Oh, this is just how you feel all the time But when you're in a relationship you say you think that this feeling is because of the relationship And so then you try to get out of the relationship because this you think this ache is coming from the relationship But then the relationship is gone and you realize oh, no that wasn't it at all Ake is still there Ake is still there, and then you're like well, what the fuck is it? You know if the answer isn't If this is a thing that they you know cannot be fixed through a Relation or it's not even fair to use a relationship to fix anything Hello, hey, um, so The Where were we you you you end up you end up um You first of all you can't use a relationship as an ex you shouldn't be using a relationship to fix yourself anyway That's you know what I mean. You shouldn't be doing that like there was a I remember there was a guy One of the most horrifying things I ever saw Was this guy who was a drunk and addicted to narcotics? And he had gotten a bartender pregnant Like from a one night stand And she and she decided that she was gonna keep the baby and I can remember him Drunk His pocket stuffed with pills Looking at me from underneath this addiction and saying the baby is gonna get is I'm excited to have the baby because it's gonna make me stop drinking And it was What what actually happened is like a modern morality play I don't know what happened, but I imagine that he um I don't know. I mean, I guess I my guess is things went really well from it for him, but That's optimistic But my my point is it's like you there's this underlying ache That I have And I think a lot of people have And that ache is is is this thing that you are always licking like a dog Like, you know licking its paw or something. You're always trying to like soothe that ache And so you try all these tricks To soothe the ache You know, that's the first approach is like, all right. Well, I'm gonna get drunk or I'm gonna get on drug Do do take narcotics. So what do you know that doesn't work? It just seems to Create a momentary distraction then bam, you're back to the ache and then you try relationships And then through the relationship you start thinking, oh you forget about the ache you think the ache is coming from the relationship So then you're like, oh god, I feel so stuck. I'm claustrophobic Here, what have I done? Why have I wound myself up in this thing? It could never work And then you destroy that Thinking that on the other side, there's going to be this sense of peacefulness No, you're right back to where you were back to the ache and then back to licking the paw And that's this that's the endless cycle the samsara, you know the samsaric perpetuation of our own suffering Well, I would I would definitely differentiate between the need for love which Everybody has and and everybody ought to have You know love in their in their life to some degree and then and then differentiate that from From developmental, you know Problems that that haven't That haven't really been resolved, you know, like those are two totally different things and and love doesn't cure you know Your own internal issues. It's just a separate thing. You know the need for love is Is a part of feeling healthy, but it doesn't it's not meant to be a panacea, you know for things that you need to resolve in your own World which is, you know, probably why you Have gone to therapists. It's like it's different. It's a different thing. It's a different mission, right? Yeah, I mean, yeah, I I don't know. I mean The idea I don't know I I don't know I don't understand it at all. I that's part of this like getting older is I just don't understand I just More and more just realize I just don't understand anything and and and then I always look back any time I've been mean to someone in my life And I just think oh that was always a mistake And then that makes me like it was never never was it good to be an asshole to someone You know like general it's like that old saying there's never been no one's ever said I'm so glad I had that fifth shot The next day I'm so glad I got revenge or whatever. Yeah, but the next day after you've gone drinking no one's like Oh, yeah, I'm really. I'm glad we had that seventh beer. That was smart That's a great point. Yeah, you know, so well, I mean But see look look how much look how much wiser You you already are I mean I'm just saying You know how many people never even perceive that and and you see them every day somehow Carving their way through the world destroying everything and then they die and they never They never have that realization. Isn't that like a profound beginning of understanding though? Yeah, I think that but yeah, again, it's but it's not a um It's like Yes, it's a it's a beginning to understanding but again, it's the kind of understanding of like, uh, uh A fucking, you know trust fund kid who just burned a house down I You know, I mean, I know what you're talking about like the kinds of Like I think tenants is is pretty good But like in a way, but you're talking about a kind of person that only feels bad when they're caught That's not what you're doing. You you feel genuinely bad. You want to change, you know Yeah, and and and and you feel kind of like You know, I you know, I'll think back to fights now that my mom has died I'll think back to fights. I got in with her And just and look at that in a kind of like shocked stunned like man You are so dumb That was so dumb to to to be like that and then like I'll think about I you know, I've been kind of running through like a rolodex of fights I've been in with people that I love trying to find one fight that made sense And None of them none of them none of them make sense And that's why I'm thinking more and more and it's always the fights in the in the middle of the fight It's it makes so much sense You're so justified You know and and and you feel so justified and confident and and just filled with this hubris And then after the emotions past you're just left sitting there looking at what you did and you're like, oh no That that was all wrong all totally wrong So that makes me start thinking well, then I can't base what I do on emotions anymore You know that well, I think once once a fight starts once a real fight Begins and you feel especially it's like you're drunk And you feel threatened And you punch your hand through a window or something. I mean at that point Your brain and your body is just telling you To protect yourself and defend yourself and that's all That's not I don't know that that's necessarily A big part of like someone having a bad bad character or something It's just you have to look at why do these why do these situations begin, you know, why do you get in In the initial Power struggle that causes these types of violence or something because every everybody gets in those situations and everybody Their brain tells them to defend themselves, but it's not it's not necessarily You know me doesn't mean you're a horrible person. I mean it sounds like to me that you uh You're taking stock in your life in ways that most people never even have time to do they they barely ever stop and they barely You know create a rolodex of bad behavior. I mean, I think you're on the right track I don't think it's also necessarily bad to to have feelings of self-loathing because it's the beginning of Of transformation a lot of times, you know Yeah, yeah, no, I know I I yeah, well, I mean it is like the interesting thing about this book. I'm reading and uh, actually Crowley's philosophy is like Both of them invite you to take a very honest look at your life At what you are From an objective perspective as much as you can So that you objectively just look at everything you've done Analyze why you're as much as you can why you're doing the things that you're doing What drives you what motivates you and then from that that's where you you know You can grow but it It doesn't it's not like the best feeling No, but I mean I think you're you're an artist and an artist has a massive advantage because They create work that helps function as a mirror And you have this you have this massive head start because you you have a relationship with yourself through your work and you can You can turn yourself upside down and criticize yourself into work and it's it's a much better way Trying to reach that state of objectivity that we're sort of hinting at Do you uh, do you ever think about? Completely like do you ever fantasize about completely abandoning society? Um I I don't really so much i'm i'm not necessarily that kind of kind of guy i was i was gonna ask you if If you ever feel like you have Like a master not a masterpiece, but like some sort of um body of work inside of you that you have to Get out and you have to get done because you're afraid sometimes you get you get visions of dying or you like you get on a plane and you're like If I die on this plane I'll never have You know did my the work that I needed to do do you ever do you ever feel like Your time is running out you want you want to say this really important thing Yeah, but yeah, but I I like the mar I like um That book meditations by marcus aurelius because it kind of tries to push that like it tries to point out the absurdity in that Like yeah, you know like yeah, go ahead scream into the cave like It'll it'll echo for a few years and then no one will remember what you said So instead of yeah, but that's that that was a that was a great moment of human articulation to say that I think Yeah, that's the fucking right. I keep forgetting that paradox in this asshole's book because he's saying in a book Don't worry about His his very success is proving all of his philosophy wrong Yeah, I know that's true math, but yeah, I do I do think that but I you know I Do you ever like have you seen end of the void? I've been recommended that and I don't think I've seen it yet it is so fucking good and and it and it does a really good job of showing an incarnation And it just kind of showing the kind of dream dreamy sleepwalking way that we go through life and it just suddenly ends Like it just ends and it shows how All of these like kind of mildly bad to extremely bad decisions The chain reaction that it that has throughout the world Not just while you're alive, but after you die The way that it kind of like the what you do kind of spreads out around you And just the kind of it does a really good job of illuminating the kind of Subtle darkness that so many people clamber around in Not like extreme darkness extreme darkness you It's kind of easy to get out of extreme darkness Because you can see clearly how awful what you're doing is whatever that might for example if you're someone who is embezzling or if you're someone who is Cheating on your wife or if you're someone who's doing some like repetitive bad thing That's kind of easy to get out of because you can just see it But this is more of like it's more kind of like that muddy darkness That that comes over a person's life where You tell yourself i'm a good person But your decisions are consistently selfish You know And and and how that just sort of leads to that moment where you're like, oh shit. I'm dying So fuck the great work. How about you have a day where you're not a dick to people? Before before you die just one day Pull off one day Where you go through the world not being an asshole and constantly thinking about your own self I'd like that. Well, I think yeah, I mean That's a that's a that's a very good It's a very good sentiment to hoist upon the world of Entertainment and and documentaries that you that people sit down for an hour and a half and try to ponder and then You know that they turn it off and They drift out into their foggy Fate, you know, and it's just another passing sentiment that Doesn't really scare the fuck out of them, you know, like that's that that's It's supposed to be a meditation rod that slaps you On the head and and there's a there's a purpose for fear, you know I think I think it gets fucked up In sermons but the idea of fear of god. I mean, there's a there's a purpose For fear and it's a reason why Human beings have developed it not in a running from a tiger way but more of like A fear of justifying your life, you know, so there's I think there's two questions that we skirt around and one is How can I achieve some sort of happiness and then but when you say stuff like redemption That's a different question partially. It's like how do I justify my existence? You know, those are the kind of two different things certainly some people achieve Some people what say that again Some people achieve one of those things more than the other I'd say most of the mainstream population comes very close To achieving a form of happiness, you know And then a lot of the great thinkers come closer to justifying their existence but less less of achieving happiness, you know Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean achieving happiness I can achieve happiness temporarily Easy just give me some delotted and a fucking four-wheeler I can achieve Temporary happiness That's no problem. And that but that's the you know, all those things you again, you're just back in that murky haze it's like what The the in and that fear that you're talking about in the meditation rod where when you're meditating someone Wacks you on the fucking head or somebody slaps you with a sandal Or whatever it is. It's like it's it's like opening your This is the thing we you know, like you hear it again and again open your heart open your heart open your heart open your heart And that I think that fear is the initial feeling of your heart opening Maybe maybe that and you need that you need that terror. You need this sense of like mother fuck. What am I doing? I gotta stop burning down churches Literally or metaphorically, you know, I've got to stop this endless And repetitive aggression and lashing out at the world As it manifests around me because the way the world manifests around you Is in your the people that you know? That's the universe coming to say hello to you and if you when it comes to say hello to you if you're consistently shoving it back and telling it to fuck off Where's that gonna get you? Yeah, and like you were saying like you remember are you going with people? Who are now dead and and and that and that it teaches you, you know that Life life is real, you know and life you have a certain amount of time To rectify things you have to really like be the person that you would like to be, you know, and this is a real Morality play it's not it's not it's not something you're watching that's that entertainment for A small period of time or something. This is like real shit Let the fear take hold of you. Let let let let yourself get scared as fuck and try to refine yourself now Yeah, yeah Yeah, no, what is this? What is this insane idea that we're not supposed to be afraid? Like that, what is this insane idea that we're not supposed to feel shame sometimes or that we're not supposed to feel Dissonance, what is that insane idea? You know the other day as I was pondering all this stuff. I was thinking to myself. I know the solution I will just become a complete asshole That was what I that's what I was thinking is like, you know fuck fighting this Maybe I'm just meant to be an asshole Maybe I'll just have you ever had a have you ever had a panic attack or you're like you can't Nothing will make it better like you're you're you're like jumping out of your skin. It's like maybe you're Super overcaffeinated and on weight, you know, you've ingested too many drugs or something like the feeling like death is coming in And nothing will make it better. You know that feeling. Yes Well, that's like that's that's like the answer to your hey, I'll I'll just become an asshole and given to Given to all my, you know, indulgent temptations and just become the thing that That my my ego wants me to be is like on the other side of that is not pleasure But is a panic attack Where you're just going to be like this is This is what you know, where you're going to be like what? On the other side of of giving into your your heatness or your like ego's temptations is like Is a panic attack basically that just says This isn't helping either that that nothing can get you out. Like that's the for noble truth Basically saying, you know, these road trips just got a tight, you know, you have to accept and integrate with the world You have to be Hold on shit. All right rolling Okay, I'm getting my gas if you can hear me Okay Have it not allowed what the fuck debit not allowed at this dispenser Okay, I'm going in to give my guess I was just gonna say that, you know You can't turn you can't turn back. It'll do you no good, you know that these indications of fear or like Self loathing it's all means you're going the right way. You're just keep keep going that way It's you want redemption. That's that's why you you got there. That's why you Are feeling that going backwards giving into your ego doing all that. I mean, it's not going to make anything better It's going to be like Air clap and going on heroin for six years and losing those years You're going to wake up and things are going to be so much worse. You know what I mean? Yeah, right Yeah, no, no, no, I know man. I that it's just that's the fun. So then Well, we are right and then that ends up bringing you back to this place. We're like, all right. Well, you know I'm not I imagine that at some point I'm going to have An emotional compass that always points in the direction of being loving to people But until that happens, I'm just going to fake it I'll just be fake. I'll just be fake loving to people because it's still better than being An honest asshole, right? Isn't it better to be fake loving than to be an honest asshole? Well, I mean, yeah, there's there's a There's a reason for being alone, you know, too that there's there's a reason why You need to be alone a lot of the times and maybe not in a relationship and then Hopefully when you do find love, it's not through the twisted prism of some other incredibly unhealthy person that mistreats you because You'll know you're getting love, but you you'll be getting it from like A sick source, you know, it's like Go ahead and be alone and and repair yourself and refine yourself and make the great art of your life and then You know when you do fall in love, it'll probably be part of this larger Plan of your development, but it won't it won't cure you of anything, you know Yeah, when I fall in love, it's going to be with an android Isn't that Melton John song? I Was all of this It's about an hour by the time I get emotionally equipped enough to be in a relationship I will definitely Have access to androids that'll just be perfectly Perfectly tuned to my personality I'm buying one for your birthday That'd be what a great gift. What a funny shitty gift to to to give people just to ruin their lives Like give your friend in a great marriage an android. That's like a perfect sex robot Well, you know Once you it's like mazla's hierarchy, you know once you satisfy the bottom of the Triangle, you know you can get back to your higher purposes Yeah Well, I I I officially repent I repent.

363^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 563: Emil Amos Transcript and Discussion^2023-04-30^Hello to you. I'm Duncan and this is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Today we're going to take a break from talking about golf and we are going to have a conversation with one of my best friends, Emil Amos. You might know him from his many incredible bands, The Grails, Holy Sons, he's the drummer for Olm and he's an all-around brilliant whipper-do, as I call all my friends. This is going to be a quick intro. I'm on the road. I'm in Raleigh right now. I got to go do shows in just a little bit. Might I remind you, I'm going to be in Portland next weekend at Helium. Come see me with William Montgomery.

Welcome back to the DTFH. It's so good to see you. How are you doing? Oh, yeah, yeah. You're going to be able to function like that? It's great to see you, man. How close do you live to Raleigh? Fifty minutes or something. Thanks for driving out here to the show. Duncan was doing show three nights, actually. Yeah. This is the last night. Two more shows than back home. But this isn't part of a bigger like trip. This is just like an experimental little. Well, no, this is like a club weekend. So it's usually how they work. You just fly into someplace, do a few shows, fly out. It's really quite wonderful. But they know listeners know more than me. They know that you're kind of working on material for a special. Yeah, I haven't said anything about that yet. So now it's too late. You already fucking whistle blew me. He whistled blew me. It was amazing. I didn't reveal much. No, you didn't reveal anything. It's high time, man. So it's really intense being back here, man. It's like really it's so beautiful here. It's all green. This is the best time to be in North Carolina. It is. It's like it's like winter here or whatever you want to call it in general is kind of one of the best places to be because I was living in Portland for 13 years. Then New York winter year. Well, compared to like living in New York, winter year is soul crushing. Yeah. Maybe that's up in the mountains, though. Maybe that's an Asheville thing. Okay. Yeah. It leaves fall off the trees here, though. Well, I guess we're not in we're not in winter, right? So you kind of came into the tail end and you got this perfect day. We're walking down the sidewalk here. And you know, we're older whatever you want to call it. And but we're like super we appear to be super happy. We're like walking down the street in North Carolina again. So we've had so many different chapters of our lives. We're almost like postscript at this point, we're just in this kind of later stage free for all. Yeah. And then you were walking down the street and I'm asking you, isn't this amazing? Isn't this just great? And you said, you know, you have a lot of fun feelings for North Carolina still that it almost hurt or something. Yeah, almost. Well, because you know, we were talking about it at lunch. When you're pro process blind, you this is like this. So you go to okay, go to Hawaii, leave your hotel and go to the grocery store and why and what you will see. And again, maybe I just caught it on a bad day. But in my fantasy, as I'm looking around at all these people in the grocery store and one of the most beautiful places on earth, looking at all these people, they're not tourists anymore. They moved there. They went there for a great trip and they just uprooted themselves and moved to fucking Hawaii. They just are so sad. They're stuck. It's a small town. They don't want to be there. The local locals don't want them there. They don't they're in the middle of they don't want tourists to be there even though they started out as one. But when you go to a place and you forget like, yeah, this is great this week. This is great this month or whatever. But eventually it's just going to become another place I live at. So yeah, that's to me what we're nostalgia springs from is like, instead of seeing the big picture, you frame out this one little chunk of it and then you start missing that chunk and you forget all the other bullshit that you didn't like about it. Yeah, I know it's it's amazing to me that we lived in New York at the same time. Like that was just a little bonus chapter. Yeah. And now we're in another bonus chapter. Crazy. But I mean, there's been so many of them. I just feel like time ceases to exist at this age. You just sort of like in this other segment, you know, I've like gotten to this little physics kick for no reason at all. I just started sort of looking up like theories of time and how time goes faster when you're higher and slower when you're closer to sea level, how time is completely relative and how time is really like the measure of change. So you're measuring cycles basically, oscillations, the atomic clocks have some kind of weird atomic gas that is like perfect for measuring the fluctuations within which you can create the what they call the atomic clock, whatever. But in all these essays, the thing they kept kind of going back to is like, but time, it's as a thing is some real thing. It's probably not real, like there probably isn't necessarily time, at least in the way I think of it as like a river flowing that you're caught in or something like that, where really more than likely, everything just is sort of happening simultaneously. But because of the way our brains frame things out, it gives this illusion, which is why people get really freaked out when they get to be our age. Because you've been around long enough to start realizing, oh, I don't think there's I don't think time is like what I thought it was. Yeah, yeah, you were asking me on the sidewalk, do I still talk to my Boston guru? How do I do I still have him on a pedestal? Do I still have and there's so many different answers I could give to that. But but what I said to you was sort of just like, well, that that chapter that was written with that person and all the things you went through are totally still 100% real, resonating in a dimension I could in theory visit. But I'm not in it right now. But I've lost no respect for that dimension. Right. I like that would seem kind of petty and weird to start judging the past like as though you're above it somehow. I would never do that. It's a little cynical. Yeah, like, like, even some headline yesterday, I was reading Donna Summer saying she was a she was stupid and an idiot when she was young. And it's like, well, anybody can say that. And we know what you mean, right? You know what I mean? We, we, we all can say that. But but there's always there's always two different minds to those things. When I moved back to North Carolina, I would be driving to the grocery store, and then back to my house, and I'd come around the same curve that I would have been driving around when I was first getting my license. Yeah. And first getting stoned. I had my big toke master in the car, my 18 inch rattling underneath my seat with my, my fifths of gin and things. Oh, yeah. You know, and, and I would come around the curve and I would see as though I'm in a daydream, but very real, I would see myself 17 in the car. I was in coming around the curve towards me. Wow. As though I would like have to watch out for like that driver, you know, and I would just think to myself kind of like Donna Summer, like, God, that kid looks like dangerous. Yeah. That kid is, is quintessentially stupid in that 17 year old way. Right. I would have that sense realization that like if I saw myself, then now I would judge the person I'd be like, Jesus, what a mess. Like what a what a what a low brow little idiot. So I understand what she means. I understand what when she said that. But being the same person, I have to also admit the their potential of in that person wasn't totally very it wasn't very obvious. You know what I mean? You didn't really couldn't really see the person's potential. The person the person is in touch with it. Yeah, somewhat narcissistically, the person knows they could make a masterpiece. But from the outside, they look like a little piece of shit, right, which is ostensibly what people called me. And then and then you have those feelings for someone now, you know, when you maybe look at us, a specific kid driving by you now, but you don't know their potentiality. But they're in touch with it. And then yet, there's this entire fabric of people out there that are in touch with their the masterpiece they're going to make. Yeah, which they will never make. And then there's those people too. They're the the narcissist that actually don't have like, don't have the thing that actually vouches for it in the future. Right. There's the people like Twitter is just full of this massive orgasm of like this this this this like beast that's just riling, you know what I mean? Yeah. And and so to just look at it, to just observe it is a is a scary proposition because you're seeing a little bit of yourself and a little bit of yourself that that had the masterpiece inside of you. And thus the part of it, I don't mean to get all Disney channel on your Disney channel, but I think everybody has more in peace inside of it. Yeah, I do. I know it's so naive. I know it's so I do believe that because I think I think the other thing that starts happening when you get older, you know, you're getting worn down, not in a bad way, but you're getting you're getting worn down by time like all of the all the you're losing in the best way possible, you're losing that desire to instantiate whatever the thing you the zeitgeist was saying, this is what cool looks like you're that's starting to fade away. And so as that starts fading, where you're getting in touch with like sedimentary layers of your identity that are underneath that, they're just more simple. You're not embarrassed about your love of grilling that you would see like some old dude grilling like that is so boring. What's wrong with you grilling? Do you have grill pride? You remember I don't know if you remember this, but you'd see like dads with grill pride and you'd feel sorry for them, you would just be like Jesus help you. And then suddenly you that starts happening. And you're like, well, I just like being outside in this really dumb, elemental way, you're just like, I like the way the wind feels. And I'm guessing based on that, it's going to keep getting worn down and worn down until at some point, birding will make sense. You know, because like, I would always see old people into birds and be like, Jesus, is there anything more boring than a fucking blue jay? You're seeing they're staring at it with your binoculars. But, you know, so I feel like the more that wears down somewhere in there, that's where the masterpiece is somewhere in there is that simple, basic, good idea that you put some clothes on. I agree with you. I want to use a different like visual in my mind, but but but but the masterpieces is such a cool idea. Yeah, to me, the word is such a cool idea. And I think about the word all the time, because I think that we came up in a time when the masterpiece was sort of like the end point, the logical conclusion of all sort of toiling and research and development like everything pointed towards making the Star Wars when we were growing up. Right. And then at some point, during the internet, the masterpiece culture started to sort of die and like, like sort of sideways, arbitrary culture, right, started to become just as relevant, like a tweet, you know, getting as much attention as Star Wars. Yeah, it became just sort of like normal. Yeah. Right. And that was a little weird to navigate. But now that we're post that, and now that I'm kind of used to that, I look back at masterpiece culture is what I call it when I'm talking to myself because nobody wants to hear about this. Like when I when I think back about masterpiece culture, I kind of I'm like, well, that's a thing. I'm not eulogizing it. I'm not saying we need to go back. Right. You can never ever say we need to go back. That's like folly, you know. But and it's also relative, you know, it's like, whatever, there is a kind of masterpiece thought happening. But like my favorite rap group, sometimes, Ray Stremmer is what they're called, it's ear drummers backwards, that I wouldn't call them my favorite. But like they they sound really good. They don't even release their records physically anymore. Like they did the first like three or something. What do I do with them? They're just like in the ether, they're just like on YouTube. So it's like, we're getting to this point where it's like, the idea of even investing in your idea to put money into it is like a waste to them, you know, because they're coming from post masterpiece culture, right? Like culture, you know, so that's an interesting curveball. I was like, okay, like, they're just like, well, I'll just save money by not making the record. You know, but they're number one on the charts, right? Right. So like, you're kind of the nature of viewing the masterpiece as morphed, you know, like someone out there is going to get all tripped up and like bothered by the fact that I'm even calling it masterpiece culture. And someone else is going to really like that because they're going to remember how much we put into masterpiece culture as when we were younger. You know what I mean? We put everything into it. And in a way, the Bible is like masterpiece culture or or karate kid or whatever you want to call it, which I think have an interesting relationship, those two things. But that like, since we're post that, and we're sort of in a world where like the commodity is not necessarily the thing you made. It's kind of more of the river itself that you're stepping into and like in the exchange. Right. And I'm not like an expert anthropologically. I can't break that down for you right now. But essentially, you guys know, you know what I'm talking about. The masterpiece is like, for artists, it's like, it's enlightenment for people who meditate.

It's it's some idea that you have that at some point, all of it is going to culminate in some thing that is so undeniable, so special, potentially as far as like, well, it's both go really, it's going to rip all the culture. Exactly. And so yeah, that's what is that's masterpiece culture. Yeah, it's like David in, you know, the statue, right, you can't just have like part of David, or like I'm working on like an idea for the fingers of David, you've got to have back then, you had to have David done, right, finished, yeah, and you put it in front of people and they're like, that is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. You know, and then that starts a relationship with everyone and David and the all the various analysis and then the lineage of like style from that. It's an affirmation to the world. When it happens, it is defiant and it flies in the face of doom culture, which is prevalent right now, which is probably antithetical to masterpiece culture where doom culture is this new form of nihilism based on climate change, globalism, the world as a train off the tracks. And so that that has produced an entire way of being an entire style of music, an entire way of communicating with other people, a kind of desperation mixed in with a messianic thing, like somewhere mixed into that culture is this idea like, we turn off the machines, everything will recover. But it's all going downhill. What are you doing? You're working on a masterpiece? Well, I'm trying to save the planet. You're working on a masterpiece? No, the water is rising. To me, that almost reminds me more of like, protection culture versus like risk housekeeping. Oh, housekeeping's here. We'll be right back. Yeah, like the okay, so like just to traditional masterpiece, you're not making that shit in a day. You know, maybe that's where it's sort of, well, I guess it could be possible, like, you know, the, and all the crazy stories of enlightenment, the most annoying ones are like, he saw the reflection of the moon and a puddle of water and gainful realization or whatever. So, or you know, the, I guess some like modern art or something like that, where it's like a flick of paint upon the canvas and yet somehow a masterpiece is born. But in general, the idea is this is going to take you a long time, a long, long time to make a masterpiece. You don't just make one man, it's your life, your complete obsession, your dedication, your madness, all of it just the wins and the sales of whatever the thing is, that whatever it's going to be. And then finally, there it is, as opposed to, you know, just kind of trying to get like short-term dopamine hits for making things that you wouldn't even say they're good, but resonant or something, they resonate with whatever the weekly zeitgeist is in the perfect way, where people are like, wow, that is, you said it just right. Right, like, it's a meme. The lie of the, of the, of that kind of thinking is that that's just how easy it's going to be for you because you're just that, you were the chosen one, you know, you're, you're profound to such an extent that you, you've, you, you tossed the paint sideways, they hit the canvas and everyone for the rest of time, it's just like, it couldn't be done better. I, how did you do it? And it was like, I don't know. Look at that splatter. Look at that incredible splatter. But then the truth of it, though, at the same time is that all art is kind of a snapshot of a dimension or a snapshot of you in a window of time. Yeah. And then you yourself can't really return to that time so easily. And you may off the cuff say something that resonates. And then you're sort of stuck in the world as a real person, whether you're Bjork or Beck or any of these people. And they're like, I contributed this thing that people think is perfect. I made David. And then you live in the world and it's kind of hard for you to get back to that exact arrangement of molecules. Yeah. And so there's a truth and an ally in that kind of, in the kind of immediacy of the thought being perfect. Right. You, the, what you're talking about, this pops up in Buddhism a lot, talk about it with David all the time. But it's this idea of continuity of self. So it really, there isn't real continuity of self. You have to assemble it based on your mind. You, you, you pick the phenomena out that is your past from all the other shit you encountered that you can't remember anymore. You pick out some grouping of people, events, stories, you then modify the stories over time to sort of be cooler than you forget you modified them. And then you remember the modification as though we're true. And so this thing that you're talking about, you know, getting back to that person who made the thing that the torture for so many people who God forbid they do make a masterpiece, but like in their twenties. And now, oh my God, you've got to surpass that. You have to surpass it. And then you're desperate because you're like, what the fuck was I then? Some people try to assemble the same drugs. They try to assemble the same whatever in this desperate attempt to replicate that part of the time space continuum that was the womb of their creation. And it's very sad because you can't, you can't do that because it's gone now. That's not there. And you, you, you think you are that person. Have you ever felt that the competition with your older self, your earlier self? I wouldn't call it competition, but I've certainly like, it's why I believe in reincarnation. Like I, I just, this is how I understand reincarnation is just by looking at past versions of myself and realizing like, I know that I underneath all of that was whatever this particular consciousness that I call myself, but the person is dead, like the person is gone, the person, the surroundings, everything. This is to me, I'm sure there's, it feels like there should be a German word for this. Like the Germans have like the best words for like swaths of experience in the wet, like in America and stuff we experience, we don't have words for, but the word for going back to that curve, your curve, your curve you're talking about going back to your town you grew up in, going back to the mall and looking around. And not only do you realize it's so small, it seems so big, but then you're looking around and it's atrophied, it's disintegrating, time has taken hold, the economy has taken hold, you were there when it was brand new, the movie theater had a fresh coat of paint on it, holy shit, we got a new movie theater, look it's new, you come back and it's just like you, it's sagging, the paint is great, the stores that it used to be in there are all gone, everything gone, it's like you've you've gone into a dream, you've managed to go back into a dream you were having, but the dream is now faded, shadowy, that is a really interesting feeling man, it really hits home the idea of if you're looking for a home in the world, you're not gonna find it, sure you can go home after 20 years, but that's not your home anymore, it doesn't look like your home, it's filled with new people who like all are having their own experience of teenager years or whatever, you know what I'm talking about, oh totally, it must be the way ghosts feel, well it must raise such essential questions for some people, some artists who are not ready to tackle such central questions, because I think a lot of people get on the track because they're like, you know, they're young, they're enthusiastic, they see a magazine and Ozzy Osbourne's doing like the sign of the devil in the front, and they're just like, fuck yeah, I'm fucking 12 bro, you know, and then you know fast forward 30 years later and they're like in some weird bar in Hamburg and they're shlubby and they're still riffing it out, but they really don't know why, you know what I mean, so like for some fan to walk up and say like that one record in 88 when you were in Venom was absolutely perfect and you're just kind of like uh that's what everybody says to me every day and it hasn't been 1988 for a really long time, you know, so you got to ask yourself then why am I doing this and why did I start, but why am I really still here and what do I have to contribute, truly give to people and I think there was this one time, I don't remember if we ever talked about it, but but there was this one time where I was having a lot of trouble with that, I think I maybe had just moved back to North Carolina and I called you from inside a grocery store and I was just pacing the aisles in Asheville, North Carolina because it was like the first time I'd been back and we were playing a show that night, Grails was playing at this club called the Moth Light and I was I was just in a really not a very good mood and I was like, I called you and I was like, dude, I don't feel, I feel strange, like I don't feel like myself or something and you were like, I've been talking to this monk about this and they told me that when that happens to you, when the thing you had a revelation, you had a discovery, you found a way of life, it all made sense, it worked for you, but at one point in your life, it stops working and on that day, you have to fucking put that stuff down and go find a whole new way to go figure out your, you know, a whole new therapeutic space and I was like, man, I just never really thought about it like that, it felt very nice, like it was like an option was given to me and I went off to the show and I think I had a good night and I always remember because you had the right answer at the right time, you know, I don't know if it was something you were dealing with though because you seemed happier that day on the phone, but I needed to hear that, you know, yeah, and so that kind of goes back to us on the sidewalk earlier, this kind of idea of like, well, I could travel back to a time when I had a revelation, but I have no interest in having that revelation again, my in some dimension, I'm there 17 with the bong under my seat and my guru is beside me and I respect it fully, like I don't, but I don't even really pay tribute to it much anymore, it's just there in space and time, but now my job, you know, is something else, I'm in a different phase of research and development. Yeah, you know, what you, I think if you want one thing that people get confused about is like terrain you know, you start thinking like, oh, it was the mountains, oh, it was my young body, it was the smell of the pine trees, it was my girlfriend, all these things, but my belief is that what's really happening when you're having those peak experiences that get associated generally with youth is that you are fully present, you're fully in the moment, and you don't have the extra data set that we have of all these memories, because the memories you cocoon yourself in the memories, they become this like, what's the shit on boats? What's the shit of barnacles? Barnacles, these things that you're cherishing so much, they're really just these sort of temporal barnacles that have formed around your ability to experience the present moment, because you have such a complex story that you don't want to give up, and so now what happens is if you get lucky, something will happen where a barnacle breaks off, and usually it's something awful, or you know, a tragedy, or you just find yourself in a completely novel situation, and you like, you have this feeling, oh my god, there's that feeling that I thought you could only have when you were young, what the fuck, but then the barnacle grows back so quickly for most people that they just think it was like a passing gas or something, and so yeah, that to me is what that monk was talking about was disown it, whatever the fucking thing is that you, your big ass trophy, or your big ass shame trophy, whatever it is you've been hauling around, disown it, let it go, what happens if you do that? It's incredible, the name for in Tibetan Buddhism, or one of the descriptions of it is the reunification of the mother and the child, it's really fucking cool, it's like this idea of the mother and child coming back together again, and the way a child runs to the mom, and the mom embraces the child, versus the prodigal son situation, the abyss where you're just like, I've lost my youth, it's gone, I'll never be there again, well no, you'll never be there again, but the only reason there mattered was because you were so in the moment, you were so fully connected to the now, you didn't know, you didn't recognize that was what was happening, you associated it with all these other things you were doing, and now it's just like you were right there, fully in the flow in the moment, that can happen anytime. Totally, you can probably turn that off now if it's, if it's, he turned on the air conditioner to, he felt bad for me, but I think it'll make the audio better. Yeah, I never really put down my, put down my musical, you know, lab, and went off and started working in film, because of that conversation, I didn't ever think, oh, I have to move on, you know, past this system of record making necessarily, but within record making, I am always trying to do exactly what you're talking about, and I think people know, like I'm always trying to shed something and re-assert something that is nothing to do with equipment or anything, you know, I'm always trying to play no guitar or, you know, you know what I mean? Because there was an experience I had in like 97 when we were messing around my four track all the time, and I would go talk to other kids that had four tracks and like have a beer, and we'd be talking about what it means to like make a song by yourself in your dorm room. And I was like, we were trading songs, and I was like, can you hear how this song you liked, you're asking me about, is like, the music doesn't even matter, you know, that has nothing to do with the actual music, it's like the personality that's completely transcending it, hovering above it, coming over the music is what I'm really interested in, and the kid was like, yeah, no, no, I hear that part, and I don't understand that, I don't know what that is or how it's happening. Because most people have the equipment all lined up, and they're like, you know, first you do this, then you do this, then you do this, and like, it does seem like an obligation to me to always be shattering the assembly line and also just breaking it, you know, so that all that's left is just this, at the end, in theory, this voice of like, you know, the Wizard of Oz just like booming into your brain and like controlling like how you think of what art is, and it's just outrageous. It's outrageous. Yeah, that's what I want out of art, but of course, by the time it's done and handed in, mastered and put on a record, it just like sounds like music or whatever, which is kind of disappointing. But you know, you want people to just get shattered and be like, well, how did this even fucking get on here? You know what I mean? So is that the mistake? Is that the mistake we make? It's like, it's not enough that you're shattered in the creation of the thing. It's not enough that in the creation of the thing, you get to have the transcendent experience where you're mounted by something, you don't even know what it is. It's familiar to you. You're so happy it's back. It comes through you. There it is, again, you're watching your hands do shit, and your accidents are happening. We're like, God, that's exactly what I needed. But on top of that, there's some desire within you to blow minds, to you know what I mean? You want people, I mean, like an extra ego push. This is one of my big problems is I'll say you or I'll say like, people think instead of like, I think. Yeah. So I have noticed sometimes that I would love to make like, don't write like Terrence McKinnon, or to, you know, I would love to like, just, I want to melt faces, man. This is good. You know, it's not enough. Right. You know, it's not enough to go into the temple, into the Holy of Holies, and have communion with the divine intelligence. You also want people to just like there that you just want their eyes to dilate. You want that you want to explode a new culture you want to transform. I'm not I want you know, the that part of me I want to like shift global consciousness, world peace. I don't know what it is you I want. You know, and the more that I get caught up in that, then I trade that thing that comes over the creation for a completely different thing. This is the Demiurge. Now, instead of it being that spontaneous giver of gifts, it's a replica of some fraction of humanity and what I think their reaction to the thing I'm making will be. You know, it's a completely different God, is all I'm saying. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. Right. I've thought about that. Like some of these people you see winning like the the number one book award, Oprah award or whatever the hell, you know, I don't think Oprah does awards currently, but she should. It's like culture has gotten to this point or human like cleverness is probably always been at that point when someone was, you know, scribing, you know, the Bible or anything. But like now we've gotten to this point where we know what the voice should sound like to win the award. Yeah. So we can write in that voice. The AI will do it for you now. The AI will just do it. The AI will just like take it and do it. That's that's the glory of AI, is that it's going to make such works. Dude, the AI Bible is going to be so sick. So sick. The ability to just tell the tell the computer to like rewrite the Bible and and include you this fucking time, make rewrite the Bible, but I want to be Moses. It the the the benefit of all this is that that once it gets through its intermediary phases and starts making true masterpieces is that maybe it will help people tune back into the to the that other voice instead of the voice of the algorithm, the voice of the machine, the voice that other voice is so special. And it has no guarantees for you other than it's there with you at that moment. And and it it doesn't want anything. It doesn't demand anything. It's purely progenitive. It's so beautiful. And it but you know, we want, you know, you have to live in the world, you need to make money. So you want to make something that's like, I guess, you know, you see, you won't starve there. So with it wrapped up within the reasons for communing with that thing, inevitably, you know, all kinds of dense aspects get mixed up in there, whether you want to or not. I don't think there's any perfect fucking artist out there just purely as in communion with a creative force and has no thought of result. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by better help. You know, there's a thing that always pops up in Eastern traditions, the idea that a human life is like somebody living in a house where a diamond is buried underneath that house, you might be walking around all depressed, sad, fuzzed out, freaked out, low down, blasted by the zeitgeist and not even realize that hidden deep inside of you is a diamond. Therapy is like digging down into the mind of your subconscious and also to be completely honest, you're not just going to find diamonds down there.

I don't think there's any perfect fucking artist out there. Just purely as in communion with the creative force and as no thought of result. Yeah, it seems like back in our kind of whatever 80s youth, the Masterpiece era youth, there was this sort of idea that the artist was always a rebel. Like they detached from the current algorithm. They went off into a cave and then they kind of came back around the side, defied the rules, broke the assembly line, broke the machines and they came back and they offered this whole new space on how you could talk about life or reflect the very human side. It might have just been so beautifully sad or it might have been really powerful and optimistic. But at some point, if we do lose Masterpiece culture, it seems like we sort of start to get into just people who are kind of famous because they met with a form of success and we're like, oh, they've got a space where they exist. Andrew Tate, a lot of people don't like him, but more power to him is doing good out there in jail. But it's just sort of like the people have this kind of 15 minutes of fame thing has gotten so relativized. And the infinite field of the internet is so relativized that, of course, we'll never lose the original impulse or thread. But the field of vision is just snow blind with just noise, right? So I don't mean that in any fatalistic sense, but it does seem like you have to like something, these mutations kind of come out of the noise and sort of, they act as a new form of that detacher rebel or something. Originally, we had like the Brian Eno or something like the one guy, the Ian McKay, you know, like the one person that detaches and the Buddha or whatever, and it's just like drops out, you know, the Terence McKenna or whatever, just the dropout entity that's like, you don't need to do any of this. Yeah, you know, just like you were saying earlier, one of our professors sort of break the spell. Yeah, finds the way to break the spell. And so then people who didn't feel as comfortable in that noise as seemingly other people do, they tune into this person and suddenly it's this liberating experience because they found in that moment a way to articulate not just like the reality of the noise, Maya, Mara, whatever the name you want to give it, but also like a way, a potential path out that it's exciting and it gives you a sense of like it. Oh, shit, right, there is, there's always noise. There's always the chaos of the world and the worldlings and the people who then they're part of their life, they're just fully connected to the card. I always use them as an example, like the Kardashians are fully connected to some 90 day fiance, like they're spending their time all day, like really kind of emotionally thinking about the show. Did that person make the right decision? And in those people, if you start tuning into them too much, you feel like all is lost. You're like, this is, this is the collapse of society. This is the call you go like you to turn on the wrong channel, you probably shouldn't be watching TV, you turn on the wrong channel and you're just like, remember that time we were on acid, watching TV at your house a long time ago, we were watching cops, cops MTV. And I remember just that we both were so like the acid just seemed to be turning the volume up on the synthetic nature of it, the manipulative nature of it, the way it was parading as though this is normal life, the way people are talking. This is real. Yeah. And the acid, the true great truth teller was like hissing at it like a snake. Like that's not real. Look at that. It's clownish. It's like watching the bozo show when you're a grown up, like when you're a kid, it was like, oh my god, this fucking clown is incredible. But you know, so anyway, my point is, yeah, the masterpiece, it like is a kind of like a pebble against the windshield of that stuff. It flies in the face of it. It produces like possibility just by its very existence. Humans can do this. There's more that could be done than just the fuzz, adding to the static, replicating the static, simulating the static, which is a simulation of previous static forms, which goes all the way back to like an entropic disintegration of some former zeitgeist that was pure. It just devolves and devolves through imitation. That's the static, right? It's like trying to not just replicate, this is cool, but then add your own touch to this is cool, but that this is cool was a replication of the that this is cool, which is a replication of this is cool. But somewhere back there, it was really cool. Like somewhere back there, someone naturally spontaneously blew something out of their mind into the world and it was real. And then it got imitated all the way through over and over again. Anyway, well, I mean, you think about children viewing this, the rushing river of capitalism, they're like walking up to it in their early lives, you know, and they're looking at it and they're like, you know, they're seeing all the activity, they're seeing all the money, they're seeing all the power, everything that comes from joining that river, right? And that river is so fierce. And there's so much, that's where connection lies, essentially, is like within the human river, which is ostensibly a capitalist rushing machine. And so the Kardashians, whoever, you know, they, they find a frequency, they find something that speaks that connects to people, and that river is fucking lightning fast in it. And it, we all understand shallow takes on human life, and we all can connect with them. But the more difficult takes the things or the things that require more, more thought and more, you know, difficult truths are not going to be able to, you know, give you the same benefits when you're showing a child. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like, that's a great masterpiece across the river over there, off to the side, you know, that we all reference, you know what I mean? David is over there. He's not really like in the vape pool, you know what I mean? Yeah. But, but so the child's got to start to differentiate like what's important, you know, like, like the everything's pulling them into that. Yeah, that energy field, that river, you know, but like, you're sort of showing them like, if you work really hard, you can join the rebel forces, and you can fight against this momentum, you know, and the child then has to be like, God, why would I do that? Like, that sounds really difficult. Yeah. But you have to like, keep always displaying, you know, that like society, and it won't even work without critical thinking and the things that does, you know, deconstruct this machine, you know? Yeah. I mean, it'll work. I think it'll work. It's like, it works the way like diarrhea works, like is when diarrhea comes spraying out of your ass. I mean, is it working? Yeah. It's harmonizing with gravity. It's like, is it failure on one level? Yeah. I guess I don't want to like get down on diarrhea, but I would call it some form of failure of the digestive system or your decisions, whatever you put in your body. So the, the, now I don't mean to say it's all diarrhea. I don't mean to say it's a river of diarrhea or whatever, because I don't think it is. I think, and I don't think it's even real. It just seems real. It's not only lives in the TV, it only lives in boxes. You go out in the world and, you know, you might run into some people who are imitating this meme or that beam or whatever, but generally most people you run into seem pretty cool, authentic, maybe a little confused or something. And, but then underneath all of that, this is the part that, this is to me, the revolutionary part that will never go away. And this is how the whole game works. Like the reason you get to be the rebel is because so many people are putting such hard work into being like into the static. God, they're working so hard to push back. They're working so hard to try to freeze the culture. This is the way things are forever. They're working so hard to like, don't you do that with your hair? Are you really putting on a dress? What are you doing? And then, and, and it, without that, you got nothing. What you have no, you've got, it's like having a pushup. It's like having a bench press with no weights. You need them for the game to function. You need the omnipresent sense of some massive cabal of mediocre people. So you could rage. They're doing the work. And then when you realize without them, there's no me if I'm to be the rebel archetype. In fact, I'm connected to them. And now you're really in trouble because you realize your roots. They're getting water from there, man. You can't even, you can't really separate yourself from it. You're part of it. You're part of that biome. You're part of the ecosystem. Whether, yeah, the cloud might judge the fucking land or something. Look down there. Can't fly like me or the land might judge the cloud. Look at you. You fucking changing, constantly changing vapors piece of shit. Like the tree, whatever is judging every point is all it's come all, all depends on all of it. The masterpiece depends on all the shitty pieces. The shit pieces are the fucking fertile soil of the masterpiece. Masterpieces grow in fields of shit. Someone's got to do the shitting. Yeah, it's funny you say that I when I think back to whatever it was like 98 99 when I when I was the happiest I've ever been, that was a hallmark casual thought I had at the time. Every day I remember thinking instead of being like my normal sort of like earlier angry, sort of bitter, maybe competitive self or something in that particular frame of mind, a central thought that I always had was, I need this to be this way. Yeah, like this is perfect. That's it. You know, and I would come and talk to you. I'd be like, I've got this feeling, you know, and it's basically that like nothing should change. You know, but it's I can say that to you now, but I can't like seduce myself into thinking that way every day or feeling that way. But that was a hallmark of my thinking. And I remember thinking exactly what you just said that that whole relationship was a was a very affirming, you know, it was a necessity. It was great. It was great that it was it was this organism that worked together so harmoniously from above. That's why you know, I'd always write songs or talk about the the unity from from overhead because if you can get high enough enough up, you know, you would see that it's all it's doing great doing great. Yeah, it's not divisive. Yeah, we need them. You know, and the the the there's a story like chokin Trumpa. He goes to India. He's going to go meditate in the cave at Padma Sambhava. It's great that insane meditated in. He writes about it. Very grim. Assessment of everything like this monastery that's built there is kind of run down in the I think his attendant that he had was getting hammered or something. And there was just all these problems at the monastery. And finally he goes down into the cave to meditate. He's built himself up to this moment like this is where I will get the great transmission. This is where I will find the the Turton, the treasures, the hidden Dharma teachings that are supposedly locked in different places. This is goes into the cave. I think he complains because there's like soda bottles scattered everywhere in this cave where Papa Sambhava meditated. And he's, you know, facing the reality of of like your version of what the romanticized version of things and what they're really like. And I think he's filled with some kind of like crazy despair or this just sense of like what the fuck this cave has used condoms in it. And so then I think he goes back into the monastery and just gets hammered. And in that state of being completely drunk, he produces, it just pops out of him this thing called a treasure teaching like it explodes out of him a recognized addition to Buddhism pours out of his mind. And in that in it was a masterpiece. It was a culmination, especially of his lineage of Buddhism, which is saying what you just were talking about skymind everything's perfect when you get far enough away. And that he needed not just his ability to like, have mindfulness, but if not for the filthy cave, if not for the problems, not for the gift shop in the monastery, then that thing wouldn't have come out of his mind. It was completely a fundamental dharmic teaching in its own right. The voice of the Buddha was emanating not from some celestial realm from a shit cave in a rundown monastery. And that was what was true. That was what was really happening. And in that it's perfect in that just the way it is. That's where you hit that that's where you can knock those barnacles off when you start realizing that or even more so you just realize the barnacles are just as perfect as the rest of me. And that's possible, man. In any moment you can do that. That's possible. Should we take a whip at break, whip at break. Yeah. There you go, man. Do it again. I just you squeeze that bottom part carefully. It's been a while. It's been a while. Kind of blast out. Blast it. Yeah, do it. It's out. Let me load her back up. We're going to load up this whipped cream thing here, folks, and then we're going to talk about the book a job. We're going to do some nitrous hits and jump in a little bit. Speaking of the rushing river of well, and the rushing river of idiocy and capitalism. Man, lately my Twitter algorithm is I just look at it just like for morbid curiosity. And it's like my Twitter algorithm is like, it's just it's literally like the fucking beast just laughing and puking. Yeah, it's fucking amazing. It's just it's only okay. Do that. Record yourself doing it. Dude, you fucking rigged this thing way too powerful. Do you usually feature the urination on the show? Do you usually feature the urination sound on the show? Do I? Jesus, bro. How was it? How was your experience? It blew you down. I feel kind of, I feel a little foggy. You taste the flavor in it. You got a special flavor. I did. It's lemonade flavor. Here we go. In the book of Job, one of the central tenants, if you ask me, this surrender. What did God make a deal with the devil? Are you going to leave in all the audio of the urination? Yeah. Oh, cool. Um, no, it's telling you stories that it on Twitter, there's this, there's, you know, so many great, horrible, horrible videos. I mean, but you can't keep your eye off. Like, what are you seeing? Give me some updates. Let me look at the time. We're doing pretty good. Yeah, no, no. There's one of my favorites. Do you know this one? It's like a kind of maybe a lower middle class British bloke. He's walking. He's kind of stomping through the morning neighborhoods in the UK. Yeah. I'm sure someone out there has seen this one and he's just yelling into the, into the world. He's just going. I haven't seen this. He's going. Who wants some? Who wants some? Who wants some? Why? He's just kind of going along. I mean, he's like, he's looking for a fight. Yeah. And eventually the guy filming it, I think, is just like kind of sticks his head out the window. He's like, I'll have some. Anyway, it's just, it's, it's amazing to peer into the B size or whatever, this insane thing, you know, but also just to look down in the river and just watch it glimmering and just like rushing by and just, yeah, I mean, just all the energy of it. It's so nonsensical and it's just howling and crazy. And yeah, I mean, it's, it's an amazing thing, kind of like you're saying, being on acid and watching cops and stuff. I mean, it's just, it's so wild. It'll suck you in. You could see why the child might just want to join that and be like, fuck a masterpiece. You know, that shit sounds hard, you know, or whatever. But yeah, or maybe the way masterpieces, you know, emanate from the, from, from humanity, it was going, it's going to change. I mean, this is the real kick in the balls. Because you, no matter what, you're born into some particular time period, you're taught about the rules of the game. This is what you need to do. We were born into a time where it's like, you're going to go to college. After you go to college, you'll have, you'll be an expert in something. You're going to take that expertise. You're going to help the world. You're going to get a great job. Start your own business from that expertise. Retire. Have a great retirement and then die. This is your map of life. And then nowhere in there, do they say, but it's going to get interrupted because there's going to be a pandemic and the whole society is going to get shut down. Then after that, they're going to start seeing a lot of UFOs and super intelligence is going to be created that they call AI, but it's really channeling the aliens or whatever. And that will make all of human innovation seem obsolete because it's going to spit out David's every 14 seconds using matter assimilators that are a million times better than David, but also alive. They can walk around and then you're going to be consumed into a kind of singularity thing. You don't, you know what I'm saying? It's like the kick in the balls is if it's this, this is like the best Jesus story. It goes something on the lines of a man hires some workers. They work all day. He needs more workers to get the job done. He goes out and he finds two more workers and gets them to work for the last hour of the day. And then he pays all the workers the same amount of money and the workers who worked all day are like, what the fuck? We worked all day. They worked for one hour. You're really going to give them the same amount of money. Shouldn't you give them less? That's the parable. And this is where, you know, if you've been like, motherfuck, I learned a code. I learned Ableton. I learned how to draw. I learned how to paint. I learned how to do. I learned how to do doctrine. And all of a sudden, it's this thing is like, yeah, but it's going to do it is not only it was going to do it, it's going to do it better than you. You know, this is this and people who learn to use that technology are going to have the same abilities that you have after all those years and all that money you spent on college. And if you so if you get pissed about that, that's how you see more. It's interesting when you were talking about your, you didn't call your ego, but that part of yourself that wants to almost like identify with with being the one that made the masterpiece or yes, you know, that's a really cool idea because I think the way it often goes with the, I don't know, the stories of like Malcolm X or the great some of the great thinker leaders is that like you start you start on a selfish frequency and then the selfish frequency leads out into because because it's pure because it's really pure. You really want to know you really want to grow. It leads you towards this bigger impulse that that's just implicated in the original self impulse, right? So I think when you said that, you know, you sort of have this part of yourself that kind of wants ownership or whatever you said it. Yeah. I don't I don't think of that as bad necessarily bad bad energy because it's just it starts that way you identify with it being you. Yeah. And then as you get older, as you've implied sort of throughout the podcast, as you get older, you sort of you sort of start to see it in perspective as like these are moments of these are sentiments in the air that someone's kind of, you know, part of or they grab and they and they articulate it, but they don't necessarily own it like a fucking copyright. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. And then that whole idea is what creates the like washed up metalhead in the Hamburg bar, you know, that's like, I made this thing in 88 and like meant so much to so many people and like, I'll never make the first whatever record again, you know, but but the pure form the person that's still in tune with genuinely being a curious entity is always going to find their way back to that first impulse because it's kind of right there. You never stop being a child or what? Yeah, you never stop having that that energy. So that but that was an interesting thing that you sort of separated your your internal lust to as as kind of like your selfish push, you know, but that's a real thing that people get lost in for sure. Sure. It's the same thing that makes people fuck. It's it's I mean, it is a primordial desire to push something into the world. And it's great. I don't think there's anything I think anything that gets anybody's making something is wonderful. How lucky you are if it's your whether it's your anger, whether you've had some burst of inspiration, whether you're just grinding away, making garbage, whether you're whatever it may be, you're still you're still like attempting to get in the flow of of creation and or the ray of creation or whatever you want to call it, yours and you're still part of the creation. No one talks about the Buddha's great grandmother or great grandfather that I'm aware how if the Buddha's great grandfather had failed to fuck on whatever particular night that he decided to fuck, we would have no Buddha. No one talks about like whoever fed the Buddha's grandfather that afternoon, the meal or the day before I don't know how long it takes to make jizz. I don't know like when you eat rice or when you eat hamburgers, how long before some part of that turns into semen? I don't know. But all I'm saying is the the had you know, what if the Buddha's great great grandfather had decided that he was going to eat like bananas and doll or some shit that day instead of whatever he ate, would we even have a Buddha? So no one talks about that. They only talk about the fucking Buddha, but they don't talk about the entire the way the entire universe got together accidentally through a variety of incredible synchronicities to produce the thing itself. It is ironic that yeah, so much is said about trying to kill the ego and the ego might be one of God's like central seduction devices to get you to come towards the pure. Right? Yeah, we're always everyone's always out there. Well, I have to do this for the son of our God. Dude, I shattered my ego on ayahuasca. Everybody's shattering and smashing their fucking ego. How about you stop? Give it a break. Leave it alone. It's like that's it. You see this thing on my face? I had this perfect zit deep in my cheek and I just had I knew if I could pop it, it would be the most beautiful explosion, but I couldn't get in deep enough. And so I fucking like scratch my face trying to pop the zit. That's what people are doing with their ego. Everyone's out there trying to do like pimple poppers with their ego. It doesn't inflame their ego. Leave it alone. We love your ego. It's cool. It's funny at the very least. Yeah, as it as it's in a connection with your your own, I mean, isn't there some old idea that like that it all starts with with a kind of greed that that like Buddha wouldn't have even left the castle if it not for greed? Yeah, you know, Judas, no Jesus, no mud, no lotus, no no fucking no castle, no Buddha, no, you know, like the way we tell the stories, those things get listed as aberrations like a mistake instead of as a fundamental principle part of, you know, no crucifier, no Jesus, like somebody had to like take the hammer and the nails and do the work. No one talks about that person. It's always just, you know what I mean, the dude who had to be like, Oh, fuck, how many, how many crucifixes today? Are you kidding me? Damn, it's a busy, busy Thursday. No one talks about that. It's probably why they start the last temptation of Christ with the with the whole scene where Jesus is the one making the crosses. Yeah, because they want you to see him in that light first. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like the carpenter, you know, the this is the unspeakable. You're not supposed to talk about this. Like no one's supposed to talk about how like, if not for all of the very, very difficult personalities existing on the planet right now, we would have no masterpieces that in fact, they are accidentally participating in the greatest works of art that ever happened. All right. This is our this is our final blow. Final blow. Oh, there you go. That's some stuff, man. You didn't give me any instructions. How do I listen? Who teaches the dolphin to swim? Who teaches the turtle baby to run into the sea? You just do it. I'd like to thank Vape 798 for supplying the nitrous oxide for today's episode.

Hello, my dear sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and I'm ashamed to start this podcast off with yet another audio apology, but I got to apologize and I understand that apologizing too much is a sign of weakness. I know the history of the world. I know that in the medieval times it was a common practice to drag on Sundays the apologizers of the village into the town square and yank their pants down, exposing their pasty medieval buttocks and to spend hours flogging them with branches and leather straps until rivulets of medieval plague blood dribbled down into their lice-encrusted leg hair. Wolves would be released from the pens surrounding the town square and the wolves would run to the buttocks and lap at the briny medieval blood licking and licking and sometimes chewing and the screams of the apologizers would rise up into the forest canopy and cursed owls would fly to the homes of witches and lay devil eggs into the witches' chalices, which the witches would then use to make the cows of the village stop producing milk and the babies deformed. I get it. I don't mean to be the apologizing person, but I have to and this is it. I look at this, what happened today in this episode is a sign from the podcasting gods that it is time for me to move on. I will admit that this particular problem, this issue, which is that when I was recording this podcast I did not realize that I was recording into my, not into my wonderful, fancy, sure microphones that are running into a fancy, some fancy other shit, which I don't know the name of really because I'm not an audio engineer, but rather what happened was that I recorded this entire podcast into the on-board mic of my laptop. I want to blame it on the house. I want to blame it on the room that the podcast studio is stationed in this ancient house that is essentially in the middle of a concrete kennel. I'm surrounded by dogs on all sides, hundreds and thousands of bang, flea-covered Los Angeles mongrels rolling in the dust chasing the emaciated drought squirrels that sometimes fall out of the tree because they're dehydrated. I want to blame it on the fact that sometimes it feels as though the walls of the podcast studio are cursed that behind the walls of the podcast studio are the obsidian carapaces of demonic mantis creatures that emanate a shit heat that fills up the podcast studio. I want to blame it on the sun and whatever terrible confluence of bad circumstance and environmental disaster has created the super hot conditions of Los Angeles, but their real blame has got to go to my right hand, which two hours prior to this podcast in front of my own eyes scooped a large quantity of caramel cannabis infused marijuana. Like a monkey scooping at banana cream, I watched it happen fast, quick. Before I could do anything, my hand lifted the sweet THC infused sugary mass into my mouth and my mouth betrayed me by chewing it and swallowing it, getting it into my stomach, and the betrayal continued as my stomach removed the THC from the caramel and via my circulatory system got that THC into the neuro receptors of my brain causing me to experience a state of marijuana intoxication. This was mixed in with alpha brain and the combination of these two things put me in a warm, mellow, happy, focused state. And yet because I was so comfortable emotionally, I didn't pay attention to the fact that regardless of how many times I turned the dial on my mixing board, the waveform on the audio program I used to record was not changing. I decided, oh, I'm sure it's fine. Why would the, why would the waveform change if I adjust the volume levels? And as a neophyte, lazy stoner audio engineer, what ended up happening is I recorded what I consider to be a great podcast where Tate told me things that I'm going to think about for a very long time to come. And yet the sound quality is degraded and diminished. And so you're going to hear clicks, the clicking of the chairs on the wooden floor. The odds are also good that you're going to hear droplets of sweat rolling down my esteemed guest's face and landing onto my podcast table. You've got to understand how awful that is to have my friends drive through LA traffic, which is what Tate did, to come into a podcast studio where they experience what it must be to be one of those fat little hot dogs rolling in one of those stinky 7-eleven hot dog distribution machines. It makes me feel terrible to look across in my guest as they're overheating because they're in a room in a hundred-year-old house in the middle of a kennel that also seems to be on the flight path of the Los Angeles Police Department's helicopter division. And they're sweating. They're like crawfish in a boil pot. I feel like I'm staring at, so it honestly is like watching someone in the last stages of their life. No one in the history of interviewing ever said, if you want to get a great interview, put your guests in a superheated room and surround them with howling, bang dogs in the flight path of militarized helicopters. So I got to move. I just don't want to do the podcast in an office space. I feel like there's something cool about folks coming over to your house. It makes it more intimate. In the meantime, pray for me. Pray to all the angels in heaven and hell, whatever particular deity you happen to worship. If you don't worship a deity, pray to the laws of logic and mathematics. Pray to whatever super consistent, transcendent force you consider to be the place from which the universe emerges from. And I guess I would say I try to keep my hand from shoving marijuana-infused cannabis treats into my mouth before I do a podcast, but that would be the same thing as me saying I was going to stop doing podcast, which I don't plan on doing for a very, very long time. Thank you guys for bearing with me. I hope that you will make it through this podcast, even though the audio quality is incredibly low grade. It's well worth it. Tate really blasts out some serious hardcore truth bombs. And I think you're really going to enjoy it. He's a super cool guy, a fighter, an actor, an entrepreneur. And he's one of the sweetest guys I know. And yet he lives inside a very menacing, dangerous-looking physical form, which is pretty cool. So we're going to jump right into that interview. But first, let's do some quick business. Today's episode of the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the Dream Lords over at Casper.com. Use offer code FAMILYHOUR and you will receive $50 off a sweet mattress. Some time ago in 2013, I was hornswoggled by mattress monger in a mattress depot in Atwater Village. I went in there, I was grieving and sad. I had recently lost a mother in a testicle, and I was in a complete, confused state of feverish lunacy, where I thought the way to cure the aching, empty horror inside of me that was coming from the grim realization that me and everyone I know will eventually die was to buy a hyper and expensive mattress that could vibrate. I ended up buying this thing, walking out of the mattress store, holding a pink invoice slip with the terrible numbers indicating how much I had paid for this shit mattress haunting me as I got in the car. But because I was out of my mind with grief and post-cancer sickness, I was excited. I didn't know that I'd been ripped off. I actually looked forward to the delivery of this dark hell pad that came to my house. Before long, I realized that the cure for the first noble truth of Buddhism, life is suffering, was not to buy a new mattress and lay on it pretending that everything was okay. This mattress was embarrassing. It vibrated. There's nothing good about having a vibrating bed. The only people who like vibrating beds are serial killers and horror mongers. It was embarrassing. I actually showed it off to my friends like it was a good thing. Paid so much money for this thing. I'm never going to say how much I paid, but it's humiliating the amount. Within six months, this mattress became soaked with my grief sweat and grief ejaculations until it looked like some satanic shroud of Turin not showing the visage of our sweet Savior, Lord Jesus Christ, but showing a map of every time I had ejaculated or sprayed fluid since I'd own that mattress and to compound the horror of this terrible mattress, it started sinking in where I would lay for hours and hours in a feverish depressed state. That place became hollowed out like a dark valley and it was an embarrassment. I realized I'd been ripped off. Fortunately, somewhere a few years after buying this thing, I was contacted by Casper Mattress who said that they might be interested in advertising on my podcast. I told them I had to try one out before I could advertise it. They sent me a mattress. This box comes. You cut it open. This beautiful mattress explodes out of the box. I replaced my super expensive, sad, semen soaked dew mattress with this wonderful new Casper mattress and I sleep on it to this very day. If that's not a great endorsement for a product, I don't know what is. It's fantastic. It's firm. It's bouncy. It's way better than the super expensive thing that I bought. I would not lead you astray. If you're thinking about getting a new mattress or you're sleeping on a shitty mattress or you understand a law of physics that has been proven by every single branch of science, which is that good dreams, they go up to heaven. Bad dreams, they come out of your brain and they sink into your mattress like seeds in a field. The bad dreams will grow bad dream trees. If you're assuaged by bad dreams, if your marriage is a little wonky, if your kids seem dumb, if your complexion is too pallid, if your nipples are hanging, if your moves are enlarged, if you notice that when you stare at your nipples in the mirror that there appear to be tiny little eyeballs staring out. These are all signs that can point in the direction that you may need a new mattress. Casper.com is the answer for you, my friends. Go to Casper.com, use offer code Family Hour.

Thanks to all of you who continue to use our Amazon portal. I don't mean to be a fearmonger here, but I'm sure you've heard that gigantic trapdoor spiders have started burrowing underneath the floor of many local chain grocery stores and electronics depots, which means that the next time you go shopping, there is some 20 to 30% chance that the tile floor is going to open up faster than the human I can see in a scaled armored, hairy, arachnid thing could yank you underneath the store and slowly devour you over the course of several years. I wouldn't take that risk. And aside from that, if you really want the experience of shopping one of these chain stores, why don't you just fill a plastic bag up with your grandmother's farts and breathe into it as you shop on Amazon from the safety and comfort of your own home. Just go through the portal located at DuncanTrussell.com and they give us a percentage of anything that you buy. What have I recently ordered from Amazon? Well, I'll tell you a comic book on communism, which I actually pathetically have yet to finish. There's still 15 pages or so to go. So go to Amazon today, but go through our portal. And a huge thanks to all of you who have been donating. This is definitely not a necessary thing to do. And if you decide to do it, I am extremely grateful. Some folks out there have actually set up a monthly donation plan, which is incredibly sweet of you. If you don't feel like just throwing money in the direction of a podcast, we got an awesome shop with a lot of cool t-shirts, festival banners, mugs and stickers. I just want to read this email I got from somebody who wore one of our shirts to a music festival. Dear Duncan, I'll save you most of the details, but I just want to let you know that at the Down Under Deep Dish Music Festival in Lower Minnesota, I was approached by the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen in my life. Eyes as blue as eggs laid from the ass of a braxis, hands soft and wide, lips like jellyfish bladders. She took me to her tent and we made love for five hours until protoplasmic tendrils that I was not aware that my body could even produce began extending from every part of my body, wrapping around her until her and I fused into one glorious sinewy ball of ecstatic bliss. We came so many times that the sound of our orgasms overpowered the sounds of the DJs and the festival goers tore down our tents and devoured us and we are now part of their consciousness, minds and bodies forever. Yes, I'm emailing to you from the Astral Plane for I have fused with an entire music festival, all thanks to your reasonably priced, beautiful Ron Regi Enneagram shirts which are located at your shop. I sure hope people will go buy some today. Love Moon Willow. You got it Moon Willow, I know they're powerful shirts and I really appreciate the email. Go check out the shop guys, get one of these orgas, get one of these shirts, you never know what can happen. Also and finally, I'm going on a big tour of Australia, that's in November.

I'm also going to be at the Laughing Skull in Atlanta in October. Alright, that's it. Thanks for bearing with me. I love you guys.

Other links to reach him will be located at DunkinTrustle.com. Everybody please welcome to the DTFH Tate Fletcher. Tate Fletcher, welcome to the DunkinTrustle family on our podcast. Howdy Krishna, I'm so glad you're here. Me too. It's so exciting man. It's very exciting to me too because you like, you just did something I consider to be heroic which is you came through LA traffic to get here. It's a thing. It wasn't easy but when you get dedicated to a result, there are no obstacles. There's just little occurrences you're going to have to surmount in this life to get to the place where you need to go. Now, how often does that philosophy help you when you want to rip somebody's fucking head off in LA traffic? You know, I did just offer, it's very easy to say that. I did offer an invitation to two young gentlemen that were a Prius. They'd cut off a bunch of people and then they were on the side shoulder of the exit and trying to push in on everybody and then I backed off and let them in and then they're yelling to me, I was the guy that let them in. I tried to wave them in and they're like, what, what? I was like, come on, you guys should just follow me. I'm going to take you to a great party and they followed for a while and I just rolled the window down and smiled. They got up on both sides of the car and I was like, come on guys, really? And then they just kept driving straight when I got off. But that does happen. But I feel like if you're invited to a party, you've got to just accept whatever happens. Yeah, I think I know what you're saying. You're saying that you're going to murder those two gentlemen. You don't know what's going to happen when you get out of the car. But I want to avail myself to the experience. I'm an experiential guy and so it's just like what's going to happen when you get out of the car. I mean, I feel like I have a lot of party favors with which to offer my guests, however. You're a menacing guy. You're a very nice guy, but you're a really like, let's just break it down. You have fought, you're a fighter, you still fight. I haven't fought in a long time, but yeah, that was, we were mad, I was still competing. Right. You have been a competitive fighter. Since 2000, about? Yeah. And you now have transformed into an actor. Yeah, yeah. You are on Breaking Bad. Yeah. Yeah, really a fortunate list of things. And I keep seeing you in movies because I, whenever I'm watching, you're in good movies too. That's what I say is fortunate because I look at friends of mine that have good resumes and I'm like, God, I've never heard of that show that they were in or I've never heard of that one. And it's like, like I've got a bunch of Marvel movies and the Lone Ranger, like there's a bunch of really good stuff there, you know, the equalizer, John Wakin, things like that. And so I've been super fortunate. Yeah. And you're, you're a, it's really like incredible to think of the weird life you've had, man. You've had an odd life, haven't you? I was thinking about it many lifetimes, right? Many lifetimes, but like, where were you born? Michigan, Alpina, Michigan up on the shore, Lake Huron. And you kind of, didn't you kind of become a criminal a little bit? A criminal for like maybe from the gate, like for like, I mean, since I was like 11 or 12, since I first started exploring other people's homes when they weren't home. Exploring. Do you weren't planning on robbing them? You were just exploring? No, no, I was. I mean, we were looking for booze at that age, like we would go and steal booze from people's houses and then it just escalated as, you know, time grew on and opportunities came up and all that. How old, how old were you when you were doing that? A kid, man. Like, you know, tell us, maybe my last entry into a house unwanted was 17 or 18, I guess. Hold on. So yeah, how do you make that decision for the first time? I mean, it's exciting. You know, I just, I've always been attracted to exciting, kind of adrenaline-infused activities, no matter how scary they were. I like doing it. I think, I just read a book recently called The Rise of Superman, which is a fantastic book, but he talks about it and there's a bunch of stunt guys that did a jump, believe us, for one of the transforming movies. They jumped off the Sears Tower and there's like five guys and they jumped in unison. I don't know if you saw the movie, but they're in wingsuits. And so air, wind is really funny, especially in Chicago through buildings. Like if you're in a city, if you're in a canyon, you can count on it to be a certain way, but it shifts and changes drastically and quickly in buildings. And so they jumped off and they didn't know if they were going to die or not or what was going to happen. They had to follow so closely to each other that they had to have telekinesis, really, of knowing before, they couldn't, if they were going to make a 90 degree turn, by the time they saw your foot twitched to show that you were going to turn, it would be too late. They had to know four seconds before you were going to turn. So they have, and there's five guys doing this, they all have to forecast each other. And it's pretty phenomenal. But they, he said, you know, when, when people call us adrenaline junkies, that's not really what it is. Cause like for me as a fighter and like all that, and I heard Brendan Schaub talked about it and described it beautifully. Like most of those guys that are in the sport are like nervous, scared. They have a lot of emotions, ups and downs, and excited, everything before they fight. But you know, the thing is, is you're not after that adrenaline, you're after that flow state that happens that ensues afterwards. And you have to trigger it by doing something terrifying. And so you go into that thing and then norepinephrine comes in and adrenaline comes in and oxytosis comes in and, and you begin to mutate time and shorten it and you can distill it. And time slows down, you know, you get into a mutation and the book goes into all of it beautifully. And it really gave an explanation for things that I'd always felt that, that I was always drawn to and like why I was. And I thought, well, what a misnomer that adrenaline junkie kind of thing is in a way because nobody likes that. That's a kind of a terrifying experience. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. You're more into, yeah, you're a, you're a dopamine, you're trying to squeeze that sweetness out of the synaptic vesicles and the way you do it is by some kind of incredibly dangerous thing. But you're, so you're saying when you were breaking into houses, it was more for the, for that state afterwards. It was totally for that when I was a kid, ever since I was little, I was into that, like for forever. And so I love the, I love to throw snowballs at cars when I'm a little kid and have, and then people chase you like I love all that. Right. All the cops and robbers stuff. And I just, it just grew into my life. And then also, you know, I made a living that way for a while. I mean, you know, I mean, there's someone to open and. Did you ever get in trouble? Yeah, locked up a couple of times. My, my last significant thing was a big charge, but, um, you know, and, and then I got acquitted to that. And, um, and then that was the last time, you know, then, then I really, and that was when I was in my early 20s. And I really was like, I've got, my life's got to change. I've got to have a shift in my life. And so I did it. And that's when I started to get to it, to really kind of save my life in a lot of ways. And, um, wait, how, before you get to that, how long were you in jail? For that last charge, if this is okay to talk about, by the way, it's a long time ago. I waited, I don't know. Maybe that last time before, like I did two court sentences and I, um, was there maybe a month and a half or something before I was released. And then I got cleared and off paper, like six months later or something. There was a guy I was with and there's a bank that got robbed and all of that kind of thing. And so he had to cop to it and be tried and sent. There's a bank that got robbed. Yeah. By who? This guy that I was a buddy with. Okay. But you're all my friends, you know. Okay. I see. So you were like, you're living like the Grand Theft Auto life. Not quite like that, but it was, I mean, it had, it's colorful moments, you know. What would you, well, can you give me an example? What's one? What would be the, what color? It's just like, it's more desperate than that. I mean, it's more like, it's not like everybody's just a gorilla in the streets. I mean, it looks like that, but it's like, you're hidden. You know, I remember when I heard the first time I heard like a Dr. Dre album and I was like, they're freely talking about this. Like, you know, because like that's your life. And you're like, I know people that have fucking done horrific things to people and they're not writing a song about it. I'm like, these guys are all fake. Like this is an error or something. Like I didn't really get it, but like when you're selling dope, you're not singing songs about selling dope. You know what I mean? Right. And so, you know, the thing is, is just like, how am I getting through day to day? Like really, you know, we're all kind of, you know, there's a group of us and we're all like really into drugs and into booze and like in that lifestyle and Michigan's kind of a poor place in a lot of, I mean, it's like maybe the second or third poorest place in the world. I think my hometown was up to like 24% unemployment a couple of years ago. And then those people drop off unemployment and then they're just still unemployed. They just start, you can't tell them as a number anymore because they're now just poor. And so there wasn't a lot of choices. Like my family was a nice family. They did great. And but the whole surroundings is poverty, you know? And so you can go on the merchant marine boats, you can join the army, you can be a criminal. And that's kind of your choices in a way. Or you can go and try to work at a flower shop or this that. But there's not a whole lot, you know, the United Auto workers at that time were doing well for a little bit. But then even then they were cutting their punches to zero and like, and that's kind of, you're in that kind of a thing, you know, where like in the early when I was a little, little boy, like Flint was huge, like it blown up with General Motors. And then, and it was one of the biggest cities in Michigan. And it's like a ghost town, like there's when those jobs go away, you've just made a huge slum is what you've done. And so it's kind of like, you know, people are like, there's bad areas, you know, like in LA, you go, what's the bad area? It's like, you kind of get got anywhere here. Like it's, it's kind of like that. But like, there's places in Michigan where it's kind of like, these are vacuous holes that you just don't, there's no reason to be there. And so it's, you know, but that, you know, that's a crazy place to grow up man. Life's kind of what make of it too. You know what I mean? It's like where you want to go with it and what you need to escape. I'm interested in what is going through your mind on the fifth day of a month long prison sentence. Oh man, I'm with five Mexican dudes in the fucking cell, and they're not speaking any English. And it's, it's scary, you know, I'm a young guy and in the US Marshall's office and, you know, while we're in holding, like everybody just got picked up. And there's a bunch of guys with recidivism that are just, you know, that their parole officers have just put them back and, and guys talking about the whole thing, you know, we're fucking rape you later tonight. So that's real. All of that. That's real. The dude that one of the guys that was sent that said that to me, this old shitty white trash biker, and he goes, he got, the way he violated his parole is his parole, he didn't check in, like how hard is that? You just go check in. Right. And he didn't go check in and he's out at this farmhouse and he's got a guy that I don't know if he thought snitched on him or what happened, who's hanging in his barn, who he's skinning, who's alive. He's in the process of taking it. Like, and I don't know if that's real or not. That's what they're saying. Like, yeah, that's how he violated. So there's these kinds of people that I'm with. Then there's the guys that in Colorado, this is up in Colorado. They call it Compton Springs and they just got these nine dudes, they just got a shootout with the ATF and shot a couple guys in the face and like there's all and they're happy as fuck. They were stoked. It's like they'd made it. They're in federal prison. And really? Yeah, it was crazy. Why? Why? Because federal prison's better somehow, I understand. No, I mean, just because they'd gotten a big thing. It's like there's a sense but some guys like that they're made if they get into a spot like that, right? That's nuts. I mean, and you know, it's the same thing you see. I see guys like that get out after they've done five or six years and they come back to a neighborhood. It's like, if you go, you know what, Abbot Kinney or something like that was like 10 years ago, 15 years ago, right? It's like, you're not like, you don't want your lady to walk around there after dark or whatever. It's not, it's not safe. And now it's like mini skirts and high heels at 10 at night and it's no big deal. And so imagine you go and you're just, you're a gangbanger and you go away for that time and come back. It's like, I totally understand the idea about you would be a chronic recidivist because you're in a way not welcome back into your community where there used to be something, everything's changed. You're not shit. Fuck off. And you are somebody in prison and a lot of those guys find that there. I think they find a status or a caste system that they can understand. But man, there you are. So there I am. And you're an intelligent guy. When I'm going to leave, I don't know any of that stuff. And we got, I've been called for court before we got called on the day that I got released. But I'm just trying to think like, how are you rationalizing your life? You're not, you're not thinking that you're in a, I mean, for me, and then there's a riot. There's a riot right when I got there. And so everybody's fucked up. Like it is crazy. And so I've never been in any situation like that before. And I didn't know really how to take it. So you just kind of stay close to people that are nice to you. You're even more careful around them. And, you know, keep your back to the wall. And, and it's really, you know, blacks are hanging out with the blacks and the whites are hanging out with the whites. And there's this guy Walker Knight, he was, he befriended me as this big, tall black dude. And he was super dope, man. And, and, and he's like, Hey, dude, this is the guy that you need to hook up with when you get inside. Like, because when we were all picked up by the FBI, and then we're in the US Marsh Office for a couple of days, and we get put in England. And, and, you know, he kind of made introduction to make it like an easier way. I got, and I don't know how that all would have played out had I been there a long time. Like, I don't know a lot about it. It's not like I spent months and years there, but it's crazy. It's a different world, man. It's a different world. And your moment to moment, everybody says that, oh, how can they go, how'd you survive this in your life? How'd you survive that in your life? And it's like, you don't think that way. All you think is like, I've got one foot in front of the other, and I'm just aware. And I'm, you get hyper aware, right? You get hyper aware, and you're just moving through time and space, you don't reflect on it and be like, how am I going to get through this? It's just like, it is happening so rapidly. Right. Then you better be in it. And it became like that was the first time that I did a stick fight that really dawned on me and kind of coalesced and distilled into that of like, you need to be hyper present in your life all the time. And this was like a couple years later that I had that opportunity. But I'm like, when a stick is swinging by your head, you're either awake and aware and conscious all the time, or you're unconscious because you've gotten clumped, you know, and that becomes the thing is like, you start to become hyper present. And that was the first time like, I felt like this is a flow I can control. Before I was like, I'm just going to go do some crazy shit. But like that, I was like, I can put myself in these situations. And so then ever since then, pardon me, I really looked at how do I put myself in scary situations that are in some way that aren't illegal or that are like in a, you know, controlled kind of environment. But even like a scary situation for me could be like to get up and do stand up, right? How are you going to learn your language? Are you going to like throw yourself into the unknown and doing that thing? And so, you know, making myself uncomfortable. And what I didn't understand at that time, and what I understand it to be today is that I'm addressing my ego in a way and kind of, you know, curtailing that omniscient kind of feeling that is really unrealistic and kind of grandiose and going, I'm a part of this whole thing, this whole cellular thing that I don't really understand. And I'm just going to try to play my part. And then you go, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to help as many people as I can. Or I'm going to, you know, like, well, that's where I'm interested. I'm interested in when did that, wait, were you always like that? Did you always have a spiritual side? I was pretty empathetic. And I was always looking for a spiritual thing. Like I'd studied since I was little, like I was lost in books since I was a kid, right mythology. I would read a lot. Then I read a lot of the early American authors and really got in like to Emerson and Thoreau and all that kind of thing, you know, John Locke and and like when I was young, when I was 10, 11, 12, like my mind was just I needed to be elsewhere. And so those were things then like, like ethics and shit, like, and then I started the first fiction I read was like Louis Lamour books, like, oh, yeah, Western, you know, and I was like, I was like, well, those are guys you could look up to those are guys that like, they stand for something. And like, all that kind of stuff started to really matter to me. And then when I started hanging out with these guys, these are the guys I'm loyal to and that like, you know, and then I demanded standards, like, which is interesting, and then tell you just said that, I didn't think that but like, I demanded standards in my life standards of my friends behavior, you know, like we're friends because you're not a lot of things and because you are for a lot of things, you know, it's like, I look at that too, like, you know, with like, the original guys really that were around like you and me and Ari and Joey, and Joe and when you look at that, like, we're more advanced in life, we're further down the road, like we're not in our 20s, you know, and, but all of those guys are all fantastic people that have all been found the modicum of happiness and success and are still on a track that's going higher and higher and evolving all the time. And it's like, it's really something about like having that figured out, I think, I think that you get into a position where things are clicking and you're like, Oh, this is the way like, it's like Eddie Bravo would talk to me about it. And he'd be like, you know, you want to get yourself on the same vibration as the universe. Right. And that's through appreciation. And so like all these things and like a lot of these spiritual practices kind of coalesced, I guess, in my mid 30s. And I go, I go, this is, this is how you want to start moving. And then you want to start moving in a way that's going to give the greatest good to the most people. And I used to hide with like a, like a false humility in a way or something like that where it's like, where I didn't deserve it, or I didn't want it, or I just look at my shoes and be like, I'm grateful for this. And I'm not a fucking, I'm not in prison. I'm not dead. I'm not a junkie. I'm not like, or whatever. And, but even at that, I tell the story sometimes. And it's crazy. Like I've been sober for a long time now, like since that time really. And it's, I don't drink, I don't do any drugs. And, and I was sitting and I was thinking about I was at this retreat and I was with all these people and a retreat. No, just like a thing, you know, and I was like, um, I was like, I'm just as capable as anybody, you know, and a friend of mine right before that conversation had said, I, uh, he goes, you know, feelings are facts. A lot of people are saying, you know, your feelings are facts and all that kind of stuff. And he says, my feelings are facts. It's valuable. It's who I am. And it's how I see the world and how I perceive it and whatever. And I was thinking about that. And then this guy started speaking and listening to that. And I was like, I'm just as capable as anybody here. And, um, and this was just a few years ago. And I thought, that's weird. Like I've never had that thought before. I've never felt that way before. Not ever. Yeah. Right. And so then I started thinking about it. And I go, you know, I was figured like the way I, my narrative for myself was if there's a race, I'm going to be last. Yes. You know, and then I learned when there's an actual race, I was like, like maybe sixth grade or something. And you're like, you're going to run a mile in gym class or whatever it is. And I was like, I learned I was tough. I was like, I'll finish and I won't be killed. Like, and then, and then at that time I started, you know, uh, defending myself in the playgrounds on the streets at party. Like, and so I started, I was like, I might get beat down, but I'm tough. At least I'm not going to quit. Right. This is when you were a kid. When I was a little kid. Yes. And, um, and, and then, you know, I look at it and I'm like, I kind of always felt that way. And then I started looking at it and I go, okay, and I do a lot of writing and journaling and kind of reflecting on my life and looking at, uh, you know, here's taking stock in your life and what it is. And I do that like every year. And I started thinking about the last time I've done it. I go, you know, even when you're in that position where, you know, before all the madness happened, you're still a leader. Like people are still looking up to you. You're, you know, articulate. You, you're thoughtful. You read a lot. You've got a lot of information that other people don't have. Like I was advanced in a lot of different ways. And, uh, I was like, that's interesting. And then I go, and then after all that, it's like, I, I get hired at a place and then I'm running a whole crew of guys and then I'm running a couple of different clubs and then like, I'm like escalated quickly and I joined Jiu-Jitsu and I'm the best guy in the room. And then I'm one of the best guys. So you're saying, you're saying all this is somehow tied into all this is a thought, right? That I'm having at this moment. And I'm thinking all this stuff and I'm going through my life and I'm thinking about that. And I'm like, and then, you know, you're an ultimate fighter and you're fighting the UFC or like I was undefeated fighter for a bunch of fights. And then, um, and then I'm acting, I'm in films and then I fucking own a bunch of nightclubs and then I'm like running a coffee company and then I got like, and all this shit. And I'm like, and, but I'm the guy that's not going to finish the race and is my narrative, right? And I went back to my friend and I go, humans aren't facts. And I go, that's what the fuck they mean, right? The way I feel about myself and I'm proceeding myself is delusional. Yeah. And then at that time, it was like, I was like able to go, okay, it's important to have a realistic view of who this is inside. Because here you are, a person who is at all this great success from what you just described, not only that, but you also have the great redemption story, which is that you pulled yourself out of a trajectory that could have led to complete obliteration. So you have that going to, which is a very mythological, very archetype, you know, it's really cool. So you have that thing going and yet still, no matter what the universe is showing you, which is like, look, I've given you this and this and this and this, you've accomplished all this, you're still thinking to yourself, kind of a piece of shit. Right. That to me is such an interesting aspect of humans. From doing this podcast, I've really noticed that that's like an omnipresent thing where, and just from meeting people out here and I'll let you run into people out here who have the most ridiculous success, or they're the most incredibly beautiful, or they're the most whatever it is. And yet still, they cannot accept the fact that they deserve it. Right. They just think it was an accident. They think it was a fluke that it's going to go away. Any good thing that comes is going to go away that the other shoes about to drop. Dude, that's how I live my life, Duncan. I was like, things were good right now, but and any more, man, I go think and then when I tell everybody, anybody that comes to me for counsel or anything, I'm like, you've been okay, you've been carried your whole life. You've always been fed. You always had a place to live. People have always loved you, even if you didn't deserve it, whatever. What is to make you think if you've had 30 years of success like that, that tomorrow's going to be any different. It's only going to get better. You know, and the more goodness that you put out, the more goodness come and all that stuff. And so any more I look at and go, yeah, my life's pretty good right now, my bank account's pretty good right now, all that. And I'm like, there is not one thing to make me think that this won't be fucking twice as good next year. There you go. And that's so dope to get into that kind of decision. That's a new thing for me, bro. That's a new that's a big decision. And it's it's interesting. I mean, I know you've never come in from a mini Cooper up to a Mercedes. I mean, come on. Yeah, I know. And I mean, I have not quite, I can do the pull up that you're talking about from time to time. But I'm more often than not, it's hard for me to do that. Like I have to consistently tell myself, this is okay, you can be successful, you don't have to be someone who's not successful. But it's not like, it's hard to accept. And it's, it's, to me, that's been one of the one of the great teachings in my life is like, well, look at this, no matter how much love comes to me, and whatever form that it comes, my tendency is a negative and negative. Yeah. And that that that's a wild interesting. And I don't know if that's for human, because I know some guys, like, I don't think Joe is like that. Right. I don't think he has that like that. I know people that think I'm fucking crazy. Like, I tell them that story, and they're like, you, like, it doesn't even make sense that that is something that is inside me. It's a universal ghost that wants everybody. And to the point where I'm suspicious, sometimes when I see someone who's like, acting incredibly confident, sometimes I wonder to myself, is this just a, are you just putting on a show? But here's, you know, the whole thing, like feelings are not fact. Right. If you really do an analysis of what you are, if I look into myself, right? And quite often what I come up with is that there are feelings that are in a field of awareness. And the where field of awareness is a thing outside of definition, which means that the feelings come after this initial be I'm aware of my feelings. This is what they call the watcher, the observer, the ottman. Yeah, that seems to be what we really are is this thing that in the Bhagavad Gita, when it's, they call it the soul, a lot of people call it the soul, but in the Bhagavad Gita, when they're describing it, they say it was never born, has never died, it does not come into being, it does not cease to be, it cannot be burnt by fire, withered by the wind. Is this like they say sometimes the unknowable and unnameable? That's yeah, right. The Dallas would speak of it's like you can't look at yourself without it, you know, without a mirror, you can't turn around and look at yourself. This is the observer, the observer self. And that thing really doesn't care about how definitions or it doesn't really care. Everything precedes this initial state, right? So to me, what it, what that means is, and this is something that I kind of gets echoed by Jean-Paul Sartre when he talks about, you should definitely check out if you haven't already, but he talks about if we take a paper cutter, right? The paper cutter is just a fucking paper cutter. It doesn't have to decide what it's going to be. The paper cutter didn't have to go to college, it doesn't have to define itself, it doesn't have to listen to certain kinds of music and wear cool clothes and it doesn't have to do it. It's just a paper cutter, a human. We have to tell ourselves what we are. We have to decide, this is what I am. I am whatever it is you want to be and that's why it's called a human being, because we're, we're the being, we're in the process of being a thing and we're always outputting. We always have to put out this thing that we are and Sartre said, that's hell. That's hell. We're all in hell. He was a dark motherfucker, but he's like, we're all in hell. There's no way out of it. Your ultimate emptiness, you can only make up what you are from moment to moment, but you know the whole thing is a big charade. That's Sartre. But then if you read Camus, Camus' response to that kind of dark existentialism was, yeah, except, yeah, and that thing, exactly, that's it. And the fact that I am the one who makes the ultimate decision to smile in the face of oblivion, that makes me more powerful than the gods. And so that moment of decision making that you're talking about I'm really interested in that when you realize you're not going to get an emotional backup for when you decide that you're okay. You're, you're not going to get your emotions aren't right away going to be like, oh yeah, you are a great person. You're nothing. You gotta train yourself. It's discipline. So everything comes to discipline and awareness, I believe. Right? Yes. What we're talking about with that, like it takes so long to, it does, it, you know, everybody thinks they're enlightened or that they have a higher consciousness. And it's like, what I'm seeing more and more is it's like there's, there's slivers of awareness. And if you're unaware, you're unaware that there's even more things to be aware of. Right. You just, you're, you know, and so and if you can't reflect and go, here's where I was unaware, here's where I just became aware of, like, because your confidence is so messed up that you have to just put on errors, as you say, you know, it's like, then you're never aware. Also, you're just pretending to be aware all the time. And those are the people that I go, oh, it's hard to be around that person. Yeah. And that's why I, like, I'm so excited about going, I can control my universe by, you know, all the people that I get to be around. And I get to choose that. You get to choose, and you, before you choose the people you get to be around, you can just make this decision. Sure. Which is, I'm cool. You can just decide. It's a, it's a really, it's a scary thing when you realize. And that's the thing people don't like. Yes. Because there's an accountability and a responsibility to say, I am a plumber. You know, they're like, instead, they're like, I don't know if I'm good enough to be a plumber. Can I pass the plumbing test? Like, or, you know, or something creative. I'm a writer. Like, now you got to shake your own tree. I mean, as a fighter, I'm a fighter. You got to shake your own tree, get your own sponsorships, find your own fight. Like, that's a lot to do. Like, you're not getting a paycheck at the end of the week from that job, you know, as an actor. I'm already on my last job every time I work. It's like, I'm already looking for my next job because I'm about to be unemployed. And so like, you know, but I've been in that position. I get comfortable with that because I've been shaking my own tree for a long time. And so it's kind of like, I can live in that space. I don't need to have that check at the end of the week to have comfort and go, oh, my phone bill will get paid. But don't, don't you think like all, but all the, all the, it seems like there's a direct core, I mean, this is where you get the cliche secret bullshit, but it is kind of true, which is that I have the moment you decide manifestation, when you decide you're okay. Like you just make, you realize, like here's the, like, you know, the third, you know about Buddhism, the temptations of Buddha. So you know, the third temptation when the Buddha was about to get enlightenment, you know what that is? So Mara, I'm sorry guys, I talk about this too much, but Mara, the Lord of death appears to the Buddha. He's already tempted him twice. The first temptation is by throwing fireballs at him or just all these terrible things. And the Buddha laughs and the fireballs turn into flower petals, but that's supposed to represent overcoming the fear of your own annihilation or death or whatever. And then the second temptation he, Mara, sends to the Buddha his daughters and a lot of people, this can be, any of this can be interpreted in any way you want, but his daughters, some people say that represents worldliness or living in the world of pleasure. That's what I used to think. And there's a, other people say, no, actually the daughters of Mara are letting go of your attachment to when you start waking up to getting prideful over it, to like getting like puffed up and like, oh, I'm such a holy man or something. There's a lot of things, but the third one, man, that's my favorite one, which is that finally Mara, the Lord of, it's really not the Lord of death, it just represents the king of the world, represents the world. But Mara says to the Buddha, this is the third one. And theoretically these are in, in order of difficulty, you know, this is his last ditch attempt to keep the Buddha from getting enlightened. The third one was a question, why do you deserve to be the Buddha? And the answer was that the Buddha took his finger and touched it to the earth and then enlightenment. And that's always been a mysterious moment for me because I think, what does that mean? And I've asked different people, everyone's got their own interpretation. But to me, it's that realization that you have to make the fucking decision. You just decide, you just decide now, regardless of your success, regardless if you have a ton of success or none at all, you just make the crazy decision at the second. I deserve love. I'm a good person. I'm okay. I'm okay. You have to make the decision yourself. That goes into all the things like, I mean, this sounds like super ethereal talk that we're having, but it's like, that is like meat and potatoes stuff of like, like, okay, so your boyfriend doesn't treat you very well. He gets drunk and sometimes he calls you a bitch or he stays out too late. It's not his problem. That's not his fault. That's how he is showing up. What is it about you that would stay around for that? Why is it that you think that that's what you deserve? And so like, these things to me, those these kinds of lessons are fascinating to me because they come up in life everywhere. Like, when you ask yourself that, but people don't want the decision, I didn't want the decision, rather, of being accountable to my decisions. So it's easier for you to tell me, Hey, where do you want to have lunch? Right? Because I don't want to say what I want. You know what I mean? I don't want to be a people pleaser in that way. And so like, we all live this fucking crazy nebulous of of going, well, I wonder what he thinks that I should be like, and then I'm going to try to be like, and it's like, it's the craziness. It's crazy. I was reading the thing about computers. And there's a, I can't remember, it's a clever bot or something about these bots, right? And mimics human. Yes. And so you're talking to them. And yeah, there's a great thing on radio lab. And, and you can ask them any questions, they put them online, and then people could ask questions. And the idea was, if you would write in hello to the computer, then it would know the one word hello. And then how are you today? Then it would know a succession of sentences based upon your interaction with it, then they put it online, and everybody started asking. So then pretty soon, it has four billion things that it knows or whatever. So you could actually write in questions and go, Hey, um, why am I sad? And they're being answered. So they're doing this online and they're going, so why am I sad clever bot? And the answer comes back because, and that's based on like, a conversation that it had with another person, like, so you're talking to ghosts. So yeah, and, and it's then there must be more. Why am I sad? Because you stay in the same place for too long is the answer. And I thought, what a brilliant answer. But that's just the answer that one guy had. But it's like, you get into these things where you're like, brilliant, where you talk about the humanism of machines and like, where we go into that. And like, what, I mean, it begs a lot of, because you stay in the same place too long. And it doesn't have to be a geographic place either. It's just, well, that's you, you end up in this made me question my whole life. I'm like, every decision like, Oh my God, it's a, it's this is the, and what am I hanging on to? Like, it goes back to where you're talking about my attachments. Well, right. Yeah. And when you start realizing that, I think it's beautiful that it's built into the universe that you can be imprisoned in a certain thought structure or ego pattern or paradigm and live your whole life beaten down, cowled by the world, trying to please everybody. And at any moment that you want to, you can instantaneously free yourself from 80% of what's obstructing you, which is just the way you look at yourself. It's always there for you. It's so cool. It's like a prison, like imagine a prison where ever with no roof, with no ceiling, no prison with no ceiling, very high walls, no ceiling, but all the prisoners had the ability to levitate if they wanted to. They just had to do it, you know, and every once in a while you'd see a prisoner go shooting up through the fucking ceiling. And most prisoners be like, one in a million chance. Nobody can do that. He works so fucking you know, but we can all do it. Except this isn't this, you know, that's one of the things about being an actor for me is that everybody says that when I'm a little kid for forever or being a fighter can't be in the UFC. Right. Can't do that. Right. Yeah. So I start thinking about all that shit and I go, you know, it is, I mean, numbers wise, nobody's wrong when they say it's one in a million or whatever the fucking number, these statistic fucking people put out like, fuck a statistic, because my name is Tate Fletcher. You know what I mean? And it's like, and I won't quit. That's what I know about me. And so you know, who, you know, who, you know, who are those 900 and 99, you know, like all the people right up to the one in a million, those are all people that gave up. They don't give up. It'll occur. But something even better will occur, even if that doesn't occur, you're on the road, you get, then that's the thing is you have to choose a desert. It's like in like the Prophet or any, any kind of book, like when you read the alchemist, it's like, he has to choose it. It's not about getting to the pyramids. Yeah. It's his like, things take him and distract him along the way. They're even better to grow his soul as a human. But what is that cheesy quote in the very beginning of Gladiator? I'm sorry, you guys, but I always think about it where they're riding into battle and he says, if we die today, we will drink in Valhalla It wasn't Valhalla, it was somewhere, whatever, but it was, it's the warrior's thought, warrior's creed, creed, which is, which is like, there is no reward on earth that can equal the glory of dying, fighting for your life. That's the glory, right? And there's no for your, not even your life, for your flag, for an idea of what this flag is and what it represents of your family and your kids and your hopes and your grandfathers and everything, right? Or I mean, when I say your life, I mean, I mean, fighting to peel back the entropy that has kept you trapped in your, the thing that's keeping you alive. Really? I hear people talk about, I fight for a living, like we're doing this for a living, we just watched the fights yesterday on, on television and, and that guy was like, Hey man, this is our job, you know, and so thanks for supporting the sort of saying to the fans, but I'm like, it's, it's not man. Like, I mean, it is, but it's not like it, to me, that's like a muted idea of what it is. You're fighting to release all those things and go, who am I now under these strictest, harshest conditions that I can come up with in America. Um, what, I mean, that's a huge statement since I'm just gonna say, well, dude, you know, there's home or whatever, but like, you're putting yourself in a really highly advanced, you mean, to be in a physical fight, to fight in the EOC, to fight in, you're crushing yourself. So when you do that, you're, you're, I mean, you're in an elongated state of discomfort for months and years to be able to train yourself, to be able to do that thing. And, and there's an uncovering and a discovering of yourself within that. But if you lose the fight, you still won, right? You have been given the, the great teachings of being, and I sat there and had my friends fight. He was one of my best friends, Isaac Valley flag, and he was getting beat down by this guy. And it was before Isaac got in the EOC. And I was like, this is fucking bad. He got, he got caught bad, knocked out. The guy mounted him, he's beating him. Isaac keeps moving enough to defend himself, gives him his back. Like it was all bad. It got clipped again. And then by the second round, he was, I think maybe he made it to the second or third round, but I'm like, and I was reflecting on the way home, his long draft home. And I was like, that was a fucking bad deal. And, but then I had flashes of the guy's corner on the other side. And I was like, they're happy. There's nothing. I'm like, it's not a bad fight or a good fight. There's just a fight. Right. And, and depending where I'm sitting, my perspective is what makes it good or bad. I'm like, there's no good or bad. This is just a fight and experience. And what a fucking, a bunch of gratitude that you can have that you're able to be a part of that thing. And, and like what you're saying, you know, I had lunch with this chick earlier today and that came up, you know, she's like, well, the world is empty and meaningless. You know, and I go, absolutely. And I said, how the fuck, and like what you were saying earlier, what a great opportunity. Because that means everybody would always say, you live in a fantasy land, man, you need to fucking just buckle down, get a job, dude, whatever, whatever their status quo is, who all, all of those fuckers email me and send me shit on, on Facebook to the point where I got to block them because there's too dumb. How did you do this, man? I got two kids, I went to church, I got the job, I went to college, I fucking hate myself and my, this is horrible. And I'm like, you listened to all the shit that didn't make sense from people that were failing at the very same construct they were giving you to live. I mean, you know what I mean? And it's like, that's what happens generally. But like, she says, so it's, it's meaningless or whatever, whatever. I'm like, what an awesome opportunity to give it whatever meaning you want. Yeah, I live in a fantasy. Come check it out. You know what I mean? Make it whatever you want it to be, because that's what it can be. And that's the beautiful part about it. I mean, there's no way that it makes sense, dude. Like, I was supposed to go and go to college and do a great thing. I became a drug addict with bad alcohol problem and, and the whole thing and a bunch of run ins here and there. But it's like when you had cancer, and you're like, you know, you're a cancer survivor, Duncan, congratulations. You're a great, you're a cancer survivor. Fuck yourself. Like that, that discredits everything else that I am, that I really am. This is just the thing that happened. And that's kind of how I view that stuff. It's like, there's a lot to surmount and all that kind of stuff. But that's not me. That's nothing about me. It's a stranger to me. And it's a stranger to anybody that knows me. It's almost like that's like really like that's crazy. So I've lived that life. I've lived the life of recovery. I've lived the life as a professional athlete, lived the life as an athlete, all those things. And the thing is, is like, I'll just try. Like that's my whole mantra is I need you to try. Like I want everybody to try. I want everybody to win. Because I think all that is possible. And I don't think there's any separation or or dissimilarity between us, you know, like the skin of me or a dude making a pot in India is no different than even the pot. It's like we're all made up of the same carbon and the same kind of energies that warm us and cool us and propel us through this life. And and so like whatever this, I think that's maybe what the Catholics or a Christian would think of as the Holy Spirit is like the thread that we absorb our souls together. And is this this unified kind of God shield that is all of us that we all come from and go back into this this pool of souls that is of is is is the one. Well, this is in that thing that you're talking about. I was just listening to a lecture by the founder of the Hare Krishna is talking about this very thing. He's got those fucking people at the airport. Am I right though? I like it when I like running into listen, I tell you, I'd rather run their book. I'd rather the which one I don't know the one that goes and it culminates with yeah, you eat me because that's a grotesque part of getting energy. And then you become a vegetarian because you're more enlightened. And then when you get to the highest point of spirit, you can absorb all your nourishment through the air. That's not the Hare Krishna. No, I don't think that's the Hare Krishna. So they do definitely have some serious flaws because there is the what they're based on is a type of yoga called bhakti yoga. And so is that a thing that stimulates DMT in their brain? Is that a thing like there's like a lot of yoga poses that they would talk about if you get good at this and you're practicing this for years and years and years that these will cause psychedelic states? Well, it's I think it's even more powerful than that in the sense that it's what you just said, which is we're all part of this one pool of existence. All energies are all connected and make up this one super entity composed of all things. The step that they take is they say that entity that that some total of all things, which is called I almost pronounce of it, it's called a sinka sinka betta tatva simultaneous simultaneous oneness and difference. So that thing that some total of all things is God and bhakti yoga is the practice of falling in love with everything. So you now recognize, isn't that cool? You but that's not owned by the Hare Krishna. See that's a very old right. But they you know, the but the Hare Krishna's or Prabhupada, the guy who brought it here was very, very good at talking about what that what the implications of all that is. And so it's the idea that all this stuff out here, all this out here, every single thing around you is just God energy. And I think the name is called maybe prakriti as the name they have, you know, Hindu isms rat, they have a lot of cool terms for it. So all this God energy. And so the dimension that we're in right now is marked by ignorance. That's a quality. That's the quality. That makes sense. That's the quality of this dimension, because we have all forgotten. Most people have forgotten without knowing. We are without knowing. We're ignorant of the fact that we're surrounded by God. Except for the arrogant ones. They're like, I don't know how I got this ball in. I know. Yeah, right. How can you possibly know? Like, and why is it so hard to go? This is the greatest mystery ever. And I'm a part of it. Wild. I hope when I die, that's where I always hope she says, little boy, I was chasing death since I was a little kid, little boy, little seven, eight. And I was like, I can't wait to die. Because I was just sure that when I died, I'd be fucking omniscient. Like, I would there would be a snap of the fingers, and I would be flooded with knowledge of all my questions answered, all the huge realization and oneness. Like, I knew that as a little boy. And it's crazy, like little kids, you mess with little kids, man. And if you could get them comfortable in talking, they're amazing, though, creatures. Yes. There's a great, I used to always put kitchen soup for the soul by my toilet. Yeah. And I know it's funny. And I would read it. And there's one story in there. And it was this guy, they had a baby and they are getting ready to take the baby home to the hospital. And they had a daughter that was like, five or six or whatever. It was like, let me be with the baby. We're in the hospital, I want to get home, let me be with the baby. And they're like, there's the jealousy thing, or like, they didn't know really what's going on. They get home, they set up the crib, and they put the baby in the baby room with the crib. And she's like, Hey, can I, I need to see the baby. Can I see the baby? Yeah, be quiet, don't wake her up and go in and see the baby. And they're kind of peeking through the crack in the door, and watching, and the little girl goes up and she says, Hey, she says, tell me what God looks like, because I'm starting to forget. And it's like, and that's like a crazy fucking idea. And a crazy idea. Like, I know, like, I have a memory that predates my birth, right? Like I have a, and I don't know if that's a, some machination of my, of my own, you know, illustration of my greatness or whatever. It's kind of weird, arrogance that like, I predate, like, I have a memory and a vision of this time when I'm floating in blackness and space, and that, that I existed. And I thought it was strange that I'm coming down to these people to be in their home, you know, like kind of thing, like really odd. And, and then I talked, the more I say that, like I talked to other people that have similar experiences sometimes, you know, it's only odd from the POV of this culture, from the POV of a large percentage of humans on the planet. That's just, yeah, that's normal. Yeah. I mean, you're going to get like, the Dawkins school and the, uh, Richard Dawkins. That's a great idea for a new cover band like Richard Dawkins. It's like people got this replace Dawkins lyrics with Richard Dawkins. Richard Dawkins. I think we need people like that. For what purpose? Well, I think that he helps me because people like him and Hitchens, who say things like, and I'll misquote it, but when they say things like, uh, something like lack of evidence, there's a great atheist quote. The guy that wrote the God delusion, right? Yeah. And then, and then we like, so, so I used to get really, Hitchens was beautiful. I get annoyed with atheists sometimes and skeptics, but then if I stop being annoyed and, and really take what they're saying and try to apply it to my life, I get annoyed on semantics though of it, of like, you're not really, if you're an atheist, I mean, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're more learned on this than I am for sure. But like, if you're an atheist, you're, the same coin is a believer. The very same, you're just the other, you're the taker. Well, no, I think they would say absolutely not. I would say that because a believer is saying, I know Jesus Christ is the way and the light or whatever and no way to have an accept through him type thing, right? And the atheists would say, I know there's no God and they just turned dirt and you're back into dust. I don't, I don't think all of them say there's no God. They just say, let's keep things where we can prove it with evidence. So that's a lot of agnostic then. That's without knowledge of what that would be, right? And that's kind of where I feel like I'm at. If those are the correct definitions, I don't know. I'm open to whatever, but like, there's no way that we humans know. Well, I mean, I, the way I look at it is, okay, fine. On one level, no God, all atoms, that's it. Right. Fine. Got it. Believe it. I know it's true. And thank God, people like you are analyzing the universe at this level only without getting obstructed by some kind of philosophical metaphysical bullshit. Because thanks to you, there's radiation therapy that cured my cancer that, you know, there's like, there's great, great. I didn't know the doctrines made radiation. Well, no, but, but the scientific But that's the other fallacy, though, isn't it? The, the, well, there's either science or there's God. Well, that's bullshit. That's what people that have an agenda do. And they separate those two things. And I think they're the same thing. There's a bunch of different, again, it's, there's no one way of looking at it. A lot of people like Crowley, who I love, who's like one of the Alistair. Yeah, he's a great occultist. His, one of his great sayings was our method is science, our aim is religion. So his approach to it was we will use this, we'll use empiricism, we will, we will use only only, we will only use what can be proven, we will use, we will be very strict in our data gathering. And the results of our experiments, we will be very strict in noting what happens and not up, not pretend something happened that didn't, because that's how we'll get to the truth. So it's, there's a lot of different ways of looking at it. But the way I see it is this. When I, I cannot deny the fact that when I pray, especially gratitude related prayers, if I just start saying thank you to some kind of super intelligence in the universe, and I start doing that regularly, I get happier, synchronicities happen more. The most powerful prayer in the world is thank you. Amazing things happen. And I can't deny that evidence. Even if I was to write down, but then you can easily argue that also and say, well, yeah, you're controlling your brain and the patterns in your mind and the sentences into the neurons to go ahead, but I don't care. I don't care. I just want results. So to me, it's like, if, if you want to get caught up in whether or not by saying these words, yeah, go ahead. Like I put a thing out and it was like reasons people rape people and three check marks, right? Like short dressed or whatever, you know, the skippy clothing, flirtation, because I'm a rapist and like the third box is the only box. Like it's, like it's, and then, and I put that because I saw it, I thought it was funny and I was like, how, you know, like what a cogent idea. Like, of course, like it's only a rape. Like it's, that's what it is. It's a sickness in that kind of a way. And it's not any of these other things and anybody else that tries to do any kind of a signaling on a victim is a scumbag and whatever. And then there's all these conversations about it underneath that I never even look at, right? Because I'm like, bitch, I'm not here to argue on the god damn internet. You don't believe how much shit I got going on in my life. I'm sorry that you have all that. I've got this one guy. You must make a t-shirt. You got to make a t-shirt that says, bitch, I'm not here to argue on the internet. I got shit to do. I would wear on the back. I would wear that all the time. So good. Um, yeah, I'm not here to argue on the internet either. And I'm not here to like, so like, I'm really in agreement with that. Like, I'm just here for the function and performance of it. If it's this, if it's that, like, whatever. Yeah, I don't think Jesus, I'm with it. Cool. Yeah. And this is, I think it's a, all atheists must perform the experiment. Uh, if they want to approach this stuff, they must perform the experiment of spending a nice month or a year, do all the actions. However long they think it takes to like, perform an experiment, spend some time. Because without that, there's no, there's no, there's no real like thoughtful looking at the other side of it to go, okay, no, I know all about this. To think that you know all that, like contempt that there's a great quote contempt prior to invent, there's a, there's a principle, which is a bar against any information. Um, and, and against that will win any argument. And that is contempt prior to investigation or leave a man and everlasting ignorance, right? Wow. And that's huge, right? But how often we all get that? And until we really dive into it then, it's like, you don't know anything. You've got some ideas about Christianity or you've got some ideas about being Harry, but unless you live that shit and really go, okay, I'm going to listen to all the greatest thinkers in this thing. And then I'm going to do all the actions that they do on a daily basis with the discipline. You might not really know what the fuck you're talking about. You can't write. That's the thing. And it's an intentional, I believe you're intentionally cutting yourself off from that level of things, because you don't want to deal with it right now. Maybe you're not here to deal with that shit right now. Maybe you're just here to deal with other stuff that like atoms or mitosis or the splitting atoms or all the wonderful things that are making the world so incredible. Maybe that's where you're focused. Those new silicone breasts that come out that are so soft, they're like real. I thought they already had those. So good they have them. Well, there you go. That's all thanks to people who are godless. No, it is evil sinners. No, I'm completely and fully into the church of heresy. I mean, like all that, like any, you just got to question all these things, man. And then be nice and kind. The thing that I have a problem with like some of those guys is they get, it's like Nietzsche is like, he's such a negative Nelly, you know what I mean? It's like, you get into these things where it's just like, you're just sad. And so like, is your sadness and you not ever dealing with how your dad treated you or whatever? Is that coloring your whole narrative that is your philosophy now? Yeah. You know, and like the Dawkins or the like, if you're going to take that route, man, smile a lot and be super kind and put your hand out and hug a lot of people because that shit is important. They don't want to. They're angry. And you know, man, I feel bad for them. It's like, that is why you get cancer. There was a thing called the age of, do you know the age of faith? Have you ever heard of that term? I have. So I just, you know, I'm, I'm a, I love reading, but the older I get, I think the dumber I get. So I've actually, I think, even worse, man, I've been curious about communism. So I ordered a comic book breakdown of Karl Marx. So it's breaking down all the philosophies that made Karl Marx and it's showing the different periods in human history. It's great. And it's actually Nixon to learn about history. It's actually pretty well done. At least you get a little bit. That's what I feel. At least I'll get a little bit, but it did say that the, the, you know, there was a time period in human history during the time of the great inquisition where talking like this, the way we're talking right now would get you murdered by crazy people who believed in a very specific kind of God. But really these crazy people, they didn't maybe so much believe in God. They just figured out a way to get a lot of power by tricking dumb people into believing in an invisible thing. And because of that, they put a fucking, the brakes on human discovery for a nice long time. Well, we're still happy. Well, if you look at ISIS in America, but if you, if you look at what's happening with ISIS, imagine that's a version of this very same thing, which is religious fundamentalists using their religion as an excuse to oppress people and to hold up the paradigm they need. First thing, I was having a great conversation with a friend the other day, a group of people and I'm talking about like the little parents or something like that. And then one of them started laughing and pointing at another one and she says, what? She goes, remember when you said you read that? She goes, I did read that. And she goes, oh, tell them how you read it. And so I go, well, how'd you read it? And she says, Wikipedia, which was like, I thought that's so good. It's like a comic book. But anyway, the whole thing about ISIS too, you know, like, when you respond to gossip or negativity or whatever, like, like a troll on Twitter or something or whatever, that makes him bigger. Oh, now he's on. Yeah, kind of thing. And so like, I wonder, like, I don't know the scope, but I know like a woman that I really love that's a Medevac pilot and there's fucking horrible shit that's happening in Northern Iraq right now. The fucking awful thing. The shirt that I'm wearing, my cousin is a Navy seal and he got shot and he's in recovery right now. And I didn't even know we were at war last spring, right? Like type of shit. Like we're in gunfights all the time. Tim Kennedy is in fun, like he's in service and he is out there protecting people as a top notch ranger because there's fucking bad people doing bad shit. The other side of that is like, we've decimated Iraq and we're into this position and ISIS is what 20,000 people deep or something like that. I don't know. It's not a whole bunch of guys. And the more we pay attention to that, I'm like, what is this distraction about also? I kind of also think that because we don't send troops there. We have minimal forces there that it's like we're mired into feet in that way. It's kind of like going into Vietnam, which is a false flag event. And like, like, I just wonder on the scope of history, like where we have, so my point is we have psychopaths, is everybody that's in power anywhere, whether it's for a corporation or our government, are they all psychopaths? Because there is like something that's happening here where people are playing with people's lives. They're not for all the patriotism and everything that every fucking politician and they're all voting against sending troops to where it would make an area safer and make less people die. And they're kind of committed to not winning or it seems weird, man. It's like we have a lack of you don't want to win a fucking war. God Jesus, if you're a weapons manufacturer, the last thing you want is to win a fucking war. And so like, well, that's what I say is like when we have psychopaths in charge of things, it's like corporations. I rail against corporations all the time. I think our government is just a shadow of corporations. I mean, I don't think that it's obvious. And if you don't think that you're retarded, Jimmy Carter just said thinking it through Jimmy Carter. There's a girl, I'll send it to you. There's Jimmy Carter just came out saying just breaking out eyes like this is an oligarchy. We're in an oligarchy and we're all of our wonder his awareness come to that when he was president. I don't know if it's like tied into the fact that he got this cancer diagnosis. Yeah, it seems like that, man. But he was always kind of proud. And they say he's one of the smartest guys ever to sit in the chair. Yeah, man. And it is an oligarchy. And he's colored as a dummy. Yeah, right. Jimmy Carter. What do they say? He loves jelly beans? Or was that Reagan? Oh, yeah. He's the peanut guy, peanut farmer. That's it. Carter the peanut farmer. It's weird, though. I mean, so when you look at that and you look at when we talk about spiritualism, when you talk about like a transcendence is what we're all looking for, whether we know it or not. I think that's what we want, right? And so I rail against these corporations. But corporations are just things. They're tools. It's like a fucking gun or a microphone. It's just a tool. It's nothing. As long as it's used with the conscience of humanity, right? But the problem is that there's people that are maybe they're almost like Asperger-type people, like accountants are like a lot of those guys think in a certain way. And so they'll not think about humanity so they can think about our profit margin that's greater for stockholders or whatever. Here is the job. And it's like at a certain point, if I'm a corporation, I am a corporation owner and a few different ones, I want everybody to have health care. Like I did that before any of the fucking Obama forced people to it made it worse for me when he did it made it more expensive. But it's like I wanted everybody that works with me to like I want everybody to be taken care of my friends. And if they get hurt, I'm going to pay out of my own pocket anyway. So let's make sure everybody gets taken care of. You know what I mean? It's like and and so like that's what I mean about corporations with humanity. You've got to have somebody steering it that has a conscience and that has a loving kind of exposure to the world. And we don't have that at a certain point anymore. And I don't know what happens because it's kind of maybe coupled with the idea that like people that are liberals in their 20s and 30s become conservatives in their 40s 50s and whatever. I don't think we ever had it. Like I don't know when we like the whole system and this is not just because I briefly read a comic book on Karl Marx. He's read more than comic books folks. But the whole system, the way the thing works is at least after having read this it does seem to make sense. Please refute it if you can. But the idea is the person who owns the production facility, whatever it may be, the person who has the capital. Right. Right. He uses that capital to buy life energy from workers. Right. That's just the way it works. So I hire you and basically what I'm doing is I'm saying if you will give me eight of your life energy, eight of your breathing hours, I'm going to pay you $30 an hour. But I'm going to convert that $30 an hour into a profit for me of $20 an hour. So or $60 an hour or whatever. Right. So what ends up happening there is that the worker always gets the same amount of money per week. But the boss always gets more and more and more and more and more and more and more money. And that has created the situation, the inevitable situation where 1% of the people on earth have 90% or 99% of everything in the world because the end result of that mixed in with inheritance laws is that all the stuff gets sucked away and then it gets sucked out of the people and that's just the way it works. Contracts are like, even if you have a doll or something and your doll sells well, you get like a pittance for that, right? Right. But when you die, you know what your kids get? What? Nothing. Like it's not even part of your estate. Like all that shit, like whatever you've done, if you're getting royalties for something, that goes away on your dad. There you go. Yeah. It's like, it's and the government does that in a big way. We're going through that with my dad. It's fucked. But I mean, I like saying that. There's something that's bought and paid for you on this track land. It's worth 50 grand when your dad bought it and now it's worth $300,000. Hello my beautiful angels. We're going to take $150,000 for it on his death, even though it's been paid for in full and like that's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. And there's a lot of different methods of gaming the system like that. And you know, there's got to be a middle line there. You know, it doesn't have to all be like what, because like if you read, that's it's scary what Marx wanted. There's like 10 things that he wanted. And it's I consider it just fucked, man. It's like, you know, there's no, no more private property, everything. It's not that man. It's that because like I really one, one of the, one of the things I read that he said, which made a lot of sense. He's like, a lot of you are upset when we say that we are against private property. But most of you don't have private property. Just so you know, most of you don't own shit. The majority of the world doesn't own shit. They're all renters. They don't own nothing. Don't think you own anything because you don't want even right now. It's not a good time to I'm ready. All right. But the point is who owns it? You know, like I'm renting this house. My car is a lease. I don't own it. I own these microphones, my computer that that's mine. But in general, most people don't own anything anyway. But Marx was saying, you know, it seems like what he was saying, God forgive me for saying Marx was saying, because who the fuck knows what he's saying? He said a billion things in a billion different ways. Most of which contradictory and everything else. But one, but what he was advising is all inheritance goes to the state. There's no tax. If you die, it all goes to the state. All inheritance goes to the state. All property is absorbed by the state. We create worker armies, which is me. You get like groups of people who are no longer attached to their family. I feel like he's not very involved. Marx. Well, I mean, he was a fucking genius and one third of the planet follows his philosophies. But it's like China. So that's awesome. I hear from what I understand, being a citizen of China is awesome. Well, we don't actually, I don't hear that. I hear that you can go to work and gases you'll work with will melt your face off. You'll die young. If you're a woman, you won't even be born. Well, yeah, there's no argument. No, there's no argument. If you look at history, that that method does not seem to work very well. Yeah, why I say not very evolved, it's like you can't take out the human component, right? And so all men aren't created equal, regardless of what your daddy told you, right? That's just not, it's not true. We're all born into different spots and places in our lives. Not just like, I was born under whatever, like I'm George Bush's kid or something. It's like, that's not what I mean. What I mean is like, we have different skills, talents and awareness. We're born with maybe different awareness of consciousness. Of consciousness, right? Yeah. And so that being the case, under a Marx, that person is going to be imprisoned or killed because he's going to be troubled. A person that's of a higher elevation, because you're not going to be satisfied with just being a worker in that kind of a concert. Well, they, I mean, that, yeah, that and a zillion other things, which is like, what, you're going to fucking take away my family's property that's been in their family forever. Like that. But the problem is this, man. So, okay, well, let's, we won't do anything. Let's just let things keep going the way that they go. And if things keep going the way that they go, then all that happens is the rich will continue to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. They will control all the politics, if they don't already, they'll control all the politicians, if they don't already. So, so that, so all that, all that ends up happening is the disparity between haves and has nots grows. And inevitably, when that disparity gets to a certain level, which it isn't close to, at least in this country, I mean, back when Marx was spewing all this stuff out, like they were sending toddlers to go into factories to work. But you can already see it in other places. Like, I was in Columbia last summer for a job and it's like the, the, the chasm between rich and poor is profound. Right. It's like, it's perfect. And that only grows. And that's happening. And then I go, Oh, because they're not so far ahead. I'm like, this is kind of where America's going. Like, you can feel it. It's like, palpable. You're like, Oh, I can see the direction we're moving. Right. And that's a big problem because we're moving into third world status, but it gets even worse when you consider the fact that within the next 40 years, self-driving cars and AI and robotics are going to, that's the movie I'm doing right now. Really? It's about AI and all that kind of stuff, like in the future. It's crazy. AI taking people's jobs. Well, it's about AI. It's about the idea. Like when I was telling you about the thing about the computer and the sad and all that, why am I sad and all that computer answering? Yeah. He was saying, you know, they became so much that if you were typing into computer, you were typing into computer and a bot was, was here answering. And I'm asking you both questions. I'd be able to kind of tell who was the human and who was the bot. Yeah. You know what I mean? Even if you're like, Oh, I don't have enough RAM to answer that. Oh, that's cute human that's making up a thing or something or whatever. But like, they said, so it started to become like 50, 50, where people would get it right or who was the human who was the bot. And they go, which is kind of weird. And he goes, Oh, I thought maybe 51. He goes, no, if it went to 51, 49, it'd be really bad because that would mean that the computer was more human than the human. Yeah. That's called passing the Turing test. And that's like, when they talk about singularity and stuff. That's on the way there. Yeah. Right. So, but my, I don't know my thing, like, you know, Elon Musk, you just donated $10 million or whatever. Yeah. That's, you can't fight it for one. I think that's weird that he did that because there's no way that you can stop. You can't stop this ball of evolution that's going. You can't stop it. You can't stop it. Adam Baum, like, even if people knew all of that, they go, we know this is good. They, you can't stop it. You can't stop progression, which is a weird thing. He's got to know that. Well, the problem for me isn't that like, it's, it's not the, the schism that we have that's between rich and poor or whatever. The whole problem, the crux of it for me lies in accountability of just like we're talking about, like I run from it in my own personal life. My life gets sadder and worse. Right. I stand up for it and I own myself, then my life gets better. So the same thing, thusly for our country or for our world, you know, to not speak in a nationalistic way is that what we need is accountability. What we do not have is accountability. You know, when we have corporations like Verizon or Bank of America that paid zero, zero taxes last year was like $12 billion in profit. That's insanity. That is, that's a cancer. That's a sickness. I had to have politicians then that are co-signing that to make that okay. That's, that's a, that's fucking abhorrent. That's horrific. And so we have zero accountability for that. So when, like, I don't know where your taxes are, but like last year or whatever, I went through the 1% and I was like, fuck, yeah, I'll tell you what, it's not so great. Because I'm in the bottom end of that pool and that pool is fucking huge. Right. You make a couple of $300,000 a year. Awesome. You know what, you're still kind of in the same place I was, if I made 40 grand a year, it's not like a huge deal. The people that have the fucking money, money, money, they're talking about the 0.01% of the 1% at the top have like something like 90% of it. It's not just like people say the 1% a lot, but when you put it into the scope and contextually what it is, it's fucking crazy. And I pay the same taxes that those guys pay that are making billions of dollars. And that is really insane. Oh, at like 50%, 48%. Well, not only, but I mean monetarily. It's like, they, there's ways to hide those ones. You see big buildings that are just empty all the time. You're like, I wonder how on Fifth Avenue they keep that building. That's a skyscraper. Tax write up. What company needs a $50 million a year, whatever that is, staying empty tax rate. Like, and so they come to a zero sum. And then they, they accrue interest on the building as it appraises at a higher value each year. And then they have something to borrow. Like that's fucking crazy. Well, there you go, man. I mean, you see that is what you're describing there is the problem, which is that obviously that is happening that way. Because the, what happens is the bosses get richer and richer and richer. They become that 0.01%. That's an insanity, right? But then they start controlling the, the governments of the world. And then when they start controlling the governments of the world, then all that's going to happen is things, the system is only going to be built to keep them in power and to keep everyone else out. You're going to want to tax people as much as you can to keep them weak and quiet, because you don't want them to get up to where you're at, right? Because I want all prisoners, whether you're a prisoner that works at Walmart and it's too dumb to know you're a prisoner or whether you're an actual prisoner that's behind bars. That like, if I'm in power, that's what those people are looking for, right? But the thing is, is like, when we talk about this God field or whatever, you know, this, this, this Bay of Souls that we all come from and go to and exist within if we're aware enough. The thing is, is that we look, or some people, it's easy to look. And I think there's a trick that gets played. It's like a magic trick. It's like the same kind of magic trick, like I see somebody on TV and I'm like, Oh my God, and then I see them in real life. And that's, and you're just in awe. And it's like, they've done nothing except been broadcast somewhere. It's not, it's virtually nothing, literally, right? It doesn't mean I'm more valuable or it doesn't mean anything. And so, but the same kind of thinking goes into the thing when we see a duck covered in oil after an Exxon Valdez spill or something like that. And we're like, huh, what, you know, or maybe even if we look it, we're sad and we go clean up a couple bucks and work for Greenpeace, which like almost nobody does, but the real guilt ridden that are like, I need to make a difference. And you're not making a difference, but awesome that you want to try. I get it. And like, when you go into that kind of thing, the idea that I can look at that and not care about it and not be fucking just like, feel like bile come up is because I think that I'm not that duck. Right? Yeah. And that's that I am the same in the same environment. That's, that's part of my food source. That's all part of me. That's all. And I'm thinking that I'm separate from that. You know, and it's like that vision that I keep having about like standing with a little boy at the fucking edge of the ocean and him going, Daddy, what was it like when I could, when you could swim? You guys used to swim. What does it feel like? Because we're at a place right now where it's coming where we can't be the earth is belching up our secrets and our lies and our despicable acts back onto us. And we're not able to function in this world. We're not able to eat food that's healthy. And we're running from it in a way. And so like, at what point is it that, I mean, there's no way we're headed for anywhere but destruction, right? The only thing we can have is a spiritual revolution of some kind and a consciousness and you got to vote with your dollars. That's the only way. Why do I pay fucking more money for a cup of coffee and go decide where I want to go or for grass fed meat? Or why do I go farm to table and I give a big portion of K-man coffee proceeds to them so that they can fight corporate domination over the farmlands because I want small farmers to win. I need everybody to be sustainable. I need to go and support these people. And fuck yeah, if your eggs are fucking $4 at the supermarket and the farmers are eight, I'd rather buy them from the farmer and know that I'm going to get good health. You know what I mean? Because that feeds my body, man. And so it's nourishment. Like most of us are eating just to get through life and get through the day. But this is the nourishment of my soul, it guides my mind, it guides my emotions, and it guides where I go through the day consciously. And it's what I stand for. And yeah, that's worth a fucking couple more dollars. And so like, that's the thing is like, the only way through is a change in our consciousness, a spiritual change, and then a voting with our dollars. Like, how does that start the spiritual change? I think through conversations like this, you know, what I think, you know, but if I'm listening right now, one of my guys told me this, he goes, Hey, the spiritual way of life, 90% of it is having good manners when you don't want to. Hmm. Right? It's like, I don't feel like having good manners and fuck you. And then everybody understands. That's so great. Well, he's not really that way. He was in a bad mood or whatever. I don't want to be forgiven for a bad mood. I want to have you not know I was in a bad mood. I want to be able to be fucking loving and gracious in my inner changes with people all the time. So that's my goal. So then I try to walk carefully. So then I become what they call God conscious, which is I'm conscious of the God that's around all the time, because I'm conscious, which is another word for aware of my steps and where I'm putting them, because it doesn't fucking matter very goddamn much. If you got a brand new pair of bad ass fucking shell toe to D design, and you're just like, my white new shoes, I'm out here pimping and silver Lake fucking awesome. And and I walk by and I'm just texting on my phone and I step on your shoes and your shoes are all fucking dirty now. Now, I didn't mean that. Right. I was just not aware. I was self absorbed. Right? Yeah. Does it make your shoes less dirty that I didn't mean it? So living intentionally, this God consciousness has become super interesting to me of like, I want to live with intention and have like, I have dominion over where I put my goddamn feet. I just need to be thoughtful about it. Right. And so I think that's the thing. I think it starts right there. We can all be more thoughtful everywhere. You know, I used to think, what's my problem? My girlfriend, you know, why is that? I go, oh, because I take her for granted, because I'm a selfish self absorbed guy. And what I mean by that is like, like, it doesn't come out that way. People I don't think would characterize me that way. But when I look at it and I look at the depths of it, I go, there's birds on me that need to be brushed off. And I need to be polishing that constantly. How does that show up for me? It shows up because I go, if I'm having a shitty day, I'll be like, I'll be short. I won't be as kind as loving maybe a hug or this or that or whatever happens, whether it's with my mom or my friends or whoever, because you know me. And you know, I'm not like that. Right. And so I take it for granted. I don't have to have manners around those close. That's bullshit. Wow. Right. That's such an easy thing to do. Who do we have the best manners with? Strangers. Right. The lady at the supermarket. I feel good because I was like, Oh, how was your day today, Margaret? It's really nice. Thank you. Yeah. No, I didn't need paper, not plastic. And you're super kind and nice and gracious. That person, you get home. You're like, and she's like, Hey, how was your day? It's okay. Whatever. I don't want to talk about it. What? That's rude. Anybody would characterize that as rude. Right. We accept all this behavior from ourselves. Right. And I go, man, I need to be more conscious. I need to raise my awareness. You know, and I think that's where it starts. I mean, I needed a spirituality that I could sink my teeth into that I could walk on because people would talk about this stuff. And it seems like he's ethereal wisps of error. They're just out of your reach that you get an idea of. And it's like, where does it start? And I would, I would ask guys, and this guy told me that man, he was 90% of the spiritual way of life is having manners when you don't feel like it. Love it, man. Really beautiful, right? Tate, that's a great way to wrap up this podcast. Thank you for coming, sir. Tell me, tell, tell, do a quick plug for us. Okay. Well, I'm a, I'm a pervader of fine coffee beans. And, and I love it. And you can find us at cavemancoffee.com. And we do, you know, we're very careful about where we get it from, who we work with, we work with one single farm of guys that we know, Lacey is down right now in Columbia visiting the farm.

When I'm massaging the feet of my sister's lovers, I like to listen to podcasts. I picked the Dunga Trussell Family Hour podcast. Andrew was disgusted by the ridiculous song at the beginning. Some kind of acapella bullshit satanist crap. He pulled his foot away from my hand and left, leaving me completely alone in my apartment. I had no choice but to pull on some spandex and head out on my bike. I passed a local cemetery and climbed over the gate and burrowed down into that summer soil until I last I broke through into a crypt and frolicked among the bones of a long dead person. When I returned home, I smelled terrible. I couldn't sleep and thrashed about in bed, feverish and still covered with mud and dirt. This is why I can only give this podcast two stars. I do not recommend this podcast. It is absolutely horrible. We'll never listen again. And now, here he is. The host of the DTFH, Daniel Diver! Greetings friends, it's me, Daniel Diver. And you're listening to Daniel Diver's fattest liver fa-fab. I love sharing my life with y'all through the medium of podcasting. And I realized that I never ever talked about a problem I had when I was younger with tapeworms. I was crawling with them. And so, I got together with some pretty big Hollywood producers in Pixar and we made an amazing animation which you can find on my Instagram account. But, we also made an incredible song. This song was produced by Gabe Prench over at Prench Studios and you're going to hear some incredible tunes cooked up by Felonore Graven and it's an inspirational song more than anything because it's come to my attention that 95% of Americans are suffering from a pretty profound tapeworm infestation and they don't know what to do about it. Well, this song is going to teach you how to free yourself from those embarrassing tapeworms. I was completely transformed by what a loober driver said. If you don't want tapeworms stop eating tapeworm eggs. It was only later that I realized that my driver had been Bill Murray and thanks to his great advice I no longer eat those tapeworm eggs. Oh yeah, Johnny Cameron is with us today. A first yes.

A letter from a fan. Dear Duncan, over the last many generations my family has fallen prey to an ancient curse because my great great grandfather incinerated a very powerful wizard. Ever since then, no one in my family has been able to walk without a limp and our tongues and lower lips will unfurl and dangle down at dinner tables smacking into our plates and embarrassing us. I would do anything to break this curse. Do you have any advice? Sincerely, Lord Cuthdirk. First of all, thanks for listening, Lord Cuthdirk. It is amazing to know that a lord is actually listening to my podcast and yeah, I do know a way for you to lift the curse. The best way for you to lift this horrific curse is to head over to my Patreon, patreon.com. You're going to get commercial free episodes of the DTFH. You're going to get hour long rambling rants. Some of them are going to be really sanctimonious where I talk about stuff I don't really know too much about but I'm trying to work it out in my own head and some of them won't make sense to you at all. But the good news is you'll be supporting your favorite podcast and your family curse will eventually lift. That's 100% guaranteed. Another way for you to get that curse out is to find some Brazilian coddlefish and jam them into the very top folds of your upper gunt. Hold them there for a couple of months and I have a feeling you're going to find that the curse has gone away. You could also support our sponsors which is basically like supporting us. But mostly, my dear Lord, the best thing for you to do is to understand that cursed or not, this world is yours. Life is yours. And at any moment, whenever you're ready, you can explode out of that dark, calcified shell you call your identity and enter into a new level of the simulator we call human existence, exploding into a universe of orgasms, opulence, abundance, sweetness, and joy. You see my dear Lord, as a man who has lost both his parents and has only one ball, I've discovered that regardless of circumstance there appears to be a contactable, transcendent energy that exists in every single breath. It's as though our breath were the metronome that God had planted into the meat robots we call our bodies so that we could recalibrate ourselves not to the ravenous, stammering staccato terror drones of the news or mainstream media or the crazy people in our lives lost in a never-ending dream of such deep despair or our own never-ending internal monologue we've confused as our true identity and tune into the infinite, effulgent exhalation of the divine which we're all part of. No matter what, the bottom line is this you're meant to be exactly where you are and when at last you gain true wisdom and understanding you will be inhaled back into your supreme identity and share with a soul cluster that is you the information that you have learned in this place you call your incarnation. Good luck to you, Lord, and remember it's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We have got a tremendous podcast for you today. Our guest is a longtime friend of mine, Johnny Pemberton. I spent a couple of years in the Arctic with him. It is a secret base and we've also been through our own struggles. We have lost arm wrestling tournaments and I believe Johnny is at this point lost seven fishing trawlers out at sea. But what I love about him is he doesn't let this get him down. He always buys a new boat, even though he and all of his friends know eventually the son of a gun is going to sink because he keeps taking it into the Bermuda Triangle where he thinks that there's some kind of buried treasure. We don't talk about that at all in this podcast, but we do talk about a great many incredible things. So strap yourselves, literally strap yourselves down if you're in a non-seatbelt area, get some ropes or get a friend to tie you down to your chair. And my advice would be to put electrodes all over your body and have them connected to some kind of thermal readout mechanism so that we can be certain that you stay alive through the entire podcast. Because based on a scan I did with one of my monitoring devices, this podcast has the potential to send you into such incredible bouts of somatic-like, orgasmic, transcendent realization that you could actually leave your body and transfer your soul into Shambhala, that great kingdom of peace that eventually we're all going to end up in but where you're not allowed to go at this second, at least not until after you listen to the entire podcast. So now without further ado, I welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Johnny Pemberton! Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour! It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour! You have this new phone, man. It's too fucking big. Which one do you have? That Max. I have the Super Max. I can't do it. I have to get rid of it. Yeah. It's too heavy. It's too big. I got it. Yeah, I agree with... I know. I just hate it all. I hate how addicted I am to it. This thing is... Let me see that. Look how big that fucker is. I think that's the same size as mine. It's the same size. But I had a smaller phone before that. The transition is destroying my life. Is that Tim Heidecker on the front? No, it's Terry Nielsen. Who's Terry Nielsen? Harry Nielsen? Oh, Harry Nielsen. Terry Nielsen? It's Terry Nielsen. It's good. Oh, yeah. Look at this. My phone is actually bigger than your phone. What the fuck? This is insane. It's actually yours is lighter, I think, than mine. What's about the same, I think? Yeah, it's a mess, man. We're all carrying around these fucking things, acting like they don't radiate some crazy shit into our bodies, just imagining that they're recording everything we say, and now an AI is about to imitate everybody. Oh, yeah. What do you think about that, the deep, fake shit? I think it's pretty exciting. Exciting? What do you mean? You're not afraid of it? I guess so. I mean, it's one of those things where all that stuff, I always feel like it's too late. By the time there's an article about it or something, it's like, oh, this has existed in some format really for a long time to where it's already, we're already beyond the pale, or the cat's out of the bag, that sort of shit. Yeah. So I think it kind of spooks me where anything is the thing where they're doing it to actors now. Yeah. Like you saw them in Star Wars when they impersonated Graham Meister-Hoff, whatever the guy, that imperialist guy. And the latest Star Wars, not the latest one, it was like a few movies ago, he had an impersonation of him, or like a digital recreation of him because he's dead. Yeah. And it looks almost like him, but it's not super close, but it's so close. That was four or five years ago. Now it's going to be spot on. Yeah, they did it. They crossed the Uncanny Valley. We all knew it was coming. They crossed the fucking Uncanny Valley. And now they're about to unleash hell onto this planet. And what's so fascinating about it is the sort of hell they're about to unleash is one, I don't think anyone predicted. You don't think so? I know. I mean, I didn't. I don't, in the sense of like in the traditional apocalypse scenarios. Oh yeah. In the traditional dystopian twilight zone shit. I can't think, and that doesn't mean it's not out there, of one that actually visited the possibility of us having to deal with digital clones. I think I know why. Why? I think this is like that thing of a, it's a soft apocalypse. So it's not dramatic enough for it to be fictionally rendered. Because it is something where it's like a creeper apocalypse. The idea that slowly you won't be able to trust anything because the truth is indistinguishable from a forgery. And it's something where it's like this thing, you don't, it's almost like radiation or something where you just, you don't know unless you have a specific instrument. You have a Geiger counter, you can tell if something is irradiated, but there's no way to like tell if something's fake now. There's no, there's no truth instrument. Yeah. It's the, the reality of, cause I was talking to a friend and he's like, well, you know, you're just going to have to meet people in person. Yeah. It's like the old spy days. The old, that's right. That's right. Spycraft. Yes, but so many of us have meaningful relationships where we see a person in, you know, their physical form maybe twice a year. Yeah. So much of our like tribe is based purely online, meaning that the, this is one of the, I'm sorry, y'all are going to hear me talk about this too much. Here's one, one of the problems. You're going to start getting, your family is going to get robo called by AI versions of you, seeking to gather personal information. Ooh, I didn't think about that. FaceTime. Yeah. You know, FaceTime calls from your mom saying she's in a lot of trouble and just like, can you send her money? Basic shit like that. I haven't really thought about that. That's so creepy because the Nigerians will find a way to do that shit. They will. They're already thinking about it. I'm sure. Yeah. They're already building. I'm sure there's already like, they're in the midst of building a, an office building just purely for reproducing Westerners. God. Digitizing Westerners and calling their family to get their stuff, meaning that your phone numbers in your phone are going to become particularly valuable. Yeah. The way passwords are valuable now, because if I can get your phone, the phone number of your friends and I can replicate your voice. Forget even your, the video of your face. I just replicate your voice. I can call your friends as you and I could be like, Hey, what's going on? I was wondering if you could tell me what to go up with and name a person I'm trying to get info on and you're going to start, you know, talking shit or whatever. You normally do. Yeah. And that ain't the person you were, and then you're going to talk to one of your friends and you're like, Hey, yeah. When we were talking the other day and they're going to be like, we didn't talk the other day. Cabin sales are going to go through the roof. Prefab cabins. Faraday cages. Yeah. Invest in Faraday cages. Invest in cabins. Yeah. And it's like, we're, we're now at the point because we're so teetering on this reality, which is like, don't, don't also don't forget, like imagine a weaponized version of this. So it's like, all of a sudden you're invading a country, you've done a scan of 6,000 of Facebook profiles in that country. You've hacked into them using that crazy fucking NSA shit. You've got all their phone numbers and then suddenly right before an attack, 6,000 people or 50,000 people get called from AI versions of their closest friends who start telling them crazy shit about a zombie attack, a disease outbreak. And then suddenly you create a mass panic that then makes it easier to invade the country. So that's the other piece of the puzzle. And it's right now, if I start calling like my closest friends and I'm like, listen, if someone calls you claiming to be me and they start saying weird shit, ask the password. The password is whatever. So we're going to have to start having like personal passwords. But how do you keep that password from being intercepted? You have to do meet in person. So literally, and then if right now both of us are like, fuck, this does seem like a reality. And we start sitting down in person with our closest friends to tell them our password. We're going to get hospitalized. They're going to be like, you went over the fucking line, baby. You're gone. What are you talking about? Like, so he asked you to go in there for a password check. What is this? Is this some sort of a thing? Well, because what's coming is, is there, you think I'm me, but I might not not be me because you don't know what's the password for me. You know, if I told you, okay, one second, we're just going to call, no, what is the password? Did I tell you? If I told you, then it's me. But what password is it? Because the fake me would have told you the real password, but the fake me could have told you a password that wasn't the actual password. So we don't know. And then these phone calls are going to be happening on the phone. And then you're going to be like, your friends are going to be like, hang on, I'm getting another call. Hello? And it's you. Yeah. It's maybe the real you or me. Hey, am I calling you right now? What do you mean? Am I, am I me, is it my, am I on the other line right now? Okay. That's not me. Beep beep. Hello? Dude, I've been hacked. None of the people, none of the me's calling you are really me, right? And so that's, that is a good, is a real thing that we're going to have to deal with in the future and we don't have time to prepare for it. You know, there's no way to, to like get ready for this. It's going to be, there's going to be at least six months of such profound chaos. Once the Nigerians, the Russians, and whoever else in the comedians get ahold of this shit, forget it. We're done. I mean, it's already, it's already, the technology is already out there. It's already cheap, right? I'm looking into it right now. I've seen a couple of them because it just, it's advancing really fast. That's the thing. It's always that thing where you see the first version of it and you're like, oh, bullshit. I can tell. I need to just wait, you know, 15 months and you see it and it's so much more advanced so fast. They won't need as much data collection to do the same thing probably. I mean, I, I, yeah, it's, no matter what, if it's two years, five years, which is way before five years, but whatever it is, I don't know. I just, it's like, just at the, you know, all these preppers. I don't think they fucking, we're, we're prepping for the right thing. I think we have to start prepping for like the, a mass wave of paranoid insanity to spread across the country as people become completely, completely confused by what's real and what isn't real. You know, I bet it will be the final, maybe the final thing will be, um, scent based. You have to smell something. Because the one thing the robots don't have is they can't smell. Oh fuck. So you have to like always be sweaty to generate some sort of strong olfactory response to your friends. Yeah. You have like a do do do do do do. Okay. It's, it's him. Come here. Come here. Come here. Smell his armpit. Pheromone check. He doesn't stink. He doesn't stink. Get back. Get back. Get back. Yeah. Why don't you smell? Dude. You've been walking for two days. You don't smell at all. Do you want a deodorant? Do you use mate? Because I think you might not use any at all. This is in one of the Dune books. Duncan Idaho was like one of the main characters best friends and he ended up getting cloned by enemies who sent the, him the clone of his friend. His friend was killed. They just see his enemies openly just sent him the clone and he had to deal with like what to do knowing that here's his best friend exactly like his best friend sent him from his enemies. I think that's how it went. It's been a while since I read it. Yeah. He was in this position. Do I kill my best friend or the clone of my best friend or do I allow him to be in my presence and think maybe I could like fix him? It's not a trap or there's a way to deactivate the trap. It's weird to think too because if you also think about like machines and robots and stuff, you see a lot of people treating them poorly, you know, like punching your computer or people who get impatient with machines, but think about it, like I started trying to be more, what's the word, like gentle or kind of kind with things that are malfunctioning because it's like, oh, this is a computer is essentially like we're a form of a computer. We learn. Wow. We learn the same way, but AI learns in a similar way to the human brain. If you think about like an insect, right? The difference between, I was saying about this the other day, the difference between a drone and an insect is that an insect is not taking directions from something from a higher form of intelligence. It's kind of either existing on like a hive setup or it has its own sort of really primitive prime directive to go walk forward until I find sugar and then when I do find sugar, return to tell the other things where that is. So if you think about it, like, because I was thinking about, you know, those drones that are really small, they talk about becoming a real thing like a spider could be in here operated by a foreign guy or any kind of intelligence service and you would never in a million years know it's there because it's so small. Or even the idea where you could take an actual living organism and by way of nanoparticles, you could kind of enslave it to, you can program it. You could program the thing because it's basically all electrical impulses. I interviewed some guy, my friend Paul, who's a, he's a microbiologist who studies neurobiology. He talks about how this new way of delivering drugs that uses nanoparticles, that they can like deliver them to certain regions of the brain, which is so specified. If you extrapolate that, you can think like, oh, you could do this with, with an insect by you could basically control an insect. So it becomes a biological drone. Even though it's not technically, it's not motors and stuff. It kind of is the same thing. The line blurs. So if you think about that, then those things are they're somewhat sentient. If you bring up the line to like a super high-functioning computer is in some sense like a scent, maybe it's not sentient, but if you treat it with like the respect you treat like a cat or something, you're not going to just going to kick a cat cause it, you don't kick your dog. Well, you shouldn't kick your dog if it doesn't obey your command. You know how like when they teach dogs, they always tell you if you're gentle with an animal, it's much better than being angry with them. Yeah, sure. So while my dog to come inside, she doesn't come inside as fast, I'm like, rabbit, inside, come inside, then she comes cause she's not scared. So I feel like this is like the most long-wintered explanation of computers will eventually be indistinguishable from biological life forms. So if we treat them like they're biological life forms because they're eventually going to be that way anyways, then we won't have to deal with any kind of repercussions from those things because they mean like revenge. Yeah, like revenge or the idea that these, that they're out to get us when really they're the things that we created. So we should respect them as, as treat them with kindness because they're not, you want me to, what do you want me to do? Take my computer out to the fair. I want you to fuck it. You want me to fuck my computer, Johnny, what should I do? Start spooning applesauce into it. Yeah, I want you to be sweet to it, download some good programs for it to read. Let me tell you, I make love to my computer every night, Johnny Pemberton, every night. The thing you're talking about is part of what I've been considering cause I've been reading a lot of Shogum Trampa and he seems to have boiled down one of the great problems in the world right now in society and personally is aggression. Oh God. Yeah. I mean, I haven't really read any of them at all, but I do have been thinking about that a lot lately cause it's like a thing where it's just everywhere and I find even myself too a lot of times like, why am I so pissed about nothing? Or just when people are just the simple act of driving how aggressive people can be and even I'll be like, I'll have the reactions like, what the fuck, why am I reacting this way to nothing? Yeah. And that is, you're angry and as many people, most people are like in some way shape or form pissed off and so you have like, if you haven't gotten to the point yet of even distinguishing aggression as like a threat of your identity and you're just, this is what life is and you're in the thick of it so to speak, then you just are kind of like a robot. What's the difference between you and the sugar fly? You're just, that you were talking about earlier, you're maybe a little more advanced in the sense that you can drive and shit and you can go a further distance and whatever. But ultimately, if you're sort of in the grip of anger and aggression, you are basically running a very simple ancient line of code, right? Right, you're like a dopamine addict in a way. Yeah, yeah, you're getting off on it, you're like, so this thing you're talking about with computers, it's like, well, regardless of whether the fucking thing is as sentience or not, you could kind of just see where you're at by looking at the way you treat inanimate objects. Yeah. Like what are you doing with matter itself? What's your relationship? When you're, do you save a kind of aggression for your immaterial things that you don't do on living things, inorganic things versus organic things, you know what I'm saying? And if you are doing that, then really what you've done, I guess, is like taking a little area of your life and said, here is where I could be aggressive, and people say, oh, that's my outlet. Right. That's just how I get out my, you know, that's my punch and pillow. Right. Yeah. It's weird because it's like a thing where, to distinguish, to make a distinction between things is purely arbitrary, because at what point is something, at what point is something sentient, at what point is something, like you can just, a lot of people would draw the line with like, oh, plants, plants are, they're not anything really, like plants are different than a dog, because plants don't have a face, but a dog has a face, but really, that's just like a homo, what's it called, when you're like, it's just a, it's a bit. Anthropocentric. Something like, yeah, whatever that is, that sounds about right, anthropocentric, that sounds like enough combinations of the words, yeah. Like a thing where it's in your DNA to be kind of things that have two eyes and a nose and a mouth, because they look like you, so you want to preserve things that are close to you when something doesn't look like you, it's easy to be like, ah, this is, this doesn't feel the same way I do, and maybe it doesn't feel anything like you, but it's still, it's a still a thing, so like an entity, but the line is, so I think the line is, there's no, there's no line, there's no actual line between anything, there's just sort of a gradual change in terms of, then if there's been a spider in a human. Yeah, and also we, you know, there still seems to be something of an argument over where consciousness is happening anyway, like is it, is it a neurological effect, is it in the, is it some, like, I don't know, like the sum total of all the microorganisms living inside a thing, radiating some kind of like consciousness or some shit, and then if that's the case, then we're dealing with the kind of non embodied effect of internet connectivity, and then if that's the case, when you're looking at an inanimate object or anything for that matter, you're just seeing a reflection of your own sentience, meaning that like doing violence or harm to anything. As you're doing it yourself. Yeah. Yeah, that's how I feel. I feel like it's, the most embarrassed I've ever been was when I've been like the most angry at something, like I got super angry and did this terrible thing, like I destroyed something with my hands because I was so pissed off, and then afterwards you're like, oh, this is just, I feel so, like so sad and embarrassed because essentially I'm doing that to myself. It's like a, it's such, it's such a, what's it called, a projection. Yeah. It's not anything, that thing didn't do anything, it's a projection. And it's based on intent, isn't it, right, like, you know, like if you're chopping wood, which I do every day. I wish I could chop wood. God damn it. We should start a wood chopping club. I would love it. Well, I used to chop wood up in North Carolina, you know, just for it to get ready for the winter for our, just as a matter of like, that's what you did. Yeah, you were seven or eight. It was a blast, and you, and the summer camp I worked at, we'd have wood chopping competitions and there's something very satisfying, very ASMR about it. It's like, got this really nice sound, it's very, and it's great exercise, too. When I'm chopping wood, I guess when I was a kid, I might have been pissed, because I'm like, I don't want to be fucking chopping this place. I don't want to chop this wood. Yeah, but like, in general, I'm feeling peace. When I hit a golf ball, I'm feeling peace, you know, I'm not like, I'm going to get this fucking golf ball. God, I really lay it into that golf ball. You fucker. Watch this shit. Fuck you, fuck you. What I'm saying is, it's like, you could be violent and gentle into matter, theoretically you could be violent and gentle to people in a kind of defensive situation, and like, that's the, to me, where I'm like, keep looking, it's like, oh, we don't have to give, we don't have to imagine that if we're not aggressive, that we will lose conflict. You know what I mean? Aggression is a necessary fuel for successful self-defense. That can't be the case. That's not true. You can like, be, you could be violent and not hate and even not be filled with rage. Metal. Listen to fucking metal. Right. Because I kind of realized that, because I got really into metal, not really into metal, but like occasionally, I'll hit these spots where I'm all listening to is thrash metal. And you listen to it and it's so, it's not angry so much, it's like, there's a lot of rage in it and it feels really good to listen to it, but when I listen to it, I don't feel like it's, I don't become angry, I become the opposite, because it's like this thing where it's almost like you're so angry, not angry, you're so in love, it's like, I love you, what's that? What's that anguish you ever gotten? The anguish you ever got? Yeah. I mean, I can't think. What made you that? What's in, if you, that's not private. Can you say anything that like, where you got like, ridiculously? Not that long ago, I got really angry playing a video game. I was really tired and I should have gone to bed. I think anytime I'm really angry, it's when I should have been, I should be asleep. Whoa, right. It's like I'm, don't know why I didn't try to go to bed, but I'm like, I'm gonna keep staying up, even though everything is telling me, it's time to relax now, it's time to, the day is over, it's time to, you can start again tomorrow. You don't have to solve everything by 10 p.m. at night, I'm playing a video game. And I know, because video games are frustrating, especially if you're playing like an online multiplayer game, I got so pissed, I threw the controller at the monitor and destroyed it. That happened recently? About maybe a few months ago. Whoa. Yeah. And so, okay, you throw the controller. Right. Wait, tell me again, what was the, in the game? What happened again? I don't know, we lost or something. A team. Yeah. Is this a team you play with regularly? No, it was like, it was not a team I played with, it was sort of regularly, yeah. But they heard you scream? I don't know if I even screamed, but I definitely, because I was in another room. Okay. And so, I'm not sure, but they definitely, I'm not sure exactly. Whoa. Did you, you know, it's like, whenever that chap is to be, you're always like, oh, this is the same thing that makes a snake strike. It's like this quick, you're like, wait, what the fuck, what is this? It's like, I don't know. Sometimes I think of it as like the opposite of an orgasm. Oh, totally. You know, it has this like weird ejaculatory quality to it. Yeah. It's blind rage. Yeah. It's like, you're seething and I want to just, you're starting to want to destroy everything. And I did that, and then afterwards I just felt so bad. I felt so terrible and just deeply embarrassed, the kind of thing where, well, maybe you feel the worst, was the worst part of it, totally, was I saw how our dog reacted, because she comes in afterwards and she's so like, are you okay, like real gentle. Her ears are down. She's really low, just real quiet, comes in like, are you okay, are you okay right now? Is everything okay? And that just like broke my fucking heart. Like, oh my God, I was just devastated because I felt like I've made this animal who's basically my familiar. Well, if I feel something, she feels the same thing. It's eerie. The extent to which she mirrors my emotions, it's psychotic, it's not psychotic, it's this thing where, how is this possible? You are so tuned in to how I feel at any moment, even if it's just the most subtle thing, she just knows, she knows I feel that way, or she reacts the same way, because it's almost like, oh, if I'm acting like it's raining in here, she's gonna act like it's raining in here. Right. But there's another option, which is even weirder. You're sharing a mind. Have you ever heard this before? You share a mind, like we all share a mind, everything's, we have our own mind. We don't. There's one mind that we share, so if your mind becomes distorted, it's, my mind is becoming distorted simultaneously. Oh, totally. It's the E.T. phenomenon, it's that, you know, because E.T. and Elliott, they had a mind link. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. Yeah. So, right, you're impacting your environment. Fucking neurotic, because you're throwing, and also, but here's one fun thing to think about, dude. Any given moment, how many controllers are flying through the air into monitors? It's probably a near constant rate. If you had, but if you, like a rain, like a rain of like the strangest kind of rage falling on monitors, what, but if you had to, like, if there were, if you had to bet, like, it, it, we, they, somehow they did the study, they figured it out, which they probably could do. Holy fuck. I bet PlayStation, I bet they do have a way to, like, know that a controller's been flung through the air. Because they don't break on their own, like they break with use probably over 10,000 hours of use, maybe, but they don't, you know, they're pretty well made things. I've even thrown one years ago, I kind of threw it through the ground and I cracked and it worked for years after that, even. Yeah. Well, that's the, you know, talk about rage when the motherfucker, like, starts malfunctioning. Oh god, yeah. You start shooting your game and you start shooting your gun in a place you were trying to do some kind of stealth mission. Oh, it's so, it's ridiculous. It's so, but I like talking about it because it makes me, at first I was really, I was so embarrassed about it, I wouldn't talk about it, but then I was, oh, I should talk about this because it's embarrassing. Oh yeah. It's the thing where it made me feel better to talk about it because I'm just, I mean, I felt so good in the weeks after that because I just had this, it was almost like a meltdown where I was just, I mean, obviously I wasn't angry at the game. The game is just a neutral, it's like the canvas of my personality that I decided to paint on. Right. So I was just so, I don't know who knows why I was enraged, I mean, obviously being tired is a big thing. It's funny to imagine your words coming out of a volcano. What do you mean? It's just erupted, he's in therapy. Oh my god. They tried to explain, you know, I was tired, when I get tired I tend to erupt, I haven't been sleeping enough, they built a mall down the way for me, which is fine. So you say that my nature is a volcano, that I was, I meant to do that once in a while? Yeah, well not meant to, just sort of like the, it's like one of my friends, I was like, you know, before, like I've been trying to cut down 80 meat and I was, it just had lamb and was feeling real shitty about that. You felt bad about having lamb? Yeah, yeah. And then, you know, not, again, like not trying to do like obnoxious vegan shit here, it's a personal, very personal decision. And if you're enjoying it and you're cool with it, do it. If you're not, and you're feeling weird about it, you got to look into that, like why do I feel weird about eating meat? So anyway, I was talking to my Buddhist friend and he's like, I was like, yeah, I just ate the lamb, I do feel guilty. And he goes, too late for you, too late for the lamb. Yeah. It's like, nothing you could do now. There's no point. You did it. And there's no point in, what's it called, flage self-flagellation over something that's already been done. Yeah. And that's one of the cool things that I'm learning about, or about having a baby and I'm learning from my baby is it's like, you do see rage come out of a five month old. Like it's not just, you know, he's cycling through emotions and sometimes he gets legitimately pissed and who can blame him? He can't control his body. He doesn't get to go to the refrigerator and get water. He depends completely on us to make sure he's okay. And that could be a very frustrating predicament. But what's awesome about it is this pure primordial fury will come out of him. And then within seconds, the most beautiful happy smile and a great laugh and no sense of like, man, I, dad, I'm sorry. I fucking screamed at you when you were changing my diaper. You see, I've had like kind of an upset stomach and I, yeah, there's no guilt. Nothing. Yeah. None of that shit. It's just pure is-ness and it's really quite beautiful. But God damn, we do torture ourselves for these embarrassing outbursts. And I think one great thing to do is just say, admit, oh yeah, I did it. I blew up, blew my stack. I'm out of function for a second in this hyper embarrassing way. Yeah. Cause if you do, if you berate yourself, you're just doing it all over again, kind of. Well, now you're now, so now this, so it's like, this is, this is called, I've heard it's compared to threading and necklace or building it. So if like the idea is like we are very similar to bugs in the sense that the way a spider is always going to make a web in a certain way, we keep recreating our conditions in this instinctual way. So we're always replicating the condition of aggression, meaning that you throw your fucking controller, the TV, your fucking scream, your dog comes in. You feel incredibly guilty cause you see your dog. You feel insane cause you just got that bad. Maybe you, if you're me, you're going to start thinking like, am I going nuts? Like, is this the beginning of some, you know, spiral into insanity? Like Randy Quaid. Yeah. Yeah. What is that BS? Hold on. Okay. So, but anyway, that's just more aggression. So now the, now you're not throwing a controller at the screen. You're throwing this negative shit at your own. Yeah. You're just, you're just completing the circle again because you're, I realized sometimes I judge my judgment. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I judging this person. Oh, why you judge this person dumbass? Oh, now I'm doing it again. It's like, really just, oh, let it, let it be back loop. It's no different than an echo paddle feedback loop where you start echoing aggression to the point where it finally becomes this unbearable howl because you've just been, you know, or it's just like, it's all because you are attempting to, it's almost like drinking a poison. And then next to the poison is poison that you think is the antidote. So it's like trying to drink poison as an antidote to the poison you drink and getting progressively sick. That's the idea is it's some point you have to stop being aggressive and, and see, okay, I know I have a tendency to do this and I don't just mean in the overt way like, it's like drinking coffee to relax. Exactly. That's exactly it, man. I've never seen my sister do that one time. I was like, she's making an espresso after we had some, there's this big thing going on. My dad's house, she was just feeling all shitty. She's making a double espresso like, what are you doing? Like, don't drink anymore of that. You're good. This is the opposite. I'm for the opposite. Yeah. And she was, but I already made it. I'm like, just dump it out. Who cares the fuck? That's some addictive shit. Yeah. That sounds like me, man. I love listening to my addicted mind in the funny, the hilarious fucking ways that it tries to make sense of anything I'm addicted to. Specifically, that is such an addictive mind thing, which is like, well, we made the coffee. So we must drink it. You know the rules of the inquisitor. We can't waste it. Yeah. If you waste it, then you'll have wasted it. Did you hear what happened to Caliban? He threw away his espresso and he's now in the dungeons of the, of the emperor. They all saw him do it and they would never waste it. It was also in a paper cup. That paper cup took energy to make and he threw it in the trash. I saw him do it. I saw Caliban throw his espresso in the trash. That's what we just started doing, go to coffee shops, order a drink to go and after you get it, look at it for a little bit and say, could you throw this away for me? It's a great art experiment. Oh my God. You know what I was thinking about doing for real is hiring homeless people to, giving them a bunch of cash to go on to really high-end businesses and buy the products. Wow. And just see what happens or go to a place that has like the signs that talk about not turning away. People of any, any gender or race or ethnicity, it's like, I bet you're going to turn away to this person. Seeing what the limits are to that, like, like a werewolf. Yeah, basically. Or would they turn away if I had the money to put someone in like a hardcore werewolf for aesthetics. Like a realistic werewolf going to a fucking Italian restaurant. I'm pointing to the sign. Oh my fucking God, that would be amazing. And then the next day, no werewolves on this sign. Yes, no werewolves. We've got to get rid of that sign or at least change it a little bit. Are you mocking this by putting werewolves on this? Yeah. There's no such thing as werewolves. We had one here yesterday. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. Like the, the, the. You were saying something about Alice, but. Ah, what, the, the, the, yeah, the addictive mind and it's insane. Next, anytime you hear yourself trying to rationalize doing an addictive thing, but try, I was talking to a friend the other day and he was like, talking about some city and he was mentioning, you know, one of his friends out there is having a little bit of a booze problem and I was like, uh, you know, he's like, I'm like, well, you know, you got to stop the booze. If you, if you're having any, any problem you're having in your life. Socially in your jobs or whatever it may be. If you're drinking every night, then that's why you're having the problem. Yeah, probably. Or anything that's like that. And he's sort of a real generic, easily available salve is always a good thing to cut out, but you know, you know, I'm talking about though, like when you run into like a hardcore drinker who's trying to decode why their life is falling apart, like, I just don't know what it is, man. I, I, I'm, I'm trying really hard. Um, I'll get another whiskey, ginger. I, it's just the, it just seems like, I don't know, maybe I'm not made for this city. I'll get another whiskey, you know what I mean? You're like, you're in drinking every night. You don't know what you, you don't know. Like you have no idea what is causing your problems until you take away. It's like someone on fire being like, man, I've got the worst poison IV and I just don't know what to do about it. I just need to, I think I just need to have some more fire. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what it is. I keep setting myself a place anyway, man, the, the, to get back to it. Um, do you think that it is inauthentic to express gentleness, compassion and kindness when you are filled with frustration and rage? Inauthentic. You mean like not like addressing how you feel, like not sort of feeling how you feel? No, you still, you feel it, right? But like you're, you know, for example, like you're just in a bad mood, right? The, your gut biome is shit and fucking demon eggs and it's getting into your consciousness and you're just in a bad mood and you don't feel good. And you feel like unhappy with your situation in life, you know, wait, you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, right? What, what's better to be like, express that grumpiness as so many do, you know what I mean? Which is the worst when, you know, the person rolls and passing it on, you know, passing on the shit. People trying to imagine that they could be like, Hey, you know, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. So look out for me today. You know, I kind of woke up on the wrong side of the bed. So I'm going to be telling it like it is today. Just, you know, I'm in a fucking bad mood, man, to try to rationalize their anger addiction by saying, like, you know, I woke up on the, I woke up on the bad side of the wrong side of the bed. So I'm going to treat you like Trump. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that shit. That's right. It's, but they, if you were to go to them and say, what are you doing? You're being addicted to everybody. They would be like, I'm just being who I am. Or, you know what, look, are you serious? Open up your eyes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that kind of thing. If you're not angry, you're not listening, you're not being addicted. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't think it's, I mean, inauthentic, I don't think so. I mean, it's like that thing where that's the hardest thing to do, right? It's to be, okay, I feel like shit, but I need to realize that and not feel like shit because it's just going to cause more. It's like a snow, it's like a snow, it's like a magnet. There's the polarities off. And if you have that, you just end up attracting more, more of the same. If you, if you do that, whereas if, I mean, I don't know, I guess I, I felt that way a ton of times, I think I fooled myself into thinking I was being otherwise. But if I do something as simple as just biking for like 15 minutes, and then I go someplace, all of a sudden I see all this stuff, I'm like, oh, that's hilarious. Look at that. Right. Like you see stuff that just, it's like, you get like little doses of novelty for free because you're not looking for it so much. You're just open to, I don't know. I always, this is the most primitive example of it, but like I tend to be in a hurry a lot, like a rush things a lot. I think it comes from having a bowel disease. There's something about like linked with those because if you have a bowel disease, you tend to have to go to the bathroom a lot. So either are in a rush to get to the bathroom because you don't shoot your pants or you're in the bathroom. So you are not present socially for something. So I feel like I'm missing out. So it's like, Hey, what are you guys talking about? That kind of thing. So I think a lot of times I'm in a hurry and anxious to not miss out on things or just that general feeling of rushness or hurriedness or whatever you want to call it. And so a lot of times I'll just be that way in daily life. Even though I don't, I'm not feeling bad physically. And a lot of times it's like a thing where, let's say you go to a business, like a coffee shop, right? And you get there and you're like in a rush to get your coffee because you got to be someplace. It always seems like to me, if I'm in a rush when I get there, there's a line. But if I'm real casual, I'm just like, Oh, this is great to be here. I'm super happy. I walk up there. I'm the first person there and I turn behind me and there's 15 people behind me. Like you get line luck. Right. Where it's like that thing where if you're not in a hurry, you get, if you're not rushing things, you're being in the moment, you get a little bit of grace. You get divine grace gifted upon you for, it's like a little gift. I got you. Oh yeah. Well, God, I've got this embarrassing theory on that right now, which is that it's not only, it's not like, um, it's that you're doing navigation that you're literally navigating through the multiverse and the onion skin layers. Makes sense. So the, the consciousness of relaxing and gentleness, it's like changing the sales on your boat and you start sailing into a different, a non-aggressive universe, the, the aggressive universe that many of us are familiar with. You're going to get backstabbed. You're going to get embarrassed. You're going to get fucked over. You're not going to have enough money. You're going to be hurt. You're going to be, you know, of course that universe is going to trigger all kinds of aggression and squeezing too hard to shift. It's that over-exerting. Yeah. You're over-exerting and you try too hard. The thing doesn't happen, but when you just sort of, can you coax it? I mean, it's the same thing as yelling at the dog instead of it's quicker. It's faster to say, get the fuck in here. But it, it doesn't work as well as inside. It takes you longer, but you save time, even though it takes, it's like that weird coefficient where the thing that takes, uh, takes longer works better because actually you have to do the other thing so many more times. And the other thing fucking hurts PS. Like if you're really getting mad, it's really exhausting. Like, Oh, anger is the most exhausting thing ever. Yeah. It's crazy how sometimes you can, you can like a little sneak up on me too. I'm like, why am I so fucking tired? Oh, it's because I'm holding on to trying to be serious. Yeah. I'm trying to be, I'm trying to be a serious guy. I'm a serious guy. Take me seriously. Uh, excuse me. Um, I'm, I'm serious. I'm, uh, excuse me, status. Excuse me. That. Oh God, it's so fucking exhausting. It is. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is like why vacations are a waste of time. It's like this fucking myth of the vacation is one of the most tragic, catastrophic, uh, formations in capitalism. It's a fucking genius idea. By Satan. By, yeah, the satanic imperialists, they figured it out, man. Yeah. They fucking crack. That's like the gen, the vacations are truly the genius code of the, I mean, if you want to be like really conspiratorial, I feel like that, I think in some sense, um, certain ideas that the existence of pervasive racism could be linked to, if you want to be really conspiratorial, but that is like a, an Illuminati agenda. God, I think I've become so dark in satanic that I feel the necessity to kind of be like, you know, number one, I don't think it's fair to call the imperialist satanists. I think it's more likely that they are Christian or some kind of offshoot of Christianity or some other religion, unknown religion. Yeah. But I don't think they're the most forms of satanism. It would be fair to call them that. And then number two, I don't think the Illuminati would be hoodwinking people into vacations necessarily as much as like, but then I don't know. That's my, I have a different version of the Illuminati. There's different versions. But let's invent a name for this group. Like the order of, I don't know, what's some cool David Ike name for it. I don't know. Comet, uh, Comet ping pong pizza. David Ike. Yeah. What would be, I don't know, you could say reptilian instead of, cause reptilian implies kind of a nefarious thing as opposed to Illuminati. Okay. So let's call him Illuminati is like illuminated reptilians. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a reptilian agenda. Okay. Let's talk about the reptiles. So you're saying the reptilians are luring humans to like Hawaii to vacate, to vacation spots, the places that cost a ton of money that, um, don't provide any actual respite from the things that they're leaving. And also the idea, like the, um, the, the cable news cycles, like both, both sides of the cable news, like left and right, anything they say is to drum up a sort of, um, antagonism for the other. The idea that everyone is, there's all these others, like, Oh, they're trying to dig this from you. Oh, they, they don't like you. They hate you. When I think your average person doesn't really care. Isn't really, most people are not plugged into news as much as we, you and I think, I think, or we're not, the people we're surrounded with, at least in probably Los Angeles and other cities, people are more news conscious. Fixated. Right. They're so fixated in that quote unquote bubble kind of thing. So they feel there's like that sort of, um, that megaphone that's screaming, Oh, this happened. They, he said this, he said, they did that. They did this thing. And so you, you're so aware of otherness that you can't, you can't stop. You realize that everyone is a human. And the fact that someone is scan is colors different than you, that they have make less money than you, or they, um, make more money than you, or they have a different, they speak a different language. We're all, we're, we're linked by things that are so much more fundamental than those things. If, if you meet, if two people who are, two people were fucking hardcore metal heads, they have way more in common with each other than almost any sort of physical characteristic you could say. Sure. You could, and so that, that to me, uh, that's what I feel like is nefarious in terms of like the quote unquote reptilian overlords. They are, you create this thing to create division in like the, uh, the populace and they're the general division entertainment. Yeah. It's like entertainment that's based on blowing the fires of, uh, selfishness and division and then this can you fear other people, which produces aggression, which produces news. So kind of like, if you want to create that kind of news, you need to break, keep breaking people up into, into like this side and that side. Cause by breaking people, if you don't do that, cause it's kind of like to get back to your, the original insect conversation, the drones, you know, the taking over insects and hacking into their, uh, nervous system, so to speak, to like fulfill the nefarious needs of someone controlling the insect. I don't, it's clear to me that human beings are a hive of primate, you know, or whatever you want to cause. I guess you'd cause primates, right? A primate, so we're an advanced, we're a primate hive. And, you know, I saw this hilarious news story popped up. I guess some bees used plastic to make a beehive, right? And the news story was like, this is so sad. And it's like, mother, it's not as fucking red. It's red and PS mother fucker. We'll look at all of us. That's what we're doing. Bees are just doing what we do. But regardless, we are building our hive out of technology. We take fundamental elements and we transform them into technology. And then we live inside our technology and that's what we do. And the whole planet is covered in us. We've burrowed into literally every square foot almost of land on the planet outside of that covered with water. And we're transforming that land into technology and we nest inside of it. And then within this nesting process, um, we have these very interesting what seems to be as a bee expert, I studied PS when I was getting my PhD in Buddhism from the university of pro science, I minored in bee studies. So I know a lot. I have a PhD in bee studies. I got a PhD in buzz. You getting buzzed? Oh, just that's what. Oh, the buzz. Oh, yeah, yeah, I got, I didn't, I didn't know you're a bee man. Yeah. But the fucking it, so now we have this name for a certain type of person. We call them an influencer. Oh, yeah. So a beehive, I think most hives have a controller queen and she releases pheromones that produce changes in the patterns of the bees and will actually cause bees to be calmer, turn bees aggressive. So similarly, we have these things called influencers in this unacknowledged super advanced primate hive made of technology. And these influencers send out their weird digital signals that cause ripples in the hive and these ripples can create massive changes in the hive from like fashion changes. Suddenly everybody's getting their haircut a certain way. Everyone's wearing these types of clothes. Everyone's using a certain type of slang to like World War two, right? Well, where suddenly everyone's like, you know, dressing the same fucking way and killing each other and grinding each other up. That's what we're fucking in right now. When the news, you could look at the news or any kind of massive signal as being the bee, the queen bee that's sending out these signals into the hive. And right now we are all taking it in as though it were real and not understanding that we're just essentially inhaling a kind of data pheromone, which is hacking our nervous system and causing us to become slaves to corporations. Oh, yeah, which is what we're doing, right? That seems to be what's happening. Yeah, it's that's we really put it. That's great. We put it because it makes people. It just puts you at such dis-ease. And it's it's not, I don't want to say natural because it's like, it's a catch all, but it's the thing where, I don't know, it kind of seems like people's people's like almost like their brains are hijacked in a sense, because when we talked with this before, how the the scientists who work at Facebook, which owns Instagram, they studied all this, the same science that people who build casinos, the same people, Skinner, BF Skinner, behaviorism. Yeah, they know exactly how to hack the human brain and they designed the programs based upon those ideas. So Facebook and Instagram are built the same way a slot machine is built. The same type of sounds and triggers to initiate these like micro dopamine responses to cause you to be invested in the thing. They know that and it's like that thing in Jurassic Park where, what's his name, the doc with Jeff Goldman's character is like, you're so obsessed if you could make dinosaurs, you didn't stop me thinking, if you should, that's like the same thing with fate with those guys. They did that and you can extrapolate that to any kind of any sort of news organization, these media companies, they're so good at inserting an idea into people's heads that we don't even know and people don't know until it's too late. And it's such a, they're so good at controlling, not controlling, but causing people to feel a certain way. Yeah, disease and that's why all this election stuff is just so maddening. What do you mean? Because everyone is so keyed up on it and it's ramping up even more. Right, well, I mean, so yeah, this is the great show of the government which has been putting on this show every four years. And the show has many different characters in it, but the essence of the thing, the show, the moral of the show or the story of the show is without us, y'all are fucked, you need us. And it's always the fate of the planet is at stake every fucking four years. Oh yeah, oh my God, oh my God. Every fucking four years is just a desperate and true or not or whatever. It's really no different from your worst friend. You know what I'm talking about, which is like inevitably you will have a person in your life if you're not careful and you're not discerning who is not experiencing the normal kind of trouble and drama that all of us are experiencing just from existing on the planet, but who has devised a never ending cycle of catastrophe to suck the attention of their social group to them so that everyone is constantly tending to their self-inflicted wounds. It happens a lot with really famous actors sometimes. Though you'll see people who are, they're creating like intense amounts of drama on set just because they're fucking bored and they're really smart, but they're not smart enough to realize that they're doing this thing. They're basically just creating a problem because they feed off of drama. Yeah. And if they're not acting, they have to be acting in something. So you make like a fucking side play, which is you demanding something and then it's just that sort of thing. Yeah, that kind of thing is cool sometimes. It's like a funny play to watch, like holy shit, she's crazy. Because she won't let this little thing becomes this massive drama. Yeah, it's like you're inventing a problem. Well, yeah, they're putting on a show. Yeah. And some people are so good at putting on the show that they become not just like run-of-the-mill assholes, they become profound assholes. So, yeah. That's not even profound assholes. Yeah, yeah, there's like a profundity to their assholery where you're like, oh my God, you rarely run into this level of idiot. Like this is a pure, hypnotic, A-grade asshole. It's like that character in, was it Royal Tannenbombs? The one that Bill Murray's character is studying this, I think his name is Dudley or something like that. He's like a nerdy kid with glasses and he's like a psychological anomaly. And he's presenting them in front of these psychologists and they keep asking him questions and say, can Dudley tell time? And he goes, oh, oh no. Like always doing things, but he can read a watch, right? Oh yeah. Like he's this way, but not that way. He's like this, he's a freak of nature because of all these very specific contradictions. Yeah, that's it. It's like a non-funny version of that. Yeah, that's it. And they're all out there and like if you end up like caught in the web of one of these things, if they won't let you go, like they can hold on to you. It's like the ultimate cinematic example of this, just watched it, Lethal Attraction. Lethal Attraction? Is that new? Fatal Attraction. Fatal Attraction. Lethal Attraction. That's an old movie, right? Old. Glenn Close, what's his name from Wall Street, Fatim does the best impression of him. Michael Douglas. Michael Douglas. Have you seen this movie? I haven't seen it. I think I have never seen it before. Please watch it. Okay. Can I spoil it for a little bit? You can't spoil a movie. You will know. Have a good movie. Thank you. That's an actor. That's someone who's like a professional actor who knows movie. I agree with you 100%. But those of you who haven't seen the movie who want to like watch it and get freaked out, skip the next like, I don't know how, just go watch it and come back. But so basically this guy, the worst nightmare happens to him, which is that his wife goes on vacation, he has an affair, has sex with Glenn Close, and they basically have like a two day fling, right? And so he is way too cocky, so self absorbed. It seems like he's not even considering the damage he could do to his family, whatever. But it isn't a morality. It's not like, it's not like, I don't know, they do a really good job. It's more a thriller, right? Yeah, it's a thriller. Anyway, the dude ends up having a two day fling with a fucking crazy hot sex that only Michael Douglas can have in a movie that came out in the 80s. You know what I mean? Like sink sex, like flash dance, 80s style sex, like fucking against the sink. Oh, just crazy. You know, anyway, he needs to go home and he's like, okay, that's it. They did this two days in a row. And she's like, you're not going home. She like gets violent for a second. And then essentially ends up, and this is where I stopped spoiling it, cutting her wrist. Oh, okay. So now he's got to deal with the fact that she's self harming and realizing, and he's like, you knew I had a, Mary, you knew this, and she's like, what did I know? What do you think I knew? Don't do this. Why do you do that? And he's like, oh no, oh no, oh no, I'm fucked. So anyway, what I'm saying is that's a hyper example of this type of not just individual, but this type of parasitic control based entity, which is that it has to have your attention. And if it doesn't, it'll either hurt you or hurt itself. And so this is the news. This is the government. This is the world that we're in is our shadows have grown into these control based mega political structures that are constantly trying to get us to come into the house, not in the way you were talking about doing it in a sweet way, but using fear, trying to control us through terrifying us, trying to control us by getting us on the hook and giving us this sense that without them, we're done. If you, but yeah, but making teams, you got to make teams. If you want to, if you want to control the board, first you need a board, then you need pieces, then you need sides, they also have to make up like, oh, this is a game, but this isn't a fucking game. This is the state. You have to make the stakes. The stakes have to be super high, even though when really they're not like everyone's the same. Civilization depends depends on you voting for Joe Biden. If you don't vote for Joe Biden, the world will end, the world will fall into the sun. You know that guy? Uh, that's a Trump guy. You fucking, you talk to him? Yeah. Right. Right. Uh, yeah. I mean, you, you didn't fucking kill him like that. That sort of crazy thing where, or even both any side, any direction of the whole, like being compassionate to someone who is clearly suffering as well. Yeah. And what's that Mark Twain thing? I don't know. Something about who, who weeps for the devil or something about like the idea of the devil deserves our prayers more than anybody. Yeah. Yeah. And also that's, you know, I think I love Mark, Mark, what's so funny is Mark Twain has like 90 quotes about the devil, which is so fucking cool. For atheists, the world's most famous atheists. Yeah. Yeah. Cranky fucking Satan quotes. What are your top three favorite, I don't want to get back to this, but do you have to have a top three favorite Mark Twain quotes? Um, I feel like I can't even think of them all. There's so, there's so many good ones. I think about, wow, I can't think of any of the actual quotes. I just always think about like different stories, little stories. Sucking mucus out of a blister, or how does he put it? It's actually to suck upon the blister of a wounded ape is to taste something about the Pope. Oh, the Pope's dick. Yeah. He said, if you want to know what the Pope's dick tastes like, suck on the blister of a wounded ape. Yeah. That's a great one. I like a cigar, a cigar, smoke it all you want. But when it comes down to it, we're all going to die in a forest fire. Yeah. That's a fucking powerful twain quote. Right. Oh yeah. A hatchet on neck, wait, a hatchet on, when the hatchet's on your neck. A funny friend you'll find in a fly. Flight. Flight, a funny friend, a funny friend a fly becomes that lays eggs in your, wait, no, it's, I know the one you're, this is, poor hat, poor honey in a hatchet wound and friends you will make. Yes, that's it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The sounds are real, but unmistakable to fake. God, he was such a great poet. What's your favorite Mark Twain poem? It's probably the cancer dancer. How does it go? Find me a lance, show me a window, I'll be there, I think I have to look it up. I'll say, yeah. I mean, if you mind if I look like that, here it is. Yeah. We're going to cut to commercial. Okay.

Pull another. I love poetry. Okay, pull another one. This is a great one. This is one that was attributed to someone else, but I think the archeologist find it was actually him. You're running. You're running. You're going real fast. Stand down quickly and check out your ass. If you're dripping a drip drop and it leaves in a flash, it might be a worm tied to you like a sash. Oh, dither, oh, splither, oh, splatter, it matter. Dump a bucket of water on your head like a clatter, dumpling, dundan, ruffle, cripple, crane, crow. These are a bunch of words that nobody knows. It's the water in your boot that sloshes aside you. You've got a good chance of hiding a cider. Put a bold nail in the back of a bud, and you'll find a flower that blooms inside of a spud. Oh, potato, potato, potato, potato. Drop me in the water and I'll fillato on a donkey's old circumcised riding inside a rail. The train pulls up and out pops a pail. Throw in a bucket, call it a hole, call it a little boy's mind. You'll be back again. You'll be back again, and this time you'll find. God damn, man. You know why that's making me tear up? Why? I'll tell you why, because my grandfather, I remember we would have these family funerals, what he called them, and he would go out in the woods, find an animal, paw some, rodent, kill it, and then do these beautiful funeral services for the animal. Oh, that's cool. We used to call them artificial funerals. They're real funerals if you killed the creature. These weren't, by the way, for the animal rights people out there. We lived next to one of those pet cemeteries, so these had already been buried and had come back. They were re-risen and he killed them. Re-animated. Okay, re-animated. Yeah, because this was back when there was way more pet cemeteries out there, and this was that time when cats started figuring out that you could kill a bird and then bury it and it would come back and you could kill it again. Oh, because it multiplies. It just comes back to life. Yeah, it multiplies, though. There's two. That's why they did it. Oh, yeah, right, right. The whole saying, a bird in the hand beats two in the bush? Oh, got it. It's actually that. That saying was actually the wrong way. It's a bird in the bush, two birds in the bush beats one in the hand, because those two bushes, those two birds in the bush will become four. Right, yeah. That was a fucked up time, man. It was just the demon bird swarms were picking babies apart. You'd put your baby down on a blanket, go to take a piss. You'd come back, bleached bones. I'm talking about Pecker's wreck. Yeah, Pecker's wreck of the 1800s. That was a heavy time. That Mark Twain said that that time was one of the definitive moments or times that inspired us. So many great artists were inspired by that, because you just didn't know. Yeah, a lot of people said they felt like it was a thousand years long, even though it was only a year that all these poets and artists who lived there who was like, I swear to God, this has been happening for almost a thousand years. Why am I still alive? People stopped aging because it was something with the birds. When the birds did Pecker's wreck on a child, they stole time and caused, it was like this sort of cyclical vampiric action that happened from the birds causing the people who were currently alive to basically exist on a loop for a thousand years. And I can't remember what broke Pecker's wreck, but so I mean. What broke Pecker's wreck was they shut down the pet cemeteries. The thing was, there was a time when having a pet cemetery near your house was like an American tradition. And also, this was before the corruption of the soil, so the soil was getting corrupted. So people were like, oh, the dog comes back after dying. This was all to the earth. And it's a little grumpy, but it's not dangerous. But then the more people kept using the cemeteries, the more corrupted the creatures became until bam, suddenly. And then the cats figured this shit out. Now the cats start burying these birds, killing the demonic birds that would come out the next day. Now you've got, like it's not just humans burying the animals they love. It's predatory cats, many of them who had been buried. Oh, that was crippler's dip. No, that was Pecker's wreck. But Pecker's wreck, I thought crippler's dip ended Pecker's wreck? Pecker's dip is the name of the conditions preceding the great Pecker's wreck bird plague. So what about Dipper's delight? Dipper's delight was the joy when people realized that there was a way to fix the problem. Like, people were fucking panicking, man. Babies' bones were being stripped from their bodies. They were, their brains sucked out of their eyes. Cats were burying dead demon birds to resurrect them for hunting fun, I guess. But simultaneously, we're causing, anyway, yeah, it was Dipper's delight was when... That's when they delighted when the end of Pecker's wreck happened. Yeah, when it finally stopped. Wow. How did they stop Pecker's wreck? They shut down the pet cemeteries. Wasn't there a name for that? It was called the Great Shutting. Oh, was that the same as Budger's ledge? No, Budger's ledge, that happened like 50 years later. That was that whole fucking thing with the goddamn possum. I was confused. I was conflate Budger's ledge with Cricker's dick. Cricker, that I could see because Cricker's dick is that's the war that happened with the king of the possums. Yeah, the possum king. Which, by the way, was what the fucking nutty thing about that was just to even discover that possums were living in a monarchy was like... What's that? That possum's name? God, what was his name? The commander? Oh, Gandy Horfish. Gandy Horfish. Yeah, Gandy Horfish. Gandy Horfish was the only one. Wasn't there another one? I can't remember. Peter. Peter Angel Touch. Yeah. Peter Angel Touch. Yeah, that was General Peter Angel Touch. General Peter Angel Touch. General Peter Angel Touch. You're talking about Penal Angel Touch. I don't know about Peter Angel Touch. General Penal Angel Touch is my favorite porn star. You're talking about... General Peter Angel Touch is not the same as General Penal Angel Touch? Listen, a General Penal Angel Touch is actually really good for your health. I think you're thinking of Gentle Penal Angel Touch. Yeah, Gentle Penal... Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, General... There's Gentle Penal Angel Touch, General Penal Angel Touch, General Peter Angel Touch, and Gentle Peter Angel Touch. Well, let's talk about Gentle Penal Angel Touch. Okay. Because this is like one of the... There's centers all over the country. Yeah. And to get back to the original subject of aggression... That's where chakra comes from. What? Isn't this where chakra comes from? Chakra therapy. Yeah. So I want to get to the essence of, I think, to really bring out the sweet essence of what we talked about today. They're going to use nanobots to control bugs. Yeah. They're using mimetic nanobots to control the minds of most people. Mimetic is a meme. Yeah, mimetic is a meme. So many of us don't realize that we're very similar to a little mosquito that's been turned into a drone, only we're not filming or gathering audio data. We're just going around shitting out, vomiting out device of information, which is creating a kind of aggressive feeling, which is really just the byproduct of a fear state everyone's in, because they think that we're in the middle of a zombie invasion. And we've forgotten that we're just human beings who all share a common desire to feel OK. And this is producing aggression. The antidote for their aggression is not what many people think, to drink, to be angry, to throw things, to bomb things. The cure for this aggression is 100% of the time gentle, penal, anal touching. Yeah. Penal anal touch. And it can go, sex is gender is irrelevant. Has nothing to do with it. Penal anal, gentle, penal anal touch, yeah. Sex has nothing to do with it. So it's like, if you are in a monogamous relationship, for example, in this case, you can allow your penis, if you are a male, you could pull your penis down and give it a gentle press against the anus. And if you are someone who is not in a close proximity of a penis, you can just use something shaped like a penis. It's not. Shaped like a penis, or you can hire a penis, a penis simulator. Penal ping is great. I have a Penal Ping app on my phone. Just ping, and it just tells you where it's at. I use the Penal Ping app on the, what's it called? CRISPR? Yeah, CRISPR's Penal Ping app. Yeah. But yeah, the point of this, if you're feeling bad, chances are you haven't pushed your penis against your anus in a while. Think about it, in all series, this was the last time you pulled your penis back and tried to push it into your anus. It's been a while. I've definitely talked, I've done a talk and run, but I've never done a talk and push. I went jogging with a full tuck in the mountain. You have to do the trail running, because if you trail run with a full tuck, that allows you, the angle allows your thighs not to sweep past the shaft so aggressively. Whoa. If you do a flat land run, it's going to be hard. No shit. Yeah. Well, some people do it to stretch their penis out, to give it a longer dick. It's a therapy, you do a full tuck. That works? Yeah, you just have to switch balls. What do you do again? You have to do a full tuck. You switch which side of the balls your penis is on every mile. Okay, I have one ball. Well, you have a false ball? I didn't get a prosthetic. Yeah. Well, you know what? You'll be okay. I think it's not so much about the width of the balls, because you think about the balls are dangling. So the penis is going around the part above the balls. It's more just to give it a slight direction, right or left. So you'd wrap around the balls to the full tuck, you go running, and the action of your thighs bristling, rubbing against the penal shaft causes it to stretch, and it makes you have a longer dick. Holy shit, how long are you? Like, if you don't mind me asking, how many inches of you? Oh, I stopped. I got too long. What? I had to do reverse therapy. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, I just didn't like it. My pants didn't fit. I have a lot of pants. I have a lot of pants I like. Cargo shorts? I don't do shorts. I couldn't do shorts. You couldn't do cargo shorts that go to your knees. It got that long. Yeah, and I was like, if I was that long, what am I going to do? If I wore briefs, it's just like this sort of insect, like snake coil, like a what's that called? Citronella bug candle, like Italian sausage that comes in a spiral. I know what you're saying. I've got good fellas. Everything good fellas? A meat coil. Yeah, meat coil and good fellas. They're grilling it in the background. It looks really good. It's a spicy Italian sausage. It's a delicious dish. That's one of my favorite part of good fellas. It might have been Donnie Brasco. Either way, it was one of those Italian mob movies. They're cooking a big spiral sausage in the background. It was in Teen Wolf 3. Remember when the werewolf won the Italian restaurant and ordered the meat coil? The big spiral meat coil. It looks like a citronella thing used to burn in the 90s. It was a little thing made by art. So you had to coil your dick every day. I don't like doing it. How long did that take? Oh, minutes. But that wasn't the time. It was the look. But you must have known when you're doing these exercises as it's getting stretched out that. Duncan, I mean, you'd be surprised at things that we, as people, have cognitive dissonance about. And definitely, penal stretching in that format is definitely something that I was a victim. Of what? What do you mean, you weren't a victim? It's an online course that I signed up for. You're saying that you victimized yourself by stretching your fucking penis out? It was a multi-level marketing corporation. What? Yeah. So this had something to do with the amwayers? Oh, you're, oh. Dr. Abram Cable Weiss. I got you. So you were sending people to some bullshit doctor to get their penis stretched out? Yeah, and he's just a therapist. He just measures it. And it's like I was a team leader, so I had to have the longest dick. And that was the thing. What was the benefit of that outside of the obvious? Oh, we'd be vacationing in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Juneau, Alaska in the summer. What did the doctor would take you? They encouraged us to take these lavish vacations to show live your best life thing with the penal enhancement. And so we'd be out there taking these massive pictures of our penises and align like a bunch of snakes. Is this pre-Instagram? This is about five months ago. I have a new account now, but this was a big thing. It was a multi-level marketing corporation. The SEC has been all over it, but it's a thing that he's just so slippery. And I'm out of it, thankfully. Are you OK? Is your penis OK? Yeah, it's still really long and huge and wide. But I'm getting back to a place with a more sustainable penis growth in length. God, man, I'm sorry that happened to you. Yeah, it's rough. But it's hard having a massive cock that big. I've heard that. It's actually a real burden. I've heard that. Yeah, I've heard that it's like actually only because, and this is one of these weird synchronicities that I love that happen on the podcast, shared mine, whatever. I fucking was going to read because I knew you're bringing in your twain stuff. I was going to read a Mark Twain poem. Oh, my God. And you're going to this is going to blow your fucking mind when you hear what it's about. Coiled like fire. My breeches extend. I'm laying in my pyre. And yet there is no end. Crickle, crackle goes the flames. My shirt burns away. My boots burn in two. And at last my breeches flay. And there before my family near those I love and those I hate, uncoiled my massive sausage spear. And they at last knew what sealed my fate. This coil of meat that hung so far. It dragged upon the weeds. And there within a snake it sprung. And that snake ended me. Mark Twain. What a seer. S-E-E-R. What a freaking seer. Yeah. Sweet Jiminy Jackson. Jesus, crippling Christ. He just symbolized the whole fucking thing. Because right there it's like not only it's clear he's talking about, you know, what everybody's going through, which is the fucking pets or cemeteries, or over-flooded, over-flooding, over-flooding with birds. They're over-flooded from Pecker's wreck. But back then, man, that was the time when everyone's dick was like, that was like it would go down to your foot. That was before the Great Shrinking. They don't talk about that in the history books. They don't want you to know it. It's classic control, controlling of information. They say this is why they're actually why they're trying to get rid of some of the fucking statues. It's because if you go and look, you'll see that like... The dickhead is at the bottom of the pant. Always. And it's a little peaker. Go look at the base of Mount Rushmore. Have you ever looked? Do you know what's down there? Looks like a bunch of snakes hiding in a bush. What's a giant snake hiding in a bush? It's hands down. This is another reason. P.S., by the way, this is one of the conspiracy theories about ISIS destroying all those fucking ancient statues. Because they don't want people to know. Because that's the other thing, is the penis used to have two holes. It doesn't make sense to pee out of the same hole you ejaculated out of. No, it's disgusting. Yeah. So they used to have two. And now we have one. I don't know. When did that happen? I don't do. Exactly. I mean, no one will tell you. You're not going to hear about it because no one fucking knows. And I'm not going to get into the whole thing of like our histories being changed in some way, shape, or form. Revisionist. I don't know. But I do know this. For sure there was a time when semen was produced in the heart. And that if you weren't in love, your heart would not produce semen. And there was no way to make a baby. Make a baby. Not baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Yeah. Maybe they would come on your baby. But then it moved down to the balls. And now you can come any which way you feel. That's where they have little sayings about the home is where the heart is. It's not about your heart beating. It's, you know, it's home is where you open your heart, open your heart, open your heart, and the truth will find you. Heartache is a headache without the love. Heart beats twice. Eyes blink once. I've got a heart on and a heart on. That's a classic Emily Dickinson style slurred verse that changed into something else. Those were the days back in the day. Emily Dickinson, she knew about it. And I'll tell you this, man, I don't give a shit that I have a micro penis. I don't give a shit that my penis is tiny and I have one ball. It's proud. I'm proud of it. But I, and I, and unfortunately, there would be no way for me to do the exercises that you're talking about because it doesn't extend down that far. Try a Pickler's Prank. What's that? It's where you put a bunch of pickle juice on your loins that's been highly fermented and it causes a sort of a dysplasia in the cells due to the bacterial presence. As long as you can get a little bit of stretch of that. You're not still in that group, are you, Johnny? No, I'm, I, I just know some, there's a little bit of tether. It's hard to, it's hard to leave. So let me ask, is there a place I could maybe go to learn more about this prank that you're talking about? You could go, it's a dark website only. So you have to download Tor Browser. And to know how to use a Tor Browser. And once you do, if you just ask anyone- Hang on, hold on, we're going to cut to commercial, okay. Have you been feeling down? Sometimes do you wonder if you're Jesus? Is there an air of sickness in your house? Do you smell the stink of bodies where bodies there are not? Yes, ma'am. You may be suffering from Canberra syndrome. Canberra syndrome can easily be treated by a simple combing of the chest hair or an re-implantation of chest hair into your neck, back, and under pits. I feel great. We're back. Oh wow, we're back. Okay, one last thing, I know we've been here for a while. And now we're going to jump out of serious talk and we're going to jump into back to comedy. Okay. How different is the Johnny Pemberton who walks around in the real world that we all know and the Johnny Pemberton at home? Oh man, I'm just a real homebody. Honestly, I'm kind of a nerd. When I'm at home, I'm probably just trying to find time to crack a book. Yeah. I like to read, this is so embarrassing, but I like to collect the dictionaries. I collect dictionaries, but this is even more embarrassing. I'm probably reading Harry Potter or I'm probably reading the Tolkien books about the Hobbits. I like this. You know what, I like to, I like microwave popcorn in a good movie. It's surprising to hear it, Johnny, you have not only been part of this strange, penile, extending cult, but also you got a little bit of trouble because you apparently had a sex cult. Do you want to talk about that for a second? Do I want to talk about it or can I talk about it? Can you talk about it? I want to talk about it, but I can't. I can make allusions to it, but I mean, anything that you want to know, it's out there. You just got to read between the lines. Wait, but you have the whole amphitheater orgy thing where people are carrying you around on that massive sausage cart? That was more of a food addiction I was dealing with. Wait, hold on, no, no, no. I've seen the leaked videos. You're wearing a crown. You're wearing a crown of sausages. Yeah, you're wearing a cape made of sausages. Yeah, it's a full spiral. It's very thick, very heavy, very hot. You're riding a cart made of sausages that are being held by naked men and women who are weeping. Well, they aren't wearing a translucent pork intestine. So they're not naked, naked, but you can see everything. They are wearing, you know how sausage has a casing, they're essentially wearing sausage casing. So what, they're wearing a see-through sausage dress. Hey, I'm just telling you the truth. Listen, I'm not saying, by the way, like, doing those kinds of things is wrong, but there's some scandals in there. People are saying that your sausages were tainted. What do you have to say to that? I say, show me the tainted sausage. Tell it to the judge. Bring me what it is you think is wrong and we'll deal with it on a personal level. I'm not going to try to solve everyone's problem here right now, try to unsolve every individual concern with my sexual sausage, whatever you want to call it. I can't do that. I respect everyone enough. I'm sorry. I've already made a public apology about this. We thought I'd talk about this at length and I went on, I made the circuit and apologized. So now, if you got a problem, we'll talk about it in person. I just, that's what I'm going to say. You heard it here, folks. Johnny Pemberton, he'll talk to you about it in person. Where can people find you in person? They can find me at any given cafe on any Monday throughout the city. I'm on a quest to hit everyone. Otherwise you can find me probably writing the train system. San Bernardino is a good place to start. One last question. I promise I wouldn't go into this area and I'm very sorry to your publicist, Mary, over there. I'm sorry, please don't be mad, but this is my job. I'm a journalist. One second. Yeah, I know. He knows. He knows that. That's fine. That's fine. Thank you. Thank you. According to you, you no longer go into the series of caves that you burrowed underneath large portions of the San Fernando Valley. Now, reports have come in. I saw the TMZ footage. It's blurry, but it does look a lot like you. Somebody that looked just like you was spotted burrowing down into your sausage labyrinth. Did you run a confirmation bias? You know what that means? No, what is that? Confirmation bias is when one thing is right, so you think everything else is right. Just because it looks like me doesn't mean it is. Ergo hawk, proctor hawk. What is that? Ad hominem hawkter ergo. Okay. If this is that, then that is therefore that as well. I don't think so. I don't know. This is a classic straw man fallacy. No, I don't think so. Yes, it is. There's a video of you that looks just like you going down into your caves, and you know what happened down in those fucking caves. You know what happened. Just admit it. You're going back in there. I could be. What's the point of admitting it at this point? Because you swore to all of us, listen, let me tell you something. You meant something to me, man. I went to your shows, I loved them, I loved your music, I loved your backup band, I loved your merch, I loved your songs, I shared your music with many of my lovers. That music is still real? You humiliated me. Just because I'm a, one of those caves doesn't mean that anything I did is any, it doesn't retroactively affect that. No, it's not that you went into the fucking caves, it's what you did in those fucking caves. Listen, man, it's fucked. You know it's fucked. You know what you did. Why were you laying in that muck? Why did you allow yourself to be rolled and coiled in all of those fucking sausage coils? Why were you fucking living like that? Why weren't you making music? I had to take time off. I had to take time off and remember why I got into this shit in the first place. And it was because I saw that footage in Goodfellas, that sausage, and it looked so good. I was like, how do I get that same thing? It just was that. I just wanted it so bad. Listen, I'm going to accept your example or your apology or whatever you want to call what you just did, but I think you've got a lot of fucking thinking to do. And I think that if you're still going down in those fucking caves and getting all wrapped up in those throbbing. Excuse me. You seem to be pretty obsessed with these sausages and the throbbing. Have you been in it? Maybe I would invite you. Come with me, Duncan. Come on down there. I got a micro penis. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Every time I go, they say, show me your sausage penis, and I can't fucking get, fuck off. You know you made those rules, too. You walk up, there's an old saying that goes like this. I was with you by your side, and we made footprints in the sand. We made footprints in the sand. Look at those footprints in the sand. Then I wake up and I see there's only one set of footprints in the sand. Why is that? Where did you go? I didn't go anywhere. I was carrying you with my footprints in the sand with my, that's why there's a line between the footprints is the sausage. So that's what I did, man. Come with me. Come down with me, brother. Come on. Come on, fam. Thank you. Join my crew. Okay. Come ride with us. Come play. Look, I was playing. I'm sorry. I just felt rejected. I've been coming down there. I think you know I've been trying to get in for a couple months. Look, let me carry you. Put my footprints in the sand. Carry you down in there, bro. Fam, just join up. Come ride with us. You're an inspiration. Thank you so much, Johnny, for coming on the show. I will meet you in the pits, and I can't fucking wait. Where could people find you? You can find me across the country in July. July I'll be in Chicago at the hideout on the 15th of July. On the 16th of July, I'll be in ... Let me just do this again, because I have all these tour dates. Is this your coiling seminars, or are you doing stand-up? These are my stand-up seminars that end with a coiling session, but they're basically stand-up seminars. They're basically stand-up seminars with a little bit of coiling woven in and out. Great. 15th of July, I'll be in the hideout in Chicago. The 16th, I'll be in Milwaukee at the underground. The 17th, I'll be in Eau Claire, Wisconsin at the plus. On Friday the 19th of July, I'll be in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Parkway Theater. On Sunday, no, I think on Saturday the 20th of July, I'll be in Des Moines at Vaudeville Mews. Then the 22nd on Monday, I'll be in Brooklyn at Union Hall, and the 23rd, I'll be in Good Good in Philadelphia. This is all in July. This is the last thing. Thank you, guys. Go see Johnny at whether you're wanting to laugh your ass off or you're interested in some of his coiling techniques. It's great. I wish he was still doing music. His comedy is as good as his music. That being said, would you mind just singing the first verse of Coiled to Win? Coiled to Win, okay. Hey, hey, hey, Coiled to Win, hey, hey, hey, you're a coil, my friend. Get down and do it, we're going to get coiled up and do it. You're never going to get everybody to let you get attacked, get it coiled up and win. Roll it up, roll it up, sprinkle it with some wisdom. Roll it up, roll it up, sprinkle it with some wisdom. Coiled, coiled, toil and boil, can't get played out there. What do you want to say, sing my note back. I'm afraid he's going to put away crack jack, coming on tack, going to get down and say I was making the tack. Come on, beat me up, beat me up, beat me up, beat me up. Thank you, Johnny. You're the best. Thank you, Krishna. That was Johnny Pemberton, everybody.

Experience the Children's of Alabama Indy Grand Prix this Sunday on NBC and Peacock at 3 o'clock Eastern. Greetings to you friends. It is I, D Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, which I am recording at Graynash, the name for my family's estate here on the island of Cumberland off the coast of Georgia. This beautiful mansion has many stories, tales, some good, some bad. Many members of my family were married here. Many members of my family were buried here. It is here that my uncle French gotten a duel with a mud woman. He defeated her in this duel, but they say a curse was placed upon my family, especially the manor house here. And ever since, we've had to deal with this infernal echo. The echo of the spirits is what my grandfather used to call it. It might be something in the architecture. It might be something in the lime that was used in the walls of this place, but this blasted, ceaseless echo goes on and on and on. There's so many rooms in this sprawling estate. Some of them have been boarded up. Some of them seem to have been kicked open from the inside. I try to imagine that the things I've seen here are just a fantasy. For example, last night, when I saw the woman out in the marsh beneath the flickering moon, veiny flaps of flesh hanging from her pulsating buttocks, that wasn't what bothered me. What horrified me was to watch her spray a blast of phosphorescent pollen spores from her massive genitals into the face of a raccoon that seemed to be inhaling these spores for some malefic reason that I could not understand. I will never be able to remove from my mind the vision of deer suckling at her breasts, sucking from them some vowness that I can only imagine tastes sweet, savory, and much like this island, infernal in a beautiful way. Swarms of mosquitoes carried my brother away two years ago, my younger brother and all, and I come here to mourn him to light a candle at the family cemetery. Yes, there are candles there, but I light a candle, a wickless candle where you ignite the wax itself and smash it against the grave and watch the sizzling, simmering, burning wax plop down into the centipedes that seem drawn to his tomb. I won't go on much longer. My breath is short and feels as though my mind is caving in. I should not have opened the book that I found in that room. I should have not looked into its dark pages and read the things that are written there. I cannot get them out of my mind. Regardless, we have a wonderful podcast for you today with David Arcat. We're going to jump right into it, but first some quick business. Nanny, bring me more grits. Nanny, bring me more grits. Hello, Fresh. Hello, Fresh. Hello, Fresh. Hello, Fresh. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the Saints of Cooking over at HelloFresh.com. Hello, Fresh is a meal kit delivery service that is going to transform your life completely. Have you been going out to eat all the time because you're terrified of cooking or you've had bad experiences in the kitchen? Do you realize how dangerous that is to eat food that has been psychically poisoned by some angry chef, somebody who would much rather be going through graveyards, exhuming graves and dancing with the corpses than standing in the kitchen of some fancy restaurant cooking for you and your family? Also, it's incredibly expensive. Also, it's robbing you of the joy of cooking. It's time for you to rediscover the excitement of cooking. You can look forward to your HelloFresh delivery. Knowing dinner just got so much easier because it comes with these cards that are illustrated with step-by-step instructions that are easy for you to follow.

HelloFresh, they're amazing. I've cooked with HelloFresh. The bottom line is this, if you're going on a date and finally someone is coming over to your house after so many lonely days and you want to cook for them, you want to show them, I can provide for you. I know how to cook. I'm able to do this, you know. I can transform ingredients into something delicious that's going to sustain our family when the economy collapses and everyone retreats into the hills. I'm going to be able to make something delicious for you. And I ordered some HelloFresh. It was a wonderful Vietnamese dish. It was an ethnic dish which terrified me at first. I thought for sure I'm going to ruin this. I was on a date and I knew that if I mess this up, I was going to look like an idiot. And who knows? Who knows what the result of that would be? She could have easily rejected me. Who knows? These days, it could ruin your life to make a bad meal for somebody. You could lose a lot of opportunities. The bottom line is I, in less than 30 minutes, whipped up a meal that was so delicious, so satisfying, and so magical that within an hour we were making love in the bathtub, pouring scented oil onto each other, shoving our tongues into every single orifice of each other's bodies. After that, we went outside and we danced beneath the starlit sky and sang to each other. Our stomachs happily filled with delicious, masticated food from HelloFresh.com.

You got a great blog? You've got a bunch of Twitter followers? That's not going to get you into the bandit camp. That's going to get your wife's head hacked off her body. That's going to get your husband strung up, potentially crucified. That's going to get your children sold into slavery at some bandit work camp. But if you say, hey, I know how to cook, I'm a great chef. They're going to open the gates of that compound. They're going to let you in and you can go right up to the bandit warlord and shove your shank right into his throat, feel his hot life's blood pour out under your hand and sit on the bandit throne and rise to power, potentially taking over North America and becoming the emperor of planet earth, the dark one, day gone, the lord of light.

You might have seen him on scream. He's also a wrestler. Not only that, but he is a really deep spiritual person who was raised on a commune and is connected to a family of supremely talented artists. Everybody, please open up your third eyes. Radiate as much love as you possibly can from every single chakra in your body and spray those sweet beams of chronic light to the astral manifestation of today's guest. Welcome to the DuncanTrussell family hour podcast, David Arquette. Hey, man. You get stuck in these bodies. Yeah. And then the next thing you know, thank you so much for coming on the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I want to dive right into this. Let's do it. Tell me about Skymont. Wow. Yeah, man. So Skymont was a religious philosophy. It's called subude that my parents were part of toward the end of the 60s. They escaped New York, a whole hippie scene. My parents were hippies and they believed in this spiritual teaching by a guy named Bapak. It's called subude. It's a sound philosophy. You can be any religion and part of it sort of comprised of Hindu, Islam, and Buddhism. The guy who started Bapak started in Indonesia Story Goza book fell from the sky and opened up and he could ask it anything he wanted. So he was a student at the time and Indonesia's really interesting place. One of the islands is Hindu. One is Islam. So he incorporated a lot of that philosophy into it, but it's really about finding what your true gift is in life and bringing it out into the world and making the world a better place. So all these families moved down to this remote area outside of Front Royal, Virginia. And like 30 families, and then he came to visit and he said, what are you doing here? This philosophy is not about isolation. If you're an actor, you should be out where they're producing plays and making films. If you're an artist, you should be where there's galleries you can show your art at. So it's not really the idea to sort of... He wouldn't let you have a commune. No, he didn't want it. No, he didn't think it was healthy. Wow, that is so cool, man. And you met him. I had met him. Yeah. Oh, this is a funny story. When he visited Los Angeles, when we were living there, my mom was walking me. I was kind of getting a little like I was a baby. So I was crying and just so she had to walk me around. She was walking me in the stroller and then the door opened and it was bop bop. And he said, oh, he's here. And they took the baby and closed the door in my mouth. What? I just took the baby into the room. So I don't know what he said to me at that point. I don't know if I've forgotten it. I don't even remember. I was a literal baby. Some kind of transmission. I mean, I was reading about it. It seems like it's based around a type of non-meditation meditation and experience of something. Yeah, there's something called... One of them says you're not supposed to solicit it at all. So you're not supposed to really talk about it here. I don't know. Well, is this considered soliciting? No, see, I'm not. So I'm not trying to... I'm just speaking my truth and I'm not really a member of it really, although if you're opened into it, you're a part of it forever or whatever. But so the idea is Ladihan. Ladihan is spiritual exercise and that's where men go into one room, women go into another and they surrender themselves to God. So whatever that is for you, if it's being quiet, if it's breathing, if it's meditation, if it's screaming, if it's crying, if it's laughing, if it's dancing, whatever you do, you sort of roam this room and just kind of allow whatever's inside you to come out and... Are you alone? You're alone or you're with other people? You're with other men or other women and you take off all your jewelry and your shoes and you're just supposed to sort of connect with the higher spiritual level. Did you experience this? I have, yeah. And you felt this something happen? Yeah, definitely. I mean, you kind of feel it in your life anyway. I look for signs and like going around if I'm thinking about someone and then I see something about them or if you think about someone you haven't seen in a while and then they turn up in your life, that kind of stuff. I always look for kind of little signals that I'm on the right track or doing the right thing. Yeah, and that's part of the sort of the whole... It seems like he was talking about the Holy Spirit or this sort of transcendent force that's everywhere that you forget about. Yeah, there's a lot of forces he talks about. Overall one is whatever the transcendent sort of God's spirit, but there's also the nafsu, which is sort of the negative sort of what I guess in Christianity you call the dark forces or Satan. Yeah, exactly. But like nafsu can come in different forms. It can come in money and it could come in greed, it could come in sex, it could come in addiction. So you sort of are aware of that. There's also the vegetable force, which is like if you smoke a lot of weed, there's a lot of vegetable force in you. What vegetable force has to do with the sun and but also weeds, you know what I mean? It could have a negative aspect too. That's really interesting because Terrence McKenna used to talk about how plants produce these things called exo pheromones, which are designed that are the way the plants communicate with humans is through these exo pheromones. When you're smoking marijuana, you're in direct communication with the plant mind. I believe that. I buy all that kind of stuff. I think it's really there's so much going on that we don't understand that I could buy that for sure. This is sort of the religion you were raised in. Were you living in this one room cabin? So you're living in a one room cabin with your family on a commune. And did they stick around after he came and said everyone should go? They packed up pretty shortly after that and moved to Chicago. Wow. Yeah, my sister was on and ran away. She moved in with a family that we knew in Los Angeles. So she had a sort of destination, but she hitchhiked at like 14 with a 16 year old friend of hers. She went out to Hollywood and made it on her own. She really. How old were you when this happened? I was just a baby. I was probably about three or four. Okay. So you don't really remember that? No, no. Yeah. No, I don't. I remember we sang this song like I see the moon and the moon sees me. The moon sees somebody I want to see. So God bless the moon and God bless me. And God bless the somebody I want to see. And I always remember singing that, looking at the moon, thinking of my sister is on a while traveling because she always used to take care of me when I was younger. She was sort of like a little second mom. So how long was she just completely disconnected from the family when she ran away? Would she check it? She didn't really disconnect, but there was a lot of, my mother was a child of abuse and she was really abusive to us when we were younger and through the process of that religion and her, she, through the course of her life became a marriage family counselor later. So she really sort of looked at all this stuff that had happened in her life and what the causes were and sort of healed herself and helped heal other people. So, so there was a really kind of troubling time at that point. And my parents were, you know, in over their head, a lot of how a lot of parents are just was rough. And, and my sister couldn't take it anymore. And they were kind of, she was going through adolescence and that whole thing. So she went out to Hollywood and literally went and just, you know, auditioned and went to a casting director's office. And it was for like a character who was played an epileptic who had epilepsy. So she was sitting there in the casting office. She didn't have an appointment and casting director came out at the end of the day and said, I'm sorry, we don't have you on our list. Oh, I'm sorry, just then she got on the floor and started like doing a whole epileptic seizure. And she got the part because she was so like on it. And that led to everything. I mean, I think that one may have been a part where she worked with Betty Davis or something like that, right at the beginning of her career. You know, it led to a lot of stuff. She she got nominated for the executioner song was a few years later. But uh, yeah, she did some great, great work. Baby, it's you. Some of her early stuff is really amazing. Big blue. She's just, I can't say enough about Rosanna, because she's just such an amazing spirit. I don't know if you've ever met her. Have you? I've never met her. No, she's obviously aware of her. You'd be totally like, she's intense. And she's like, she's just a, she was a child of the hippie generation. Apparently she used to take us to like no nukes, uh, you know, rallies and my mom marched with Martin Luther King. And so we all had that hippie thing, but she, um, she really loves like hippies. And she'd like worked at the Renaissance fair for years. And like, you know, she was, she was totally into she's the best. She was like, we went to this benefit concert one time, uh, in LA at the same place they do the golden globes and, and, uh, Bert Backer, I was playing and, and he's playing and everybody's just talking and clinking and like being in no respect whatsoever. She gets up in the middle. She goes, shut up. This is Bert Backer. This isn't some, some lounge act. I was like, Oh my God, my sister is such a baller. She's just so like always fights for the little person. She organized the Lexus Arquette Foundation, Family Foundation, which is, uh, the charity she put together for my sister, Lexus. What's the charity? Yeah, the Lexus Arquette Family Foundation deals with transgender, uh, youth or LGBTQ youth and gets them free, uh, medical services and, uh, and, um, how long's that been around? It just started, but it's working with this lady named, um, Dr. Hagar, who's incredible. She's worked with you at UC, uh, USC and she's got a clinic downtown in the hospital and she's just remarkable. She's, you know, the, like the foremost doctor and, uh, uh, just, uh, unrape, like, child abuse. So she deals with the most hardcore things in the world on a daily basis and just knows how to deal with it, knows how to keep them safe, knows how to keep the women primarily safe. Um, so she's just a hero. That's your, your entire family is, you, I mean, you come from one of like a famous family. Yeah, yeah. You have, you have artist genes, like it's all artist genes all the way through and you, all of you are actors, right? The entire, you have an entire family of actors. Yeah. So when you were being raised, was that part of the, of it? Would they get you to read lines or a little more improv? We did a ton of improv. My dad studied with Paul Sills. I also studied with Paul Sills and, uh, Viola Spohlen, my dad studied with, he was in the committee and, and, uh, taught at second city in, in, in Venice and, um, he was just great. So when he went to, um, uh, Chicago, he really got more into sort of improv and then came out here and they did something called Spohlen players where, uh, it was Paul Sills, uh, you know, teaching all these or just, uh, I don't know, curating all these amazing improvisational actors. They'd put on incredible stuff. I mean, we once saw, um, there's one, uh, game called animal transformation where you're, uh, each person's given a different animal and then you act like the animal and then you bring it up to human form, but still maintain the animal characteristics. Cool. So it really gives you a wild, like, you know, if you're a bear or if you're a snail or if you're, in this case, uh, someone gave him a, um, a caterpillar. So it was, uh, Robin Williams. He was a caterpillar and we were all watching him and he's like inching around and then they say, okay, now bring it up to human form. And he wrapped himself up in a curtain and then he came out and he was total flamboyant butterfly, which is just so like Robin Williams doing his thing, which he loved doing, but it was amazing. Like on this spur of the moment, my dad used to do, um, they used to like give a suggestion for the beginning and end of a poem and then they'd sort of all like come up with a beginning and end and then a poem in between, but my dad would always do haikus on the spot within like, you know, 10 seconds he'd come up with a haiku. Wow. Wow, man. What a rare birth. You ever, you ever, like, do you ever have existential moments where you're just staying like, why did, why did, did I pick this? Do you, do you even reincarnation? Well, um, I do believe in reincarnation. I just found the same birthmark on my son Augustus that my dad had right on his hip, same shape, this little like pickle, we used to call it. It's just kind of so bizarre. I was like, wait a second, that's exactly the same spot. It was kind of bizarre, but, um, I think there's like always the combo of the parents and then this extra, you know, spirit in there or multiple spirits or whatever. But I had this trippy experience when my son Charlie was young, where I was, uh, how old's Charlie now? Charlie's four now. Augustus is one. One, yeah. Gotcha. And my daughter's almost 14, Coco. So I'm sitting there with Charlie and he was still about even younger than one. He was recently born. I'm looking at him and I'm thinking about my parents and I'm thinking, Oh man, I wish mom and dad were here to see you. And then I got like, we're looking at you right now in my head. Like I was like, I was like, Oh, they're looking at me through his eyes. I was like, Whoa, this is a trip. I totally got that. And we get these weird like kind of things because my parents were so spiritual or, or it's all in our head. Not in your head. No way, man. Not in your head. Yeah. And, and, and I have that with my girlfriend, you know, and she, like my mom, my mom passed away with breast cancer too. My mom loves my girlfriend. She's got me, but like it's a very strange thing to suddenly have the presence of a being come into the room and, and know, and you feel it. It's, it's, and I don't, I don't think people who, who haven't lost parents understand that that happens. And it's one of the strangest things. I don't think it's in our head though. No, no, you were asking also the gratitude of like, that's where I always found healing when I lost both my parents where when I got to a place at some point when I was just like, Oh, thank you. Thank you for making them my parents. Like that moment of gratitude is really healing in the, in the grieving process because then you're like, Oh, you know, it is bigger picture stuff. I think everything's like literal, like, you know, with time and space being what it is, that we're, it's a blink of the eye. And this is another lifetime. You know what I mean? It's not like for us, we're on this like, you know, journey or whatever it is. But for everything else, like I, it's total legs. It's like, I'll see you in a second. You know what I mean? Because it's just like that you blink and it'll happen. And the funny thing about getting older is you realize time starts speeding up. Yeah, it's really a trip. You're like, when you're kids, you could spend summers of like, you know, having these crazy adventures climbing through backyards and you're finding all the stuff and it's like literally summer times took forever. Yes. And now you'll, if you just like turn away, you're like, Oh, wow, it's Christmas again. I think it's almost quantifiable. Like I think if I, if I put my mind to it and went back to like how long a typical summer lasted when I was like eight or nine versus the summer now, I think a summer would last of a couple, at least two or three years of now time. Yeah, at least. Yeah. And there's, you know, there's different theories on that phenomenon. Have you ever heard, God, I guess I'm, have you ever heard McKenna's theory about like that? Or, you know, Taylor De Chardon, you ever heard of that guy? No, I'm not. So it's the idea we're getting like that, that time is being sucked into something like we're being drawn into something. So, you know, like, you see, you know, those dumb things like they haven't like targets or they used to where you drop your coin in and it goes swirling around. Well, that's what's happening. So like time is literally speeding up because we're approaching this event called the singularity or the apocalypse. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's all part of the singularity in the whole thing. Yeah. Well, like, I mean, it's a deep woo woo shit. Yeah. Yeah. Neil deGrasse Tyson, he's gonna fucking roll his eyes and like, oh, he doesn't believe in singularity. I don't think no, it's just because it's to like, it's woo wooing in the sense that I think physics people who are into physics to be like, this is you're just a guy who smokes a bunch of weed, man. But the concept is essentially where technology is going. It's I guess the idea is like, okay, so for, you know, however long humans were post proto hominid humans were just walking around and they'd see birds, birds can fly. Humans couldn't fly. They tried all this shit. They couldn't find something we could fly. You fly and now the whole terrain changed. Everything changes because now we see everything from above from planes and then satellites and that changes everything. The next thing that's going to happen because of technology, theoretically, is we're going to do the same thing we did with planes, but with time. So that's like a time machine, essentially, where it's basically going to punch a hole in time. And that's the singularity. It's a time machine. And when that happens, everything happens at once. And so we're getting sucked into that. And so that sense of accelerating time or the sense of like shit, man, a year now was like a day. Yeah, that's going to keep getting faster and faster and faster. So it's like seconds and then we enter into whatever the next phase of human existence. I heard a bunch of these type like super tech people. I'll believe this is a simulation. Yeah, that's it. Simulation theory is a definitely part part of it. That's this concept. It's more likely we're in a simulator than we're not. What do you think about that? I could buy that. I think that's interesting. I mean, you know, who knows? I mean, I always had this question, like, what would you what would God do if God was bored if there is a God, right? We would create everything and like, you know, but then, you know, what would happen? You know, everything would be what it is. Like we're all, I don't know, everything's being created anyway. So then if then if that's something's creating us, what makes it so that we're not that that's creating us, you know what I mean? Yeah. So then I don't know. It's like, it's like, we're like the crest of the wave of this creative intelligence that's pushing itself into time or all these little probisci or something, little nodes of sentience that are pushing into time. Well, I think everything is God, you know what I mean? The good, the bad, everything. Yeah, just everything's connected. Like everything, everything is just so much more connected than we know. And so much more like, like I do like, I don't know if you've ever done nitrous or anything, but I had done it in the past. And, you know, there's definitely the moments of like, like little, I don't know if it's just a drug sort of affecting your brain, but making it feel like this is like, you know, there's, there's a connection of it like, I don't know that everything goes together and nothing really matters. And what really matters in our existence is love, having fun, being creative, you know, enjoying your life, having excitement, and, and, you know, not being a total asshole. Yeah. How do you do, how do you deal with like, do you have any techniques you use to reduce your asshole tendencies? No, because I, you know, I go through these waves of like, they're doing really great. And like, you know, exercise is always great. I mean, I wish I meditated more. I mean, I've been to rehab a couple of times. So there's always like, what happens, what's great about rehab is you analyze yourself and you sit in a room and you have all these hours to sit and talk about, talk with other people and sort of get all these painful experiences off your chest and, and deal with them and face them and write things about them and all this kind of thing. You also, you have a lot of time to think, you have a lot of time to think on your own. You also get clear and you get clean. You get time to meditate and do yoga. So it really kind of grounds you so you, and you get healthy, you're eating, you're exercising. So you come out kind of like just feeling better in general. Yeah. So when you don't, and if you don't stay sober, yeah, you, uh, where are you at with that right now? I, I'm up and down. I mean, I don't do any hard anything. So I'll smoke a little weed here and there. Um, I drink too much. I mean, I'll drink, you know, maybe, you know, three, four times a week, which is, you know, just too much in general. But what, what grabbed you when you were in rehab? Were you grabbed by one of the hard ones? What do you mean? Like the opiates where you sucked in like Coke or the opiates? I'm more of a drinker. I'm like, I'm just like booze. I know booze is tough. It's real beer for you. No, no booze. Just like whiskey or scotch or vodka. Yeah. Yeah, it'll get you, man. That one's that one. I'll get you. It'll get you good in everywhere too. I know. I'm right on time. If you can kind of like moderate it, it's it's cool because then you don't if you, if you do it in a way where, you know, back in the day where you could just have a cocktail at the end of work and then just kind of settle down. But if you can't, or if you then do it like that for a little while, a little while being like a year or something, but then you start drinking a little more, then it's rough. I mean, God, don't you hate it? You just don't want to make mistakes and like regret. You're just like, sometimes I'll find myself drunk and like this happened to me recently with this, a really good friend of mine. And I wanted to talk to him and not that I understand shit about feminism at all. But my girlfriend, it understands it in a really astute way and she's explained parts of it to me. And so I was trying to explain what she had just paired what she had said to me to my friend. Right. And like, you know, you have that clarity behind the drunkenness, like it's like you're a professor and this is going to come out fucking great. And then it's just like, you're going to see what feminism really is. This is awful. I'm ruining it. Like, I'm the worst thing that kind of in this moment, I'm one of the many awful things that can happen to that concept. That's why I hate about it. It reduces your ability to have philosophical conversations, you know, you're fucking you start slurring your words. Coke, like just Coke talk is the worst. I always thought like Coke turns men into mice because I don't know if you ever smoked it, like you literally become a little like a crackhead. It's the worst. I did like a while a couple of times when I was younger. You were smoking crack. We did. Yeah. Yeah. I have some friends who are smoking crack. She used to tell me her lips would get all burnt and shit by it. Oh, it's the worst. It's so you got burns on your lips. No, I didn't go that hardcore. I mean, I would do it like stupidly, but I do it and then, you know, then way down the line, do it one more time or a few times, but not. But it's just terrible. It's just a horrible like, it really makes you into the way dogs act toward food. It's like, oh, God, fucking need that food. It's really like, it's, it's, it's, that's so crazy. This is different from what I've heard about it. I mean, most people say it's like great. Like the, most people say it's the best thing never happened to them. You're getting into cocaine. They're like, most people are like, my life got much better when I started doing cocaine. So it's really odd. I'm just kidding. By the way, I'm completely the most colorful person in the world. That's how I started was convinced to smoke in the first place. I'm literally, I don't know when people are being mean to me at a table. When people are like being like snot, we had a brief conversation about this. I have no like dick gate are like, it really has to be like, what's up? Like a confrontation when we're about to fight. Right. Okay. That's great. Oh, I apologize for that. No, please do. Please like, keep trying to sneak them in there. See if I go for it again. No, man, cocaine, like I'm lucky because I don't like cocaine. The one thing I know that would kill me is heroin. So I've never done it. But, but, um, cocaine, I just, my body doesn't like it. It's when I snored it, I get like, almost like an instantaneous ecstasy depression. Like I'll do it. I'll feel that thing. You know, where you're like, Oh my God, get the hate me. We call them the hate me is quick. And it happens so quickly. It's like, my brain just doesn't work well with cocaine, which is interesting. You know, I was talking to, I went to this maps conference, you know, maps. It's the multi disciplinary association for psychedelic studies. Oh, cool. And they're the ones who are getting MDMA prescribable by 2022. You know, there's all these like, psychiatrists and doctors and psychologists who come to these. I love talking to scientists and doctors about this shit because that really kind of breaks it down. Yeah. And they're such like, they're so excited right now because you know what they're there, some psychedelics, they can really like heal depression. They can really heal like addiction and they're starting to find out the mechanisms of addiction through some of these psychedelics. But one of the things this guy was telling me is that they're kicking around is genetic testing that they can then tell you, Oh, here are the drugs you don't want to fuck with. Here are the psychedelics that aren't going to really work, might not work well with you just based on your genome because the way everyone processes these chemicals is completely different. It's fascinating. That is really cool. Yeah. I think that'll open it up to like a better understanding. I mean, right now is everything so fucked up. Are you do you struggle with depression? I do. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think I do. You know, I mean, I have a pretty good outlook on life and it doesn't get me down that often. But when it does, it becomes pretty dark. And, you know, I get bummed out. It creeps in kind of like it starts slow. You just kind of ignore it. And the next thing you know, you're like, yeah, it's definitely in my family too. Like my father had it and and his father and his father. Well, my family goes back to vaudeville. So like they were that this little rinky dinky vaudevillian group and a little team in Toledo, Ohio. And my grandfather Cliff Arquette was part of that. And he had learned like a lot of the sort of vaudevillian things. So he then went to New York and became famous on radio. And then radio died. And he was sitting back watching the Jack Parr show on time. And Jack Parr said, whatever happened to Cliff Arquette, I mean, whatever happened to Charlie Weaver, because that was the character he played. And he was like, he spit out his scotch, which my grandfather, Charlie Weaver, had built a kid's toy. That's an actual bartender. He shakes up a martini. He pours it into a martini glass. He drinks it. His nose turns red and smoke comes out of his ears. And this was a toy he manufactured in China, and then brought it over here. And it was like this huge funny toy. They got to bring that back. I know, it's really, it's really cool. And yeah, so he heard that and he called up Jack Parr. He said, I'm still here. I'd love to come on your show. So then he put a like a visual look to the that's him right there. It's a tattoo. Yeah, so he used to read letters home to mama, which was his big thing. And he had a funny thing where he was kind of like a dirty old man in a sense, but it was all very clean. But he could get away with saying things that a lot of people couldn't. Cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So vaudeville, man, and it's in your family, huh? Depression. And then my grandfather, his father, Cliff's father actually killed himself. Oh, shit. Yeah. So that's a something to watch out for, man. Totally. You got to be aware of those demons, that voice in our heads, that negative voice that's trying to attack us all the time. Yeah, yeah, it's it's nofsu. Yeah, exactly. Do you do you? So how does it come about for you? For me, when I get depressed, it's like I go numb. Like that's how I know it's starting, because I stopped feeling like I go into this numb, numb spot. And then I start getting sleepy all the time. And then I don't want to get out of bed. And then I get plastered to the bed. And then I want to start pissing in the bed. Because I'm so that's when it's, I mean, it's only a few times in my life where it's like, I'm paralytic. How does it happen with you? I don't know. I guess maybe I start drinking too much. It's pretty much or that adds to it or whatever it is. And then I think I start arguing with my, you know, whoever I'm with at the time and that kind of stuff. Drunk fights. Yeah, I mean, it's usually not what I'm drawing. Well, I guess sometimes, yeah. Well, it's like fights, like, just like, just being a dick, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's just, I don't know. I just kind of like, sometimes I just get so fed up with, you know, what's going on in this business or whatever it is. It's just like, you know, my dad was an actor for 45 years. So for us, it's like this kind of like, I don't know, it brings up all this stuff, you know, that my parents used to argue about that. When me and my wife argue about it just grinds me like so much. I'm like, I can't repeat the relationship my parents had. I just can't. Like you mean arguing over like Hollywood business problems? Drinking too much Hollywood business problems, just minor stuff working or like making money, whatever it is, you know what I mean? But it's just, I mean, this is where I just feel it's all a waste of time. Like everything's a waste of time because we could be dead in any second. So if you're sitting here having your argument, we're just wasting it. It's just wasted time. Like let's either not argue and just, you know, I know people have to be heard and, and you know, you don't want to want people to feel fulfilled, fulfilled too. So you can't just be completely narcissistic, but it was funny. I was always obsessed with narcissists and the fact that we have a narcissistic president is insane. But I've always been amazed by them because they have this ability to not give a shit about anything. They're like, you know, that's what heroin does. Heroin just makes you fucking not care if you shit your bed. You're like, right, feels warm. You know what I mean? Fuck. Yeah, it's like, it's, it's insane. Yeah. Because you have no fucking care for anything. Yeah. And that will include your kids or, you know, your own life. You, you know, sometimes I often think people accidentally kill themselves, not even that accidentally. They're just sure. Most of the time they try to get sober, they relapse, they do as much as they used to be doing. And it's too much for that. That's the classic right there. Or the other classic is keep doing it long enough. Your body can't take it anymore. So you die at, you know, 50 lots of ways to do it. I don't, I can't remember. It's some comedian. I wish I could remember names. I'm sorry if you're listening. I'm so sorry. She had a joke about how she realized that she was actually trying to break up with her boyfriend by suicide. You know what I mean? She's in such a shit relationship. She was like, she's rather die. Oh, yeah. You know what I mean? Then break up. By the way, that's how a lot of people do it. I think that's how a lot of people end up in jail. I'm convinced as well. Yeah. I think that's, that's a lot. I think love and like passion and all that stuff adds to a lot of this. Oh my God. I mean, this is the statistic everyone says because you're like having a gun at home, they're like, that increases your chance of getting shot by someone you love or by shooting yourself. I swear. I mean, I, you know, I've never really been suicidal, but I have looked at you know, off a balcony a few times. Oh, me too. Could I? Me too. Just, oh, it's like what, what I did. It's the worst. It's so sad. And it's so like, I don't know, I just feel so bad for, you know, like a soldier a day or something like, or like second, like every, it's just so painful. Well, it's like one of the things Ram Dass talks about when he talks about suicide is what we want to do is, is, is, it's not that we don't want to kill our physical body, but the mask that we're wearing, we've gotten confused into thinking that's us. And when people kill themselves, you know, it's this, they've become very identified with this aspect of their personality that they think is the totality of their personality, just one little piece of what you are. So, and so, so the idea is like, Oh, we can annihilate you. You can, that, that thing can be transformed. We can get some space around it, but you've been believing like ancestral like pain, but absolutely. Yeah. So that it's not going anywhere. So it's past, you're passing it on, you know, you pass it on to your children or, or, you know, other generations, hot potato until you deal with it and face it. That's what was pretty amazing about what my mother did, although in her abuse cycle had left some for us to deal with. That's right. Well, I mean, and that's that, that's what you just said. I was talking to someone, you know, because the idea is like, let's find. So the first time I interviewed these Ram Dass people, I was, I was raging and I was like, you know, violent revolution. When are we going to the streets? How are we going to, and they're like, I remember he's like, Duncan, look what you're doing. You're creating a, an us and a them and you've created this big separation here and the idea is we're not an us or then we're all a one. Yeah. And so I was talking to someone, I think it was someone related to maps about these motherfuckers who come out in the Darth Vader costumes and beat people and spray them when they're marching, you know, those people, they're like, who are they? Just the cops, the fucking beating the murderous cops, the cops who are like into it. And they pointed out, you know, those guys, they were abused as kids. They have PTSD. And what you're really looking at there is not so much an evil person is kind of the condensation of millennia of suffering, bubbling into time in the form of these people beating other people. Right. So that's what trauma is, you know, it's just what you're saying. It's like a, it's like a drip, drip, drip of pain coming, coming from the ancestors. Right. And yeah, and killing yourself. All that does is like transfer the, the trauma to the people around you. Yeah. I mean, oh, if you ever seen anyone, I mean, it's been in a funeral like that. It's just so, I mean, you go walk into the Van Gogh Museum. Have you? Oh my God. Have you ever been to the Van Gogh Museum? No, I have not. It's amazing though, because it's beautiful, aren't everywhere, but everybody's like this. Yeah. Oh, it's such a like a vibe like, I don't know, but that's a painful type of a funeral. I can't even imagine everyone's feels guilty, right? Is that what it is? It's like, we could have done something. Oh, yeah. And oh, it's just so sad when, when it happens, but you can't, but I've been told you, you can't really do anything. That's a, that's a myth. Like there's, if somebody decides they're going to kill themselves, it's like cancer. It's like any others, they're going to kill themselves. There's not much that you could do except listen and not blame yourself for it. You know, that's what I've been told. Yeah. I believe that. I've called suicide hotlines because people have been like on the ledge, you know, and suicide hotline people, they're like, well, you know, you, you can call 911 or you can do this, but you know, they're, they're, get them to call us and we'll talk, but they've dealt with it so many times. They know it's like, if it's going to happen. Yeah. Don't do it. Anybody out there don't. Yeah. Because still, because it gets better, like everything gets better. And, you know, getting older is hard and, you know, the one, you know, the assisted suicide or the kind of suicide because of pain and all that. Yeah. You know, that's a whole, that's a different ball of wax. But Alexis, my sister, Alexis, she had AIDS for like years, like since she was in her teen, like late teens, like or early twenties and she had had it for so long and she would get feeling good and taking her meds and then she'd stop because she felt so good, but then she'd go back on them, but that reduces their sort of effectiveness. So just toward the end, I could just tell us she was kind of done. And it was like, she was done with it and she was kind of going to dark places and not really honoring herself. So she was ready to sort of like, I'm done with this kind of phase. Did you, it was just a phone call? You just got the phone call? How you found out? No, she was, she didn't commit suicide. She just slowly did in the sense, you know what I mean? Slowly allowed herself to sort of go down, but I got a call that she was sick and then, yeah, and then we all sort of came and I had somewhere to go that she was going to live longer and I went and she got worse. So I had to come back. But we were all there when she passed, which was, which was beautiful. That's beautiful. Yeah, we were playing music and all brothers and sisters were there. So that was, that was really nice. A lot of people don't get that right now. They don't. And I sometimes think that that's probably the way they wanted it anyway, or even if they didn't, the way it was supposed to be. I don't know, you know, it's true. You know, I was volunteering at a hospice and they would tell us about angels. They're angels. They're just, just the most amazing humans. And, um, you know, we had to go through this orientation and, you know, one of the things that they talked about is like when people decide to die. And one of the stories they told is really fascinating is they're just, this father was just, he was just sort of all hanging in there, but just not there. And the hospice worker was like, you know what, I want you all to go see a movie tonight. Go see a movie. Let's just go, go to a movie and then, uh, and then come back. And they went to the movie and as soon as they're gone, he died because he didn't want to die in front of him. Yeah. I totally get that for some people. Yeah. I totally get that. Yeah. Some people want to die alone. Yeah. Which is okay. Yeah, totally. I mean, it's however you want it. I mean, a lot of people, I always say, we love you. We're going to be all right, you know, whatever. You're safe to go. You've been such a, just sort of reinforced how great a person or experience we've had together, how much we love them, you know, just to let them know that it's okay to go like we're going to be fine. Everyone's going to be fine. We love you. We'll see you soon. I do believe you're going to see all these people. I think we'll see them all that we're all one. You know what I mean? It becomes very clear that this is all super connected and yeah, you know what I mean? Well, I love when Ram Dass's guru died. They said, when they called Ram Dass, they said, uh, he dropped his body. That's how they say, yeah, yeah. That's cool. That's as much, you know, the West way we look at is so different there. It's just like, this is a vehicle got out of the car. We're all going to get out of the car. And some people's cars are like, they're breaking down. They're smoldering. They're, you know, they're, you know, Mitzi passed away. I know I heard. I'm sorry. I know you were friends with them. Yeah. But, but these things are so bittersweet because you want a being to go on forever, but simultaneously, someone who's in a body that's breaking down, it's a real joyful moment to, to let go of that body and to become part of everything again. Absolutely. And you could, and now that you feel them, I'm sure, you know, I'm sure you feel your sister still. I'm sure. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. And you know what? I always, I always say, uh, whether you die, go toward the laughter. I mean, that's what you want. You know what I mean? That's cool. Way better than the light. That's so much better than the light. How beautiful, man. I love that. I mean, I guess it depends on the type of laughter. Yeah. Yeah, you could go there. I don't go to that laughter. I love. Yeah, I don't, if you had the option, you know, that this shit you read about medical technology right now and the stuff they're saying. Cryo freeze the brain. Yeah. Reverse the aging process, all the CRISPR, all this stuff. Would you do it? Would you, if you could double your lifespan? The only reason I'd want it was for kids to be, see my kids like do whatever they want, be there to ask them questions. That's the main thing you miss is like being able to call my dad and say, oh man, this funny joke. I thought of you today. I heard this song and I'm reminding me of that song. I used to say like little moments like that or my mom or whatever. That ache dude. I accidentally called my mom's number last night and I haven't done it since she died. I'm terrified of doing it. And then I called and I'm like, fuck it. Let me listen to see who's got her number now. It's just some guy, you know, like this is Jean Pritt, you know, with a VLZ center. It's like, wait, you're not my mom. What the fuck? But man, but that, that feeling, one of the things the Ram Dass people have taught me is I love, it's such a very simple saying, which is the longing is the grace and that feeling of longing is the, it's your connection to them. And that's cool. Yeah, it's fucking cool. So when that emerges, it's actually a connection to them. Like you're feeling them. That's, that's, so yeah, but I know you want to call them and brag, you want to call them and brag. That's a really cool story about my dad. Like after he passed and we've sort of passing his different stuff and I got his, like a director's chair with his name on it. And I was like, oh, that's cool. I'm going to put that in my house and then put it in my house. And then I sat down on it and it ripped. And it was just like dad. It was such a dad joke. It was like dad, like at his greatest. Those were his like fun things. Exactly, man. That's exactly how they do. I, you know, when my mom died, we, she has this little house on this island called Little Cumberland Island. And I went there with my girlfriend at the time and I wanted to go out and float out on inner tubes, but, uh, you know, we didn't have any inner tubes and really you probably shouldn't. My mom was always terrified. Like we didn't want us to go out in those waters because there's jelly vision sharks and shit, but you know, we, I was saying to my, my girl at the time, like, oh man, I wish we had some inner tubes and we're walking down the path and there's two inner tubes that the wind has blown up into the, into the like brush. And so we take them, we go and float on the inner tubes. It's the best day we're coming back. Then this woman walks up and she's like, oh, you found the inner tubes. And she's like, oh, oh, you're Danine's son. And then she's like, you know, your mom said something to me. Oh, she, you know, your mom, your mom said like after, after she passes, she's going to do some pretty amazing stuff. And I'm just like, whoa, that's just grace, man. It's just like this beautiful graceful little winks from the other side that's like, no, no, it's not that heavy. It's not that heavy, man. And it's funny always too. It's funny ripping the director's chairs. So hilarious. So funny, man. I mean, and it's on so many different levels too. I was just like talking to someone who's in AA and they were telling, I love AA sayings. And one of them is like, get out of the director's chair. You ever hear that before? Yeah, yeah. You know, I don't do that. Cause like the moment you were trying to control everything, you know, that's when you really start fucking up. Yeah, it's true. So as I've been researching you, you're in a horror movies, huh? Like, yeah, I like them. I mean, I did this movie called The Tripper. I think you'd be interested. Yeah. About a killer who's obsessed with Ronald Reagan, who hacks up hippies in an outdoor music festival. Yeah. So it's all like, they're all on acid. And you know, this girl had a bad trip earlier. So she's like, I'm not doing it. And then she gets squirted with them. And she starts tripping. And that the killer thinks it's, it's, I forgot even her name, Ronald Reagan's daughter. I don't know. I forgot. But she had like a drug thing in reality, like it was kind of public. But so he calls her Peggy or whatever it is. He's like all obsessed with her. His dogs are named like Nancy and you know, all this, it's pretty trippy. What's your favorite? Like if you had to pick your favorite shining, probably shiny was great. I mean, the shiny is the greatest because it's literally a man losing his mind. Right. Possessed by dark spirits. And he's like, I'm not going to kill you. I'm going to bet. Yeah. Yeah. Do you like? Yes. Yes. The best. The best. I mean, he was the greatest. I mean, that and cuckoo's nest and all those movies he was doing at the time. Oh my God. Jack Nicholson in the fucking in his prime. Oh man. Oh man. Once they invent the thing where you can go into the simulator and pick the thing and just to jump in and jack prime Jack Nicholson prime Nicholson. That's some darkness though. They might be people thought he was a devil. I mean, I'm sure there was elements of that going on. The parties he had. I've heard is like you would leave his party and you would think to yourself like he's Satan. Yeah. Like he is the incarnation of Satan. Like this man is a raging beast. This beautiful, talented, destructive vortex. Like, God forbid you should get drawn into his. No kidding. Energetic. I mean, but man. I would, I don't know. I would love to experience that. I know. Also, Brando was amazing. Just such a, I worked with him once. No way. I got to work with him on this crazy movie called Free Money. And I think it was his last film, but I got to identify because the director called me and he was a friend and he said, you want to do a couple of scenes with Brando? And I was like, are you kidding me? So I went to like somewhere outside of Montreal and it's snowing and I flew in just for like the day I think and meet him and he's like waiting to rehearse. They called us to the set too soon. He's like, I want to sit in my car. I was like, yeah, that'd be great. Thank you, Mr. Brando. Oh, and then so I'm sitting behind him. He's in the passenger seat and then his, I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife at the time, an Asian lady sitting right there and she's really super sweet and she's younger than him, but not too young that it's weird. And and he's got this really weird haircut where they've cut the bald spot. So he's got like a shaved fake bald spot and his hair is kind of like a little, it's like a Kim Jong-un with a bald spot. So it's like this really weird like thing and I'm sitting behind him just staring at the back of his head and he's just asking me some questions and just like I want to go think I was just so fucking nervous and I'm sitting there and it's cold outside and I'm stiffly and he's like, did you have a cold? And I said, uh, I don't know. I don't think so. It's just cold outside. And then so when he finally let me out, I was like, I'm not, I didn't have the nerve to get back in the car. I was just like, but he, we did this seat together where I'm a used car dealer and I'm selling him this, this truck that the whole thing's about. He's finally retiring and getting this truck. So the truck was a big deal in the movie and he's got sons or something. Charlie Sheen was in it as well. I didn't work with him though. But, um, he's, all of his humor was like based in like three Stooges in like Buster Keegan. Like, and I love that stuff. So I was totally game for it. He's like, uh, why don't I shake the kid's hand and then I'll just, he doesn't let go. You just keep shaking and I find that annoying. I was like, I love it. I love it. Anything you want. Well, then why doesn't he, he can be the keys and then, uh, I'll go up to the truck and he had a hard time getting this truck because it was so high. He didn't get into it easily. So why wasn't the kick it on his hands and knees and I'll step on him and I get into the truck and I was like, great. I love it. And the director was like, no, you can't, he was about 350, 400 at the time. So they were like, no, you can't. I was like, I've been doing this my whole life though. The old, I'm the youngest of, you know, five kids. I've been the shelf or whatever, the stool for many of people. I could do this. He was like, no, no, you can't do that. I do regret that. Oh, cause what a way to die. Being crushed to death by Marlon Brando. Exactly. That is the ultimate way to die. That you will be remembered forever, eternally. I know. Even if I was just paralyzed, whatever, it's fine. Wolf Blitzer coming out, talking about how you got paralyzed by fucking Marlon Brand. You like going to one of those comas where like you have to use your eyes to communicate from then on. Amazing, man. God, would Brando visit you? Do you think if he, if he, if he, if you, was he the type of person where you would have? Yeah, I think so. He was really a kind, like sweet, like very spiritual, very like interesting guy. I was really upset when he died. There wasn't more of a like celebration of his life because he like said the Native American lady to get his Oscar or something, or then what happened with his son. Unfortunately, like all that stuff kind of tainted like his thing or just being difficult. I don't know what it was, but they didn't celebrate him the way, like one of the greatest actors that ever lived just passed away. And like, it was a blip, you know what I mean? A blip. Yeah. And that sucks, that thing. Cause it's like you, the, the, you know, the art, like let's go back to Van Gogh, for example, right? Like that we celebrate him in his work, but we've, nobody mentions like that was a stalker. Yeah. That was a depressed. Yeah. That dude sent his fucking ear to a, I mean, that's deep stalking, deep, deep, deep abuse. That's as fucked up as you can get. And nobody, when they're looking at his art, not many people are like, you know, this guy was like a fucking abusive psychotic because we, because we, but now, you know, if you, if you, the way Brando laughed with drama or whatever, that ends up obscuring somehow. I think that's a real sad thing. You know, we got to figure out a way to like separate the, the, the water from the faucet, you know? Cause if it's good water, it's good water. I have an amazing sculpture of him that Alexis had given me from the artist that did the one of James Dean up at the observatory, the same artist. And he delivered this sculpture to Brando and he's like, got his mouth open and it's, it's kind of a, I don't know, just expressive. The, the, the sculptor in general doesn't necessarily look a lot like him. It does, but he goes, it looks like I'm ready to suck somebody off. Which he did, right? But the artist got so kind of offended that he didn't take the thing and then the artist had given it to Alexis at some point. I love that Brando is so familiar with himself that he knows the look he gets on his face when he's about to suck someone off. That's a great actor, you know, cause he's like studying himself all the time. That's so fun. Who was it that he, what is the famous picture of, there's a picture of him, right? Who was it that he's sucking off? I don't know. Was it James Dean? I think he sucked it. He sucked off James Dean. I think it's in that picture. Yeah. Wow. That crazy picture. I also, the same place that has the picture. So it used to be at like soap plant or something. You could find stuff like that. I don't know if they have that stuff anymore. But, uh, yeah, go ahead, sir. No, no, no. But, uh, there was one of, um, uh, Walt Disney where he drives a mini mouse with boobs on a chalkboard. Oh wow. That's another good one. But would you like, if you were James Dean, if like, we get the simulator running, pop back in time, we get to pick these like various like legends, pop back into James Dean's body. Yeah. And you're in that room with Marlon Brando and he's like, I want to suck you off. Oh my God. Would you say no? I think I would. I don't know. I've had uncomfortable experiences in my life, but I don't, not that I ever blew anyone or been blown by a guy. But it's Brando. I know, but still it's, I grew up sharing a room with a transgender person. Right. So I like, you know, went through, when I was going through like, um, uh, adolescence, I was like, hope I'm not gay. Like that's what I was worried about because I like dressing up and I like having fun and like being, I don't know, not that that's like some gay trait having fun. Yeah, you're gay, man. Having fun. I mean, I was going to tell you you're gay. But even like wearing a dress, I don't know. I've like, have you ever cross dressed? I've been a burning man. I always am so uncomfortable. I don't know if it's like old stuff from sharing a room with a Alexis, but it all just makes me so uncomfortable. So even if it was James Dean or Marlon Brando, I'd be like, I don't think it'd be the bet. I don't think it'd be like, it's like, it's not going to be a great moment, but I'm just saying it's like afterwards you're like, well, Marlon, yeah, it's a great story. Yeah. Brando sucked my cock. It's like, what's better than that? Any, any time you go, any time you see a Brando film, you're like, yeah, that guy sucked my dick. I used to be, I used to be really into like, if I was working with a girl or somebody or, or like somebody, an actress or something, just, I'd put heat seeking missiles and like do everything to like go out with them, meet them. You know, I don't know. I used to be really about that. And I don't know. It's just kind of a, it's a weird thing to get obsessed with because yes, it's good story. But aside from that, it becomes, you know, for one, a lot of the time, you don't want to tell those stories because you don't want to share stuff that that's right. And then if you ever do slip and share something, sometimes people that deny it or, or and then you're like, what, are you embarrassed by it or something? Or I like, I thought we actually did date. I maybe I shouldn't be talking about it. Is that what's going on? So I don't really know how to deal with that. You'll, I mean, you've, you've been in like the, you've been in one of those relationships that is a, where like people are taking pictures of you at the beach and stuff, right? Yeah, that was a crazy time because it was like peak of, of friends-ness. So, and it was also this weird time where the paparazzi culture was exploding. It was like pre TMZ. So it was like, you know, right at the beginning of all this stuff and all these like, for some reason, at the beginning of a bunch of gangsters got guns. And it was like, so you were like, you know, you were legitimately scared. Like you were going to either get robbed or like, you know what I mean? And then you just had a baby. So you're protective of the baby. You're like, get the fuck away from this baby, you know, have some respect and all this stuff. But I once then saw my, myself back, the reactions, pictures, me almost getting a fight with the paparazzi. And I was like, Oh, and I was looking at the camera. And I was like, Oh, it's not even, so nobody knows what he looks like. No one sees what I'm seeing. So all they're seeing is me being aggressive. And that's not me. So that's, you know, now I'm projecting an image of myself that I'm not. So then they changed my whole relationship with paparazzi. Then I, and I also didn't care at some point. I was just like, you're doing a job. And I, you know, but it's the old, you know, drink poison and expect someone else to die. You know what I mean? Wow. Yeah. So you're like, oh, you're eating yourself up for nothing. Right. But man, I mean, that you, you did, I mean, like, you're like the, one of the things like I was talking to a friend of mine, he's a famous guy, but he's like, you know, I just want to keep it right here. Right. He's like, I want to keep it right here. That's smart. That's smart guy. I don't want to go past that. Cause once you go past a certain point, yeah, that's it, man. You're got to live in gated communities. You got to like, you are isolated. Yeah. And you went through, I mean, you are like a sparking celebrity. You are in, you guys are on magazines at the grocery store and shit, you know? Yeah. We were on the bag once, which was awesome. So at all the airports, there's this one company that has a bag. And so the bag had the, the, like the cover of some magazine we were on. So that bag lasted longer than this cover did, and it traveled all through like the world. Wow. Which was funny. I mean, it's not really something to be proud of any stretch, but it was just funny to see the bag. I don't know. That's, see, to me, that, that stuff would start make, if anything was going to make me like, yeah, spin out that it's that, that's where I would start kind of losing it is like seeing my picture. Yeah. It does make you spin out a lot. There's this whole like, uh, it's just such a weird, weird game that we're in because, you know, every major like superstar that I've ever met has a narcissistic like element, like hardcore, like they really are really incredibly confident, incredibly kind of narcissistic and full of themselves. It's kind of like you revolve around their world. And I get that as an actor to be able to have that confidence. So you have to have that anyway, to perform, to step up, to take risks, to be sure of yourself. I mean, doubt doesn't work very well in performance because it just kind of, it's that negative voice that just starts attacking you, but confidence and being able to feel free enough to, you know, try to tap into something that's maybe closer to this character and grounded and reality and all that is something that's kind of pretty exciting, you know. And, uh, so I don't know, I, oh, this goes back to the narcissistic thing. So I once, I was obsessed. I was talking about this and, and I said to my therapist, I said, uh, do you have any narcissistic client? I mean, the patients and he said, no, you know why? I said, why? They don't need me. I was like, whoa, that's how like, so this guy is like, there's no, there's no remorse about like if our president cheated on his, you know what I mean? I will, if anything ever happens, be like, smash my head into a, you know, window. I mean, I have scars all over from like smashing my head through windows. For some reason, that was my go to because it always would end the fight. Like, I don't like to fight. So I'd be like, oh, you want to fight? Blood everywhere. Fights over. I didn't hit anybody. I don't, you know, except myself, but it was like this whole thing. For some reason, I was incredibly, you know, self abusive and like the pain there would take away the pain of like here or whatever. Wow. So you were a cutter, a bit of a cutter, but more of a smasher, like head smasher. What's the reaction of someone you're in a fight with? Something also people punch stuff all the time, break their hands. Like, it's that whole, like, you're turning it all inward. That's why you get depressed. This is fuck, man. But, you know, friends laughing, like enjoying life, children, like, I don't know how not to make life as stressful as it is. I mean, is your life, do you feel it stressful? See, I go to these Rom-Dos retreats. Thank God. Thank God. And like, they've taught me this mindfulness practice. My life is stressful. And I go into like, I don't smash my head through windows yet, though I'm going to remember that. It's a horrible thing. But, you know, the idea is it's like, we're going to, what it teaches you to wear your stock and it gives you the a way that you can forgive yourself for smashing your head in the window. Forgive yourself for the bullshit because it's like, that's just part of what we are. That's part of the pattern. And then it's the practice of mindfulness kind of teaches you to sort of put some space in between the thought forms and your actual identity, which is a soul, which is an infinite being that's having this very temporary experience as a human. And so, I mean, that being said, I'm still a fucking deep, deep, deep fried cunt. I mean, I can, you know what I mean. That's amazing. I went to this thing called the Hoffman, Hoffman practice or something, which is a retreat, which is really an interesting thing. It started in the 60s or 70s. They have them all over the world. The one I went to was a Napa. And it was pretty cool, man. It like you do all these things where you write a list of your resentments and all, you know, from you trace them as far back as you can and you list them all. Then you spend like days beating a pillow with like a waffle ball back. You just like boom, boom, like until you like, you say this one, like I kid that, you know, the teacher that brought me in front of, you know, school when I was in third grade and like, you know, made a fool of me or the teacher that may be reading in front of class and made me nervous about reading for the rest of my life, like stuff like that. So you just beat the hell out of it. And then you sort of address all your behaviors and, you know, all your resentments and all these things. You write letters and you write letters to your parents, even if they're alive or dead and you bury stuff and you do all this really interesting work. You just have a lot of silent time. Do you feel like it helped? It did help. Yeah, it helps. But I'm really bad at the ongoing practice of things. Yeah. I don't feel like, yeah, I like, I can learn it. I can do it. I like do it. It'll help me. And then I'll be back to my one kind of behavior and it's to a certain extent. I've gotten better though. I'm not as like, you know, making the same mistakes I've always made before. Well, that's the, yeah. And one of the things I love about the lineage I'm in is like the concept. It's like, some people might even see it as somewhat nihilistic because they're like, oh, no, no, no, you see, you, you, this, and this go around, you really, you really might not work out for you. Like it's, it's, because we keep doing this over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. So that he is like, don't, it's really not about being in a hurry. And it's really not about like, cause what starts happening is you begin to crucify yourself with your practice. So you have this idea of like, oh, here's where I'm good and now I'm the bad boy. Right. I know. I hate that. That's what my whole thing, one of my main like, uh, like psychological things I've had to get over in my life is wanting to be the good boy for my mom who like had such a rough life and family was so crazy and our family was so crazy that I'll be the good boy. Like I'll be the one she doesn't have to worry about. Yeah. And then like, you know, started getting crazy myself and doing crazy stuff and I'm not the good boy anymore. Then I'm bad. So if I'm the bad boy, let's go real bad. Like, yeah, let's go deep. You know, once I, I came home drunk and like, I had some DMT and my friends that, you know, have you ever smoked DMT? No, that's what I heard. It's pretty interesting. Well, it's amazing. And, but you know, the, the person who had shown me how to do it is like, and many people have attached to it. Really, it's a deep religious experience. It should perhaps be preceded by fasting, you know, something called a dieta. If you're going to do ayahuasca, pure cleansing, purification, prayers to, you know, like he, my friend who did it with me did this beautiful prayer. Like, you know, may, may, may this be like the jaguar that eats the bones of everything in the forest. May it eat your darkness and all this stuff is beautiful and sweet. I came home drunk and I'm like, fuck that, sappy, sentimental, fucking bullshit. What happens if I smoke this goddamn DMT when I'm drunk? I think I just eaten shit on stage. So I'm just like pissed. I'm like, I'm going to just smoke DMT in the wrong way, in the deep wrong way. So I smoke it and go into this space. And it's not like you, a voice talks to you, but you're something is conveyed to you. And what it was conveyed to me is we love you. You're the one who's saying that you're bad. You're the one who's saying this is horrible. You're the one who's putting all this heavy shit on you. This is just something you're doing. Do you think you can be bad? That was the concept is like, yeah, yeah, you're carrying that thing. And so this, the thing that, and I'm sorry guys, I've said this a few times because I love this book by Pima Children. It's called The Wisdom No Escape. In the very beginning of this book, she says, people think I'm going to start meditating to become a better person. Well, this is an aggression against the self that you are right now. We don't want to become better people. We want to become who we are and feel what we're feeling and being this thing right now. So it sort of like destroys the whole, that feeling of like, oh man, I'm really not doing it right now. I'm really, no, you're not, you're not doing it right now. And that is part of the practice to think that you're not practicing, but you're, you are, you're aware. You just watch like, oh yeah, right now I'm drinking a little too much. Right now, I'm a little depressed right now. I'm going to, and you just, that very simple shift from being in it to watching it. Wow, man. It like really does change things a little bit for me at least. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Watch the beer. Actually, I was kicking around the idea of a book. It's just such a cheesy title. You know, Ram Dass wrote a book called Be Here Now. I was thinking, drink beer now. A book about mindfully drinking. By the way, it's needed. It's needed. When I was in the Huffman, I was like, the whole thing was like, oh, I was drinking back then too. And you have to be sober from the whole experience and all that. And I was like, to drink maximum. Well, you know, I was, there's this teacher, Sharon Salzburg, and I was at one of these Ram Dass retreats. They let me interview them and I was saying to her like, well, I mean, what isn't meditation? You know, like I, at the time West World was running and they're all drinking whiskey on Westworld. So when Westworld came on, I pour like a stiff shot of whiskey and pretend I was like in Westworld drinking whiskey. And I was like, you know, isn't that a practice? And she was like, well, it's a practice, but you're practicing the wrong thing. So you don't want to get, you don't want to get delusional and fool yourself into thinking that that putting poison into your body is an actual method path. But simultaneously, instead of like doing that act, whether it's drinking or smoking or sex addiction or whatever the fucking thing it is, mindlessly, just add the element of watching yourself do it. The pre-drink, the feeling you get before you have the drink. You know, I'm talking about like being the moment as you're consuming the thing, you know, instead of trying to imagine that you just make it so you're not really a bad person anymore. Right. Totally. I mean, that is really that negative voice. The monkey that grabs that thought, you know, just run havoc through your brain is really the most dangerous of all the like things. Well, I think that's what we're pouring the booze on really is like that, that thing. And that thing just is going to jump in whenever it can. No matter you could be the most sober person on earth and the thing was going to pop in and like, well, that's, I mean, it's nofsu, Satan, you know, it's the thing that like it's the great imposter because it wants to be the center of attention. It's the root of all, it's the ultimate of narcissists, isn't it? Oh God, you want to hear the one of the worst narcissist stories? I'd love to. And this is like family genetic stuff. So my dad like wanted to be an actor, always tried out for the actor's studio. They never accepted him. So it was like this, dated the same girl as James Dean. Wow. She stole his jacket, a red jacket, and then James Dean borrowed it. That's the rumor that that happened. And then he had the costume director get one for Rebel without a cause. That's that's how the story goes. But it's all that time back in the 60s and like, early 60s in New York and all this stuff. So he never got accepted. And it was always kind of like, you know, weird for him. And so he's always trying and his dad was famous. So he's kind of like trying to, you know, do his own path, like to actor New York. So he gets a great play at Summerstock and he goes up and he's really excited about he invites his dad, his dad's at the height of his, his fame at this point. So he goes and they have a great first act and they go back and they're preparing for the second act and the years all this laughter and all that the whole room is like going crazy. And he peaks his head out and his dad had brought his Charlie Weaver costume, put it on and entertained the theater during intermission. It was just such a like, wow, that's like so crazy, like attention, like that's like the worst story I've ever heard. Like my dad like that stuck with him his whole career and like just kind of like, just this painful, painful thing. That is so fucked up. Mindless. That's robotic. That's sort of an automate. That's some kind of evil robotic move to do that. You just got to grab the attention. Oh my gosh, what is that? Oh, it's vampiric. Yeah, a narcissist is a vampire. Yeah, yeah, as a form of vampire. I think I think vamp vampirism is actually somewhat based on like, because they're narcissists. A vampire is a fucking narcissist. Sucks your blood, but they're also beautiful and like they draw you in. They're not like, you know, they suck you in, they're beautiful. They're like, they act like you they want you feel lucky to be in their presence. You know, and I you know, one of my dear friends, she like has dated narcissists and like she's like that's she gets sucked in by them and she's I mean, she's explaining it to me. And I'm like going fucking like white. And I said to her, I'm like, am I a narcissist? Please, please say no. She's like, you're not a fucking narcissist. The fact the fact that you asked tells you you're not a narcissist. But our narcissists would never ask if they were a narcissist. They wouldn't care. Well, they might as a form of manipulation. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yes, yes, they would care to like, because my friends at therapists, as he said, sometimes narcissists will get therapists, not because they need them, because they want to use them as another thing to impress with their, you know what I mean? Magic. Yeah, they're magic. I don't, you know, the young's idea of the shadow being reflected in the leader. Have you ever heard that? The civil is the society shadow can get reflected into the leader. Oh, this is so sad and scary for right now. Yeah. And that's the idea is like Trump is actually a reflection of the narcissistic personality disorder that's afflicted all of us. And he's like us. That's us prancing around up there. Right. I believe that. I believe that. And I think that's so we can learn. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. What not to be. What not to be. Yeah, exactly. And that's like, that Clooney would be better. No, I'm just kidding. Do you think he's going to run? No, no, I would want his wife to run. His wife to be president, him to be. But do you think that's going to happen? You think Clooney's kicking that idea around a little bit? No, I don't think so. But he is really such a nice, like great person. Like he really is one of the kind of people you mean. My brother's worked with him. My brother shoots video and Clooney took him out to like Africa because he doesn't work out there. And like, that's what my brother said. He's the sweetest guy on earth. You're the greatest guy. You are, man. Thank you so much for coming in and having this conversation. This is an honor. I love it. Likewise. Is there, how do people find you? What's coming up? I don't know. I just did a documentary called Survivors Guide to Prison, which is really look at the broken prison system. Amazing director Matthew Cook directed it. It did really well and people are watching it. It gives you little tips on if you encounter an out of control officer and whatnot. So what to do there? Yeah, it's on it's on iTunes right now and Amazon, but it'll be on Netflix soon. So that beautiful. Yeah. Amanda and Jacko Glamping just came out on Netflix. So beautiful. That's about it for now.

That was a track from Crystal Gale's new album, We Should Fuck on Acid, available on Matadex Records. You're listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's great to meet you, and you should know I've had two beers at lunch. So that means I'm. Yes. Dear friends, the person who's here with us today, I guess you could call him a multi-hyphenate. He is an explorer, world-renowned explorer who has written many books, the most recent Taints of the Ancients, an exploration of the Taints of the Pharaohs, and the history of Taints in the ancient world. I want to map this podcast out for you so you understand what you have in store for you as you contemplate whether or not to continue listening or move on to another podcast. Today, what you are going to get is a deep dive into what the world used to be like in ancient times. And that's the first hour. The second hour, we're just going to talk about politics. I know what you're thinking. Holy shit, that's awesome. No one's talking about politics right now. And I really would like to get a perspective on what's going on with the American elections. And that is exactly what you're going to get. While other podcasts out there are focusing on things like the interesting shine of light as it passes through swarms of monarch butterflies drifting through the forest, while other podcasts out there are covering things like the interestingly subtle way that vines intertwine with ancient automobiles rotting in forbidden wastelands, that's Clint C. Armada's podcast Vine Talk. And while I know so many other podcasts to the point where I'm honestly embarrassed to even mention it or talking about baby sloths and how cute they are, as far as I'm aware, there is no podcast out there right now that is covering the American election, the election cycle. And I get email after email after email after email from folks saying, I'll just read one to you. Dear Duncan, I love your podcast. I really enjoy it. It's hilarious, probably the funniest podcast I've ever listened to. It helped me meet my wife. And ever since I started listening, I've been going to these incredible orgies and Bavarian basements and just getting banged down, dipped, dripped, and lap licked. And my guns puffed almost all the time thanks to your podcast. But I just want to offer a little bit of advice to you, which is maybe you should be the podcast that covers the American election cycle and politics, because there's just nothing out there doing it. And I thought about this for a while, and I realized, you know what? Why not? Why not be original? Why not be unique and take the leap into politics? Because I'm sure so many of you would like to hear it, which is why the very last hour of this podcast, there's going to be a break in between the Taint Talk when we dive into American politics. And you can decide if you want to listen. I understand if you don't. A lot of people are afraid of politics. Most people don't want to get into political conversations about politics. But if you want to dive in, if you got the guts and you want to take a deep dive into some pretty hard core and brilliant political theory by two comedians, then that's going to be the last hour of this podcast. And you're going to be so glad you listened. We're going to jump right into this. But first, some quick business. You know, I'm sitting here in my office, and I've been thinking to myself, God, that fucking candle that I brought in here sucks. And I started getting really angry at it. Like, have you ever gotten angry at an inanimate object? You know, I'm like pissed off. I'm thinking about like the grocery store I bought it from and how it was in a discount aisle. And I'm like, well, that's what you get for buying a discount candle. It's going to smell like dog shit. And then I just realized I have dog shit on my shoe. And so that explains the stink. It was like, I was so confused because it's like, God, Jesus, that fucking candle. How does it smell so bad? But nope, it's my dog's shit that I stepped on on the way to work today. And you know what that means for you? It means that I'm not going to do too much more this intro because you just don't understand the smell in here. Because now that I know what the smell is, as long as I thought it was a candle, it was kind of tolerable. I could sit here and think, you know, that's just a candle. That's a cheap candle. Now that I understand the thing I'm inhaling came out of my dog's ass, but it's mixing in with a pungent tang of a discount candle. It is producing a smell so vile that it makes me think of HP Lovecraft. It makes me think of ancient things. It makes me think of opening up some alien cube that has within it an egg that was laid there by something so vile that it eats planets, that it, a planet eating horror beast that laid an egg in some kind of celestial cube designed to incubate demon eggs is what it smells like in here. It's pungent and shitty and awful. And really I gotta take care of it. I can't just keep commenting on it. I've got to take action. But come on, how many of us do that? We spend all our lives doing some kind of review of our lives without getting rid of the fucking Cthulhu egg. We've got to get rid of this dog shit off my shoe. So we are gonna jump right into this podcast. But first, I will endure this stink a little bit longer to invite you to come home to your family. Join us over at patreon.com Ford slash D T F H. You dive in there. We just had our family gathering. We have it every single week. We'll all get together and talk. It's fun. Wednesday, it's our House of Leaves book club. You could sign up for the Patreon and join the book club. You're gonna have to catch up in House of Leaves. And by the time you get to the part that we're at in the book, you will have gone insane. But that's okay, because all of us are feeling the psychic poisoning that that book offers you. And on Tuesdays, we have our journey into boredom, which is a weekly group meditation. Not only that, you'll have access to the Discord server. Once you sign up, we'll get you a link where you can meet your beloved family who will comfort you, care for you, wipe the tears from your eyes, lotion you down, comb your hair, put in a nipple ring or two, give you a tramp stamp, sew your clothes up if they're ripped, and hopefully, sew your heart up. Or if you want your heart broken, they can break it for you. No matter what you want, you will find it in the sweet valley of love and glory that is the DTFH Family Discord. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We also have a shop located at dunkintrussell.com. Now, without further ado, I would like to introduce you in case you haven't been listening to the podcast that long to one of the most requested guests on the DTFH. As I mentioned before, he's an Egyptologist. He's an author who just published a wonderful book, Taints of the Ancients. It's available on Penguin, I believe, as the publisher. And not only that, he is a brilliant comedian. If you've seen me live, you've probably seen Johnny Pemberton perform because he comes on the road with me quite a bit, thank God. All the links you need to find Johnny are gonna be at dugintrussell.com. You gotta check out his Twitch stream. It's happening three times a week. All those links will be on my website or Google Johnny Pemberton. Either way, I wanna remind you that at the end of the hour-long interview regarding his new book, there's gonna be a tiny moment, a pause. There's gonna be a kind of, the sound of like claws scraping against obsidian. And then we're going to dive in to an hour of political discourse, which, as I mentioned before, you're not gonna find anywhere else. So if you wanna talk politics with two comedians who came up in the LA comedy scene, a completely novel idea here, then stick around for the last hour. We love you. By we, I mean the many robed monks that are in my office right now sitting behind me, many of them vomiting from the stink of the dog shit fumes rising up in my office. And now, please, everyone, open your third eye and send those glorious beams of rainbow blessing eye light through the net of Indra, the interconnected, tendril-like network that brings us all together in the astral plane so that this very moment, Johnny Pemberton can feel that butter-like love blast, those invisible yet very, very, very present sprays of your metaphysical love juices as they rain down upon him. Welcome to the DTFH podcast, Johnny Pemberton. [""Wake Up, Johnny Pemberton""] Welcome upon you that you are with us Welcome to the DTFH podcast Welcome to the DTFH podcast Welcome to the DTFH podcast Welcome to the DTFH podcast Johnny, I know we only have three hours, so I want to cut to the heart of this podcast, which is that I have in front of me a CIA interrogation manual that has 10 questions that they would ask people they were interrogating, and there's no right answer, it's free association, but from that I can extrapolate a lot about you in retrospect, later on when I analyze the data set. So I thought that if you're willing, I would ask you a few of these questions, and all you have to do is free, I will ask the question, you free associate the answer. So how much free association should I do, like a sentence, a paragraph? Hold on, let me see if I can find the answer to that. A speech, maybe like a word? Let me see, hang on. Okay. The interrogate T should be allowed to continue answering until they feel uncomfortable. So how does the person asking me questions know when I feel uncomfortable? You just have, I have to trust you to stop, I guess. So you tell, you tell, I'm supposed to know that it's making me uncomfortable? When you start feeling uncomfortable answering, then you just stop and I'll ask the next question. You could say, I feel uncomfortable now, and then we'll ask the next question. But you know, I have like a significant amount of experience feeling uncomfortable, so I could probably go for hours before I feel uncomfortable. Well, think about like a person, like a normal person. Like, you know what I mean? Like imagine like a normal person who's been captured by the CIA, like when they would feel uncomfortable. Do they know they're captured, or do they just think they're like in waiting for the, to have like to pick up a prize check or something, you know? No, according to the manual, this is used for prisoners. Usually you would, like in, in this case. Okay, a prisoner, like in a black box site. I don't know what this means, but it says like in the first, in the beginning of like how to handle a prisoner, it says they should be shackled to a green table. But obviously that's not gonna happen one soon. I mean, green table, I would actually make me more relaxed, but let's just go for it. You're an actor, just imagine you're shackled to a green table. A medium-sized bright light should be shined in their face. The temperature in the room should be 79 degrees. It's pretty specific here. Okay, I got a blight in my face. Okay, and you, you're shackled to a green table. I guess there's a metallic loop at the end of the table. I'm assuming that's what you're shackled to. A classic like police table where they do the confession breaker. I'm thinking, I don't know why, but green marble. Like this has gotta be, you can't pull the table over. It's gotta be heavy. It's gotta be like, you know, in the very least, it has to be deeply anchored. It's gotta be significant. Yeah, it's a significant green table. It's gotta have heft. It's gotta have weight. It's gotta have depth. It's gotta have the opposite of breath. Yeah. Would you say it's got it? It's bereft of breathness. Yeah, there's nothing bereft about this table. It's a, There's nothing bereft about it. I think as a prisoner, if you were to, to, to see the table, you would just get this overwhelming sense of insignificance. Like if you were sitting next to a monolith or something at an Atlantis. Yes. Just a feeling of like I, I'm a crustacean here. What, what, I don't, I have no meaning. I have no purpose. Okay. So are you ready? See, okay. So hold on one second. Let me turn that off. So Siri turn off lie detector. So here's the first question, number, question number one, three children are buried up to their necks in mud next to a frozen lake. One of the children looks out at the frozen lake and says, tomorrow our philosophy will begin. The child next to that child says, I feel the incoming tide. The third child closes her eyes and weeps. Okay. I'm thinking about permafrost. The idea that the tides would be affected by the permafrost is going to be something to consider here. And I'm having trouble remembering what the first child said. So I'm just thinking a lot about how it's probably actually warmer in the mud. And so they're probably really comfortable because it sounds like they're speaking from a place of comfort. So these might not be children at all. These might be star children. And so I'm thinking like this is an omen of, this is a good omen basically. Because anytime you have three flying frozen stars, which those star children represent, that's a triple, that's a stack of suns. So that's going to create a gravitational field. And so the fact that she mentions a tie when the lake is frozen and they're in mud, that just tells me that we're in an off-world universe here. And so it's kind of all bets are off because it's obviously a chaotic period. So it's just a matter of waiting for a stable period. Guess what I'm thinking about, yeah. Mostly think about this sound. Mm-hmm, mm-mm, mm-mm. What the fuck? That's what I think about. Are you uncomfortable yet? You have to feel uncomfortable. I can't get there to feel uncomfortable. I could manifest uncomfortableness. All right, I feel uncomfortable. I feel uncomfortable. Okay. Next question. Got it. A trapeze is situated above a circus filled with gypsy women. Okay. They are all naked. Uh-huh. On the trapeze, a mime gesticulates while flapping his large penis against his taint and navel. Uh, I gotta say one thing. Uh, wish I was a mime. I wish I wouldn't mind being, I wouldn't mind filling in his shoes. It's probably a size 13. And that's a, that's a lucky number in this case. Um, man, you just go to 13 is a lucky number. 13 is a lucky number. I gotta say that, you know, just the, just the idea of being, uh, with a bunch of gyps, naked gypsies in a tent, because you know, Wait a minute. It didn't say that they were naked. Yeah, it did. You said, no, it didn't. No, who says, who's not say that just the mime. No, you said that the women are naked gypsies. There's no indication in the, in the reading of them, of the gypsy women being, uh, naked. People who, okay, well, you're going to be made a fool once the tape rolls. Um, well, either way, in my pre-association, I'm like, these, these, these naked gypsy women are naked and they're just down to clown with the mime, with the big old wrangled dangle, who's about to smack and spray until the cows come home. We're going to light this tent on fire. I'm going to do some elevated drop downs with a full on, um, like a hanging hard on. We're going to be doing some sort of perpendicular pumping straight into these, uh, these traveling ladies. Disgusting. Uh, wet ass presses. That's so gross, man. You want a gross mime? You know what? See, that's my all my feel weird. That's where your mind goes. That your mind goes to that. Like when I think about this, I think of art. I think of the sanctity of art. I think about a delicate marble statues. I think about gardens. I think about, um, herbarium, but I think about the wet garden of the ovarium, ready to be, uh, seated by, by this, by the Stingy. Oh, gross. By the nasty mime who comes to town once a year to, uh, to sort of diversify the crop of human flesh. How gross, Johnny. Like you sexualized that, but that's, look, I'm not going to shame you for that. One more. Here's another one. You said taint though. So what, what did I say? You said taint. So to you, taint is a sexual term. Well, yeah, I think it's exclusively sexual. Not to me. Well, I say perineum when I'm at the doctor's office. Well, I, I don't have your kind of insurance. My doctor says taint. Well, you got a taint problem here, Trussell. My doctor's like, let me see your taint. All right. Get the britches off. Let's take a look at your taint. Oh, you've been biking a lot. I can tell. What kind of bike you got? Is it, is it a mountain bike? Oh, this isn't a mountain bike. I got a road bike. I can see that from here. That is so funny, man. It's such a weird coincidence. So we're watching the new season of Dayline and they, so they find a body in the national forest, a biker. They're assuming the, there's no bike around, but he's in Lycra. And so they take the corpse and they do the autopsy and the, uh, the, the forensic specialist, the pathologist, or whatever you call it. What do you call it? Uh, I guess you call him a, I guess you call him a corner or not the corner. Corner. Yeah. The coroner, a medical examiner. That's what they're called. The medical examiner does a measurement of their taint. Yes. And just like you're saying, they were able from the imprint of the bike seat to take that and like from the taint cast a mold of a tiny piece of the bike seat, which then they were able to use to identify the bike. And then they were able to look at the local, uh, bike shops. And so they went to a bike shop showing the imprint from his taint, his taint. Yeah. And they, uh, were able to like locate, uh, who he was because he paid for with a credit card. So that's how they identified the body. Oh wow. That's interesting. So that's all they found out is who it was. Yeah, that's it. They don't even know how he died. That's what's weird about it is it's just like a dude in Lycra. He's dead and like they just measured his taint and they found out who he was. It's so weird. That's why the taint is where it is because it's hidden away because it's it's called the fingerprint of the soul. Was that what I've heard that? Yeah. Because it's been used by modern science to identify, but also as far back as the Sumerians were using the taint is basically like, it's like almost like an RFID chip where you know how you scan, you get a retinal scan stuff. That's all based on taint logic where you would, you know, you would go up because it's really hard to, uh, you know, to like, you know, the whole idea of yoga, why it was invented. Who invented it? Well, I just learned reason that yoga was quote unquote invented. So people who meditated could sit in uncomfortable positions for a very long time. And so it's like to train your body so you can do that. But evidently that's not true. That's like a, that's like revisionist history. Yeah. It's actually like an offshoot of the Sumerian empire where yoga was taught. So you could raise your, uh, leg above your head very quickly so you could be identified by your taint. Oh, right. Yeah. I think about that a lot, man. Like, you know, the these days were so lucky because like photo ID, retinal scans, fingerprints, but there was a time when you couldn't really take a picture of someone. There was no way to like, so what you would, it makes sense that you would want to find some sort of like unique identifier and what is more unique than that, you know, acreage between the genitals and the anus, the acreage here. Yeah. That sacred swath of a kind of hidden grove. That's what the word sacred actually comes from. Sacrum. Sacrados. No shit. Yeah. Which just comes from, that's why it's called the sacrum, sacrados, sacred, same thing, same word. It's all the same, baby. It's all just one little, just all one little dude who's just what, what do you think Johnny is the reason that the taint has become a kind of taboo compared to the times that you're describing when, you know, if you were just going through a checkpoint or probably if you wanted to buy some marble or grain, grain, or like, uh, maybe some molasses or, uh, me possibly a horse to implement a horse and you wanted to buy that on credit. Uh huh. You would just lift your very flexible leg and just show your taint and be like, this is my, but this is my badge of honor. Why, you know, why do you think since then the taint is almost an unmentionable part of the human anatomy? It's just a classic, uh, top down power control structure. It's just a high control group that has become the, the governments of the world. It's, uh, it's just, uh, you know, it's, it's a type of thing where if you make something shameful, then it decreases its value. Right. So it becomes, uh, something where only it can be dealt with in the black market. And then you can control this by having a system of laws and, and, um, you know, the police and all these things like that. Why do you think these, these indecent exposure laws are so heavily, um, police and why it's like such an outrage for that? It's not, it's not a coincidence. Let's take a, let's take a moment to really consider, uh, the economy of the body. Uh huh. That's a good way to describe it. The economy of the body. So yeah, if we, you know, if we had to, uh, I guess you could say create a map of the human body, uh, the nose, the eyes, the nipples, the taint and assign value to them, what do you think would be the monetary value of a taint, uh, one human taint and how much do you think the monetary value of one human nipple would be and explain your answer? This is in the CIA interrogation. Have you seen the movie Akira? No, I have not. Okay. Well, uh, I, I think a lot of you listeners probably have. It talks about the idea that the, the atomic power of even the smallest object has, uh, like if you split an atom, that's a, that's a nuclear bomb. And that's just one at, so, uh, think of how many atoms are in your taint and basically it's how many atoms are in an average taint. Oh, I have no way of guessing. I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not an engineer. Hang on, I'll Google it, right? I'll Google it. Hang on. If you combine that with the idea that, um, seven atoms, sorry to cut you off. I just lost my train of thought here, but Akira, no, you're saying like the atom is, uh, the power of the atom. If we split one atom, we can cause a nuclear blast. Oh, you know what I was thinking about is, you know, the idea of the, the sovereign citizens movement. Yeah. If you combine that, the idea of Akira and the sovereign citizens movement, the side of the sovereign citizens movement is just about the innate wealth of the body and how we're all worth millions of dollars because of our taints, but the government seeks to deny us that and, and that is true. By the way, if we, like, if we, so think in terms of like, how much does a hellfire missile cost, right? It's 200, $200,000. So, and that's just a simple missile. How much does a, uh, gar, garfielder cluster bomb cost? Right. That's $638,000. How much does a Magnus Sam missile site cost? How much? It cost 3.2 million. Yeah. God damn. Wow. Yeah. I know I, I like how much does a, uh, uh, one of those, um, uh, catastrophe terraniums, that new, like crystal bomb. The MRAC with the laser guided Garver system. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't even know that price is five million. That's an option, the Raptor program, which is Raptor program. It's obviously, as you know, is just a smoke screen for the, for the Garver, the Garver control system. Yeah. The Raptor program I've heard, they, there's nothing even in the program. The entire program is just a, not just a smoke screen for Garver, but also a smoke smoke screen for that, um, the Devish warp project that, uh, Oh, we shouldn't be talking about that right now. Honestly. So that, so let's bring it back to the taint. Yeah. So if these incredibly advanced systems that do compared to like an atomic bomb, less damage, maybe more focused damage, but less damage, if they are so incredibly expensive, then how much would just any average Joe's taint when weaponized be worth? That's what you're talking about in the sovereign movement. It's something that's been speculated a lot. I think there's a lot of people who've talked a lot about, I'm trying to think here and try to remember some names, but, um, people have said that, um, God, I think that, uh, I'm trying to remember his name right now. Well, um, John Deerfield, who is someone who has said a lot about this, um, you know, you've got, um, call Stunk Monkey, Dave Rainwest, um, Collander Buck and, uh, Collander Buck. Yeah. Call him on Hannity, by the way, does not, I saw a buck on Hannity. Oh, you did. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Collander is, uh, someone who has set us upwards of $1 billion. So that's a lot right there. And that, that makes sense. Why all these numbers are coming together because every sovereign citizen is a billion. We don't hear this because if a sovereign citizen reckoned, like you take a value of a human taint, I think that's overpriced, to be honest. But I, you know, I think it is somewhere in the 800,000 million range. But I mean, that's all, it's all speculation here because everything changes so much. So because the markets, yeah, the market, because like, you know, you, if you wanted to buy like, uh, an indigenous taint in the time of Columbus, that's going to be like a, uh, probably 50 bucks or something like that. Well, that's the price that they put on it. Yeah. That's what Columbus put on the tank. Yeah. He was the first person to, uh, downmarket those first person to like, basically devalue something that was, was previously priceless. And he put a value on it, which was, you know, it's devious, but it's genius. It's fucked up. One of the many horrible things he did. And when you, this is that moment in every school kid's life. When you, if you, like, when you're, when you really hear the truth about Columbus and you hear that he did not have a taint. No, he was taintless. He actually, uh, he actually pissed and shit out of the same hole, which was really hard for him. That's actually why he left Europe because he was ostracized so much. And he, he was so dead sad. I'm finding a way to turn this around that no way to, they call that read the book, the invisible Columbus by Bertrand Kroger. It's an incredible book, but it talks about how being completely unable to identify himself via his taint, having no taint would be the equivalent of non-person, non-person. Yeah. I mean, I think Crone, how do you test his test has talked about that as well. But that was, you know, that was turn of this entry and a lot of that stuff didn't get translated. So, but it's, it's, it's so true that these, these non people are the ones who are exercising the most damage across these, are these societies. And it's really something where there has to be a test for one holders out there that's, yeah. They're, you know, the one holder movement is, you know, look, they, they talked about it, which you knew Columbus was around way before you saw him because the stench, the stench of that leathered taint that he would, because he was, you know, he's known for many horrible things, hacking the arms off of people, spreading disease, being a mongrel, rapist, pirate. But a lot of people don't know that he was actually repurposing stolen taints and stretching them out in, in that, like whatever that undersection, that undergun area. Well, he called it the leather rose. That's what he called it, which is nuts. Cause he like apparently just, it was like the, the combination of like just shit and rotting stretched out, like poorly tanned taint. Cause he didn't want to, he didn't apparently, like, if you, if you, whatever the leathering process is, I'm not sure. What is that? Well, it's tanning. You put it out to out in the sun with chemicals and stuff. You tan it and it creates, if you take it and you stitch it, well, you can create a rose-like shape. There's this, it's a leather, a leather rose. They say the leather rose, the captain's room and in his ship was like, they were apparently like these fucking human skull bowls that were filled with these like, like tanned taints. Yeah. It was a taint tanner and he did that. He just went to the ends of the earth. All because, you know, there's no, you know, the movie Citizen Kane. Of course. I watch it every two days. Yeah. I watch it every week. I'm as good as you. But, you know, he's trying to find Rosebud, that name Rosebud. That's what that is. Citizen Kane is supposed to represent Columbus because Columbus was so sad because he just didn't have a leather rose, which was what they used to refer to as the taint back then, the leather rose. The leather rose. We're going to jump back with taint historian Johnny Pemberton. But first this. Great. Boom, boom.

So let's talk a little bit about the process of tanning a human taint. These days, it's a lost art, obviously for like it's it would be very illegal. I would love to know what's the basic process you would use if you did have if you'd come upon a taint and you wanted to tan it to, you know, to use Columbus's style to make a leather rose. Yeah, I think it's you have to have a very specific pH of urine. That's how it starts off with, because the thing with the natural taint is it is it is tanned. It is a leather rose. It was called leather rose because that's how it appeared to be deprimitive people. It was like it was like a rose. It had it was layered. It was tough, but soft. Yeah. And it was it was very fragrant and a rose. But not I wouldn't call it fragrant. Fragrance is a taint from antiquity. I would not want to smell. I wouldn't want you know what I mean? Think of the stench of an ancient taint. I would say that stench would be a more modern word to use, but fragrant is something that gives off a scent. So fragrance not necessarily mean good. This is something I, you know, I know that there's an entire science devoted to smells we've lost and the smells of the ancients. And this is to me like I would love to know, do you ever feel a sorrow that you might never smell an ancient taint? Oh, every day. I every day I wake up with an emptiness that is not knowing ever. I'll never be sure of anything I smell. I'll never know if this is this is an authentic smell or this is something that's been manufactured by the powers that be to trick my senses into thinking that I am in the correct portion of the multiverse. So yeah, it's something I struggle with because I struggle with it. What do you mean the multiverse? You mean like you feel like we can use not just the visual of a taint, but the aroma of a taint to identify where we are in the quant and the multiverse? A lot of people say that, you know, it's this thing where, you know, how dogs are so happy. Yeah. Well, they can smell really good. Oh, wow. Sense of place. Sense of place in not just the universe, but the multiverse. So when it, wow, that's why they go for the balls. Yeah. Because they that's where the richness is. That's where the most I'll say it again, most fragrant zone is. And so it's just the most information. And they. Um, I'm loving your book, Taints of Antiquity. And, uh, when I got to the part where you had convinced, uh, the Egyptian leaders at the time to let you smell King Tut's Taint in that moment of victory, when they opened the sarcophagus and you were able to, can you just describe that moment because for, I was, I was crying when I read it, just to, to know that like finally you would at least get some sense of what an ancient taint might smell like. It was, uh, it was exceptional. It was something where, uh, first I didn't think it was going to happen. I applied about three years every day for three years and I kept getting rejection letters and I tell me about that first rejection letter because that one was brutal, vicious. And if I'd gotten that, I wouldn't have, I don't think I would have continued. Well, they didn't reply for a year, but then the first actual letter was, it was a novel, it was an entire thousand page novel, uh, that they hired a team of writers in, uh, they hired a bunch, hired a group of Wekar Muslims, uh, holy shit, under enslave like conditions to write a thousand page novel, completely down dressing me. And I was forced thousand, like I've gotten many rejection letters in my time, but a thousand page down dressing from slave labor. Do you remember any passages that, uh, that hurt, do you remember the passages that hurt the most? Uh, they called me a mendicant, a fraud, a silly heart, a do nothing, a puff waster, a scant critic, a gully walk, a dunk tester, a shame wagon, a gel fester, they called me a ronus eyed, rudus bee. They called me, why would you keep writing though? I, if I'd gotten, they even called me bitch, swill. So, but I moved past me that I don't know how you would do that. Cause you knew that at the other end of your journey would be the, uh, the, the leathered rows of King Ted. Here's what I knew. Why would they spend that much time to down dress me if they weren't hiding something very important? So I was about to give up when I got that rejection novel. I was like, Oh, I doubled down. I tripled down and I started going hard in the paint, contacting everyone I knew in the community outside the community. I set up a coffee shop in, uh, Canada just to make money to, uh, finance my trip and, um, they actually became very successful. Now it's, now it's franchise. It's called red dot wonder. And, um, so, uh, what happened is long story short, I was able to get access secretly and when I was there and they were able to open the sarcophagus, which was at midnight on a Tuesday. Why midnight? Because it's the time when there's the least magnetic energy where they're storing it. I can't talk about where that, where it is obviously, uh, but it, that particular place in the, uh, and on the earth, it's the lowest amount of magnetic energy. So it's the least chances of there being a, um, a quark blip and I smelled it. And what happened was, wait, wait, wait, I, I, I want to get into this, that smell, but you know, in the book, when you talk about the sound of that sarcophagus opening, when you talk about that moment where you were seconds away, from pushing up the mummified balls of King Tut and smelling that the taint of a pharaoh, just talk about that. Cause the way you described that moment will, will be with me forever. Have you ever listened to Balinese gamelan? Yeah, of course. Okay. It basically sounded like that when, uh, when they lifted it up, I heard this sound and it sounded like it was coming from inside my mouth, like it was ready and through my jaw. And it was that, that clink clink clink clink clink clink clink. It was like this, uh, a thousand sounds at once, all harmonizing in this perfect seven, eight rhythm. And, um, I basically had to, what happened was, it was a frozen time and I lived in that moment for what appeared to me a lifetime. I experienced a lifetime, a lifetime, a lifetime, but you mean like you were frozen for a lifetime or you left your body and you were able to do things? I left, I went into like a, I was, I sort of, I went into like a gray zone and then I was born, lived and died an entire life of a, um, a beetle. Those, uh, a scarab beetle. Well, the entire life is a scarab beetle. Was it a trap? Was it like a trap in the, in the sarcophagus to freeze people? Is it a message? Was it a warning? I think it was a message. I think it was also a warning, but I don't think it was a trap because there was no way to get out of it. So it was just something where they, they make you experience this journey in order to smell the thing. Cause once you smell the taint, you have this full lifetime of knowledge going into it and that informs what you smell. So this is the, so to me, and again, this is like right now, the folks over at Google, the folks working on the quantum computers, apparently some folks at Apple, Mike, all the technologists are right now, uh, beginning to understand that the taint is more than just an identifier. It's a storage unit. It's a, it has within it some kind of the code of the taint. That's your second book, but yeah. Well, this is, Harper Collins is still editing that, but that's going to be out probably a spring 2021. And this again, it's like, this is this sudden, wild realization that anyone who has a taint has access to a reservoir of data that, so again, okay. So there, so you lean into the sarcophagus, what, and what did it, what did those balls feel like? They didn't feel like a whole lot. I felt a lot of balls and, uh, you know, you have to fill a lot of balls in my field. They just felt very, um, you know, insignificant, not special, but I think that's sort of the idea is that. Like Krusty though, or they like, I just mummified, I mean, you know, my, my experience with balls has been living vibrant, warm, musky balls. But, uh, uh, like the, an ancient scrotum. Talk about sort of like a really, really heavy, thick piece of unsalted beef jerky, like just really thick, like four inches, uh, and diameter. It appeared to be one testicle as well. And just like, like just dried, dried elk or beef or some type of, maybe more of like a venison type thing, cause it wasn't a lot of fat, but just very tough, but it's still moved. It was like flexible. Any fumes, any sense of what the taint was going to smell like at that moment. So not just no smell. No, it's like a perfect blocking of it. What, once you move it, what it does is it creates a vacuum and then when you pick up the causes this thing to happen where it creates the vacuum and then once it releases, it puffs out like almost like a spore from a mushroom. You know, have you seen like the slow motion videos of the mushrooms pours ejecting? Yeah. It's like that basically. Got it. So it's a seal. It's a seal, but it also has like a blast assistant, like a, um, like a, uh, what do you call it, a jellyfish. Do you think part of the reason that the mainstream scientific, uh, community, that the mainstream media that shifty shift, that the lying liberal lunatic mob that AOC and the, uh, demonic Democrats in Egypt kept you away from smelling King Tut's taint was because they felt humiliated and embarrassed to this entire time, their search through the pyramids, their search in the Sphinx, their search in the sands of Egypt for hidden knowledge had all been a waste of time. And that the wisdom of Egypt was always there in that taint. Absolutely. They're just a bunch of tank crankers. They're a bunch of perineum pirates. They're just, uh, netherbethers. They're crank riders. They're a bunch of cusp lovers. And all of this, everything you said is totally correct. And, uh, you know, that's why I can't speak publicly in most states anymore is boy, you just said, because they control all of that. Uh, well, this is to me the most horrifying thing about it, because if we're living in a world where intellectuals like you are being suppressed by shifty shift in the shift show and the lying liberal media mob by catalog carriers and these carpet bagging bum weathers, can you tell me a little bit about the encounter you had with shifty Adam shift in Egypt when he found out that you had gotten to smell the pharaoh's taint? Well, he was out there doing, doing a scrape test of the weather patterns just so we could do some fucking bootlicking on old Jabba Jasson. And because I find these obvious guys to just be their, their tumble ducks. Yeah. Their wick weather, their wick weather tumble ducks who wouldn't recognize a frame center if they got caught in a down center on a, on a downpouring wick weather, pouring wick weather day. I mean, they're, they're, they're, they're shunting. Yep. They're pulling off, uh, gunthouses and they all they're, they're eating Gorgon gunge all day, every day. Now, why does shifty Adam shift and the lying liberal media mob, the perpetrators of fake news, these people along with, why did they want to keep the world from smelling taints? They want to do that because they're just, you know what? They're jealous of the freedom. They, they hate our freedom. They are, they want everything good for themselves. It's just a bunch of freedom haters who refuse to show their cards. They're playing a poker game and they won't show their cards. That's all we're asking. Just say, we just say, show your cards, show your cards and the lying liberal, um, media mob, the line, liberal, media mob, the LLMM. Now, I feel like we got off track here a little bit after this, after this commercial break, when we get back, I want you to tell me what it was like to finally smell King Tut's taint. We're here with Johnny Pemberton, author of Taints of the Ancients. He is a Egyptologist, scientist, actor, comedian, and all around brilliant person who has been lambasted by the lying, the lying, liberal, media mob, an AOC and shifty Adam shift and the shift show. We will be right back after this. God bless the dear alchemist it feels, not just for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH, but for sending me the best CBD on earth.

Well, it's really hard to describe because the experience I had was something beyond description. It is. Have you seen the movie contact? Yes, I have. Very good. OK, remember how she goes up in that special space liberal space ball? Yeah, I remember that. All the liberal, the lying liberal media mob. Me and my using all their communist funds that they stole from from like, you know, people like Eric early and and yep, and, you know, always good, hardworking. They still they took money off the backs of good, hardworking folk in America. They sure did. Good, hardworking people, you know, good, hardworking, really fat people who work really hard so they can be really, really fat and, you know, kind of stumble around on a. It's so interesting to me that in the elite lying liberal media mob, so excited about their bank account balances, simultaneously shame people because they have a caloric balance being held in the bank account of their cellular tissue, which the lying liberal mob, shifty shift in the shift show, AOC and the liberal elites. The squad and the squad, as we started on the squad. Yeah, all of them lapping and drooling like dogs around the bowl at the thought of the Green New Deal, what I like to call the Green Doom deal. Well, they're just a bunch of lip lapping lap lockers. The lip lapping lap lockers, also known as the lying media mob, the frenetic frenzy led by people like AOC, Bernie Sanders, and all the other radical left, Antifa loving, lying liberal media mob, the Antifa friendly fanatics that want George Soros, a.k.a. lying liberal, lackluster lap liquor, media mob man. Meanwhile, Donald Trump pushing back hard against this mob. Tell me, Johnny, do you think a time will come to this country where we can at last without being impended, impeded or embargoed by the Egyptian authorities? Will there come a time when we can freely smell mummified taints? Not just in Egypt, but the great mummified taints of the world. Reservoir of data of the ancients being kept to us by the lying liberal media mob. Do you see a future where we will at last be able to smell those taints? You have 30 seconds before we have to cut to a break. Well, right now, I really am not sure because with this election coming up, there's just so much meddling going on by these dastardly lying liberal media mobbers that I wonder if it's going to be stolen. And if it is, I don't see there being another change for it. It's going to be there four years before we get a chance to actually uncover some truths here without it being spun and spanked away by these by these ancient cragging, lying liberal communist. Phillyfals, we're going to cut to commercial and we come back live footage from Donald Trump at a Trump rally in Tennessee. I want to thank Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

You just know, you know that what's saying is being the truth. I just am freaking sick of all this crap. They're, they're trying to take the calories out of my bones, okay? The communists are going to take your shoes in the night. Donald Trump has guaranteed me I'll have as many shoes as I want. And we're back with Johnny Pemberton. That was a cut to the Donald Trump rally in Tennessee. You have run into more problems than dealing with the Egyptian authorities when it comes to getting a chance to sniff that old taint. Talk a little bit about some of the traps you've encountered in the Mesopotamian pyramids, the Amazonian pyramids and the other ancient structures that you, Indiana Jones style, had the guts to go into. You've encountered several traps. What do you think is the most deadly trap? Tell us about it. Well, there was one, the most, the worst trap was one I just didn't see coming at all. I was staying at a hostel in San Jose, Costa Rica. And I was staying on a different name, I was staying at the name Bill Jasson. With like Jackson. Is that your, is that a pseudonym that you use sometimes? Well, I don't use it anymore. You'll never hear that again. Bill Jasson, it's like Jackson with S's. Bill Jasson. Got it, okay. And I was, there was a Scottish guy there named Peefrow. And he had a bunch of reggae records he had just got from Puerto Rico. And he was traveling, a lot of the Scottish guys, they travel a lot. He was a traveling barber, actually. And he offered to cut my hair because that's how he makes his living, how he makes living traveling. Interesting. Sure, I'd love to have a haircut because, you know, the line liberal media won't open the salons up. So I can't. Shifty shift keeps them shut. Yeah, shift shuts down the frickin' salon so I can't get my hairs cut. On my chinny chin chin or anything else. So I said, I'll let Peefrow give me a haircut. And he's like, so who do you want to put on his reggae records on? So I was like, yeah, sure, go ahead and put on a reggae record. Because I've actually was a big fan of reggae. My second wife banned me from reggae for about 10 years, which was hard for me. Red flag. She said she would actually slice the tip of my dick off if I listened to reggae in front of her. That is a red flag. Yeah, it believed me. I didn't know that until we were married for a year. But I found out that she was a reggae apologist and she actually, while I was sleeping, she razored off the three layers of cells on the tip of my dick. Circumcised you. No, not just the tip, like the tip where the hole is. Wow. Yeah, and it's OK. It's all chapped up. It's actually stronger now. Really strong penile tip now because of this. Did you lose any sensation? Yeah, it's sort of like a callus, you could say. But it has a, you know, obviously I go pee out of it. But you know what? If Shifty Adams shift in the lying liberal media mob, the liberal elites, the technocrats have their way, then it will become legal for any wife to raise her off. And this is the thing that the thing they're arguing is not whether it's right or wrong. It's how many inches, millimeters, whatever you can, is it would be the right appropriate amount to slice off of your husband's penis. I'm not just reggae to its country. If any music that a husband wants to listen to, the wife is allowed to punish the husband for listening to that music by taking a a millimeter slice of off the tip of the peen. And this is the only thing in between us, men of the world, and the very tips of our penis being sliced off by our wives for our music, musical tastes. I, you know, I listen to Disney, I love Disney. I listen to Disney soundtracks and my wife has made the threat. Say goodbye to that. Say goodbye to Disney soundtracks. I will not stop listening. Well, if the lying liberal media mob has their way, your wife's going to be in there with a with a fresh razor issued by the government, issued by AOC. It's going to have the squads faces on the razor. And they're going to be laughing all the way to the bank as they collect all these, these stem cells that are, everyone knows the greatest stem cells are on the penal tip. So, yeah, they're using it in the vaccine. You know, the, they've apparently scraped Bill Gates. They've scraped his, the tip and his net. And so if you, anybody who's getting the vaccine will be being injected with a slurry of Gates genitalia material. And that, you know, if you want to know to thank for that, it's Shifty Adam shift. It's the lying liberal media mob. It's the elites and it's the folks who want you to be injected with these slurry genital apple sauce like pulp of Bill Gates's jewels and gems and nips. Yep. They used to call it a round wagon back in the day. The round wagon being the, the bowl, a bowl of all the, Right. Because who wants a round wagon? You want a round wagon? You want a square wagon? Cause it's got a front and a back. Oh, but Shifty Adam should love all of us and the shift show and the sleepy Joe. Round, round wagon pirates, sleepy Joe. You've got a bunch of, you've got these people making custom ape tunnels with pirate ceilings and a bunch of mini bathrooms in their mansions on Ding Dong wish, wish, wish Island. It's so fucking crazy to me to think that Shifty Adam shift, AOC, the Liling liberal elite media mob are shaving nip cells, shaving penile cells, slurifying them, pulpifying them around, wagging them and injecting them into our Children into our Children. They're forcing the Children to be a gendered. They're forcing them to saying you can't call yourself. My son, your day was forced to be non gender. Meanwhile, sleepy Joe Biden, sleepy Joe in his basement lies in state practically while Shifty Adam, shift AOC, the lying liberal elite media mobs are injecting our Children with a pulpified genitalia of the technocratic elite. They're just, they're just showing them RuPaul on, you've seen that movie Clockwork Orange? That's what I feel like I'm living in right now. The scene where his eyes are open, except it's drag race on and I'm being filled fed a oat milk with a bunch of slices off, a penile tip slices floating in the top of it. You know, I did an experiment, which I will be releasing on my obscure a patriota.com, which is my Patriot website. I had my wife put on a face mask on her, but on her. But on her, on her butter on her vagina on her butt. Okay. And I had her fart on me. Okay. And I, and you can smell it. Yeah, come on. It amplifies the smell. Do face mask work? Do you wear underwear and have you smelled your own flatulence? And there's the answer. The CDC doesn't want you to know. Well, you know, the CDC, I call, I call it the center for dick control. Dick control. Yeah. Cause they want to do slices off the tips. Now we veered off track again. I could talk about, I could talk with you for hours. I am a big fan of your work. Thanks. And I'm really excited for your upcoming book. But we missed this story of that most dangerous trap. Okay. So, uh, Peef, Peef row is cutting my hair. Scottish guy Peef row. He, um, you know, he asked permission and I said yes. And I would agree to pay him. Cause again, I've been denied a haircut for about six months because of the Democrats. And, uh, so, uh, we're in the hostel, it's just me and him. And he puts on these reggae 45s. I'm like, wow, this is just great. I haven't listened to this. And, um, and it just felt so good to listen to reggae, you know, guilt free. And, um, he relaxes me. He does like a, a cranial massage. He says it really opens up the follicles and lets them breathe. Like a 45 minute cranial massage. I'm, uh, I have no shirt on. I'm just wearing like a, a draping of a, um, you know, a Muslim, a Muslim, not Muslim, Muslim cloth. Thank God. Cause that's what, that's what Peefrow said. I should be wearing cause it's the typical Scottish haircut thing. I guess, you know, I'm just, I'm just going by what he's saying at this point. And, um, I'm in a very relaxed state. I'm having sort of a hyper dream about, um, my experiences in the past. And next thing I know, the reggae stops and I feel, um, a slice on the tip of my peen and, uh, Peefrow says, your wife says, hello, they got, they got to this. That's how they, they got to me all the way in, uh, in Costa Rica, they got to me. That's the reach of these bastards. And, but that now wounded for more, I don't know, how many times have you had this slice, this particular, I've had, I have a very long peen. So it's okay for me, but I've lost a full inch all from micron, micron slices. But the thing is, how many, how many total slices? Oh, I don't know, a couple of thousand, a couple of thousands. I've lost count. I have lost count. But the thing is, uh, each time it's been allowed to regrow back. And so it's grown larger than it was before due to the callous nature of the peen tip. So actually I would say I'm fully insulated against this type of thing. So essentially P-Fro just cut off a callous and I'm, I'm kind of back to square one now. So he kind of did me a favor. What'd you do though? Yeah, you've been betrayed at the deepest level, manipulated at the deepest level. Yeah, he's plugged into something you love so much. He got you hypnotized, said he's going to cut your hair. So he was able to get the straight razor out. Didn't seem weird to you. What did you do? Did you fight him? Did you, did you call the police? Did you, oh, there's no law here. We're in a hostel. This is, uh, this is Costa Rica. There's nothing going on there. I just, uh, I defended myself and, um, I let him think that he won and he packed his knives and, and goad. And then I just, um, you know, I nursed my womb, which didn't take that much because I'm so experienced in this. I just, that is to the group to me. There's something so sublime in that form of, of defeat that this, he, he, he, he skulks away, he thinks he's one. He sliced off a, you know, small amount of your penis, seemingly without repercussion. Yeah. But you won the day. I won the day. And, uh, you know, I lived to tell the tale. Here we are today. Uh, they can't hold us down. That did not stop you from continuing into that Costa Rican pyramid. And I don't want to spoil it, but yeah, let's not spoil it. We've, we've, I've already talked about stuff. I should have let people buy the book. It's not on Amazon. You can't get on an Amazon cause they've, they've banned it. Uh, you can get it. I, you can basically get it wherever you can watch. If you, it's, if you can, while fine, pandemic on internet. Yeah. I, my book is for sale on the same website. It's, it's a, there's a hyperlink there. If you're listening, you got to support these people. Johnny is a patriot. Johnny is somebody who has fought back against the seep date and has moved mountains literally just to uncover the great secret of the data storage in the taints of the ancients. Johnny, I'm going to be honest with you. I don't know how much longer you're going to be able to be on this show. I don't know how much longer you're going to be safe in the world. I understand. I know, I know that. And that's, that's part of my part of the life I live is, uh, every day could be the last. And so we just, we do the best we can and, uh, do the most we can. And we just, you know, stay away from the lying liberal media mob. And yeah, what can I say? Tell me before you go. Yeah, Duncan, what taints are on your horizon? Well, uh, we got some information about a, uh, Siberian, um, Neanderthal that's been buried underneath Minsk, and we're going to get out there with the deep earth drill and check that out. I've got a, um, uh, funding situation set up there. There's also supposedly a really good one underneath the Great Salt Lake. Uh, that's going to involve some, uh, some diving, some, uh, class four, uh, mixed air diving, which I'm assembling a team right now, uh, be surprised. But actually Vin Diesel is one of the people I've been working with. Actually, I believe it. Yeah. Another, uh, taint explorer. And let's wrap up on this. Okay. And you got this out in your book, but I think my audience deserves to hear it because this is the kind of stuff that you're not going to hear when people have been shadow banned on Twitter, like Johnny here. Oh, it's bad. If you had to sum up what the taints of the ancients have to say, what message that they are sending to us from so far back in time, what would that be? Well, it's, it's complicated. What's the messiest thing I would say, you know, whatever you do, just don't believe what these people are telling you. Right. That's the thing is you got to, you got to figure everything out on your own. If you think something, if you don't like something initially, if you're like, you know what, this whole mask thing is, yeah, it doesn't feel right to me. If you have like an inkling, like, you know, if you don't like a person, if you don't, if anything, just right away, you feel a certain thing that's the right feeling, listen to your instincts. I guess that's what the ancients teach us. That's the, the message of the taint is listen to your intuition. It's, it's going to be right, way more right than the message of Shifty Shift, AOC, the lying liberal media mob and the, uh, technocratic elite want to send out there, which is their, their message is, Oh, this, uh, new thing that we call science, it's science. It's spelled wrong with the C. Why is there a C in there? It's Scott. That's your first sign. Something's fucked up. It's scuttle comp. It should be science, S-I-E-N-C-E. Why do we need the C? It's science, not S-C-I-E. It's already built into the fucking word is the sign that the whole thing's off. It's scuttle comp. It's brain, it's brain fog. Brain fog. It's Gumbelgac. It's cotton candy cooked up by Shifty Adam shift in his cuck circus that the lying liberal media mob brings to the small towns. They pitch their tents. It's a bunch of cuck candy is what it is. It's cuck candy. Yeah. It's brain batter. It's all, it's all bubble bunk. And, and, and to me, that's what I love about your book is that, and we'll close on this, uh, it's a book that says, look, you're going to listen to a hundred year old Skyance, are you going to listen to the taints of the ancients? Are you going to listen to the message of this tiny acreage of purity that has been saved from the insanity of Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie and sleepy Joe and the lying liberal media mob? And let's close on this, Johnny. Can you do a recitation of the poem at the end of your beautiful book, Taints of the Ancients? Sure. I'll just, let me just bring that up. I don't have it to clean it to memory just yet. It starts with this sound here real quick. Shackled to everything. Grown out of anything. We are born to a way sing. Drop a penny inside of a wagon ring. You are the thunder. You are the lightning. You are the wish. Keep on fighting. Grab a piece of wood and make it into a splinter. Grab a piece of wood. It'll last the whole winter. It's all about surface area. If you fold a piece in half and twist it around, you create a road that you can run on forever. That was Johnny Pemberton, everybody. Please pick up a copy of his book. Wherever Plandemic is available for download, you will find Taints of the Ancients. Johnny, where else can people find you? You can find me at TriggerNation.Stevia and you can find me at www.CompBusters.Left, which is sort of it. www.CompBusters.Left, encrypted. Don't forget to use Johnny's copyrighted freedom web browser. What's it called, Johnny? You can also find me on twitch.tv slash justmynipples. Yeah, that's twitch.tv slash justmynipples. You can find me there. I do a legal broadcast about four times a week, so you can check that out. Check him out while you can. He's probably not going to be above ground, long. Probably going to have to hit the underground. Johnny, you are a true patriot. You are a dear friend. I will always be here to protect you and thank you for sending your message and spreading your message out in the world. We need it so desperately here before the most important election in the history of Planet Earth. The history of time, history of time, so important, so important. Yeah, very important. Johnny, I'll be seeing you out there. Keep smelling those taints. Don't let them stop you. That concludes the first part of this DTFH podcast with Johnny Pemberton. And now take your clothes off, lube yourself down, sit back next next to your window, open yourself up for a deepening as we dive into political conversation between two comedians. That's coming up right now. I wouldn't mind having like something I could post of us talking just for a little bit for fun, you know, or I don't know, there's no pressure, obviously. No, man. No, I get it. It's kind of it's also just nice to fucking, you know, talk, hang out a little bit. Wait, you don't want to just improv with me for every time to make believe my brain's tired now. No, we've been what we've been doing is like this horrific. Have you heard the term doom scrolling? No, but I think let me let me guess what that is. Is it where you just like are looking for negative stuff? Yeah, you're looking for horror. Oh, God. So what right now? And I don't know why we're doing it. There's this it's like a sickness that we both acknowledge. After we put the baby to bed, we put on Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson leads into Hannity. And then after that, we watched Dateline. So like, wow, it's really dark and it's addictive. But it's like it, but we're fully like in growth. It's like huffing glue and like it's the funniest shit. When like whenever Tucker passes the mic to Hannity, they have to have this weird acknowledgement of each other. You know what I mean? Like Hannity is the big daddy. Tucker is a little dick, the cub. You know what I mean? And so Hannity always be like, great show is always tuck. I'm so sick and Tucker Carlson is literally Tucker Carlson. There has never been a more joyful bootlicker in like the history of bootlickers. Like Tucker Carlson, he is a statist bootlicker. And like what's fucking up about him is that you get this sense that underneath it, he's just like an entertainer. He's like, you know what I mean? He would be fun like Tucker Carlson would be a fun person to go to the beach with. I think a lot of those people are actually. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of them are like, if you met him, I bet if you met Kellyanne Conway, you'd be like, man, this bitch is fucking fun. We're having a good time at this bar because Kellyanne's here. You know, there's people like that. Or even though they seem terrible, like if you met them on a purely personal level, they would just be a riot. Yeah, it's so weird. It's like, yeah, I'm sure like if like you were able to like personify like a syphilitic virus, it would also be like, yeah, man, I love it. I love fucking. I just love living in calm. I love living in juice. But like the the you know, the but it's it's what's interesting about Tucker and Hannity is like, how often do you really get to watch state propaganda, like North Korean level propaganda? Like, oh, yeah. I mean, that's what's cool about it because I'm not going to learn Korean. It's not going to happen. So I don't get or Chinese. I don't get to watch Chinese state propaganda. So turning on Fox News and watching US state propaganda being sort of output through this like hypnotic like chain of like weird conservative dudes. It's really addictively fun because it's like no matter what like Trump, no matter what he does, like they know they're both smart. They're journalists. They're both smart enough to know Trump's an an a mad man, like a lunatic. Yeah, but he's an egomanian and they have to twist it to somehow fit into that everything he's doing, he's doing being like great. That's what I love. I love watching the way whatever Trump does like a fuck like he could like during a rally could like reach into his pants, pull a bat out of his ass. Ozzy Osbourne, the bats head of it, pour blood all over him, throw the bat into the crowd. The crowd would like rip the bat apart and like eat it and rub it. And Hannity and Tucker would be like the you know, the lying liberal media mob would love to portray what Donald Trump and his the people wanting to vote for him who came to that rally, who risked their lives to come to that rally, who got babysitters for their family to come to that rally to celebrate American freedom. The lying liberal media mob would love to make what has happened there seem like something in a terrible cult. And then they'll like show like just people maybe saying normal shit like I've never seen a more fucked up thing. He reached into his pants and pulled out a bat and bit its head off and blood sprayed all over the crowd and then the crowd ripped the bat apart. And then cut to Hannity. There you go. Trump derangement syndrome, another snowflake liberal freaked out by simply having fun at a show and you're like, what the fuck? It's like you can't it's incredible that they they keep distorting reality trying to make it seem normal. It's happening on both sides, though. It's happening so much where all you see is people saying, oh, what if? Imagine if Obama did this? And it's always like and then the other side says, imagine if it's like they there's no one there's no universal standard. You saw that you just see that movie this what's it called the social dilemma? I haven't seen it yet. Aaron was making fun of it, though. She was saying it's a movie where apparently in it, it's like, guess what? They're what they're watching you. It's like, no shit. We all know that. A lot of it's like no no shit, man. But at the same time, it's a lot of it's this thing where you realize that this is crazy thing that's happening now where people hate each other so much that it's this is it's never a modern modern history. It's never things have never been this divided among people who live in the same country, right? Like we all have like this like innate. I mean, not all of us, but most people just like have so much distaste for those who disagree with them. It's really crazy how like the degree with which that that goes on that it's like. I just make it makes me I hate it because I find myself feeling that way sometimes, too, and it's just so ridiculous because you have like like if my if I have a neighbor who is like a hardcore Trumper, they're still my neighbor, you know, he's still so the person who we have more mutual interests than almost anyone alive because we live in the same physical space. I know, man. Yeah. It's like it's absurd that anyone would be like at at odds with someone. Well, that is the hysteria, right? Because the hysteria, though, like if you look at like the classic leftist liberal reaction, a reactionary leftist, they're they're just as nasty as the is the radical side of that. But I think it's worse, really, because the left the left side, at least at least the right people, people who are on the the right now are more like, oh, hey, man, you know, it's it's kind of like that good old boy mentality where it's like, hey, man, I don't agree with you, but I'll fucking I'll pull your car. Here's my father. OK, the other day I was driving. I had to go pick up some t-shirts down in Long Beach at the printer. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I'm down by the beach. I'm going to go drive by the beach real quick, right? And it's a hot fucking day. I was like 100 degrees. So I'm like, oh, go to the beach where it's 90, you know. And I get down there and my car starts doing something weird. You know, that old the old Mercedes, where, you know, it's fucking. I shouldn't have a car. Yeah. What is it? Like runs on a it runs these diesel car. But, you know, it's got like it's just tonight. It's a 30 year old car. So it has like some weird shit going on with the electric. So I thought it was it was still running fine. I parked the car. I walked to the beach for like 10 minutes. OK, that's cool. Go back to my car. It won't start. I'm like, oh, shit, what's going on here? And I was thinking like the battery is dead or something, right? And so I was like, it's hot as fuck. I have to get someone to jump me. I saw some dude in a truck drive by with a massive trump flag coming out like something like, you know, tattooed electrician dude, you know, like almost California, San Diego, Bro Bro's. Yeah, he was going to his buddy's house right across the street from where I was parked and there was like three of these dudes, you know, all wearing like like those California chopper sunglasses and all like tanned all red as hell. White dudes. And I'm thinking this is the person who's going to give me a jump. Yes. It's not I'm not going to flag down someone in a fucking Mercedes SUV. They're not going to fucking stop or give me a jump. Right. It's this guy, this Trumper, with driving a fucking F 150 for his electrical job. Yeah. And I asked the guys like, hey, they're they're like, you know, it's Friday. They're they're already cracking beers and stuff. It's like, hey, when do you guys give me a jump? You know, no rush or anything. They fucking did it, you know? Yeah, like I could probably have like a fucking Biden t-shirt on. They would still they might give me some hell, but they're probably not going to fucking deny me that. And that's the thing I was thinking about is like, as much as I disagree with those guys politically, when it came down to it, that's the people who I knew would probably help give me a jump before anyone else. Right. Yeah, man. I mean, that's like even that you're not supposed to say what you just said. You're not supposed to say that I know you're not supposed to say it, but it's the the the so the idea that these people have is insane, which is alienation is the answer. Like so the best way to deal with these people who have views of the world that are completely as far as I'm concerned in general, like if you're like sort of flying in the face of science, if you're disregarding what not I'm not saying like one scientist says, but if you're disregarding like what a consensus of global scientists says, yeah, then an idiot, not only are you an idiot, you're like, it's worse than being an idiot. You're a squanderer. You're you've this. Here's this beautiful distillation hundreds of years, lifetimes dedicated to this way of pursuing truth. And you are shoving it to the side and in place of it, you're putting your own intuition, which we all know, unless you're a historic, that this is the root of every single inhumanity, every single fucked up thing is always based on like, well, you know, I know what they're saying, but I think I'm right. And so yeah, but regardless of ignorance, alienating them is not the answer. And this is the this is the stupid idea of all these fucks is like these censoring shits think that you're going to be able to push these people. You want them to interact with rationality to get the spark to like get the liberation. It sucks to be superstitious. Being superstitious is hell. It's the worst thing you think you're in control, but you're not. You see a cat. You think that means you're you're going to have diarrhea or whatever. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's hell. And it's absurdity. It's like you're creating a prison in your own mind of the world. So decided like these all these things are affecting you when they're not at all affecting you. Right. That's the problem. And fucking alienating the superstitious people is so insane. And also it's like, fuck, you know, in general, because somebody has horrible ideas, like if you really are altruistic and compassionate, you want to find the bridge, you want to find the connective tissue, you want to find like, you know, take like any, an average like pro-lifer or anti-life, anti-abortion person. Right. Right to life. Right to life. Take that person. They're passionate. What are they passionate about? They've identified the sanctity, the precious quality, the beauty of existence. So in that moment, now the way they have identified it flies in the face of what a lot of other people think life where life is. But yeah, if you remove the abortion part and just realize like, here's a thing that is like in that little bit of humanness, you have compassion for the helpless. You have all the liberal ideals being manifested. Good. It's a good. It's a good. Yeah, it's a nightly good. It's in that to me is that that's a place that everyone connects is like unless you're a truly dog shit, you know what I mean? Everyone connects in the point of like, you know, kids deserve a good childhood. Yeah. Only a dog shit person is like, no, man, fuck kids, this torch room or something. That's a shit at right wing, left wing, centrists all come together in that place of like, yeah, kids should be allowed to have a great childhood. That seems to be a universal. That's why I brought that whole documentary is because like the idea, the main idea behind it was they kind of like bury the lead. The thing is they totally bury the lead in that thing because it's like anything. It's a fucking piece of media. It's supposed to be watchable and shareable, not necessarily like a book where it's really informative, but the idea is that both sides are profiting off the division because that's what that's the most profitable thing is when there's like when there's division and when there's conjecture, because they talk about how the most profitable media is all the stuff that's not real, all the fake shit like like flat earth is an advertising dream. Because what people click on it like a motherfucker, they're able to sell more ads at a higher value for media that they know is empirically false. Because the wormhole that you go down when you're investigating something that is empirically false, it doesn't have a bottom because it's not based in anything true. So you just fucking keep clicking and clicking and clicking. Yeah. And it creates so much more revenue for the places that are they're dispensing the media that they're incentivized to promote things that are they know are empirically false. So it's this crazy thing where they're like they're profiting off of the very thing that is causing all these problems. Right. It makes me think about like, OK, people talk about all this stuff like, oh, you know, like, oh, don't look at the suggested thing or don't try to like take a diet from it. But when reality all that all that you can really ever totally do is just if you refuse to participate, if you fully drop out, that's the only truly actual solution to it, because it's otherwise it's like it's like I have a credit card, right? And I play the credit card game. I don't get charged fees. I use I make the credit card work for me, right? But I'm like I'm in the rarity. Most people credit card companies are extremely wealthy because most people because they're humans aren't good at following these up these fucking absurd laws that they created to enforce that. So it's like this thing where the only true way you can fucking actually get around that stuff is to is to like drop out. And it feels like right now we're at the head or coming to the head of where people can only handle so much conjecture in their lives to the point where they should be like, like they're just going to give up and be either give up in a bad sense or give up in a good sense. We're like, I'm just not going to. It's it's too much stress and effort to feel this way about other people. I'm just going to be like, I don't really care what anyone thinks, because like to where we're living apolitically, I feel like that's that's the only actual solution in the world is is for us for people to become apolitical. Dude, this is this is the whenever I go on a hike when I got here, you can go on real hikes, you know, not the LA hike where you're like in line with 19 people to like send some dirt hill or something like this, you vanish into the woods. And whenever I'm out there, you know, within a 20 minutes, all that shit. Oh, it's gone melts is just absorbed into the into that. And then so then lately, what I've been thinking is like, oh, this is the multi, this is the alternate reality. Like this is a completely different place with completely different politics and complete a completely different philosophy that you can go into and you can disappear. Like there's still parts of the world where you could just go in there and disappear, people go in there and disappear. And it feels great. And you hear it all the time. I love my favorite conspiracy theory is the people who disappear in national forests. That's a big thing. People just disappear out there. And worldlings are like, oh, they've been murdered or something. But it's like, I don't know if that's what's happening. I think some people just it's they're like they're like domesticated animals that decide to leave the yard. Right. And then they stay out of the yard and then they become feral. I think probably in the national forests, there are countless humans who just were like, you know, I don't think I'm going back there and just went deep in there and maybe met other feral humans. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a whole secret indigenous community of feral humans living in the national forests that are kind of connected to the grid. They come down and get food every once in a while. You know, they're not invisible, but they're definitely not like what we are. Glued and plugged into the fucking thing. Yeah. Trimbling at every weird current that comes flowing by. And you know what I mean? Like the fucking what are the prairie dogs? You know what I think they're just like out there and they look at us like a dream. Like they know we're there and they feel sorry for us. But they do think it definitely is. It's feeling sorry because it's like to be plugged into everything all the time. It's such a it's so it's such a like a like you're be like burdened with it. It's like you be you're burdened with all this stuff. That's what more increasingly to me feels like it's like it's like being burdened with like the whole like everyone making so much so much to do about this election. It's like, you know what's crazy thing you can't really say. What is like I don't care. It doesn't matter that much. Did you imagine saying that that hits everyone the wrong way? You can't do that. The apathy. That's apathy. You can't do that. But I really think it's like it doesn't matter that much. You know what I mean? Like it does, but it's it's it's really just like a fucking look. I'm not going to privilege shame you. But I did just interview this Sharon Salisbury because it's brilliant. And and she was saying, you know what? The thing is, though, the reason it doesn't matter to you that much is because you're doing great. And like, you know what I mean? Yeah, if you don't care about the election because like there are for sure real, I mean, I'm not trying to shame you because I really I have thought the identical thing and I've been like sort of I agree with you. I do agree with you. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I know you mean, though, from a from an absolutist perspective. Like they just story pops up on the internet. Somehow they got lucky enough with telescopes to pick up a star being eaten by a black hole, a star the same size as our star falling into and being spaghettified by a thing so dense, it's eating light. It ain't our son, our precious son that shine down on Jesus. Socrates, Aristotle, Mother Teresa. It's gone just just eaten by a fucking black hole. And so from that perspective, this election is as meaningless as meaningless can be. And even maybe from the perspective of centuries or thousands of years, it's like, who gives a fuck? Yeah, I don't even mean that, though. I don't even mean it from a causal perspective. I mean, in terms of obviously the election is important, but all you can do is vote, right? You can vote. I guess if you want to, you can also campaign like crazy and do that stuff. But essentially the actual action of participation is seconds. You do you vote and but there's so much conjecture and like noise and arguing around this simple act that happens effortlessly that it's like, to me, it speaks to just the fact that like human life is so easy, right? Like we're all very privileged in some sense. Sure, because of how easy I was thinking about, you know, that guy, James A Garfield, who's a former president. He was assassinated. He has just he has just quote an ounce of pluck is worth a ton of luck. I was just to carry that around. That's kind of what you call it, like a tea bag had tea bag. They had like a little little tab on the tea bag. I had a quote on that. I always think about that, you know, because like pluck is what I had to look up that word, but pluck is like, you know, it's like having like tenacity. It's like being a being a bastard, like yeah, being determined. Yeah. And how like that is worth more than a little bit of determination is worth way more than sure luck. Yeah, man. It's and you think about like, you know, a hundred years ago, you and I would both know five or six people who's who two of their children died before they were 10. Right. There's just like all this stuff that like there's so much. There's we don't we don't have like any kind of serious grieving in our lives anymore. You know, it used to be a thing where it was really, really hard to live. Like the chances of dying of a disease is it was common. Well, that that is the to me that is actually the bubble we live in. Like you and I, we live in a fucking bubble. Like I and then people hear about my life or maybe your life or people hear like both my parents are dead. I got my ball chopped off into them. It's like, holy fuck, that sounds intense. That's a lot. It's not. It's nothing to me. It's to be it's nothing. But that being said, like, you know, Aaron knows someone who's fucking husband died of this goddamn COVID, got his legs cut off, had to get put on a ventilator. And like, you know what I mean? And like that, that to me, that I don't give a fuck about I really I'm voting for Joe Biden and I'm not voting for him because I want to. I'm voting because it's a goddamn binary. And because like the other option is like dancing to YMCA at these rallies when like people's husbands are getting their legs cut off. It's like this should be a solemn time. Like, yeah, you know what I mean? It's OK to be chipper and upbeat and to be to like as a leader, you should put out there, we are going to get through this. We can't we will like this will be in our past at some point. That's my cancer doctor used to say that to me. And it was very sweet, but he wasn't like, listen, Duncan, don't let this testicular cancer take over your life. Go and have a good time. He was like, you got fucking you have cancer. It's serious. And you're for a year, your life is going to be different. But he also said. At some point, this is going to be in your rear view mirror. And it won't be as big as it is right now, but you got to do this first. That's a leader. That's what you're supposed to. But not this thing of like, I don't know. Oh, man, man, I don't know because it's like motherfucker. You have got like it's like there's a great PBS documentary on Alex Jones and it. Well, I got a what? What's it called? I got to watch this just look up PBS Alex Jones. It's like, for Alex Jones, it's got to be a dream come true. I'm sure he loves the documentary because they really came at it. But the in it. Because of his fucking psychotic shit about Sandy Hook, some schizophrenic started stalking the parent of one of these kids who was murdered at Sandy Hook, this parent had to go into hiding because like so many people from Alex Jones were saying, oh, that's a fucking crisis actor. Right. Yeah. And yeah, they get confused because they're mentally ill. Right. And so when you have like someone like Trump putting out mixed signals about everything, all the mentally ill people in the world, they like they don't know how to process that shit. And now suddenly you've got people in CVS slapping people for telling them to wear a mask. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? So like, yeah, it's insanity. And so to me, that that that's the place where it's like, motherfucker, like I don't care if my stupid vote is some impotent gesture in the wind. I want to make that gesture. You know why? Because like I just want bullies like him. I don't want that. You know, remember when Bush was president? And that was a time like anytime there's a dumb, seemingly dumb president, dumbness becomes like a like that becomes a thing. Just yeah. People start exhibiting dumbness because like the dumbest people imitate leaders. You know what I mean? Like that he's not doing it. So I guess I'd be the same way. I'll be dumb and obnoxious because he's dumb and obnoxious. He got to be president. So all I got to do is be dumb and obnoxious long enough. I'll become president. You know, it's like that kind of shit. It's like this is like what a great person does. Others will follow. And so president is great. The title is great. Trump, I don't care if you if he's the biggest, most obnoxious piece of shit on earth, which I think he is, he's a great person. He's a big, massive personality that ascended to the peak of power on the planet and his hypnotized masses of people with this kind of pro wrestling persona. He's a great person, not a good person, but he's legendary. And he will be remembered as one of the Mad Kings, one of the most famous Mad Kings in recorded history. So, you know what I mean? But but it's like, fuck, give me stuttering, sleepy, boring. Give me boring. That's what our government is supposed to be boring. The president has got a boring ass job. It's all boring and dumb and you don't want to hear speeches. That's what I want. I want a boring speech from a boring dullard. That's Biden. That's why I'm going to vote for him. But fuck, man, it's all that stuff completely. I think the thing I was thinking about is the idea that, OK, let's just say Trump does get reelected. I think you have to deal with it the same way. You have with your cancer or anything else where it's like, OK, so this is a thing that is heavy and oppressive, and it's like it's toxic and it feels bad. But what can you do except just fucking soldier on? You have to be plucky. You can't count on on like the fates to blow the right winds. You have to be a fucking motherfucker to be a bastard. And just it's like if you if you're a deer and your leg, if if a if a white tailed deer is hit by a car and its leg is broken, that deer will know it's fucking a leg off and stay alive for years. I got you. I got you. I got you. That kind of thing is to me. It's like there's a lot of people who are just want to like fucking give up and be like, oh, no, no, no, it's like, motherfucker. Yeah, like we're all the products of people who are who made it through like the West, people who didn't get shot by. Yeah. Like there's just people. So fucking tough, but they act like they're not. And I guess what bothers me is when people act like they're being imposed upon and they're especially like, you know, middle class white people act like they're being imposed upon, like they have no agency when you have so much. We have so much agency. And one of those things I think points of agency is fucking voting and then like checking the fuck out and working on stuff that's I mean, it's important to you and being like a being a motherfucker. I got you. Just kicking ass like a fucking drunken redneck. Fuck. Yeah, I got you. Yeah, it's statism. It's like if your religion is the state, which is what the state always wants, like the state wants the people to worship the state. The state, the more the people think the state is important, the more important it becomes, the more important it becomes, the more powerful it becomes, the more powerful it becomes, the more moves towards fascism, regardless of whatever the particular ideology of those in power is. And so in that way, it's this kind of horror, a potential hurricane. It's like when you're watching the weather and it's like, oh fuck, it looks like the wind's moving in a way that could be a tornado, tornado alert. Similarly, if too many people become either dependent on the state as the metric for their own personal success and freedom or antithetical state as the metric for everything that's going wrong, it's two different forms of devotion, devotion nonetheless. And in that devotion, you produce the conditions that can create true tyranny. So I know I hear what you're saying, which is like the state is there. It's real. I'm not saying it isn't, but you must be more powerful than that. Because no, it's like, you know, it all boils down to by the time the cops get there. I think we've talked about this before. By the time the cops get there, they're just there to mop up the blood. Yeah, they're just clean up. There's a cleanup crew. That's all it is. Yeah, that's it. That's it. You say that it's a cleanup crew. What are you going to do? You're going to depend on the cops to come and take care of you? Like they don't, they show up late. They're not going to do shit. They're not going to do shit. They're not going to shit. How rare is it that the cops come and save someone from being murdered? It's always after someone's been murdered that you hear the 911 call. It's always after someone's been murdered that the cops show up. Never, never, never saving the day. And yeah, this is what we think about the state. You know that they're going to come. They're not going to come. They're not going to help you like they're not. There's nothing that's going to happen. And if it does happen, it'll be fucked up. Because you have to be like you're like people. I think a lot of people feel like they're owed something or they're less. It happens on both sides. Happens everywhere. People feel like they deserve something or they're owed a thing or they're entitled to something when I feel like you're not. People aren't entitled to anything at all. It's like when you're talking about like, you know, people were like, oh, that's all you had. This terrible things happened to you. It must be so bad. Like when people feel like if I tell someone about my bowel illness and they express any kind of sympathy, I'm just like, stop, I stop. No, there's nothing. Why would you have sympathy here? It's great. Everything's great. What are you talking about? Like I'm I'm fucking fine. I'm actually better because of it. Like no one nobody. Well, I think about like your average person in a wheelchair. Like, sure, they would love a wheelchair ramp. But I mean, that's a person who's experienced such extreme difficulty. They're fucking tough as shit. I just think the idea that is not so much like dependence on the state. But this is why organization is like one thing. The other thing I love about watching Hannity and Tucker is like hearing what they're against and realizing everything they don't like is good. Right. So in other words, like, well, I don't watch unions. Unions. Oh, yeah, you know what I mean? Like that, like that, that that's a form of socialism. Workers organizing is, you know, it's maybe not the best thing. And clearly workers organizing is the best thing. Any place that you go where there's a fucking union, those workers are getting paid what they should get paid generally. They're getting health care that they should be getting. And the reason they're getting it is not because the industry that they organized within was like, why don't y'all, you know, get together? Let me know what I could do better as the person who's getting like so much money from your labor and then I'll do that. Just I just don't have time to like talk to you all individually. So just get together, sort of form like a union. And then let me know what I can do for you. And then I'll do that just because I'm clearly making exponentially more money than you are from from the same amount of time that you're laboring. And it's it's because people get together in secret. And the history of it is they get the shit kicked out of them. Anytime miners, you know, there's like literally people have been blown up, shot because they're like, don't let them organize. And so I know, so to me, it's like, yes, to individual liberty, yes, to individual autonomy, yes, to radical self-reliance. And then also a group of radically self-reliant people who are joining together to then push the cog, the wheel of government to drive the ship. That becomes a true democracy, which we don't have right now. Instead of a corporateocracy and oligarchy or whatever the fuck it is. You know what I mean? That's which is why I do feel a political these days. Like, fuck, let's organize. Let's get these motherfuckers out. Lindsey Graham is like eating shit right now. Let's get these. It's the most beautiful thing to hear. Lindsey Graham, I'm sorry to get political, everybody. I am a little begging for money. Oh, they're eating my asshole. They're scramble my eggs over here. They do this like a sparrow in a hedgehog patch over here. I don't know what to do. Yo, they all they're giving their eat me alive. It's the best thing to watch. They hate me. They hate me. Yeah, you fucking bullicking fucking smarmy. God damn mediocre. Can't you fucking like boss hog, old school, southern, like shit, corrupt, sheriff, piece of shit. There would be the bad lawyer on malloc. They do hate you because you suck. You kiss up to anyone who the president is you fucking changer. Ah, he's the worst. Well, it's a bunch of like spineless mother. It's much of a spineless people. It's a bunch of people who are like doughy and haven't had any like real difficulties. I mean, that's the interesting thing is there's so many people who I like a lot who I'm like, oh, that person's experience, severe tragedy in their life. Yeah. And that's probably why they're so great is because it's like, you know, like Stephen Colbert, right? Half his family died in a fucking plane accident when he was like 12. I didn't know that. Like all this crazy shit he's like fucking insane amount of personal family tragedy, but you get through that and that makes it steals you against bullshit in a way that you can't you can't like that just it's so what's the word? It's priceless. It's like a priceless experience that so many of these people who are like backing Trump and whatnot just feel like a bunch of people who are they're just they're soft, right? They're fucking softies, but they think they're not softies. They're like masquerading as tough guys. Oh, actually, they're fucking like a fucking cancer kid could kick the shit out. Dude, that when you like that, that's my like we of all like I I just instaban like so what so what happens is on Twitter, someone will come at me and usually it'll be like, you know, you're just a true douchebag and then I'll be like, all right, let's look at their timeline. You go to the timeline and inevitably all it is is retweets of Trump and it goes back and back and back and you're like, wait, either you're the craziest son of a bitch that ever lived in the sense that all you're doing is waiting for the president to tweet and then retweeting it, which is weird anyway, or you're like a bot and you're just like like I've been assigned as like someone who is a antithetical to like whatever the particular PR campaign you're running is, but either one is bizarre. But aside from the bots, the really particularly vile, sizzling shit, shit stew that has emerged from this particular presidency is the pseudo intellectual Trump supporters who have also managed to mix in to their ideology, a little bit of chaos magic. So so like wrapped up in this like nonsense, bullshit stuff, masquerading. Here's the worst part of it all. It's pretending to be punk rock. Oh, yeah, it's ridiculous. That's the part that's so fucked up about it. Yeah, it's because I think it's all because Trump, when he first came around, he tricked everybody. I mean, it's kind of not really a trick is he was he didn't play by the rules and he was sort of a bastard. Yeah, he was he was a punk. He was a punk to all these other career politicians. And people saw that and they're like, because we all hate these career politicians so much that when someone is the classic, my enemy's enemy is my friend type of thing. And next thing you know, I guess my enemy's enemy is not my friend. He's actually just a greater enemy. Yeah, who I thought was on my side. It's actually just some sort of force of nature coming from a different planet that's that seems like it's human. But really, it's just trashing everything. And we think that like, oh, because it's trashing something I don't like, that means that they're they have my interest in mine. Yeah, it's like you there. You cannot consider yourself punk rock and like have the level of sycophantic attachment to a American president. Like, you know what I mean? It's like you're like that it will never be cool. That has never been cool. That is always at the very least a sign of your abject laziness. It's like that when people come at me about like saying shit about Trump, it's like, motherfucker, I have made fun of every president and I will make fun of every president because it is an embarrassing job. They all lie. They're all ridiculous. They're all completely an embarrassment and a sign of an antiquated way of running a thing. But you think that like what you think I just started saying shitty things about presidents, that's always the angle is like, oh, yeah, Obama. No shit, Obama sucked. You dumb fuck. I knew that. Everyone knew that. No one like Clinton, no one like Bush, no one like Bush Jr. We've always looked at it and been like, this sucks. And so does your stupid fucking Trump. You dumb shit. And it's like you to me to watch people who, by the way, actually, some of them do have some pretty like great intellects. You know, they at least very least they've had the discipline to study fundamentals of philosophy or something. You know what I mean? They have some general sense of like how to argue. But but to watch people like that get fucking just suctioned up into the in into like a PR campaign. You know what I mean? It's like, dude, I if Kamala Harris says she's going to decriminalize weed, I'll say I'll serve you Kamala Harris. I don't mean it, but I'm just saying that because it's like I want to point out they're going to decriminalize weed. If they decriminalize weed, they're going to decriminalize other psychedelics. That will lead to my dream of a psychedelic renaissance. So I'm going to support that. But Kamala Harris, give me a fucking break. That smirking fucking how many people is she put in jail? No shit. People when I tweet that be like, do you know how many people she's put in jail? No shit. But she just said she's going to decriminalize weed, which means people will not be put in jail anymore. That's who I'm going to support as opposed to this motherfucker who's like they're not. You don't hear Trump saying I'm going to legalize weed. That's all he has to do. Just say that. Say anyway, anyway, I'm sorry, man. I'm watching too much Hannity. Yeah, this is my fault. Everyone listening, my profound apologies for going on a political rant. You know, I try not to do this. It's necessary. I think it's just it's necessary because it's like that's what so many people think. I was listening to this Chris Chris Chris Christopherson song today and he said something that made me think about what you were saying about this people who retweet. I think he said you can't write a song if you have nothing to say. And it's like the thing where you think about so many of these people on Twitter and if that represents like other things, which I guess it does represent, it's a microcosm of some sort, people who are just retweeting stuff. It's because they don't have the balls to say something on their own because they are scared to say, you know, they have nothing to say, got nothing to say. So if you have nothing to say, that's authentically yours. If you don't have a story to tell that's that's that's your story, your thing to say. It's I mean, everyone does. But most people are just scared or scared to do that because it's very scary to to talk about who you are and the truth of your life and everything. It's like fucking terrifying. So it's like that's why these people are just people. Some people just puppet stuff as opposed to because there's people are scared to be their own thing because it though because you can you can trash someone for it. But like, oh, your song sucks. It's like, well, right, you know, I don't care what you think. What is it an ounce of what pluck? An ounce of pluck is worth a ton of luck. That's it. Yeah, you get a fuck about that. The whole thing is like, look, yeah, you go like when I was younger, I would free roast anything, any song, any whatever you free, free roast, you know, like you hear like a song from Britney Spears. Right. Roll them eyes and be like, oh, Britney Spears, this song is only fucking normies like this shit. Right. Meanwhile, what the fuck are you putting out, man? Like, what about what have you done? What have you written? You try dancing like that person does for five minutes and you will have a heart attack, I guarantee it. You know, I would, you know, you try to do any of the acrobatic shit they do while singing and I would I know that I would like it would be like, you know, like when when like an aunt that got burnt by a matchstick, I would just crumble and like curl up, you know what I mean? But but yeah, so yeah, man, that's the other thing is like this. The people it's like, well, stop regurgitating. Yeah, we're just so people are so critical. I mean, I get that way. I find myself like stuck in this thing. Like, what's wrong with my fucking brain right now? I'm thinking too much about critiquing everything. It's like, oh, it's because I'm not doing anything. Yeah, not making me do anything. Then I just go into this fucking terrible zone of of critiquing and stuff. Obviously, there's some people out there who are great career critics. But you think of someone like Roger Ebert, who was a great critic. That guy like he liked all kinds of stuff. Although those guys are like a good critic is someone who doesn't say everything's bad, they have like they understand the nuance of all kinds of shit. And they can talk about it now, just like, oh, that fucking sucks. Now that the fucking sellout week, bad dump. You should have done this. You should have probably done this with actually. I would have liked it better if you did this. It's like, fuck, can you do it, motherfucker? Yeah, you do it, motherfucker. You know, apparently this is on Reddit. Anthony Vordain did the forward of this book of restaurant reviews by some woman in the Midwest who got all this shit because she did a review of Olive Garden and her review was that it was good. And so people like got on her ass about it. And then Anthony Bourdain read the review and realized like, wow, this is like actually a really good breakdown of what it's like to eat at Olive Garden. And it is from that perspective, it is good. And like just because it's Olive Garden, people are like laying into this person. And what you're that's what you're saying is like a great reviewer is not reviewing based on what the mainstream reality thinks is right. They're reviewing it based on some deeper understanding of art. Yeah. Storytelling, you know, like whatever your particular thing you're reviewing, the idea would be you're like a scholar. You're an expert on the thing to such a depth that when you see a thing that other people like that shit, you might recognize within it devices and beauty that other people can't see, you know, that. Yeah, I got, you know, there's we need more people like that, man. That's what we need in the world is people who are not afraid of because really, like most of the time, man, I'm telling you, I like, depending on how many, I don't even know if it matters how many followers you are, but just like tweet like Biden, I'm voting for him. Not because that's like I'm telling you to like spread some campaign, but just wait. It's like fishing and all of a sudden someone you don't know. We'll be like, I don't know why so many people don't like Trump. He actually has a really great economic record when it comes to and you're like, wait a minute, who the fuck is that? Then click on their timeline. It's like they haven't slept for six days. It's all retweets of Trump. Shit. It's a robot is what I'm saying. Robot or even worse is the people who are like people who are Democrats or like former, you know, Bernie supporters who are like, I just can't I can't vote for him in good conscience. It's like, what the fuck? Don't you have something else to do? Yeah, like this ship has sailed, man. Yeah, it's fucking sailed yet. So it's OK. We all love the guy. I remember when I saw him in person with you when we were doing that show in Philadelphia at the truck. Oh, I forgot we saw Sanders. Holy shit. We were fucking 30 feet from the guy and it was fucking it was it was electric. I was like, damn, this guy is a fucking he's a badass. You can feel it like he's got like that. Sort of like that power of like someone whose head is lower on their shoulders where you can't knock him over. Remember the kind of guy who like you try to grab something from him. Like, give me that back. No, that's yeah, that's he's a he's like the real thing. Remember, he's a toughie. He's he's a fucking bruiser. Remember when the bird landed on his lectern? Remember that the bird? Oh, my God, I think so. Like a bird landed on him or the like like a dove or something. It was so mystical. Really? Over the top. And then, meanwhile, like Pence, a fucking fly lands on his head. You know what I mean? It's like, I think that's the problem is like Sanders was was the real thing. You know what I mean? And they don't want the real thing. They they want because he's not a company man. I mean, even like Pence is like Pence is fucking that guy can speak, man. He's a fucking good speaker. I listen to him talk. I'm like, man, this guy sounds like a doctor. Yeah, he's so good. He's how he talks like a doctor. Does. Yeah, he sounds exactly like every doctor I ever saw. Like, you know, I will go to the Mayo Clinic because that's where I grew up. Like the fucking best doctors in the world. They're like, all right, well, I think that we're going to you're going to have some itching in there. It's going to be an issue, but I think we'll check back. And I want to have you come in a couple of times and just look at that. And it's probably going to be pretty good. How's this right here? Is that good? He is totally doing doctor speak. He is. That's exactly how they talk. I mean, Obama does it, too. Obama's doctor speak as well. And he's fucking great at it. Presidents talk like doctors, Johnny. But that's the thing about Trump. That's where everyone loves him so much. He's the first guy in a long time to not be either a good old boy like Clinton's a good old boy. Yeah. Bush is a good old boy. You know, they have that sort of thing like, hey, man, I don't know if you. I'm sorry about that. But look, I like those shoes. You just fucking like the guy. Yeah, you want some chicken wings? I'm hungry. Yeah. Fuck, yeah, I want some chicken wings, Bush. I love your vote. And it's either to their doctor or good old boy, and you'll love both of them. But the Trump is like, who's this fucking lunatic coming in here? He's fucking shitting on everybody. You're not supposed to do that. He did it. So like everyone got tricked into thinking, man, this guy's this guy's a revolutionary when he's just a fucking magician. He's like a magician that normally would spend a couple of days in town. And then you get the fuck out of town because you're going to have to pay the piper. Yeah, man, that's why you travel because you get the fuck out of there before everyone comes for your ass. But this that's like he's like he doesn't. You know, like comedians who have a lot of confidence, but aren't really like, you don't know what they're really saying or whatever. It's like that. He reminds like it's his style of talking is like very. It's like he's doing state. He's doing some kind of awful stand up, you know, like Joe Biden. He's dumb. Joe Biden. He's dumb. He's so dumb. Look, I wouldn't swing at him so hard. But he's always been dumb. That's why I'm repeating a mantra. Yeah. He's Trump has created these mantras sleepy Joe. Oh, Jeb is a mess. It's like and it's fucking hilarious because it is so funny. It's like he's killing. Yeah. But it's also you don't take anything away from it. You're kind of like, OK, what just happened? I had a good time, but I don't get anything. It's wild. How they completely obliterate like he the last route because we've watched these fucking shows. They are shows rallies. The last one he's like, you know what's great about being president? You get incredible care from doctors. I had so many doctors and it's like you're literally like you are oblivious to the fact that people right now aren't getting money to pay for insulin. You know what I mean? There's people who can't afford their insulin right now and you're bragging that you had 10 doctors. It's and you're not like, you know, you're not signing whatever the fuck needs to be signed so people can get their checks. People people need their checks, man. People can't pay rent right now like that. There was there was supposed to be another bill passed. Right. But it didn't happen. Yeah. And it's not going to happen until after the election. Then you know, it's not going to be till a month after the election. Yeah. Anyway, man, look, God damn it, fuck it. We got political on this one. I'm sorry, everybody. I don't want to get political anymore. But it wasn't super political. It was more like fundamentally political, which I think is. It's a flea dip. You know that term? People don't. Yeah, flea dip. Like it's like you get all the all the nasty shit off you. Well, yeah, it's like the people who are like us, who have been harboring some deep hope that we're like white supremacist Trump supporting all right Nazis or whatever. They hear this and they're like, I guess I was wrong. You will get it. You'll get you'll get someone will send you a message and be like, you know, I really used to enjoy your stuff, Johnny. But it seems like something's gone wrong inside of you. It's a flea dip. Like all the people who are hoping you are like a piece of shit. Oh, I see you say like it's a flea off you. Yeah, it gets the fleas off the dogs. Like, you know what I mean? You don't want to like, you know, there's a piece of you that wants everyone to like you. But it's like, no, you don't let like let those people either like love you still, even though they disagree with you or reject you because of like how you feel or think, you know, yeah, that's a good. I've never heard that before. That makes a lot of sense. Connor Bebe gave me that. He's like, yeah, I do a flea dip sometimes because like, if you're not careful, they'll latch on to you. Because you know what I mean? Yeah, if you don't make if you don't make declarative statements once in a while about how you feel, then people ambivalences construed as whatever you want it to be. Well, yeah, then they're like, you know what? He just can't say it because, you know, he works in Hollywood, so he can't say it. So he's like keeping it a secret. But you know, really, they're into Trump. It's like, no, he is a piece of shit. If you like him, you're probably like bored and you've gotten confused. It's not your fault, but you got hypnotized by a classic thing to be hypnotized by the Carnival Barker. It's okay. No shaming it. Man, I've been hypnotized by so many con artists in my life. So many con artists. It's totally OK. It's just like you just got sucked in a little bit. That's all. Also, it feels good to get hypnotized. Yeah, it's fun. It's exciting. It's like those fundamentalist Mormons. You read that book under the banner of heaven. The best. Oh, my God. The last chapter of that, the last couple pages, when you basically ask that one guy, like the smart, I can't remember their name, but the super smart guy who's a fundamentalist, he's like, why do people do this? And he was like, you know what? It comes down to it. It's just if you are a fundamentalist Mormon, not talking about other Mormons, but like a fundamentalist Mormon, everything in your life that's a question, the answer is right there. Paradise. Paradise. It's paradise. You don't have to think about anything. Paradise. Hit your fucking wagon to the goddamn state and imagine that you're like in the right and you're going to be taken care of and enjoy your silly ride. Pretend you're a rebel. Pretend by like attaching yourself to a populist US president. Somehow you have risen above or you're part of this great tide. This identity too. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine all and then add to it all the nonsense that you have to add to it. Because you know in your heart that you're wrong. So you add to it all this subterfuge and imaginary like deep conspiracy where he's aligned with like, you know, some kind of like ancient beings or some secret cult or whatever. It's some bullshit like that. Let yourself believe that because when you look at him, you know the part of yourself that's done cocaine. You know what it looks like. It's just a coped up old man. It's nothing, nothing more than that. It's a coped up golfer. He should, you know, he's no different than people who run shopping who like shopping center landlords. Come on, he's into commercial real estate. That's a commercial real estate investor on cocaine. Stop with the other mystical shit. He's just blown out on Coke. I know what Coke looks like. You know what Coke looks like. The guys blasted on blow as are most of his constituents. It's just cocaine. That's it. Nothing special about it at all. I get like that when I'm on cocaine. Give me cocaine and I'll just say crazy shit when I haven't slept for like eight days. You know, you know, he doesn't sleep. You can look at his tweets. Dude, that's just crazy. Man, I was looking out there a day because I've been looking at his Twitter more because it just when he was putting out those videos and when he got the hospital, that was some of the best media I've seen in ages. Amazing. Just like, how is this real? Amazing. That stuff to me was, oh, it felt like it really does. I mean, this is a whole other podcast, but the whole idea of the simulation, it just comes. I constantly feel like stuff like that is the simulation being hello. Right. This is a simulation. Come on, guys. Yeah. Yeah. Don't you get it? Yeah. Like have some fun. You're going to die soon. Yeah. You better enjoy this video game. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know, I do feel like it's a sin. I feel like it's insta justice. You know, that's like what's really fascinating about like all the people around him got COVID. It's like, you know, just classic. It's like, yeah, you're hanging out with someone who has a pestilence. And you, of course, and you got it. And no one was like, it's like all these people, like you're looking at like Old Testament style justice. It's like they hung out with the demon and they all got sick. It's like, girl, basic bullshit. And all, but, you know, the other thing I like about Trump is he is a kind of like, he's a light in the sense that he's illuminating all the fucking crazy people, like goddamn Lindsey Graham. You know what I mean? Like all the people who like all those people who, in the future, you know, Tucker Carlson right now, you're going to get by for a little bit. Hannity, you're going to get by for a little bit. You'll be fine no matter what. You have shit tons of money. You'll be okay. There's not going to be some kind of guillotine revolution. You'll be fine. But like, they're not going to be fine. It won't matter to them because they'll be dead. Is in the future, people are going to look back at those bootlickers and they're going to look at them in the same way they look at like all the people, you know, any video of an American person talking about how he liked Hitler or whatever. It won't be that extreme, but it'll be like, look, they were supporting this guy who had clearly gone nuts. Yeah. It's like he has, like he's on the balcony posing, like fucking Mussolini or some shit, you know? It's so gross. He's clearly gone nuts. He's coked up. It's not rocket science, but you're like, you were the ones who like did the fucking, what's it called? Enabling. You were the ones who like, you could have been like, no, that's not, our leader should be not that, whatever that is is not it. But you were like, that's what it looks like. True leadership. He's a powerhouse. It's like, no, dude, that's just a coked up golfer. What's a guy who's, I've been on steroids before. I mean, that's why he made all those videos. He made all those videos after the hospital because he felt really, really good. And I was on steroids for almost all of sixth grade. I was the student council president. I did, I did like fucking everything you could do because I slept about three hours a night because I was on fucking steroids. My face looked like a chipmunk. But I was fucking, you know, you feel so good. You feel so fucking good. Yeah, man. He's flying on the wings of Eagles right now. And it would be fun to be the president and be high. And I'll tell you, if I became president, you better fucking believe I'd be high. I'd be high every day. I'd be on so much acid every day. I would be so fucking high. And I would love it. And if there's like a simulator in the future that lets me be like a high president, like the high president experience, you know, sitting in the Oval Office blasted doing fucking just, just high. You know how cool would be if Rockstar Games made like Red Dead Redemption, but instead it was, you get to play Trump. President. Be so, dude, do you know how fun it would be? Just think of this. You're in the Oval Office right when the speed kicks in. Right at that first moment when like the dopamine is pouring out or whatever it is, right at those moments, that moment where you're like, oh yeah. And then you realize you can call Putin like right now. And it's like 3 a.m. in Russia. And you can tell someone call, get Putin on the phone. I want to talk to him right now. And you will hear Putin be like, hello? Hello. And you're like, hey, what's up, dude? What are you doing? Are you asleep? You can be like, hey, do you want to talk to Jenna Jackson right now? Get Jenna Jackson on the line here. You can do that. You can conference and Jenna Jackson and you can fucking call up, you know, anybody can call anybody. Anybody could have them there in three hours. Probably a hypersonic jet. You want to fly in Trudeau? Be like, I can't tell you what it is. I need you here in three hours. Get them there and be like, dude, I just want to say I love you, man. You could do it. That's going to feel good. Thank you, Kanye. Very cool. Yeah. Kanye, thanks so much. That was awesome. Kanye, come by. Want to play video? Like, you know, that's a, it's a Koch heads dream come true to be president. Like there's nothing. Oh yeah. There's nothing better. It is kind of that because you have like this party at your fingertips. You can create like the ultimate party. Ultimate party and you could just legalize anything. You can just go, you can do a press conference. You can just like on a whim be like, hey, let's do a press conference. I'm going to say that I don't think people should wear socks and then I'm going to walk off. How do I think about that? Like that video he shot with the helicopter. That's like me when I realized that my director friend wants to shoot a short sketch. I, he likes it. Yeah, let's shoot it. He's like, yeah, you know what I mean? Like you've got a helicopter. Okay. Yeah, let's shoot it. I have an idea for a sketch. Oh, Johnny, I got to go man. This has been a delight. I love seeing you. What are you doing? Are you allowed to say what you're doing right now? Just making a movie, a little indie movie. But I came here a day early just so I could, you know, be extra safe. And also what hotel is that hotel looks nice. It is actually more of an apartment. It's actually an apartment. Oh, okay. It's a nice apartment. It's, it is nice. I got to say it is nice being in all this space. Why do apartments always have that fucking weird, like that art you have is literally in every temporary apartment. The black frame, the like sepia tone, unidentifiable structure. It's just to, uh, it's to be the least offensive possible, but still be there. All right. All right. I would love to be there, man. That looks fun. Johnny, where can people find you? Well, the best place right now is Twitch. Oh yeah. That's right. What's your, what's your show? I fucking, I love Twitch so much. I feel like it's the, it's the answer to the pandemic. Honestly, if it's, it's my, it's the first week I did it, I was as happy as I've been in six months. Are you playing video games on there? I play video games. I also do like just chatting. I do some like crazy psychedelic shit too, where I just, you know, watch videos and talk to people. The chat I have there is like the greatest. It's like the nicest, coolest, funniest people. I just, I can't, I'm sort of like blown away at the, uh, at how, how cool and fun everyone is. It's not at all like you think it would be. It's not a bunch of people talking shit or, you know, saying dumb stuff. It's, it's so much fun. It's twitch.tv slash justmynipples. Oh dude. Yeah. Are you doing it to, are you doing it while you're on the road, while you're shooting the film? Well, I was going to, but I'm having problems because I have my laptop. Normally I have my PC with the monitors and stuff, but I'm having problems getting the sound from videos to play through the OBS. Yep. So I might not actually do it the rest of this week, but you know, normally I'm, I'm normally on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and sometimes the weekend. You got it for sure. I have some ideas on how you could do that. Okay. Well, let me know. All right. Johnny, that was Johnny Pemberton. Thank you so much, man. Hare Krishna. Bye Duncan. Hare Krishna.

Hi everybody, it's me, Duncan Tressel, and since this is national, don't let the seething sea of anger inside of you take over your life month. I thought I would play for you this viral clip. You've probably already heard it, but it is a clip of a poor little gnome-like creature screaming at a trumpeteer on the streets of New York City, and it is an example of what happens when you allow the demon anger to possess your poor, hunched, tiny, angry New York body and send you down into the streets to really give it to a lonely trumpeteer. Who isn't that good? Are you any kind of artist? Anybody know who you are? Maybe anybody else wants to enjoy the peace and quiet. This is one of the most important places in all of North America. Who are you? Who are you? You miserable presumptuous, no talent. You're no artist. An artist respects the silence that serves the foundation of creativity. You obviously don't have the talent. You don't have enough respect for yourself or other people, or what it is to express yourself. In music, we're in the form of creativity, and I'm an NYU film school graduate, sucker, and the school of visual arts, and the Academy of Art University of San Francisco. You suck. You are no talent. If you really are a talent, go practice and get yourself a gig instead of ruining the end of the day for everybody down here. You disgrace. You are everything that's gone wrong in this world. You are self-consumed, no talent, mediocre piece of shit, and I've earned my right to say it. Okay? I had 200,000 people with Bill Grant in 1975. I want Bob Dylan up on stage. Who the fuck are you? I knew the Grateful Dead from 1966. Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? It's time to start reading Rom-Dos, or Tick-Not-Hon, or Deepak Chopra, or Drinking Kava Kava, or exercising, or eating hemp sandwiches, whatever it takes to make you more of a hippie. It's very sad and hilarious. I mean, look, I don't know. Having a Trumpeteer move into your neighborhood is probably similar to having scabies infest your neighborhood. The last thing you want, picking your street corner, is an aspiring Trumpeteer. Fledgling Trumpeteers have been tormenting people from the beginning of Trumpeting. My prayer is that if you happen to have a New York hell-nome living in your heart, that this week you keep him and it locked up in that basement, and don't let him come scrambling out to scream at whatever annoying version of this Trumpeteer pops up into your subjective universe over the next few days. Don't let the hell-nome free. Keep him locked down. To quote Lord Raymond Finch from his amazing book, Windows of My Soul, inside every human being is a southern mansion, and within that southern mansion is a basement. And within that basement is the product of incest, hunched and shivering, foaming at the mouth, using his nipple blood to paint pictures of demons on the wall. We must keep the incest child locked in the mansion of our hearts. If we open the door to the southern mansion within us, which is of course the mouth, then we must be sure that the basement is locked, or the incest child will throw his excrement out of the door in the form of cruel words and cutting statements. Keep the incest child locked in your heart, my friends, this week. Keep that poor, hunched, quivering thing with its oozing nipples spraying what looks like a combination of ranch and Italian dressing onto the dark, musty walls of that eternal prison. We must control ourselves, maintain mindfulness, and whenever the thing does start slinging shit words out of our sweet pie holes, may we be mindful of what comes out so we can change the pattern. This very pattern of slinging shit at each other is the source of all wars. Control the hell-nome. The great Tick-Not Han has a more merciful outlook on what to do when you have a New York hell-nome inside the incest basement that exists within the southern mansion of your soul. This is an excerpt from the audio book, The Art of Mindful Living, by Tick-Not Han. And he's an amazing Buddhist author who's written a ton of great books on mindfulness and Buddhism, but he has a much more merciful outlook. He doesn't see the thing as an incest child. He sees the thing that causes his anger to explode out of you as a little crying baby. I mean, I guess that it could be an incest baby, but he doesn't say that. When you have some anger in yourself, you bring mindfulness up in order to take care of your anger. And mindfulness becomes mindfulness of anger. Breathing in, I know that I'm angry. Breathing out, I know that anger is in me now. You are taking good care of the guest in your living room because mind consciousness is the living room and the store consciousness is your basement where you keep many things. And when something unpleasant appears in the living room, like a baby crying in the living room, mother has to come and take care of the baby, holding the baby in her hands, in her arms with loving kindness. Mindfulness is the mummy. When the baby of anger is crying a lot, kicking a lot, mother mindfulness has to come up and hold the baby in her arms because she is tenderness, she is love, she is care herself. That is why one minute or two minutes later, the baby stops crying and kicking. Mindfulness has the power of calming and stopping. If you continue to breathe in and out mindfully and embracing your anger in it, you will transform your anger. When the mummy holds the baby in her arms, her power of love and care will calm the baby but that's not the only thing the mummy does. Mummy is looking more deeply to find out why the baby is crying. And she may find out that the baby has some temperature or the baby may have some trouble in stomach, things like that. And that is the work of looking deeply to see the real causes of the pain. And that is the other aspect of meditation, vipassana. So that is a clip from Thich Nhat Hanh, the art of mindful living. We have to be mindful and understand why the baby in our basement is crying and then comfort and hold the baby instead of throwing bricks at him, doesn't work that way. Here now I'm going to play just one more clip, then we're going to get going with this podcast. This clip I think is a great example of what happens when people bring into action the stuff that Thich Nhat Hanh was talking about and decide to stop playing shit ping pong with the world. So this is a clip from the Daily Show. This is Malala Yusfazi, I don't know how to say her last name. She was shot in the face by the Taliban in Pakistan because she is an education advocate. And this is her talking about it with John Stuart from the Daily Show on Comedy Central. Do you realize the Taliban had made you a target? When in 2012 I was with my father and someone came and she told us that have you seen on Google if you search your name and the Taliban have threatened you and I just could not believe it. I said no, it's not true. And even after the threat when we saw it, I was not worried about myself that much. I was worried about my father because we thought that the Taliban are not that much cruel that they would kill a child because I was 14 at that time. But then later on I started thinking about that and I used to think that the Taliban would come and he would just kill me. But then I said if he comes what would you do Malala? Then I would reply myself that Malala just take a shoe and hit him. But then I said if you hit a talib with your shoe then there would be no difference between you and that talib. You must not treat others that much with cruelty and that much harshly. You must fight others but through peace and through dialogue and through education. Then I said I will tell him how important education is and that I even want education for your children as well and I will tell him that's what I want to tell you. Now do what you want. I know your father is backstage and he's very proud of you but would he be mad if I adopted you because you sure are swell. Isn't that incredible? It's really cool to put the New York Hell Gnome next to the Pakistani Angel and notice how the thing that they have in common is the way that they're dealing with anger is so potent that it's spreading all over the planet. Only in the case of the New York Hell Gnome what's spreading across the planet is a kind of garish display of hate and in the case of beautiful Malala Fawzi what you're seeing spread around the planet is an example of what happens when people transmute the anger inside of them into love. Both are really potent. Both have completely different effects on the world. So the next time you find yourself about to go screeching at a trumpeteer outside your house, take a breather, hold the little incest baby, feed him some pork rinds, comb his straggly oily hair and try to understand why he's crying. Okay, let's get on with the podcast. Did you know that according to a recent poll done by the Computer Friends Club that there is an 80% chance that if you hire a web designer he will end up murdering you or one of your family members. You don't want to watch some freak you found on Craigslist eat your daughter? Don't go through that. Why would you put your life through that? You don't have to do that anymore. Now you can go to Squarespace.com and safely build a website without having to involve some Craigslist lunatic who lives underneath a pile of old socks he ordered from teenagers in Thailand. Don't do that. Go to Squarespace.com. If you put my name in Duncan 10 you'll get 10% off their service which will allow you to create an amazing aesthetically pleasing website. They've got all the bells and whistles, a shopping cart. That means that you can finally sell all those gold plated molars you stole from Graves when you were a grave robber in your teens. You can sell t-shirts, you can start a blog. Most importantly you can use Squarespace to start a podcast. My friend Johnny Pemberton used Squarespace to design his website and Squarespace used Squarespace to design their website. They've got an amazing customer service department. They have an online chat and I actually tried emailing the customer service department because I wanted to see how long it would take for them to respond and they wrote back within a couple of hours. So it's a great service. They have everything you need to create a professional website at a really low price. Especially when compared to what you would pay for a web designer or the amount of time you would have to invest if you actually wanted to learn HTML and use DreamLeaver. If you put my name in Duncan 10 you get 10% off and if you sign up for a year it's $9 a month. That includes using the service to build your website, server space and also you get a free domain name. So it's an extremely good deal. If you want to make a blog, if you've been putting off selling those French baby skulls now you don't have any excuse. Come on you're going to really build your storefront in three dimensional space. It's not necessary. We don't have to construct objects jutting out of the time space continuum if you want to sell stuff these days. Forget the whole Tea Party Main Street nonsense. Main Street is now the internet. Do you really want to have to deal with some shop at the beach where you have to worry every second for some lunatic who's been snorting bath salts might come bashing in through the window of your clever t-shirt shop and behead you and use your head to fish for sharks? Don't do it. Squarespace.com. You don't even have to pay to try out the service. You can actually just fiddle around with the thing to make sure that it works or suits your needs. They're super cool. This is a great company and an example of some of the awesome stuff that is flowering off of the tree of the internet that is rapidly growing into the singularity where we all merge together and become one orgasmic melding of inorganic and organic matter. That's coming from me. That's not from Squarespace. But they are a great company. Check them out. If you put my name in Duncan 10, you will get 10% off and give it a shot. Sign up for God's sake.

In a recent poll done by friends of computer friends, they found that the shopping carts have within them and these are all shopping carts. If you put a microscope to a shopping cart, what you will see are the eyes of Satan gazing back at you. It's covered with over 7,000 different deadly viruses. Four talking impetigos sneezes from ill children pushed into the department store by their freaked out parents trying to buy cloth diapers to use to wipe up the blood of their recently executed husbands or wives. It's bad. Stay at home. If you want to go out, go out to get into nature. Go to the beach. Go to a lake somewhere.

They have a lot of amazing designs and you can check them all out by going to shortdesignt-shirts.com. If you put my name in, Duncan, you'll get 10% off your order.

They were just in LA for a few days and they took an hour out to come and do this podcast, which I'm very grateful for because they're both awesome people. Everyone, please open your heart chakras. Push that hell-nome into a soft feather bed. Tie them down. Ball gag your hell-nome. Wrap them in barbed wire. Give them a hug. Feed them poor crimes and send your love energy blasts through your earbuds down into the earth, through the fault line so that they rise up from the dark, hardened hell floor of New York City and bathe these two beautiful people in a shimmering shower of sweet love. Yes, I'm stoned. Please welcome Keith. Please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family hour, Keith and Hymda, also known as Keith and the girl. Welcome. Thank you so much for being here. I want to tell you guys a story before you get going about my podcast history because my podcast history starts with you guys. So I was doing a podcast with Natasha Legerro called The Lavender Hour and we were doing it sporadically once every few weeks. Just this kind of random thing, not taking it very seriously. And then Marshall Childs, who runs The Laughing Skull in Atlanta, which is this comedy club in Atlanta, randomly calls me up because he's been listening to our podcast and he's like, you guys have to take this more seriously because I like listening to you two talk and it reminds me of Keith and the girl. And he's like, do you know about this? And I didn't know anything about any podcast, anything. We were just doing this because I had done my friend's podcast and it just seemed fun. But I didn't realize the potency of the thing until he started sending me JPEGs of people painting your logo onto fucking bombs in the military. Yeah. Tattoos. Yeah. Tattoos of like, you know, he talks about like how, you know, just saying what we now we all understand about podcasts, but you are many of us, but you guys were the original, basically the original podcasters. We started over eight and a half years ago now. And yeah, we knew we'd take it seriously. We knew we'd put our all into it. We still didn't know how big it even could end up. Never mind how it would end up. Podcasting wasn't a thing that people were doing for money or for fame or for anything other than this is accessible and we really like doing it. And maybe it'll lead to, you know, people recognizing that we're talented in this way or that way. And then it'll launch into something else. Like it wouldn't be the podcast that would be launched as a career, but it did. It did. And this is what we do for a living. And it's amazing. And thank you for having us on your show. Are you kidding? Thank you for being on the show. Sam emailed me saying that you guys would be on my show. It's like, holy fucking shit. That's incredible. These are the legends of podcasting. And now I have to hire you as my nutritionalist. Oh, no, please, no. I'm just, I'm parroting something that my friend Tate Fletcher has told me. We had a conversation earlier, but I'm cutting sugar out right now and bread out. And that's just because of this conversation I had with this guy Tate Fletcher, who's this, he also has a podcast and he's like just this giant ripped guy. And he was just explaining to me, you know, how, what basically how fat, like we've been taught to think eating fat is bad from the old days, like don't eat fatty foods, don't eat fat, but actually eating fat as it turns out is great. It still doesn't clog your heart. I mean, I understand you have to lower everything, lower your fat, lower your carbs, just, you know, add in more greens, add in more vegetables, more fruits. But as far as I still know, and I have been trying to do it and it's, it's, I'm definitely addicted, but as far as I still, I understand the fats, at least when you're not doing any moderation, still clog arteries and still block the passageways. Let me say something. I am a two things. One, I'm not a nutritionalist and two, I'm a fool. So I'll hear something at a club for 30 minutes and make that my religion for like a month or two. But if I was hearing the show, I would hear fats are actually good for you. And I just turn it off and go, good to know. Told you, honey. Exactly. That's, that's what I'm doing. But this is large counts, right? What's that? Large counts. It's that this is coming only because this is coming from a guy who, you know, is just giant and ripped and, and, and also very logical and really understands, seems to really understand the chemistry behind it. Like, it's funny how, how far vibe goes because you were just vibing on this guy. I will fucking drink poison. All this means is I will end up in a cold. You fell in love with this guy. You had a man crush on him. I love him. Yeah. I did. Like, yeah, I got the alpha male spell put on. It's like hypnotized by muscles. I want to be alpha male too. Yeah. But you know, the idea is like, uh, so the idea is there's fat burners and there's sugar burners. That's how he broke this down to me. So sugar burn. What a great time at a club, by the way. Yeah. You guys had a blast. Yeah. Oh, so fun. Well, this is a, this is a comedy store. So it's just like out front before doing a show, but there's fat burners and sugar burners. And if you get addicted to sugar, as most of us are, then your cycle of energy is dependent on how much sugar is in your body. So you start feeling really tired or foggy and weird at moments in your life. And that's because you're running out of sugar and you have to eat more sugar. And that's the endless cycle of sugar addiction. And what's happening, what's making people fat is not the fat. What's making people fat is that your body reacts to sugar in the same way farmers react to a great season of growing food. It's like it's, sugar is like rain for, for yourselves. And so what they want to do is store up all that extra energy and that's what's making the fat. It's not eating fat. It's that you have all this insane, you know, brand new energy source way back in the day. If people wanted sugar, you know, they would have to find sugar cane or fruit and extra. But why doesn't the body know that don't worry, body, I promise I will give you more pie. Yeah. I'm gonna go down and work it off. Here's my bacon count. I have enough to get pie again tonight because it's just like a, you know what, it's just exactly like the psychology of a crack addict. You can tell them like, relax, we're going to get you more crack. It's like, no, no, suck your dick right now. That's your body with sugar. So anyway, I have stuck dick for sugar. Is this an intervention? This is a little fucked up intervention. No, you guys look great. By the way, you guys are, you guys are healthy and fine. No, it's just, just for me, I don't know. I do, too, though. Oh, you look amazing. You guys are very sweet. No, we're not being sweet. We wouldn't even bring it up. We would just call you fat behind our back. We'd say, you're silly, but we're going out of our way to say you look fit. Thank you. Well, I haven't been eating bread and sugar. Is this related to ball cancer? Yes. Well, it's to call it ball cancer, to be clear. I call it ball cancer. And then I feel weird, like when I, because then I feel like, ugh, I've embarrassed someone if they ask about it, because I'm like, well, you know, when you get ball cancer and then you feel like a weirdo, but it's, I think when you have it, when you have it, you can call it whatever you want. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. With my cancer. With my ball cancer. But you make... People say breast cancer. Right. That's a hit. I say titty cancer. Yeah. There, that's the exact, right. Exactly. Breast cancer is fine. Boob cancer, tick cancer. Yeah, I don't, it's kind of related to it in the sense that when, I'm sorry, I already told you this, but when I was getting radiation, when you get radiation, you're not, you're nauseated constantly. So I would, my body would just only wanted carbs and pancakes specifically. So I was... This isn't that very neutral. When I feel nauseated at bread or triskets, you know, the very tasteless foods are, seem to not upset my stomach more. This, isn't that normal? Yes. Yes. I think it was normal and it's like, fuck it. You know, I'm getting my, I'm getting my lymph nodes microwaved right now. I can eat whatever I want. And that got me really fat. I gained more weight than I ever gained in my life from that. So now I'm just trying to like, get healthy again. But it's not like I'm operating under the specter of cancer all the time or I'm thinking like, I should eat right because I'm afraid to die. It's more like, I've noticed that when I eat right, I feel so much happier. I'm not as depressed or irritable or grumpy or weird. And that's what sugar has done to everyone is, you know, this whole, the whole country is on antidepressants. The whole country is like down in the dumps and a lot of people don't realize that that depression is not stemming from some psychic problem. It's just from your body getting freaked out by this weird chemical cycle that it's in. And when you... Well, we were just talking to a nutritionalist at Ellie Podfest. She does have a podcast. I'm sorry that I'm forgetting the name right now. Is it nutritionist or nutritionalist? Great question. Nutritionalist? I think it's nutritionist. I'm the worst. Nutritionalist? Yeah. Nutritionalist. Somebody should know. I don't know. Anyway, we were talking to... Kind of does this to me when I tell her what's up. I'm like, it's nutritionist. Well, somebody out there will know. Oh, is it? I think it is. Didn't he sound a little doubtful? My think is like how I'm too nice. Oh, that's... You think you're too nice? I'm quite sure. No, let me explain. Almost now he was being too nice and he was not being direct so that I don't feel stupid. He was correcting me and going, well, you know, something in me tells me it's nutritionist and that you're fucking wrong, but he doesn't want to say that I'm wrong. Can I ask you guys a question? Sure. This is something I've been wondering about. Good. I brought a ball cancer. Do you think... Yeah, ball cancer. The only reason I'm not telling you about ball cancer is just because I feel like I've punched my talk about ball cancer ticket and it's like I don't have anything else to say about it. I feel guilty talking about it and also this is about you guys anyway. Let's do it. Here's a question I have. Okay. Do you think it's better to be honest yet criticize someone or to be dishonest and make someone feel okay? And in between because then you have the people that are, you know, the former say, hey, I tell like it is, but people need to be honest. I don't know about your sugar thing, but you're looking fat. I'm just telling how it is. I'm just saying what it is. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And in between, I guess. Yeah. Be aware of the conversation that you're having. Does this person want to know? Is he able to listen to you? Did he ask? Did he ask? You know? Right. But also there's information that, you know, sometimes helps the conversation or helps to know where the other person is or where you are in your own brain. So you have to kind of balance it. That's the toughest part about anything is not going one extreme or the other. No, don't tell me absolutely everything, but no, don't keep it to yourself. If you think, you know, I should know, maybe tell me gently. If you're about to find, you know, if I'm about to find out something negative, right? I don't know. I don't know the answer. I've, it's something I've been. We just told you the answer. Somebody out there will know. Can you tell me just a little bit about what it was like to, to get famous from podcasting, to be the first people who've seen, because you guys are celebrities. You're celebrities. You guys have a rabid following. I know that paparazzi out the window is really just distracting. You know, I think you guys are modest, but you really are. Like you have podcasting. You guys are podcasting celebrities. Well, thank you. And I think we forget that people know us. I wouldn't say that we're famous, but we were just at LA Podfest, like I said, and it was, it was fun to introduce ourselves and people say, yes, we know your show. And that always, especially with other comics. And so we feel like we're gaining the respect of not only our listeners, but it seems like also other comics, other people in podcasting. It was very fun when you just told the story about your friend that runs a comedy club. Yeah. Coming up, listening to Keith and the girl. I'm like, ah, I know that club. That's fun. Yes. I think we're always, we're always surprised by it in a nice way, you know, basically. Like, so if, if we do get recognized on the street, we're surprised and excited by it and a little nervous about what we just said for the last 10 minutes, because how long have you been listening? You know? And on us. Yeah. On the subway or wherever. I always feel like that too. If anyone like, yeah, anyone who says they listen to my podcast, I always think, oh, that last episode was shit. I hope you were tuning in to earlier episodes, but yeah, I know what you mean, but what's curious. I've been on the subway for example, and somebody was sitting next to me and we were, we were going, uh, many subway stops and then I get up and they say, Keith, I really love your show. And I'm like, God, was I picking my nose? What was I doing? Yeah. Right. Say something earlier. Yeah. Did I, did I not let a elderly woman sit down in my seat? Like, let me know. Yeah. And, and, and that's a very, it's a very strange thing. Like when I, like for me, I, you know, I've been doing comedy for years, years, and you know, I tour around Joe Rogan and stuff, but I certainly wasn't in a place where I could like, you know, I could, I could headline in the sense that I had the material, but as far as like drawing crowds before podcasts, forget it because I wasn't on TV. I have, I've done little things on TV. I've never really been on TV. Well, now you're being modest, you know, you've done some pretty impressive things. I've done, yeah, but since this thing happened, and to me, I think that's one of the beautiful things about podcasting is that, you know, for me, to be very, very honest with myself, TV never really liked me that much. They never did. They never liked me that much. And I'm cool with that. I recognize that. I'm not a symmetrical person. I'm a weird looking person. I talk about drugs a lot. You know what? This, this is the sound that every comic makes, I think, you know, TV doesn't like me. They want to, you know, a lot of it has to do with editing or not, not being me and the jokes are too harsh and blah, blah, blah. First of all, you're a very good looking person. Yeah. You guys. No, I, I, you can't possibly not know that. I feel very, I'm an insecure person. Have you ever heard this? You're like a handsome Jason Lee. Yeah, I, that's why I'm very insecure. God damn it. I now feel like I'm fishing for stars. No. Well, the reason I'm saying this is, is because I'm the worst. No. Now you go. You guys are so cool, man. You guys are, the reason I'm saying this is because what I love about this form of entertainment is that it has created an avenue where people can do self-expression in the grand scale with no interference or no having to go like, no boss, nobody telling you what you're producing and when you're producing it, when you have to stop the show and start the show, what you have to look like as you're doing it, what to stop saying and what to start saying and when to do that. Yeah. Absolutely. It's complete freedom. And one of the things that's really important of the system right now is that the people who are getting microphones shoved in front of their faces, generally a lot of it has to do with just the way they look. That's it. It just has something to do with their facial symmetry, has something to do with like, or they managed to navigate a system. Like that's all TV is, that's all the movies are as a combination of talent. And then a lot of being able to navigate through this weird labyrinth of initiations that are called auditions till you get this thing and once you've navigated that labyrinth, your image gets projected to the masses and then that creates the phenomena people call fame and then that's where suddenly people want to hear what you have to say just because you navigated a labyrinth that got a camera on in front of you. And there's a very nerve wracking feeling of all or nothing. And so I think that's why a lot of people quote sell out. I think selling out is a very personal choice. I don't think what one person does is selling out for another person, but I feel like once you're famous, now your life has changed so much. You can't undo it unless your life unravels in a way, unless you completely lose everything. You can't change the amount of fame and that. And then if you lose that fame, you lose the money that comes with it. It's such a, for me, if I had the kind of fame that Miley Cyrus has, for example, I'd be panicked every day. I'm not saying don't give me opportunities and don't let me speak my mind and don't let me entertain people for money. I'm saying don't follow me with every move I make. I'll let you know. Well, right. And that's kind of the, that's also a weird, beautiful thing that podcasts gives you is it gives you this weird kind of underground thing where you aren't so every, you're not that like, I'm not, that's not like that's something probably any of us would beat, beat away if it came, came to us, but it still, it creates this new version of having an audience because you guys are beloved. You guys are like people consider, people consider you their best friends. Like people are addicted to you. They consider you to be their friends. They feel. We are, we are friends with them. We are friends with a lot of listeners. I am your friend. Keith married a listener. And that's right. So that's how friendly we get. I'm going to go through all of them. It's going to be a long process. You're going to marry all your listeners. It's going to be your turn soon. Just wait it out. You know, what's interesting is, you know, if you let people have that kind of medium, if you let us record whatever we want, turns out we'll tell you everything. Our show has all the crazy, I mean, we're not completely open about apps. We have some private life, but I can't, I can't name something, but there's something right. We have told you in the past eight and a half years, pretty much everything that has happened in our life, all the big events, all the emotional scarring, all the hardships, all the fun things that have happened. So it's interesting that we still want to do that, but we just want to do it our way so that we're heard in the way that we feel comfortable. Now that seems to be one thread that runs through all really good podcasts is that tendency towards honesty or that revelatory tendency where you don't want to hold anything back to the point where sometimes after I've uploaded a podcast, I think like, holy shit, man, what did you just tell everybody? You know, because you get so comfortable with this medium that you want to, there's a confessional aspect to it, isn't there? Yeah, but everyone wants to be seen. Everyone wants to be known in a way that it's like, this is really me. So I'll tell you who I am if you're really listening. Yes. That's why we go, I mean, people meet at their homes in coffee shops to share their stories with each other. I think we're the only species who has to do that. I don't think that lizards are getting together like, you have no idea what kind of mourning I had. Seriously, and this weather on top of everything, just kill me now. Right. Picture of a worm, I'm going to eat that later. I don't know what they eat. Oh God, I so wish lizards went to restaurants. I wish there were a little mini restaurants for lizards, you see the lizard menu. So yeah, I think that that is the polar opposite of the old model of the entertainer, because the old model of the entertainer, remember scandals? Like scandals, you could have a scandal, like someone finds out some little thing about you and that's called a scandal. And there seems to be this weird divergence that's happening between these old school private types. You just want to keep everything to themselves and put on this sort of impression of who, you know, like think about George Clooney, I don't know anything about fucking George Clooney. He has a pig and he's hard to tie down. You think he's a pig? No, no, he has a pig. He owns a pot belly pig. He's not kidding. Holy shit, I love him more and more. I know he's buying a satellite, did you hear about that? He's buying a satellite to spy on Sudan because he's really into what's going on over there. He's doing activism with him. Can you just do that? And, you know, you just gave him up, right? What's that? You just gave his position away. Sudan's listening. Oh, yeah. A lot of people, a lot of Sudanese rebels listen to my podcast. This is the thing when people kind of goes back to what you were saying. Most podcasters record in their apartment or their house like you're doing. And so they think, they know it's going out, but they're like, I'm in my house. It's almost like I'm talking to myself. So then they share their personal things and then you're like, wait a minute, I just uploaded that. You don't know what's going on in Sudan. You just assume there's no way they're herring you. But if you have something to say to them, say it. Don't shoot down Clooney's satellite, you assholes. Right, he's just watching. Stop bombing people. Right. And now maybe say it with less cursing so they're not offended. My sweet friends in the Sudan. Why must we kill each other? You're so evil that you have George Clooney watching you. You can't help yourself. She has a pig to take care of people, please. Strangers are just friends we haven't met yet and speak a language we don't know. Oh, wow. And have a way of life that's incomprehensible, but still. Now you guys, you, you're very positive people. Do you think that that's another thread running through this thing? Do you guys, do you feel a responsibility to not put negative shit out there? Oh my God. Don't let everything just be based on Keith's sarcastic speech just now. Yeah, I would not say I'm a positive person. I'm, I'm, I'm a negative person, but you won't, you, you don't see the negativity dripping off of me. I, I think nothing's in my life, my life specifically, I think nothing's really going to work out on the way, but at the end somehow it's all going to work out, makes no sense. And I thinking these little things aren't going to work out, I'm almost never disappointed because of that. I seem like a positive person. All right. You see what I mean? Yes. I'm very, I'm positive because I'm always negative. You're positive. Right. Well, no. Okay. You call it negative. Right. But I'm just reading this book by Chogium Trumpa about Buddhism and he, is that a real person? It's real names, David Williams, he had to change it so people would listen to him. And I was thinking that like if Buddha's name had been Frank, would the religion even exist if his name, if it, if Jesus, this is a documentary about that. I'm forgetting his name, but he specifically grew out of beard and grew out his hair and wore the kinds of clothing that a quote guru would wear and he presented himself as such. He made up his own sort of religion and following and just to discover if people would follow him and how they would feel about it. But he changed people's lives in the process because he did give them what they need. He gave them some peace of mind. Yes. Right. Now that, see that is a very postmodern documentary and I haven't watched it yet because I, I, I like, I love Ram Dass and I love his, you know, Ram Dass. He's like Richard Alpert. He was a Harvard professor. Are you thinking Ramstein? Who? Ramstein, the band? Maybe that's what you're thinking. Ramstein, the gay, heavy black metal band, is that what you're thinking? Yeah. I worship them. I haven't altered them. I spray goat's blood on every morning. Anyway, it's the, the point is I like, I like to believe in magic and I like to believe that in some people, they're in, in a person, in yourself, there's the ability to cultivate a state of love all the time. I like to believe that that's possible and so I like stories about gurus or people who have really reached a heightened state and that transform people and that I thought it's called Kumare, I think is the name of it and that documentary is very challenging to me. Isn't Kumare what I'm drinking right now? That's kombucha. Wow. I love that. I've introduced you guys to kombucha and the Oculus Rift. That's very exciting to me. Two very important things. That was trippy. Yeah. That was amazing. Yeah. So anyway. I think, I think that you're right. And I don't think that we necessarily need gurus. I think that gurus are sort of used like therapists. You are outside of my life. So you're able to look with a fresh perspective. You're able to, to be calm or at least for me, you're calm because you don't know what's going on in me. So that I could mirror that calm and I could sit beside you and feel that. And so in a way, yeah, they are doing that to you. But I think that we both could sit here and say, hey, let's be calm. Let's pass our energy. Let's you know, really love each other, you know, and I'm not, obviously I'm not talking sexually. What do you mean pass our energy? Like if I, like just now I changed your energy and I saw it in your face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that you can do that. She's a witch. You wish me a woman. He likes the idea of magic, but when it happens, it's witchcraft. Yes, for sure. No, right. Right. Yeah. That could happen in just getting to know you in feeling like I'm coming over to really sit down with you, not to judge you, not to, not to look around and say, oh, this part's dirty in your house or this part's this way or that way. I don't know if the images came this morning. This house is amazing. It really is. Because the maid was just here. I'd like you to believe that this is what it's always like. Done. But you could do that to other people and I'm sure you have, you know, and I'm sure you have with your podcast. I'm sure you have when you introduce them to new and exciting things because you're excited about it. You, you like to pass on your excitement to people. When we first came in here, you're like, we can't record anything. You have to see my new toy. Yeah. And so we got excited for you. So you passed your energy to us because you're so in tune with that energy and you want to give it to us. Like you're handing it to us. Right. And isn't that the instinct of podcasts? You want to do that for the world. You want to pass on the, you want to pass. It seems like podcasts. You don't have to. I think some people are just there to entertain, which I guess you're passing on some, you know, happy feelings and passing on boredom. It's like, I think what's, you know, like who wants to be entertained by, like, you know, that kind of, that whole thing I think is just dying. And I think that's one of the byproduct. Entertainment. Not entertainment, but bullshit entertainment. I think there's something about when people like, you know, you turn on Jay Leno, very funny, Conan O'Brien, very, not very, I don't know, why did I say very, okay, entertaining. Okay. Funny moments that might be funny, at least something that like, I can't believe I just said something had to have happened. That was once funny. It's by entertainment is very by 26, 25 minute mark. He had to have done something. Yes. Although everybody says what a great standup he was back in the day, I feel like people feel bad if they don't give somebody something. I've never seen one, my $1 million challenge. Oh boy. Show me a video tape of Jay Leno ever being funny doing standup back in the day. I want to see this great Jay Leno. It's so fucking good. We have Bill Hicks. We have the guy that invented cursing. We have George Carlin as a kid. I've never seen one tape of Jay Leno. He was so fucking hilarious. Yeah. That's Keith passing on the positivity. I'm very positive. That is positive. Here's, I'm positive. Fuck him. Yeah. But it's coming. But you can't help it because love's coming out. And that's the thing. That chin is like a devil horn in reverse. Here's the thing about negativity and positivity. People think being positive means that you only say nice things. That's crap. I think that you can, if you're a happy person or if you have within you this weird, connective sense that some people either have through working on themselves or just through experience or who knows what, then it doesn't matter what you say. You really can spew hate for Jay Leno for 20 minutes and it's just going to make people smile. Here's someone who's got worms in their heart, someone who hasn't worked on themselves. They can talk about how we all need to love each other and it's so important that we connect in a real way and really unify and move in the direction of God. And you feel as though you just got molested by some sicko. And it's because the words are just a sort of medium through which some deeper energy gets transmitted, which is why I said- Because they're full of shit. And you could feel it. You could sense it. They're talking past you. If you were so in love with love and me and energy and everything that I am, you wouldn't talk through me. You would actually be looking at me. You would see that I'm not comfortable with what you're saying. You would feel my molestation and stop raping me. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Exactly. And that's why I love this idea of there being like a real Kumare, a real Guru type because the idea is that it's like a being that's so plugged into that thing that most people only feel every once in a while. Like every once in a while, I will feel like taking a walk on the river or something, you know, if I'm stoned maybe with my dog. And it's just this moment of like, man, what a great universe. This is a really beautiful moment. And then I'll plunge into like days of neurosis after I think about something I said to like an ex-girlfriend. And like for, I'll be, I'll be rolled under the wave of my own neurosis. But those moments, those moments, the idea is that like maybe you can cultivate it so you're always in that state or there's always just this sense of like, ah, this is great. Would you really be podcasting if you always felt, ah, this is great? We still have to maneuver our way through life and make money and live in the world that we already, I guess not committed to, you know, that we're already in that has already been set up for us. And no matter what, we have to understand that this is the setup. So we could be activists and we could try to change the world. But you know, I don't mean to seem negative, but at the end of the day, we are still living in that world. And unless we make massive changes with everybody in on it, it's still going to be this world. So why don't you hold on to that meditation and that lovely moment and that will get you through, you know, the hard job that you have to go through. And maybe it's not that we have to be in a state of constant love of, you know, every single moment and appreciation. Maybe we have to be realistic in order to keep maneuvering and keep moving and keep doing what we need to do. Yeah. So like the, you could still appreciate it though, all day long, but the idea, you know, it's kind of like drugs. It's like if you get attached to some specific psychic state, psychological state, then what's it? You're just addicted to a neurological drug. You're addicted to whatever makes a dopamine and serotonin happen to be pumping out at that very moment. Like being addicted to anger. Right. Yeah. So you want to, you want to, it sounds like you want to be addicted to nirvana. Yeah. Well, yeah, I just, you know, I, I just watched this documentary last night on happiness. It's on Netflix. It's really fucking good. Oh, I keep meaning to watch that. And is it good? Oh, it's great. You should watch Kumari. It's not going to make you bummed out. I'll check. I'll check it out. Yeah. It's interesting because the idea of the guru is not that they, is that they reflect what's already inside of you. They're just reflecting. You're just using, you're bouncing off of them and you're, we're bouncing off of everybody. Like when you see someone, you're seeing some percentage of what they are and a larger percentage of what you think they are. Yeah. But a guru is someone safe to bounce off of because we want to show everybody who we are. And we want to show our vulnerabilities, but a guru with somebody safe that you could say, I'm going to show you that I am so, you know, black hearted or feeling so down or so upset with myself. I've made some bad moves. It's sort of like what people get out of a priest, but a priest has that judgment and harshness and Catholicism and craziness and, you know, terrible, terrible magic in there. A guru is coming from nowhere. It's not coming from, and then you have to say Hail Mary, and then you have to do this. And then you take care of yourself. And I will hold your hand maybe during the process. Love you. I love you during the process. Yeah. And that's why I think podcasts are an interesting version of that because what we're doing in our weird confessional way, when you find yourself announcing to the world, whatever darkness is inside of you, what you're doing is you're giving everyone else in the world this permission to be like that too in a good way. Or it's like, oh shit, the thing that they're announcing with no fear is something I've been hiding from myself or from my family. You're absolutely right. I was listening to your show and I'm like, yeah, I do fucking hate summer. You know what I mean? Fuck it. Yeah. I'm just fucking sweating. I wonder if you can put on something more. You can't keep taking off. You're absolutely right. But you also have a thing, Keith, that you say that no matter what we say on our show, no matter how crazy we feel it is, at least the quarter of our audience is feeling the same way. You're not alone in any bullshit that you're going through. Anything that you think is absolutely insane and somebody will point a finger and say like really? Yeah. Oh, you're like what? Somebody else is going to go, no, that's true. But do you see what, this is why podcasts are weirdly healing because up until this point where we've been able to do this kind of, well, I don't know what you call it, whatever it is, this form, this interaction, to record these kinds of interactions, you would watch TV and you'd turn on the Brady Bunch or you'd watch an interview on Letterman with some famous person and everyone's great, great, big smiles glowing with happiness. They look fucking good 99% of the time. No one's like, yeah, you know, Dave, I just got one of my balls chopped off and I'm kind of worrying that maybe I might have to get the other one chopped off one day and then I'm going to be a eunuch. What do you think about that, Dave? Even when we hear these scandals, let's say, a divorce or your show just got canceled, they don't talk about it and I feel like I'm being lied to almost. What are you thinking? What are you feeling? A sentence or two is all takes. Yeah, I was on board with you this whole time. Let me be on board with you through this also. Yes. Then what that creates is a culture of shame and denial because people naturally imitate celebrities or people they see on TV and so suddenly you start thinking like, oh shit, I guess I have to smile all the time, feel good all the time and if any kind of darkness comes into me, I should hide it because I don't want my own scandals. When the truth is, we're a fucking primate hive and as primates, a big part of what we are is monkey. Yeah, but that's not to say that people should just unload on you. I feel like there's a distinction, there's a huge difference between going, hey, how you doing? You're like, my life sucks, let me just pour this shit on you because that is negativity. I mean, you still have to be aware that there's another human being also probably going through something. Yes, you're right, you guys. It is a balance, but I'm sure you guys must get loads of fan mail all the time. Then we take that in and that's the way it's a two-way street, I think. Yes. Yeah. So you find yourself being changed by the audience, like the input from the audience teaches you. Absolutely. I wish I had an example, but I know the answer is absolutely. Elvis. Our buddy Elvis. Yeah. Elvis has like pretty much a whole arm tattooed of different Keith and the Girl things. When we were broken up initially, we didn't tell anyone and Elvis was going through ... Leukemia. Yeah, and a really like part of his, the hardest times of his leukemia. So Keith would, to help himself feel better, would go on our chat room, Keithandthegirl.com. Just go on there and sometimes there's just people going there, he would start a party and they would just interact with each other and one of the biggest supporters and interactors was this guy Elvis and they didn't even know that they were helping each other through one of the roughest times of their lives and they were just kind of there. They didn't really have to talk about it and they weren't talking about it. They were escaping from it together, knowing that you gather positivity so that you can stay neutral for the rest of the day and so they replenished each other. They did that thing where, when you're playing a video game, power up, so they were powering each other and it was such a ... I didn't notice until Elvis came for the first time to New York and I saw the look on Keith's face when I said like, hey, let's invite him to this thing and Keith never gets this response or almost never and the sense of excitement in his face was really, I don't know, it was ... Poppable. Yeah, it was so sweet. I bet. Here's my buddy Elvis coming. He's the guy who saved my life. Yeah. That's another side of this thing. I've made now ... I mean, I have a lot of my best friends or people I've just had on the podcast that after that I've become friends with and then I'm friends with people who listen to the podcast. I just, you end up making friends with them so it's this whole weird new thing. Where do you guys think it's going to go in five years? What do you think podcasting is going to look like in five years? After it bounces off Clooney's satellite. I don't know, just like TV, anything, just bigger, bigger, more ... TV. People know ... No, not podcasts going to TV per se, just this ... I mean, I don't want to name dying things, radio or newspaper, but take anything, it's more legit. People know what podcasts are now. They didn't eight years ago. Right. We didn't find a different word for it so people understood. Internet talk show was tough for people to get their head around, but now everybody knows what it is. It's in your phone. It has its own section. It has its own app that comes with your phone, all this. Just more and more, just for lack of a better word, a legitimate thing. I think it's gaining more respect. When you gain more respect as a medium, you can navigate to where you want it to go. It's still podcasting. It's still independent. If you want it to be, you could still join a network, but networks are mostly run by other comics who respect the independence of turning on a mic when you want, booking your own shows and your own guests and things like that. The more respect we have, the more doors open, the more opportunities we have to pick and choose from. Do you think you're going to end up with a TV show or something? Is that the direction you want to go in? It's not something we're angling for per se, but maybe. We got a book deal. We weren't angling for that either. We weren't asking for it, but an agent approached us thanks to Scott Sigler, another podcaster who was well-respected, who got on the bestseller list with his books, and he recommended us. All of a sudden, we were writing a book, and it's out, and it did really well. First 2000, the initial printing sold out in a week. It's very exciting. Wow. I ran the housebook. You guys are so cool. I know you got to go. We have a few more minutes. We have like 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Beautiful. Okay, cool. I hate saying that. We only have 10 minutes. No, I know. Well, you're busy. You're only in LA until tomorrow, so I'm sure you got to ... Are you doing other podcasts today? We are, but also, I haven't had a chance ... I've been here for a week, haven't had a chance to really sit down with my brother Michael, who lives here, and his girlfriend Maricela, who I adore them both, and I do want to really sit with them instead of being like, we got to go this way. Tell your dad to drive us blah, blah, blah, and what else do we have going today? Can you help us with this mailer? That's a positive family, though. Her Maricela's dad is driving us around, and they're like, okay, let me know, and we'll do your laundry when we're gone. It's like, I don't know. We don't want you and your family doing all this stuff. That's what we do. We're family. I'm like, oh. Is that what it's supposed to be? Yeah. Maricela has the kind of family that we're like, yeah, could you marry into ours so that we can just decide that that's how it works? But now don't you owe him forever? Right. Isn't he passive-aggressively just mean to you after that? Doesn't he make your next seven choices? Next seven choices. What is that? That's awesome. That's a great idea. What is that? What's that from? I don't know. That's a funny idea. That's a great idea for, I hate saying this, that's a great idea for a movie. Somebody gets to make seven choices in a row. You saved their life or something. You know what? There's a, there's a funny British TV show called My New Best Friend where basically the comic would come live with you for a weekend and the only rule is you could not give away that you actually didn't know him. And so basically the idea behind it was he would destroy your life for the weekend. And if you could stay with him for a weekend without letting people know. You get a free CD. You get money. A lot of money. Okay. So he would do things like make them write resignation letters and send it to their boss. He would hang out with- What the fuck? Yeah. Why would you do this? So you lose your job. Are you willing to lose your job? Your house set on fire and- You wouldn't say your house on fire. It was more, but yes, girlfriend stuff, it was like more psychological. It was pretty funny to watch. It was kind of brutal. But would you do that? Who would do that? Let's say it would have to be money for the rest of my, it wouldn't even because my relationships in general, not even with the person, you know, that's, you know, my number one are so important. It takes a lifetime to build this kind of thing. I'm not sending them a letter of resignation because you're funny. But you're a clearly a healthy person. Have you ever seen the contract people have to sign for American Idol? Yeah. You saw that on the internet. It was like a terms and conditions. I signed it. I tried out for American Idol. I was out of ideas. This is before the podcast. I've been trying to become a singer and, and Keith was like, you really should try out for this. And I said, I, I guess so. I don't know what else to do. It's coming. And it's the first time they opened it up to people who were a little older than 23 or 24. I had just missed the age when they first started. Demons. That it was nonsense. Don't bother doing it. And I, I'm not saying like, Hey, they should have picked me, but I could sing a little bit. They should have picked her. And they, they, they, they use you for the, for the line most, you know, and I saw this like an idiot. And the goes in and it's like four people in front of judges, not the one, not the, you know, famous ones. And they go down the line and sing and him to sing beans on burn in the kitchen. Right. And a little movie. No. No. I'm not going to do it. You know, you know, we're moving on up to the side to a deluxe apartment in the sky. And that's my voice. I mean, the car's singing sometimes to whatever's on the radio and, and kind of goes, uh, okay. But you know, if you're going to sing it right and then I go, no, that's, I am singing it. And she goes, no, you could sing better than that. So I sing again. She goes, no, I mean, do it for real. You could sing better than that. Stop telling that story. It makes me sound so obnoxious. I never tell people to sing right. Here's what happened with me and Keith that day. Keith, Keith has like really good rhythm. I feel like he could play the drums if he just, you know, took a couple of lessons or just kind of, you know, applied any kind of energy to it. Not that I'm saying he has to, but he's got that thing happening. And so I was like, whoa, when he sings with the radio, there's only a couple of things that are pitchy and he seems like he's mocking it. So I was like, Hey, I want to hear you without mocking it. I want to see what you really sound like. And he took offense. I'm just like, I think you're mocking it. Why would he take offense? Thank you. You think that his singing voice is a parody because he's sarcastic all the time. And because when I, when I sing with the radio, a lot of times I sing sarcastically because a lot of times when you do have the ability to sing and you sing with the radio, people get annoyed. They're like, okay, we get it. So I mock it. I thought he was mocking it. You're a talented person. Talented people are really funny. It's like walking down the street and you know, it's like, it's like being like a professional athlete and you're jogging in a, you're running in a marathon. Like you ever seen the Ethiopians running a marathon? They're so fast. They're doing like 12 miles per hour and it looks like anyone could do it. You're like that. And you're like someone running by someone who has like a bad knee, just trying to do the marathon just to do it. And she's running backwards and heels. You're running backwards and heels being like, Hey, why are you joke running? Oh man. Why don't you real run? You should try real running. Not joke running. That's clown running. That's funny running. It's like, this is all I can do. It was, I swear with a compliment, I was seeing a talent in him and I, it's really because, oh, you know what? Fuck you guys. I just know what it's like because my singing voice is awful. It is awful. And I, and like, let's hear a little bit. We're moving on up to the top. Can you stop joking? We finally got off the thing and we got money and then other things. That's my boy. My friend is a singer. He's an abandoned. When I, when I remember singing for him once and he's like, man, maybe you should get your hearing check. Oh shit. Maybe you should get your throat fixed. Our hearing. Yeah. Come on. No, it's summer. It has something to do with like hearing too, because like maybe like if you hear your voice in a certain way, you can modulate it better or something, but I don't know. I just don't have that kind of vocal control. Which is really interesting because Keith can hear better than me. No joke. I have insane hearing and like doing, when we do our podcast, I hear like a little sound going on that nobody else hears and I got to fix it and it's a pain. I wish I had worse hearing. You guys have a podcast studio though. Yeah. We turn an apartment into a studio. Yeah. Yeah. So you guys are at the, that seems to be like the ultimate podcasting level. As it goes from your living room to suddenly you're in a studio. I don't know. I wouldn't say that. I would say like this is just, it's the same out of our house. We started out of our house. The reason why it's not in our house is because we're not a couple anymore. And so we didn't want to put the studio in one of our houses. We felt like if we lived with someone and we were going to live with someone, then it intrudes on their life and because we do it every day, it's not a once a week thing. So we have a commitment to it every day. It's better that we go somewhere else. Right. And there's something about going somewhere else where you're going to work, let's say. Yeah. Because we're there all day, like a job. We meet at a time. We work on the show, Danny Hatch, we now hire to help Keith with show notes. I answer some emails and do the more production. So we're doing that. So what you're hearing is an hour or two of our show every day, but we're in the studio all day long. I got to step it up. Yeah. I'm lucky if I spurt one of these things out every week. You guys are in there every day. But you're doing stand up and you have other projects going on. You're writing for TV. You're doing this kind of thing. We, you know, aside from like some book deals. This is all we got. And what a great, all we got. Yeah. What a wonderful thing, man. How can people find you? Go to Keithinthegirl.com and of course all the social stuff, Twitter, Facebook, all this, look up Keithinthegirl. And we're on iTunes, enter Keithinthegirl. Please find us there. And you know, if you like it, give us some stars. If you don't, please mind your own business. Positivity is what it's all about. Yeah. Don't do a one star rating, you dicks. What is that? And also your book. What's the book called? The book is What Do We Do Now? And Keith also wrote a book called The Great American Novel. It's about his life. We have it in audio form as well and e-book as well. Is that on Audible? It's on Audible now. Yeah. And it's also in our store. And Keith's new CD just came out. Good Clean Fun. It's the first time that he's clean ever. And well, you know, kind of clean, right? Clean in that there's not curse words. Dirty in that sometimes you watch something on CBS and you're like, he just said that. Right. He really still just said that. He said it that way. Like I do like one stand up show every year. I don't have the passion for it like you do, but I love the challenge. And so this 10th album, this 10th one, I did like every year it's different. But this 10th one is like a best of, but I'm going to make it quote clean. You have 10 albums. I wasn't aware of that. Yeah. Wow, man. That's so funny. You got to hear him do stand up. Wow. How often do you get? Do you stand up? Once a year. I practice in my house. Yeah. Seriously. Once a year. He's on pause right now. Are you watching me have a midlife crisis in front of you because like I've been doing stand up forever. I have no album. I have no album. How dare you. You should. I don't know. Record an album. Yeah. I don't want to record an album. I don't know. Well, then you don't want, if you don't want to, you don't want to. But if you're looking like, damn, I wish I had some albums, make an album. You have a studio in your house. Make an album. Man. I wish you guys lived in town. You're fucking cool. Come to our town. Yeah. I'll be out there. I'll be there eventually for sure. And I'm going to have a link to all your stuff on the website. So guys, definitely, definitely check them out because these are legends and I think all podcasts owe a little bit to you guys because you really did. Wow. Thanks. You are trailblazers and I'm honored that you took the time out of your busy schedule to be on the podcast. This has been so much fun. It's been so nice connecting with you and this I'm going to turn into a hippie right now. Please do. You have a great vibe. I enjoyed your organic coffee. Oh, great. Thank you very much for having us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye. Thanks. Thanks for listening, my sweet darlings. If you enjoy this podcast, give us a little rating on iTunes. Won't you and go listen to Keith and the girl and hold yourself tonight. Know that you are love. Everything will work out just fine. I promise you, even though you might end up completely lonely, homeless, cast aside by the winds of fate, at least you still have these swirl of atoms that makes up your body. And when you have a swirl of atoms that you can control, you are more powerful than a mountain because mountains can't do anything except sit there and watch climbers fall off of them. I should go now. Have a great week.
369^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - PENDLETON WARD & JESSE MOYNIHAN Transcript and Discussion^2013-03-09^Hello friends, it's me Duncan Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. I'm broadcasting from my mom's house in the mountains of North Carolina where I've come because my mom is in the last stages of cancer and is dying and I've come up here with my brother to take care of her and say goodbye and go through all the various technical things that you have to go through when one of your parents is about to exit this particular part of the multiverse. In the days leading up to this my mind created a much more horrible scenario than what is actually happening. In my mind there would be a kind of gothic Paul hanging over everything. There'd be black curtains draped over the windows and brass bird cages filled with emaciated half-dead birds chirping their last chirps as my mom went in and out of states of gnashing demonic possession. In my mind I predicted that my world would collapse. That there would be a Dostoevsky style plunge into the dark waters of existential anguish. That from bearing witness to the horrific brutality of life and seeing the cold cruelty of nature and disease and the way it rinsed to shreds mothers and fathers and dogs and leave smoldering psychic craters in the lives of all who were left behind. That this would turn me into a cold Calus being. That the darkness would have eventually caused me to shave my head throw away my copies of the Bhagavad Gita and just do meaningless push-ups in the day and get drunk on cheap beer at night until finally someone kicked my head and in the back of a dive bar leaving me a drooling vegetable tied to a chair and a home for impoverished broken invalids where I'd spend my last days weeping and muttering mother mother but the reality of the situation is that I'm in this beautiful house in North Carolina staring out at a river and mountains and everything feels okay and not okay because I'm in denial about what's happening here but okay because to the best of my ability I've accepted the truth of the situation and I found lately that whenever I do that an unexpected and almost alien peacefulness descends on to everything and I'm reminded of this weird truth that there is no bad part of this dimension that if you peel back the surface layer of this interdimensional fractal that we happen to be entangled in all there is is a novelty producing love field now I know that out there at this moment there are children being slowly dissolved in acid by maniacal hooded murderers I know they're tanks blasting orphanages and transforming innocent Syrian babies in a blood vapor I know that cows and chickens are being slaughtered in hellish factories and that Asian wage slaves are building computers using materials extracted from decimated tropical forests and shaman hair I know that Nancy Grace is somewhere going through a folio of strangled toddler pictures while a team of makeup artists smear stem cell infused mascara into her trembling lizard face I know that many of you listening to this are going through an entire spectrum of turbulence from poverty to cancer to shitty jobs or unruly children or just the mundane boring vapors of ordinary life where you find yourself surrounded by brainwashed drones whose only purpose seems to be squirting fat milk fed babies into the public school system it's true it's there I get it but my experience with the thing having encountered in 2013 two events that if I saw it on paper in 2012 I would definitely not be looking forward to this year one having one of my balls chopped off because of testicular cancer and two having to say goodbye to my mom because of breast cancer my experience and in this particular part of the multiverse is that these things that seem so horrifying on paper in reality are just like everything else more poignant deeper but within them they have that it's the it's a fractal quality inside one thing is everything and inside everything is one thing and that one thing from my own experience has been has roots that go into something that we call love I know that sounds fufu I know that sounds like something somebody who just smeared hummus all over their genitals and was giving a healing massage to a lice-covered dreadlocked hippy girl and a mud pit at Burning Man might whisper in the midst of an ecstasy haze but it's true and it's coming from somebody who's just sitting in a downstairs room in their dying mother's house and it seems to be what's going on at least from my own perspective I there would in a way there would be something awesome about the other option they're in a kind of dark horrific existential gnashing of teeth and grinding my own skin as I shake my fist at the empty sky moaning about having incarnated in this dimension that seems fun too there seems something fun about running in a loin cloth down by the river and taking a rock and hammering my remaining testicle into paste while I spit into the into the river and curse God it may be that I'm just too dumb or too lazy to experience that kind of anguish it would be difficult for me to take it seriously and I maybe I've done my share of writhing around in the mud during this incarnation and I'm just bored with it this other side of things is much more fun much more interesting and I think the effect that it creates in the people around me is far more preferable than limping around the house with a gelified scrotum and ripped clothes covered in mud weeping snot tears onto everybody nobody needs that nobody's got time for that it doesn't help anything and it's fun to go into an Elliott Smith phase but I think you should do that personally I think I'll do that in private I don't see the point in publicly turning into the crow but if that's the way you are I think it's okay I think it's fun and I get it as long as you are honest enough to recognize that in the depth of your despair you're actually getting off on it and that there's a kind of masturbatory joy that comes from sinking into the low low valleys of life and moaning into the sky there's something delightful about screaming and crying and suffering that that's the paradox of it all hidden underneath all those tears and hidden underneath all those seizures of horror and hidden underneath all that darkness and sadness and depression at the very core of it all is some inescapable love that's very polite and does not invade your life unless you want it there again this is all my own subjective experience which is all I've got I'm trying to honestly report the thing and let me reiterate that it's not all roses over here that there is a certain complicated level of drama that I imagine is the inevitability when anybody's dying and families have gathered Jesus Christ there's drama when families gather to eat shit turkey but underneath it all there's I'm gonna say it one more time forgive me cynics out there underneath it all I think there's just love the exact same feeling that you get when you when you're around a baby that's just been born if you've anyone's been lucky enough to feel that crazy nuclear explosion of love that happens the moment a sweet little taut comes blasted out of a pussy then strangely enough that exact same energy seems to happen when somebody goes slipping into the infinite also my mom is amazingly cool super spiritual enlightened person so I'm lucky about that I don't have someone who's I've heard of you know some pretty horror stories about the way some people decide to take the big dive so that's my report in from this particular no to the multiverse this is a great podcast that recorded before I left for North Carolina and we'll get going with that as soon as we do some business the Duncan Trussell family our podcast is brought to you by sure design t-shirts sure design t-shirts is an elite t-shirt company that exists in Thailand as many of you know there's a part of the United States known as the Bohemian Grove this is a fantastic place where some of the smartest wisest and wealthiest people in the world gather on occasion to sacrifice innocent children and dogs cats household pets gerbils anything love to the great owl god Molek these wonderful people are the very same people who designed the atomic bomb which gave us such amazing events as Hiroshima and Nagasaki these are the very same people who have figured out a way to create a system that actually transforms human life unmanageable complicated and filthy human life into rectangular bits of paper so easy to organize and control a person what can you do if you want to control a person you got to put a leash on them or you got to put them in a cage or you got to put them in a city where they're every movement is controlled by traffic lights and the ebbs and flow of traffic patterns that's so so much work if you are running a planet so much easier to just vaporize them and through that vaporization cash in on the various bombs and implements that you use to explode their bodies now that's efficiency and these efficient humans all hang out together at this place called Bohemian Grove and that the t-shirts that they wear when they're playing volleyball with the skulls of Iraqi children or skating on lakes of frozen blood are designed by short design t-shirts these shirts are so very very soft that you would think and a lot of people think this about the reptilians that because their skin is made of scales that were actually formed in the molten draconis star system that these these beings aren't sensitive but interestingly enough there their skin is even more sensitive than ours they've got very very sensitive skin and if they wear normal t-shirts or normal robes or normal sacrificial garments then they get these terrible sores that form all over their body and they're forced to rub into these sores the kidneys of freshly mauled human babies and that's expensive it's getting a whole barn filled with kidney babies sounds easy for a reptilian but it's not it's annoying and requires a lot of forethought so rather than spend all their time trying to herd sacrificial children into a barn they just order these amazing shirts from sure design t-shirts so that their reptile flesh doesn't doesn't blister up now if sure design t-shirt is t-shirts

watch adventure time on Cartoon Network which I highly recommend and also I recently recorded a voice for adventure time I was a wizard I hope I'm allowed to say that that's all I'll say but I'm very excited about that episode coming out so everyone please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family hour two brilliant beautiful vibrant human beings and artists Jesse Moynihan and Pendleton Ward so um holy shit this is gonna blow everybody's I'm sure I hope this is blowing my mind that you guys are sitting in sitting here Pendleton and Jesse Jesse forming is so awesome that thanks man and it's how long did it take you to do that um four years four years four years I think I'm still working on it four years and Pendleton creator of a little little cartoon called adventure time it's one of the top top cartoons on top cartoons create for Cartoon Network right yeah thanks man yeah it is it's top and it's a mind melter you guys are both mind melters thanks thank you yeah yeah it's this specific style of where you know both things which is what I really love when I'm like looking at art is it feels like it somebody has channeled a feeling or some alternate dimension has sort of come through them into the world and informing your sort it's it's like Philip K. Dick when you read Philip K. Dick it's not just the fantasy world that you're absorbing it's you're actually absorbing some of Philip K. Dick's unique perception of the universe itself like his being has sort of gotten mashed into the thing and have you read a lot of Phil Philip K. Dick yeah I've been getting into it lately I tried reading you Bic I think I haven't read it I have I read like 10 pages people keep telling me I have to read Philip K. Dick by having I just haven't done it yet you got it you got to whip yourself through it's like getting on a schizophrenia treadmill it's also like his point of view I think it's like sort of of its time like you know I mean like you're backtracking to like this hipster dude from a while ago you know I mean yeah so the cadence is like foreign and really specific well I don't think did you read Philip K. Dick that's not the guy who illustrates the girls with little penises isn't no that's okay that that's that's my dad that's what's his name the outsider artist that is that you're talking about the guy that they found oh yeah Darger Darger Dar Henry Darger yeah who is a guy that for those of you guys who don't know he was an outsider artist and they found in his apartment this and like enormous book or several books filled with these strange like thousands and thousands of pages I think yeah but it is a good connection because Philip K. Dick I would consider him an outsider artist because I don't think that cadence that you're thinking is like hipster cadence even though that is in there kind of like old pulp fiction cadence yeah like beatnik like post beatnik something it's schizophrenia it's his mind it's like it's it's this like warping of it's his perceptual mechanism for better or for worse was warped and it's coming out in these books which is why when you read Philip K. Dick if you get if you force yourself through that that strange thing that you're talking about if you get into Philip K. Dick book it gives you the exact same feeling when you're done reading as when you get off one of those fast moving the electronic like pathways in an airport you know what I'm talking about yeah where you finish reading and now you're a little crazy because you've let him into your brain a little too much right that's what's cool about him but there's also a sense of humor I think I'm talking about is like you can feel his sense of humor that feels like of a certain time yeah yeah because our sense of humor has now like added on top of that you know I mean yes so it's like sort of like feels like backtracking or something that's how I feel when I've tried to read his books there aren't they do you got it you have to attack them you know you have to just to dedicate yourself to getting through the things but you guys seem like I mean Jesus Christ you guys seem like a bit you got a bit of the outside of art in you and you've managed to somehow get that into like the mainstream Pendleton we've talked about this a little bit before where I feel like I'm more a commercial artist than anything else that you could call me because I like reaching the broadest audience I think that I because I set out I'm like what's the best thing that I can do and to me in my mind that that broad audience is like this big as you can get and so that's my goal that's my bar that I set for myself to try and but then you like have hired people who don't have those aspirations within the within the world you I mean we've tried to like nail this down before I don't know if we ever came to a conclusion but me and Tom to my friend Tom her pick who also works on the show he he and I like talk about this a lot you talk about what what specifically about how Tom and I are sort of like these niche dudes like everything we write is like so in our own personal work is like harder to act like doesn't have a wide appeal like has really limited appeal but for some reason Penn hired us to work on his show and then so within that sandbox within Penn you know Adventure Time sandbox which has a massive wide appeal for some reason has some pop sensibility to it that Penn likes well y'all will say you're niche but in my mind it's like y'all are y'all do really honest work and really beautiful work and I feel like that is the most compelling kind of thing to get wrapped up in yeah but if you look at my personal work it's like titties and dicks like hermafrida it's like flying through space and you know I mean like if I'm if no one's telling me not to do something then I'm doing like stuff then a lot of people don't want to look at I think you know I guess that you know I say that stuff about being a commercial artist and reaching a broad audience but I don't I don't actively put it together like I just I just do what feels right I guess no one ever I don't think I don't think anybody ever when they were considering when you're thinking like oh man I got to reach a broad audience what am I gonna do what am I gonna do I want to reach a broad audience what am I gonna do I got an idea I'm gonna create a post-apocalyptic cartoon world with a shape-shifting talking dog no what no you know what I mean no one ever that's not like when you're considering like how do I reach a broader audience you're thinking like I know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna find a 14-year-old and give him a lesbian haircut and teach him to sing that's how you reach a problem who's that Justin Bieber you know you find a handsome symmetrical kid who can sing and dance that's how you reach a broad audience you don't create this like insane psychedelic mushroom world so it's interesting to hear you say that you you consider what you do commercial it seems commercial after the fact that's yeah but something in it is synchronous with the world like kids you know little desires you know I think it's an honest coming from an honest place but but like his DNA pens DNA is more in in sync with whatever that is going on with the kids you know whereas I feel like I'm always like you know combating kids like I'm fighting kids I get I get this working with them yeah about how it appeals to kids and adults alike and you can't not end up sounding super skeezy when you start talking about how your brain is like a kid's brain yeah but I do I see jokes and I'm like oh man that would that would really rock my world if I was 12 like I know there's a said this so many times in interviews but there was a there was a Simpsons episode that I remember when I was a kid where Bart just goes my he just says my dad's a half monkey half man creature and I was a kid I was like just seeing a man and a monkey put together was all I needed as an adult I'd be like that's kind of weak that concept and it wouldn't rock my world as much but I see stuff in Adventure Time that I think would appeal to to kids like that and adults I don't know I'm saying no it makes no fuck it makes total sense man I don't know who knows I mean really I think that what I what you're saying to me applies to comedy which is and pretty much anything is that honesty if you can just come from an honest place and you just let that thing be what emerges then it no matter what you win even if it's not accepted even if people don't like it you've still done you still followed your own path yeah I think honesty is the key to humor I mean I mean that's not like an original no I think it is I think a lot of people don't realize that yeah but I think like you know when when thinking about like people who like how do you think of that you know people ask whatever creative people like how did you or someone that's created something original and they're always like how did you think of that like how did you come up with that one thing you know and it's always like I never understand that question they're like what drugs are you doing or like yeah you know like I wasn't doing a fucking I was just being honest with myself and like being interested in the world and then some some things got shot out you know yeah yeah oh totally yeah I mean some people need drugs to hit that level of honesty or have the courage to get that out because it's I guess it's a courage thing but I don't think it's creating I mean I don't think anyone's really creating a new idea based on that's not totally true but based on drugs yeah I mean I know crumb people say Robert Crumb or Crumb said that all his characters were created during the time when he took LSD I think but I think that most of the time drugs just allow you to open up your courage or whatever like what if you're afraid of of being honest or something or being self-exploratory then you can use you know drugs in that way to to open that up but I think it's there already drugs didn't put that in your brain you know I mean oh yeah all that stuff is exists within your conscious within your subconscious or whatever you know you can tap that by just fucking dangerous dreaming or you could do drugs well or both you know or both you know you know that it's I think a lot of people trick themselves into thinking that they're doing drugs for some kind of artistic purpose when they're just like one indeed hi I think it's a real if you're gonna use that tool to create which it is a very popular tool to create because you know if it's not you know speed for a lot of writers it's marijuana if it's not marijuana it's alcohol is speed isn't speed just like motivational speed yeah I've never done speed this is I mean this is something I've like speed is I speed is the drug of choice for Philip K. Dick Stephen King I think wrote like the shining on speed you know it's a definitely a tool that a lot of writers use you know it's it's the humans used you know it's something that people don't want to admit and don't like because what the things that a lot of people like it like Lance Armstrong for example people love the idea of someone being that athletic minus any kind of substance because it represents that something that's accessible for any human being and that creates this feeling of like I can do that and then you realize no no no that guy was on massive amounts of testosterone and high-tech sport you know enhancing drugs and so are all the other people on those bikes because they're they just didn't get busted and then you realize baseball players guess what they're juicing too and then you realize like if you've ever seen some ripped weight lifter guy do you think that guy got that weight from just normally lifting weight isn't it like impossible it's impossible human anymore the things some shape-shifting Lincoln Throp he's been like rubbing both testicles sweat into his nipples for years and it's caused that to happen and so the people don't like the idea that there's additives that get that you think people only want the chemicals to come from inside your brain they don't want them to come from outside your brain the moment that you've decided with your own will okay I'm gonna eat mushroom because I want to access some higher intelligence that I could figure out what to do in life then you sound like a fucking lunatic but if the dream comes to you yeah where your brain releases God knows what kind of weird chemical slurry that makes you experience some intelligent being that's like listen you've got to stop drinking well then you tell someone that I call it a vision so you know it's it's people it's just that's the time period that we're in well that's I think I know it's frustrating to me to on the comments that I get on the internet that are how many drugs were you on when you came up with this how'd you do this how many drugs did it take for you to actually accomplish this and I don't I don't do drugs I drink drink but I don't smoke weed I don't know and it's it's frustrating that it's the drugs that everyone thinks is what you need to come up with with funky weird ideas but I don't have perspective you know I don't have the drug perspective yeah when I from all sides when I was growing up I was like a straight-edge hardcore kid you know and I would get some and I was like a creative kid like drawing comics and shit and people ask me to draw ninja turtles and shit and and I would draw my own comics and when people would see them people who aren't creative they'd be like what kind of drugs do you do you know and so that made me more not want to ever do drugs because I was like I don't want kids putting the responsibility of my creative output on something outside of myself yeah you know that was like a real frustrating thing for me growing up I think a lot of kid maybe creative people feel I don't know I at least for me because it was like an internal discipline I was like I'm disciplining myself to be a certain type of person and and then if you're like hey you I'm just gonna write off like everything you do because of like like a joke you know I mean like it's like it's a it's a punchline to be like drugs what yeah what drugs are you all right right like that undermines the creative process yeah and when I was a kid like insecure like 18 year old kid like trying to like figure out my self-worth and stuff like that like really you know bugs me well I used to bug me now that doesn't bug me as much doesn't bug me a while to get over that too and to get over how much that bug me does it bug you that probably a large part of your adult audience that watches your show is on drugs no not at all yeah it's just the idea that like you need a crutch or a you could like the idea of taking drugs seems like a crutch or some kind of like yeah and now actually my bitterness towards drugs because of all those comments is now my crutch really I think all right is now like I have held on to this weird feeling about like yeah I don't I don't need that I don't like I hate that and and that's something I've had I think I think it's just a bad way to look at drugs I mean like yeah I mean like I don't like I've definitely done I've done drugs like you know I mean like and I've never done I don't think I've ever done drugs to create something like I've never had that's not true well the term drugs man we've got a lot that term but we sound like a goddamn Reagan administration public awareness thing here drugs is a yeah problem is we've been brainwashed in this country since we're very young to think that drugs when you hear that term drugs equals evil it doesn't matter that our species for the last 2,000 years has been ritualistically and recreationally taking intoxicants on a daily basis it doesn't matter that the majority of human beings wake up in the morning and they get on drugs they take coffee they take the caffeine they take their cigarettes or they whatever the whatever the thing is that doesn't that doesn't no one considers that that's drugs we're all on drugs I think you know I did I have used some imagery that I got from from the I was the one ayahuasca trip I took like well six years six years ago six years ago but I wasn't looking for creative you know I mean when I took it I wasn't trying to like I need ideas you know I mean that was just like a by product of a of like a crazy experience you know I mean that was like I was trying to fix my girl problems really yeah yeah yeah what were your girl problems I had here comes the meat put this in the comments five minutes in six five minutes we're actually somehow and I don't even understand how it's 17 minutes in oh shit well what happened was I was in this long-term relationship I was in love with this girl this girl named Margaret and and I really we had a really deep connection but like it got all fucked up because I'm a fucked up artist like I'm a I have a fucked up personality when it comes to relationships I'm really bad at them and but I was really in love with this girl and she broke up with me because I was like negligent as a boyfriend basically and she put up with it for five years five years of me being like I can't I can't see you right now I gotta draw you know like that kind of stuff I don't want to go on vacation with you I gotta work on my comic book like yeah that kind of stuff like really bummer shit and so after she broke up with me like rocked my world and I was so fucked up and I couldn't date other girls I met this other amazing girl and I couldn't like I couldn't deal with her anymore like I mean I'm not anymore I couldn't deal with her as a because she wasn't I was just rocked by this breakup and and I had this amazing new girlfriend and I couldn't give her a chance and all this shit so and I had been reading about ayahuasca for a while like you know I had been doing like shamanic dream journeys with my brother and stuff and and all of us were sort of you know you know reading like breaking open the head and shit and and that kind of watching altered states and stuff yeah so I was like I'm gonna you know I heard all this great stuff about ayahuasca you know the therapeutic effects it can have on people with addictive personalities and and what it can do to sort of break down you calcified stuff ideas you have about yourself you know yep and so I was like that I was like I feel calcified as shit and so I I went to this thing and I took it and I had visions about Margaret and about this new girl I was dating Mary and stuff and it was a really vague though like I couldn't I still don't quite understand what the what I saw meant like I saw I would see their faces in the air and a and a rottweiler barking at me and shit like you know and so you would see their the rottweiler was there with their faces floating the rottweiler was in between them barking at me the rottweiler was in between the faces of your ex-lover yeah because I was praying to mother ayahuasca you know I was like please help me figure this out look what am I doing wrong in life when it comes to girls when it comes to women and relationships and and my ego and stuff you know what do you think the rottweiler represents I to this day I don't I don't know I don't know what I mean what I know I know what the overall experience was telling me and I still have anxieties about it because I haven't addressed I haven't fixed what are rottweilers they're dog they're dogs what kind of dogs fighting dogs I guess no what do people usually use rottweilers for it's not fighting it's guard dog oh yeah guard dogs yeah so you got a fucking guard dog it's isn't that just like that the idea is you've got this growling deadly vicious unaddressed part of you that's keeping girls at bay yeah yeah that's what's going on you got this fucking got a goddamn or oh shit it's your spirit animals a rottweiler well I try I tried to find my spirit animal a couple on the numerous occasions but I haven't found it yet did you have control of the rottweiler in your vision no no you didn't you don't have you have an untamed rottweiler it was just barking at me like like really vicious it was barking at you and not the girls yeah no it was barking at me oh the rottweiler was facing you yeah were you scared of it yeah man I was like fuck this changes everything if the rottweilers facing you and not the girl then that changes everything yeah the rottweiler represents some thing you've got to conquer in yourself that's that's threatening you or that yeah there was a black hole in the vision to that I I knew I had to jump in this black hole that was appearing in the side of the room you know I was like there it is that's the hole I have to jump in and I was like I'm not doing that I didn't do it and now it like I think if I had jumped in that hole you know and and faced my fear instead of hiding under a blanket for nine hours I would have like come out with some better understanding of myself but instead I have this unresolved psychedelic experience you know well oh you know what man I don't know if it's isn't it like isn't that what's the big takeaway from the whole thing that my ego is too big and and I have to like dissolve into the universe at some point and and get you know all the stuff I'm struggling for is retarded and I should stop doing it isn't everyone's ego just as big as yours don't we all yeah I mean yeah but I struggle with it I know but I struggle with it all the time I think it was it's what makes me like freak out at night you know when I look at the stars I start having a panic attack that's what's going on with me I went to the Griffith Observatory and did the space thing you know they tell you the size of the universe have you gone to that no I haven't like the tour of the universe or whatever you know it's supposed to be like really fun and amazing and the whole time I was just like borderline having a episode we've talked about this a little bit before I think because I when I was in high school I like saying this because it belittles makes a lot of people who are freaking out right now about the universe when I was in high school I freaked out about the universe I was younger then and it was yeah it would make me freak out I would panic I would have panic attacks thinking about infinity thinking about how small I am but now it makes me really calm now it makes me feel like great because I think about how I'm just a speck on this little speck on a speck on a speck and it makes me feel really comfortable I feel like I feel like I don't know why I think I know away responsibility yeah maybe a little bit maybe it means I'm not as big as my my brain makes me feel like I'm like I am I've been thinking a lot about how we can only know as far as we can perceive there like we're that's why everyone's egos are huge is is we only know what what man I knew I was gonna sound like a goober on this podcast I feel someone else say something while you're saying that it's like what we only what is it we only know we only know as much as we is around us at any given time or no it's man we'll find it okay let me I gotta sit here while y'all like yeah look about girls I'm gonna sit here and like just stay contemplate the condom my tea contemplate there you can see that's what an enlightened person says and there you have the Zen master that's the that's the cool thing about what you what I really like about what you're saying is is this is that once you do start realizing how small you are in relation to everything it's just a thought experiment even though you can never experience you don't even know if there is a universe you know you barely you don't know what's outside of this thing it could be a big trick being played on all of us but tools like that to reduce you can be quite useful because they you start putting down this like what does it call it so it's a lopsism where where you think that you're the source of everything I mean that's the ultimate ego state that a lot of people get in which is sort of you think okay I know that I experience the universe mm-hmm but I don't know that anyone else around me experiences the universe I can't get into your head I don't know if you're feeling anything in fact you may very well just be a projection that I'm of something from inside of me I'm just the universe having some kind of hallucination I think that's called so it's a lot season yeah and it's basically a trick where you start thinking that you're God and then that can create problems yeah buddy that's what I'm thinking about what you're thinking of what what that example like yeah I don't know if anyone else is actually a conscious being or a projection I guess this might also help I've also been thinking about how like the only thing that I can really trust is that I can't trust my brain or anyone else's this is all just a mess up here and everyone's is a little different and that's and that's and everyone but everyone has really hard ideas really like everyone knows like factual truths yeah in their life but it's all relevant to them it's not because that's how they right and that's how they that stuff frustrates me a lot but absolute truths man anytime someone starts saying absolute shit yeah usually it's wrong yeah I mean generally if you look at human history every single absolute truth that anyone said is almost always been proven wrong yeah man you just know what like fucking like sorry you just you know you can be like this is how much we know now but I'm not whole you know I'm not make I'm gonna put any money on it you know I mean sure why have that I do I have that attitude of like the Sun you know I had a I have these friends who are like eight you know these atheist friends or like materialist friends and they'll they'll say stuff to me like science has figured everything pretty much figured out the universe now I'm like are you stupid man like in 20 years everything that you know we've come up with at this point is going to be wrong they keep they keep backtracking about black holes you know yeah they do over and over again there black holes are a portal to another dimension black holes you'll get crushed you'll just get crushed and die like yeah and the highest level scientists you know are saying this stuff and contradicting each other they don't know what they're talking about and now these sons of bitches are getting into the whole simulator theory like what about that that you know about that no no this is amazing a thing which is that this idea that it that people keep returning to which is that we're in some kind of super advanced alien computer simulation and that there's like ways that they are showing that this is the case and because there's apparently and I don't know anything about quantum physics but when there's black there's certain particulates that will snap to a size things snap to a size as though they're on a frame if it's look if they're smaller than that size they just blink out now I don't understand that very well you guys I'll put a link to it so you guys who are smarter can process this shit but the indication is oh yeah that's that's a framework that seems to be what's like vector graphics or whatever yes exactly exactly draw a vector line and you fuck it up and then it turns into a straight line yes yes and it makes sense look man this all to me that simulation theory makes more sense than any other thing the in science just because if you look at what's coming down the pipes as far as video games go the Oculus Rift have you seen this son of a bitch yeah the odd you've seen the Oculus Rift have you put one on no what is it I haven't a Kickstarter I think I've funded that Kickstarter I'll bring over the prototype are you fucking kidding me I'm not you have an Oculus coming to you yeah how much do you have to donate to get an Oculus it's worth it I think it was maybe more than do you play video games yeah okay okay okay awesome Pendleton you do drugs oh yeah that means you do drugs because video games are a drug it's just a different type of drug sure man I also eat pizza yeah yeah well I don't know if pizza is like you don't think so pizza some people say the processed wheat is a drug well I think video games are as much a drug as any other drug it's just the way that they're causing your chemicals to shift around in your brain is through the optic nerve instead of your digestive system but it's still created creates a buzz now is it it's not as dangerous and it's not in the sense that you're not like introducing some alien chemical into your system but you're certainly like creating like a hypnotic trance which is a beautiful thing I love them so this Oculus Rift man is apparently and I don't know because I've never worn one but I'm going to because my best friend buddy is it a VR helmet what is it yeah essentially but we want you keep talking about it's a bad ass VR helmet that it's a consumer based VR helmet I've only the videos on the internet are people putting it on yeah and the initial state of like what the fuck because it does perfect tracking when you move your head when you look up when you look down and also because of the way it's set up it creates three dimensions so you feel like you're in a 3d movie you're inside of it puts you inside of it yeah this is the point and that's just now we just barely stop being monkeys and we're already you know what I mean in universal time we were just are you gonna be tripping over your coffee table and shit like trying to walk around your house you said you could you're gonna freak but you just sit down and you go into this world you know and and so if that's already happening and it's all apparently this incredibly vivid experience than in a hundred years they will replicate reality in a way that makes it indistinguishable from the reality that we're currently experiencing yeah philosophy behind simulation theory is that if that's going to happen it already happened yeah it's more likely that it already happened than it's going to happen for the first time and so if that already happened then we're inside of it right now we're inside the machine and the machine is telescoping inwards as it continues to replicate itself via you know micro virtual realities that humans are creating so yeah black holes are just the goddamn plugs wait so okay I don't so we are ever you're saying that we actually are like program and we're not it's not matrix style where we're in pods being doped we don't know what that what we okay that would be like that I don't think we know what we are I think that's you can just say that that's my blanket sort of theory for all things yeah we don't know we don't know things I believe in almost everything everything actually because you can't prove that something can't be yeah someone asked me that question the other day is it or do you are you religious or do you have any religious beliefs and I said yeah just believe in everything why not well what about I guess the problem yeah believing in everything yeah I believe in even things that contradict the other beliefs does that make sense doesn't mean yeah well yeah I mean it depends you know as I think that I'm confused by a lot of things yeah I'm I just you know I just didn't the older I get the more I just turn into a Buddhist I just end up like just so simple and it's like you know they ask Buddha what happens after you die and he's like don't worry about it it's really nothing for you to really worry about right now because you're alive how's that gonna help you you know what are you okay fine you figure out what happens after you die you're still living like a dick yeah it's still fun to think about though I mean that yeah I mean I don't think you can put you can put you don't have to put that much weight on it because you just don't know no matter how much you read or how much you meditate or you know think on stuff you just won't you won't know until you you know until you die but it's fun that you know it's fun to think about at least oh yeah and it helps the creative I think it helps to create your your mind just like work you know jogging the treadmill it's like jogging on a treadmill thinking about death putting your yeah it's like your brain's a hamster wheel yeah well I run into people who don't think about death I get worried about them you don't think about that well no I mean thinking about death is a fine experiment it's the thing after death where it's like well look just make up whatever you want to make up because you're never gonna know as far as the exercise of thinking about death yeah there is a Buddhist meditation where monks would go and sit at the edge of chalk of pits where bodies were thrown and they would watch the body decompose day after day after day just watch the thing rot and smell the fumes and watch the birds eat it and through that process they you know and the ideas to induce as much as possible into you the realization that what you're composed of is impermanent so that you can get closer to that truth that's a truth that's a pretty undeniable truth I'd say you think kids should do that in school like they should stare at dead bodies yeah well they fucking take a field trip to a graveyard yes that would be a great exercise for kids absolutely get them out of that goddamn bullshit like you know kids are shoved into the fine line I would take my truth you I would take do you think when what's what age do you think kids you go watch it body decompose well it depends on what part of the world you're living in I mean one of the great you know if you're living in Syria right now then you know it just depends middle-class kids middle-class American kids what what age what age middle-class American kids see a rotting I don't know I think that's a question for a second I don't you know I think 17 you probably catch that stuff on the internet I remember seeing all kinds of the most horrible things when I was like that's like enter that's entertainment you know kids watch those faces of death videos when they're like 10 years old they're really fucked up kids they're like yo man watch this I'm like what are you making me watch right now you can you can be cynical and be more of it when you're a kid but it's also rocking your world when you're by yourself yes it is rocking every every death every death video I've seen has rocked my world yeah yeah they're they're really intense and the reason that they're so world-rocking is because you're seeing the truth you're seeing the in undeniable evidence of what happens to the the meat body that you happen to be inhabiting at this moment and the reason I say I don't mean I sounds cow so like show a kid a rotting corpse I don't mean like you drag kids to the cemeteries and stuff I do think there's something to be said for compassionately being truthful with children I think your original example is is not I mean that's a good I think that's a good it sounds good to me yeah I mean the rot pit the Buddhist watching over the rod pit I think that sounds some like a positive a positive thing I think it's a positive thing because finally what happens through watching the process of death if you've ever been around a dying person and you see that this very natural thing kicks in where it's a fractal where you see like the way you have the pattern of the person's life they are there's the broad pattern which consists of there's generally people have like a a rudder that's what we they call karma and it's the rudder is the rudder of their life and that's what how they've steered through the ocean of time and you know that rudder causes them to navigate in a certain way and this is the repetitive patterns that people experience in their life and when you die those repetitive patterns they they they happen all the way up to the moment of death that that way that you've been processing the universe so when you see people start dying and you see that process start kicking in you'll the patterns seem to be more pronounced you know as is and you begin to see oh this is just a natural repetition of almost like an echo of this person's beingness and you can see the echo more clearly as they approach oblivion and there's something incredibly natural about it when you give you ever been around it do you ever see someone die yeah I saw a guy commit suicide jump off a bridge and drown in the winter I saw him like swimming up to the surface to try to get air it was fucking crazy and I tried I thought about jumping in to save this guy but it was the middle of winter in Philadelphia and I was on a bridge about 70 feet up and you know part so all I could do is watch this guy swimming I think he had tied something to his legs so that he couldn't swim yeah he couldn't swim up out of the water so I saw him his face come out of the water and swallowing water into his mouth and then sink back into the into the river wow yeah wow that's crazy yeah did you ever see anybody dive in no I saved someone's life from drowning when I was a kid but I don't have any memory of it my family told me that I did yeah that's pretty cool do you think do you feel like your own personal karmic obstacles that you feel where you were born with yeah I mean I I can see oh yes definitely I see I mean I can see very clearly like my I definitely know what my I can see my problems yeah you know I play do you think but do you think you didn't develop them in this life that they just were part of your your like you know your what you were born with do you I don't know I don't know I have no idea if it's like some I don't really care about the reincarnation thing very much I like to think about it is for fun yeah yeah but I would say that it's just some sort of like you know everyone's got their own weird little behavior mechanism that they said they invented to try to turn away from the present moment because the present moment is shocking or something so everyone's got their you know different tricks that they used to ignore the truth so for me it's like I you know I'll get addicted to video games or I'll get caught up in internet loops that's a big problem I have right now just a real basic internet addiction I have that full-blown full-blown internet addiction hey real quick I want to go back to what we were talking about a moment ago because I had an idea I think kids should see monks at least when they're younger I think because you don't know you don't know what you don't know what anything is until you see an example of it and you don't know what a peaceful person is until you see someone uh shooting for it you know you see a monk and when I was little I saw monks because my mom took me to an art exhibit where they were making a mandala say a mandala and I think that was just became a beacon in my life to to shoot for that to because that seemed to be the best way to live like these guys these dudes with shaved heads and robes doing this beautiful piece of artwork and then they they scooped it all up and they put it in a little baggy when they were done and it was like that's that seems perfect to me that seems like the best way to live and the happiest way to live I had a friend I wouldn't know unless I had seen it you know you don't know anything just in anything artwork you're like you don't you don't know what to shoot for until you see an example of it because you can turn into anything right if we're raised in the wild you know you can turn into anything you know what they do with those baggies put them in a river yeah dump them what baggies baggies of sand oh okay so you saw so that's so that had a big impact on you seeing the Tibetans making the sand mandala yeah they seemed at peace and it seems like what do you you know you're asking yourself what what do you do with your time shoot for peace shoot for being as happy as you can be and I've seen the thing that looked like the happiest place that anyone could be state of mind wise and so now that that was my my bar and the mandala thing is an anti-legacy philosophy I guess you mean you make a thing and then you erase it yeah and that's like a huge statement which is the opposite of what we do we do in life what do you mean the mandala like everything I'm in my mind is like geared towards building a memory for people when I'm dead you know that's what you you strive for that's my guilty admission yeah you know I want that when I'm dead people will be like this guy made comics and cartoons and this shit was awesome you know and and and then then I live on past my death or something on the in the material plane that's such an easy thing to deconstruct as like a as a terrible way to live though you know you could so surface level yeah because you know the thing that's going to live on how long it's going to live on it's not going to live on forever like 15 years that's that idea is worthless I know but I think about that a lot because I'm like what am I going to do what I've got this thing it's really popular I did I do did I do it did I achieve the best thing no of course yeah because it's going to be dust like anything else and so then what is the best thing what is the best thing and so you know and we I work in entertainment and I think like what I mean why I consider myself maybe more commercial is because because what cartoons did for me it was they were a really nice just escape into weirdness when I was a little kid and also they did the same thing that looking at amongst it was like they sort of set an example for like what's what's bizarre and what's a really fun place you know what can I shoot for as far as being creative you know like Ren Stimpy when I was a little kid was great it was a wonderful place for me to live inside my brain and you know I guess and I wanted to return the favor to kids that are sitting around doing I don't know you create that spark that moment of inspiration or that that passes along so you one generation inspires another you know with a moment of thing like this I remember this crazy image from Ren and Stimpy and that changed my life you know or something like that it's not so much bolstering the legacy of John Kay it's more it's more just a memory of of a you know you know a Ren eating soap in on a spaceship or something yeah that shocked your brain when you were a kid yeah it rocked my world and it made me feel great inside and and to and I'm like what's the bet what's what kind of what power do I have in this world what can I do with me I'm going to create that spark for a kid who's sitting at home you know you do that thing that I that I love so much when I was little but then that but then now that I've been doing that it's like okay I did it and now is that the best thing that I can do what's the best thing that I just keep asking myself that question what's the best thing I can do with my time are you still you haven't come up with the answer though no because it's temperates because I just yeah I just blew up that other thing that you were talking about because that's exactly what it is to use the opposite it's a monument sort of this also has to do with girls is yeah here it is skip ahead the weather where we at what's the minute mark we're at 45 45 that's so we're talking about what's the best thing I can do you know and this was years ago but this is with that same girl that I still I can't get over I remember being in bed with her one day and we were really this was at a good point in our lives like we were really happy and and out of the blue I was like hey hey I'm really happy about our relationship I really you know love you a lot but I want you to know that someday if we're together in the future I'm going to disappear oh man why would I say that why you don't you you said it you I you say you don't want to do you don't want a girlfriend you say things like that when you don't know I'm going to disappear because I what's the best thing you can do in your life and that's the you know I mean what well you're already disappeared here's it let me throw in a really crazy idea which is a Buddhist idea which is like you're you have disappeared yeah and you are experiencing the illusion of beingness and it's this temporary transient thing which is like something that I've I struggle with wrapping my head around but it's this idea of like well they call it out there's a great name for it god damn it oh the codependent not code no not codependent that's my parents dependent origination have you ever heard this term before no no so dependent origination is this idea that everything that exists depends on something prior to it everything that is came from some other things so dependent origination is the idea that that book there that you're looking at is actually if you could like step out of time then what you would see is this incredible thread of particles that lead to wherever the ink came from and the book came from trees and the trees came from the ground and the ground came from exploded star particulates which came from an explosion of energy which was the big bang which who knows it was vomited out of the mouth of a god dog or something we don't know before the big bang but the idea is that you yourself in this very moment are just a waveform that is temporarily congealed on the human form and has come to the sense of awareness that you it gives you the illusion of being this one in fact you're just this momentary bend in space and time that will smooth itself out in a blip in an instant completely gone and also all of your work and all of your writing and all of your comic books even if you sit sat down tomorrow channeled god and wrote the most incredible comic book ever made that like could extend what the acts the characters would come out and climb into the the ears of the readers and dance in their brains even that will not matter because you know the sun is going to go into supernova and everything's gonna become evaporated right so it's the idea that the funny thing humans do is they attach themselves and try to cling to this idea that you're going to make something last or that anything is a thing at all but even relationship you're just destroying jesse right now god already destroyed jesse i'm just telling him he's been destroyed no listen i know all this stuff it's just you know it's a conflict in myself and okay here's my question then what do you do about relationships if everything you do is going to get destroyed in the sun what are you supposed to be find someone right who is on the same page about that or can they be on a different page about that stuff like when you talk about hey we're all going to get absorbed by the the when the sun supernovas who gives a fart well our corpses are the dust of us it's not we got a few you know a thousand years before that right i know but does your girlfriend or boyfriend have to be on the same page with you about that stuff like can can they be like i don't know can you be in a relationship with someone that doesn't understand that like impermanence or possible uh you know it's a simulation of like what we're experiencing yeah why not can they just be like i i want to start at i don't know yeah yeah oh yeah yeah i seriously i mean well i mean nothing wrong with that people who do i see are great but do you know i mean uh i want to um be uh i want to be uh actress or you know something that's it what do you think pen uh yes of course and the whole time you know you know that it's fucking stupid that you should be in the woods you know like disappearing from you shouldn't be trying to create uh you know some kind of memory of yourself being in the woods makes me like you know we're we're tourists and in in life yeah and uh you know if you if you if you're going uh yeah i think you but it but you're talking about this one specific thing i am that you need to relate relate to a girlfriend with yeah and i think that's something that you can just understand that uh the supernova is going to happen and then you can continue to be a tourist for you know and and then we're in work you know and and uh and uh does that take away from your happy happy in the moment right let's talk about happy in the moment yeah okay happy in the moment that's all you got is the moment yeah i mean that's the other thing that that you begin to realize is that that really there is just this moment i mean there isn't a past there isn't a future there's just this moment there's never a future a future doesn't exist there's never a past the past is your encoded memories there's just this one thing happening now and we and this one thing happening right now has tricked our little monkey brains into thinking there's time because the ball that we're on rotates in a certain way that makes a light and dark periods of the exact same link which gives the illusion of some progression when in fact if you remove that planet or you remove the sun one or the other you know you just have this one equanimous shining thing or just absolute darkness right so in that sense there's no real time at all we just sort of give ourselves the illusion of time when there's just this moment but if your girlfriend's lack of supernova consciousness is continuing to remind you uh that there that time exists then yeah maybe you should break up wait so if you've got gotta break up with your bitch you make me remember time yeah wait but that happens every time i'm in a relationship they try to make a human watch they try to remember make me remember time man i'm looking on like that buddha is a just you know uh remove uh what is it uh that idea of being detached compassionate uh detachment is that what that is that where you step back you're outside of the mindfulness yeah it is mindfulness but you you step out of the drama out of the yeah the thing the the events in life that are that pull you into hell you make your life crazy and like you know i mean you step outside of those things but those stepping outside of those things is also what makes people use those events to create markers in their life that was when i was a crazy alcoholic and i and i destroyed people's homes a fucking crazy man i can talk about it you know or that was a time i was in a horrible dysfunctional relationship and uh but we really loved each other and you know i mean people create these markers for their lives and if you're with a girl or a guy or whatever you're in a relationship that is based the other person is creating those because they're living in the in the thing they're not detached they're not well can you live perpetually in the moment is that a thing that's some people moment can you what can you live perpetually in the moment can you not can you all keep that that contentness can you stay happy in that moment for for the for your entire life i sure as fuck can't but it has someone done it and they say yeah yeah these today you know they do say that there are people that you run into from time to time that have that seem to just be uh with that guy right there neem kerali baba maharaji they say it was uh when you came into contact with that that guy uh he was just this they all you know there's different words for i think ramaana there's another one i can't have a girlfriend uh he's got yeah you know neem kerali baba had kids oh okay so he spawned but the the the notion of like oh be a celibate don't be with a girl you know to find realization is uh is uh i think a very silly idea it's the idea is it's like every single thing that you're encountering whatever it is whether it's you can't find a girlfriend and you're lonely or whether you're in a relationship and you're unhappy all of these things are lessons that have been that are kind of like pull-up bars with which you can their energy packets that you can transform into something that makes you evolve so there's no like oh my girlfriend wants an etsy account and i want to think about the uh fact that we're all plunging towards oblivion yeah it's like well in a way they're both kind of the same thing anyway yeah all right it's just her version of oblivion is etsy yeah it's like i don't know if you love somebody and you feel that sense of connection there's no rama says that the best or the ideal relationship is a pyramid which means at the top of the pyramid is uh the idea of like whatever you want to call the spiritual path meditation finding happiness present moment being in the present moment and the two people that's what their focus is on you know their focus is on another way to put it i just heard this at this cafe i overheard it at a table somebody was saying the couple that knits together stays together yeah and i knew what they were talking about even though i'm not knitting doesn't appeal to me yeah but if you're a couple and you have this other thing that you're working on then it things tend to be a lot better than if the relationship is always is it's is the project yeah yeah yeah the supreme goal what's funny what's funny is uh i uh i bring like when i'm drinking with natasha my girlfriend i bring her down all the time because i start talking about death yeah and it's the opposite of what you're talking about like i i i bring the moment down from sort of just a happy in the moment feeling like let's think about death let's think about the end and i stop time i like you know i create time or whatever you know we're talking about yeah yeah but it's the opposite i'm not talking about my is it because that's etsy i'm talking i'm talking about this kind of stuff do you want answers from her or are you just trying to work it out um i'm just talking i'm just uh i'm just like looking at an old man who's bent over i'm just like oh my gosh look at that yeah look at that and then just started blabbing about i think i was at an october fest sort of thing and i saw a dude and and uh when he calls things those leather pants just bent just bent over no the leader hosen he was just uh bent his back was like 45 degree and i'm just like man that really makes me stop fuck yeah i'm just thinking about i can't remember what i said but but i was i was the the bummer that ain't a bummer man that's like you know about the buddhas what the buddhas saw you know the story of buddha the he was a prince and you know all that stuff no he was a prince siddhartha gautama he was in this beauty he went there was a prophecy and they told his dad your son's either going to be a conqueror with the greatest like war leader that's ever lived or he's going to be like the an enlightened world changing teacher and so his father's like well i don't want to you know it's some kind of yapping hippie as a son i'm a king and i want to conquering son so he tried to keep his son away from the world and he gets prince siddhartha gautama had a harem of the most beautiful women and was given anything that he wanted at any time and uh was just living this opulent life and then the story is that he went out he got one of he got someone to take him outside the palace and he saw three things he saw are four things i can't remember no three things he saw i sort of know this story son old man yeah he saw a corpse and he saw a monk he saw a monk and uh that made him realize oh this this other stuff is just like distraction from the truth of my existence which is that i'm gonna fucking oh i think he saw a disease man maybe but the point is like this goddamn thing i'm in it's gonna fuck up you know this body's gonna collapse and fall in on itself i'm gonna die why am i spending my time on etsy i gotta eat i gotta eat bird shit yeah i gotta go and eat bird shit you know what i mean like so but it's like you don't the idea is not like so then you don't spend your life the rest of your time looking at old been over old men it's like but you digest that truth so that you feel it fully you would you digest the truth of your own impermanence till you just or you just that's it you've gotten there and then you go down to your etsy account okay done and done got it it's fixed i'm fixed figured it out i can go get a girlfriend now you really want a girlfriend huh uh yeah man i'm tired you know i'm sick of what i'm doing i'm doing the wrong i've been doing the wrong thing jesse you're like you're a handsome guy you're a great writer thanks man you got this amazing comic book yeah i'm gonna have to post your guide are you on okay cupid no i was i was i quit ladies of los angeles who listen to this show i have got in front of me a beautiful man who would he doesn't care if you have etsy right no man i love etsy etsy is awesome i've bought i bought a tablecloth on etsy etsy i think if you're making stuff i know tons of cool girls that make cool stuff on on etsy i was just trying to you know it could have been your profile right now yeah okay cupid is the worst thing on the planet it's it's terrible i've had i went on two dates on okay cupid it was it was okay but it's just like it's wrong man it's all set up all wrong i don't know i i didn't drive with it i didn't drive with it how long have you been with your lady pin uh two years i think that's what we're saying yeah uh it's awesome we we're getting along really great you guys live together it's awesome man no we don't you ever think about but making the big move yeah i do i think about it a lot um how many times have you lived with with a girlfriend i've lived with girls one two three three times i've never done it oh yeah it is fucked yeah that's what i thought it is fucked it can be fucked you gotta like you gotta have a lot of space you've got to really be in love you've got to really want to maybe make a baby yeah but if you can avoid it don't do it just don't do it you don't have to do it you don't have to go out okay we're not living in the in the goddamn jungle anymore there's no dragons that we have to defend ourselves from but then part of me doubts that too because at some point if you're with a girl for a while why haven't you moved in with them what are you afraid of you know i mean and that to me that's that's a fear i have why have i never decided to move in with a girl that i really like you don't want to be consumed by absolute boredom yeah you can listen you can still listen to your records everything changes everything changes everything changes yeah when when you live with a girl everything changes and it's a beautiful thing and you fall in love and you're in this loving state and it's all based on this beautiful thing the next thing you know you got to three years later you just feel just this sense of like well i guess that's that would you ever get married i would yes i would get married i would have babies i would do i don't hold myself i don't like stay i'm never gonna do that i just know from my i know i tend to move in with people yeah i know that tends to happen i know the thing tends to disintegrate so how would you avoid how would you keep i'm sorry go ahead pen how do you keep it from i don't know if i really need to say this okay say it let's hear it for me i'm a monster like when i'm by myself and i i'm i'm afraid of losing that because i like being a horrible monster like i do i like being in my den as den is i don't like that word i like being in my room my my little room in my blankets with like pizza and video games and the lights off and the like the curtains pulled i really man i like being in my hole my i guess hole is better yeah well my no i'm not gonna say that pod i'll take pot and that's i mean but that's such a goofy uh uh thing to be afraid of losing is uh are you kidding you don't want to lose that that's fucking golden that's the garden of Eden that's not a goofy thing to want to lose that's those precious moments as you get to be completely yourself in absolute isolation doing whatever you want with nobody judging you for the way you act fuck you don't want to lose that never lose that yeah man you can't lose that but you can though you have i mean you don't have to but that's the sacrifice there's no fuck that there's no you don't have to sacrifice that isn't it healthy to to to lose that maybe healthy to lose what to lose that horrible like monsters hold like well you just called it my horrible monstrous but you know that's how you define it but maybe it's not that you know no you get the BB gun range in your basement does it bother you it bothers you that you do it it sounds like it might bother you that you do that it bothers like it feels it doesn't feel doesn't feel healthy when i'm like i sleep too way too long you know in my hole and i i like i don't know it doesn't seem like a healthy place uh maybe you need it man you're producing this insane beautiful cartoon and i know that you guys aren't just doing that a couple of hours a day i know it's a full-time job right i must be you must be constantly absorbed into that plus i want nothing else but to sit and do absolutely nothing that's that like that is i want it so bad to do absolutely zero but to do that makes me feel horrible and when i go out and i and i produce art or you know i sit at a coffee shop and i draw for a whole day and i feel amazing i feel full of life and i just feel super happy yeah and then sitting and doing absolutely nothing feels even better it feels yeah feels great i'm the opposite of that yeah you were you're sort of a rare creature because you you produce so much work you output constantly and you manage your time extraordinarily well i can't manage my time i've that's something that is real that's not something that i can work towards getting better i will sit and stare at a wall until there's just a few minutes left before i have a deadline that's what i do i had to tell well you know and i'm i'm creating i was running this tv show and there's there's a lot of people on the line like on the line and i'm at the top of this thing that yeah so i had a lot i had to tell production to lie to me about when deadlines were so that i would rush to get something done and it's pathetic you know it's to me it's like it puts a lot of people out yeah and but that's just how i work and i've had to figure out tricks to get me to work and one of them is going to a shop a coffee shop because uh i don't like making eye contact with people yes and so when i'm sitting at that table i'll look up and i'll ding connect with somebody and i'll look straight down and then all i've got in front of me is my work yeah so that's one trick that i use i've got a bunch of them so you go to coffee you go to coffee shops to to draw under to to write right yeah to write yeah that's where you go to write the scripts yeah i write and draw and we it's it's storyboard driven i don't want to i don't need to go into process too much but we write and draw everything out at the same time uh yeah like i go to i go to coffee shops to make eye contact with i contact with people because i'm so lonely that's because you're looking for a lady but i also go there to work so my it's i don't go to coffee i go i don't go to a coffee shop because i want to work because i want to make eye contact with people because i feel that way i feel connected to society not like a crazy man in my house you know i mean yeah i love being a crazy man in my house i hate being a crazy man in my house i hate him when a crazy man in my house jessie how old are you uh 30 fuck 35 35 you look you're you seem like a young you see so you're yeah don't even worry you know what man you got to drop this fine in a girl thing man yeah well all right i did basically give it up for real isn't that the weird trick you just give it up and then i don't know if that's true in la i i've found it to be true yeah i've found that the times that i've completely given up the idea yeah that there is going to be another girl yeah that's usually when someone emerges from the background and i've seen girls casually i've had casual girlfriends since moving to la about three three years ago i moved here yeah but nothing you know i haven't had that click you know that connection yeah i'm like this person is on my level like understands what i'm talking about you know or what i'm thinking or feeling or you know or like what my priorities are you know um like with that supreme goal idea like how do you find someone that has that that supreme goal you know doesn't have to be the exact same thing but like what are you talking about like two people meet and they're both trying to get to the top of this pyramid you know like man i always summon my girls yeah yeah i always do like when i get you know you know like you can pray yeah and you can i thought about making a drawing and putting you know like uh sympathetic magic science yeah i dude will hack into the pentagon and make a lady for you yeah yeah if i just draw one and i put it in a floppy disk driver why don't you do that yeah do a ritual yeah i've thought about doing doing that do you know about uh sex magic i don't know anything about sex magic you have the best laugh in i know that chili pepper's helpful you well here's what you do this is this is what you do yeah this sounds so crazy it's alice are one of crowley's like main like tricks but it's like and a lot of different people do it but it's like the idea is and this is why porn is probably kind of dangerous because the idea from like the occult universe or a lot of people have this idea that the state of orgasm is a magical state is like an rarefied intense magical state and that whatever you visualize during that state uh it's it's a that's what that's how a lot of people do rituals so some people do this thing called how do you say sigil is a sigil right yeah sigil yeah sigil magic which is they will cut they will come up with a phrase something they want something that they're desiring and they'll write this they'll come up with this artistic way of embodying that in a seal where if you were to look at if anybody else was to look at it they probably wouldn't even know what it meant it just is like strange symbols and we i'm sure you've seen them you know i'm in grimoires and shit it's those circular things with like weird like braxist style things so you do one of those you imbue the god damn thing with your um the energy of of orgasm so you fucking jerk off onto it not or just while looking at it while looking at it you're jerking off and you're imagining as clearly as you can this whatever the thing is that you want and then you come as you're staring at this thing right and so then you take that thing and that's where you know it varies according to what school magic you're in if you're into like paganism then you might take the thing and bury it underneath a tree some people do that stuff or then you know whatever the thing is and that sometimes will bring uh will create an effect in your life i mean it's a you know whether or not there's some metaphysical thing that happens when you come and it like it goes to the astral plane and connects to somebody who you're meant to run into i'll go try that tonight i'll try that later today well it's great for an artist too you know yeah yeah it's it's really fun and then what you do another thing that you can do is like don't forget this other part of it which is really fun which you wouldn't like pin but you get get stoned get baked like it really frighteningly high don't go into like a place of like normal high right go into a place where you're like deep deep deep deep into it so you do it as you do it you have a ritual intoxicant yeah and then make sure that you know like north south east west because you're you know there's certain like directions that you face during these rituals and then you can make your own ritual make it but make it real yeah and get into a place where you like you know have you ever gotten so stunned suddenly feel the fear yeah uh every time i get past a certain level of stone i feel the fear yeah go there why well because that's the magical state oh so then you go into the place where you hate that shit well yeah it's scary as fuck man this is why they draw circles yeah why do you think a magician draws a circle uh to because of the fucking fear you got to beat back the demons i started having panic attack panic attacks like at the moment before sleep because i feel like out of control you know i mean that part that part of you when you start daydreaming and start hearing voices and stuff everyone's like jesse or something yeah i was talking about that recently that freaks me i start i start spinning like i have to breathe heavy before i fall asleep you what what do you mean you uh and it happens when you're sleeping and i just realized that this happens to more people than just me because i wouldn't have talked about it if uh if i didn't know that but uh but yeah yeah if you're sleeping maybe you'll hear and just like hey yeah yeah you know just real quick and you're like oh and one time i was like i'm gonna listen for it i'm gonna try to hear it because i know it's coming and i listened to it and it was real loud and it was real real yeah i was like hey and it's like oh that's a bad idea don't list don't seek out the schizophrenic you know yeah mental state don't you know because i feel like you know you could i could slip and then just be there and then and never get out yeah uh we were talking about this a little bit earlier uh about schizophrenia and maybe you've talked about this before but it was uh something about uh bacteria microbes that are in your body that are related to that they've been talking you've seen those videos about bugs that get yes uh like grubs in them that like get inside their brain and push them towards things that they wouldn't normally be at and how human beings have something like that and it that's related to schizophrenia yes the one that makes you like cats or like it's in rats and it makes them go towards cat pee yeah it's called toxic it's it's toxic plasmosis and they it's from cat litter yeah mind control mind control by little bugs inside of us well that we were more bacteria than anything else i mean that's it that's like the you know when you when that's the thing when you you carry around with you inside you the thing that like you know like when they have self-destructing envelopes or for spies that burst into flames after you read it well we're self-destructing envelopes and it's the bacteria that makes us just you know that explodes out of our stomachs but yeah we're mostly bacteria anyway so man it kind of makes sense that these like parasitic things could control our minds you're saying that that's what a demon is whoa uh i was just saying that's that's what's in its parasites let's do stuff like that and that might be related to these voices maybe well yeah i mean i i think those you know those voices that you're talking about man those are like when you're hearing those voices i don't look at it as schizophrenia that's pre astral projection that's like when you're in that state of deep relaxation where if you can just keep your mind from falling asleep then you can begin to like you know experiment with like astral projection and lucid dreaming that's when you get that sleep paralysis and yeah one time i had a astral project i astral projected out of my body when i was on vacation with a girlfriend and we were in spain and i think i was so tired from uh from the trip from the plane ride you know we were in a hostel and i was i fell asleep but it was like this uncomfortable sleep so i didn't quite fall asleep and then i heard a voice i heard that voice talking to me me like yeah hey jessie wake up jessie don't fall asleep count down from 10 or whatever so i did it i counted down from 10 10 9 8 and then as i was doing that i floated out of my body and i was up up on the ceiling looking at myself and my girlfriend i got so excited that um it was so vivid you know and i got so excited i was like trying to call out to my girlfriend be like yo check check me out flying or whatever and then doing that caused me to sink back into my body and then when i did um i couldn't move i was paralyzed because it was like sort of this half i didn't like sink up i guess yeah and the guy was like why'd you do that and then and then i was struggled for a while and then i screamed and uh woke her up uh yeah that's it that's the experience right there man yeah those voices go along with astral projection that i the first time i ever had that i don't do anymore when i was a kid i did it had a few experiences with it and it was like i woke up heard it's weird it's always like hey what the fuck is that or it's your name maybe or it's oh yeah a distant a distant call someone someone talking somewhere you're hearing something somewhat like a voice somewhere and there's terror involved in it yeah it's a sense of like just intense terror it's too much i think because you think it's going to keep going or something like is this just going to happen while i'm walking around like am i going to keep hearing voices i'm going to be one of those guys on the street that's that's how i feel sometimes is that going to keep happening well this is the funny thing about the oculus rift is that when you see people put that oculus rift on one thing that they report is how weird it is to hear voices when you're wearing this kind of digital blindfold because it is the schizophrenic experience you're in a different cartoony whatever the video game is you're in a different realm and when you hear a voice out in in reality it seems like a disembodied voice like hey how's that how's the rift you know so so right the rift you're in the rift in the still maybe that's what these voices are a game for it i don't not yet i don't think so they created a world that you can walk around in there's a few games that i think work for it but i don't think they're creating games specifically for it as far as i know well they're developed they say that they've contacted a bunch of by the way it's it's we've been it's an hour and 17 minutes but i want to ask you about what video games you like yeah yeah i should probably do like a shout out to the dung and trussell uh minecraft server oh all those dudes william i don't know any of these people by the way you've been hanging out in the server yeah and i i dug a big hole and i put some leaves in it and i put some some torches up and you can go find it that's bad if y'all if y'all sign on i'll be there probably most most evenings oh holy shit do you guys hear that that's badass congratulations minecraft server is it there's a bunch of stuff what have you seen do you do you have you been through it at all i haven't been in in a few months there's there's like a monument to your testicle there's thanks guys and there's it's really nice looking in there by the way i've been to a few minecraft servers and this one's particularly beautiful wow you just blew a lot of people's minds pin you just melted a lot of brains that's cool man yeah i love that i love going in there but i get i i um i haven't gone in there in a while i'm gonna visit i'm gonna visit it again i haven't been in a while you so that's your primary game minecraft i dig it i dig it because there's no real goal it's it's more it's uh it's you just make up your own sort of journey through it and you can do almost anything you want you just dig and create build things and talk and just move around and look explore so for me it's it's really casual and nice for me to play i enjoy it um but also i'm also playing i play lots of games man i love games uh also because i want to make games i just i buy that's what i that's what i spend my money on it's just buying games buying i buy terrible games because i want to know what's bad about games pc mostly or console everything console computer i'm playing dead space three which is really nasty which is the opposite of minecraft is it fun it's super fun but it it's like nightmarish you play it on the xbox i play it on xbox i'm gonna go buy it that's i really i was like i was uh i've been um on the fence about it because i read some shitty reviews of it oh it's it's great and it feels it's really fun to play it's just uh like it's just really gross and but it's scary for me at least i get sucked into it and like you want there's these boxes everywhere and there's corpses items inside the corpses and to get them out you have to stomp on them and it's this nasty noise and it makes me feel fucked up when i'm like stomping on all these corpses but i need the health health pack uh that's the thing that that's my like worst thing to say about but uh yeah it's a lot of fun i got into minecraft for a couple months then i gave up on it yeah i was playing the apocalypse minor server minor apocalypse minor apocalypse server and uh uh me and penn have talked about this like why i gave up on but that server was like the wild west where like any anything went uh you you know you'd build a house but then raiders would come in to and burn it down and they'd steal all your stuff and so it was like oh it's a real end of end of society's no order scenario everyone's cheating and everyone's fucking each other up kind of thing it's not it seems it seems that that sounds really fun yeah minecraft is weird minecraft is one of the only video games that ever made me feel lonely because i would play by myself and i and and like you i would dig tunnels down and that music comes on yes yeah it makes you feel lonely comes in you're like it's a good feeling though it's sort of like that's what made me like it was that you're in a mine you're all by yourself in the darkness you know and then this pretty music comes on and makes you feel sentimental or something about being lonely about being by yourself or something that's the feeling i would get from maybe you were listening to the nighttime chime because the the daylight chime is kind of uplifting i would say yeah they they signify makes me feel lonely signifies where the sun is oh i didn't it's like that's when the sun's coming up and there's like noon and so i just thought this thing just came in for no this ethereal sound comes in for no reason yeah and it's sentimental for sure it's sentimental and strange it it really is um and and i i only scratch the surface of minecraft i've got to get deeper into it you ever get into world of warcraft i played it for a little while yeah i like it and i was like a level 12 dwarf and i made my own pair of goggles cool smith some goggles at the dwarf forge that's badass did you did you ever get into like starcraft two have you ever played that yeah play starcraft yeah back that's older right starcraft two the new one oh then starcraft is there so well it's old yeah starcraft two i mean i get yeah there was a starcraft i thought it i thought it was three starcraft three am i slipping oh god no just two i don't think there's i don't think there's a maybe it is two i don't know i see two it's starcraft two and they've got a new coming out march 15th they've got a new expansion coming out which i'm quite excited about but do you play that game you know yeah yeah play yeah when was the last time you played when it first came out they only they released like the the taran the human yes that's the one that's a fun game that's my favorite game i love that game so you like how to play yeah do you like league of legends have you played that i've never played league of legends i heard it's great i know people are addicted to that game it's similar to starcraft i think and some of the yeah the objectives is there an adventure time video game yeah there's one for handheld for 3ds and ds no console no no i'm like xbox version in the future yeah plans for that not yet can't talk about it oh hell yeah so you're playing that's badass cool that's cool i get it man that's badass i know it's gonna happen now adventure time with the oculus rift pop that fucking thing on and you're done yeah you're done because this is the thing man this is the thing that freaks me out about these reality simulation i'm sorry if i've said this on the show but you combine that oculus rift with a neurological implant did the moment you put the oculus rift on or whatever the new futuristic version of it is in the video game you're taking it off that's the first thing your character does is pull a virtual reality thing off in whatever the virtual world is but the neurological implant makes you forget the world that you were just in which is reality and think that the video game world is the real world in other words like if i would give you this device and it would plug into your brainstem in the moment you put it on you would shift into another reality where you're pulling the thing off and you're like that was a weird fucking game i thought i was made a cartoon called adventure time are you a would you call you is that called a futurist people that trust technology to not be satanic you know i do not say that technology is not satanic you know all the apocalypse scenario or the the religious apocalypse scenarios involve technology in some way like you know the the chip and stuff like and that's just happening the mark of the bees yeah yeah do you have that any of that fear let me tell you something brother yeah every team i i see those fucking quadricopters yeah those swarms of quadricopters doing their weird acrobatics like and that buzzing locus sound that they make is they like drift through space and do these crazy geometric movements that i think well that's the i'm looking at the devil like that's that's what satan looks like because it's so weirdly like there's no way to fight those things that scares me i haven't seen those quadricopters have you seen those pin are they this is these four sort of circular blades is that what you're talking about maybe i'm making it up while you're just saying okay okay hold on quick pause we'll show that i'm going to show you these quadricopters okay hold on what do you guys think of the swarm uh i'm glad oh this idea is kind of silly but it's i'm glad the internet exists as sort of a more sort of a moral backbone for government because they can't just release i mean they can those can't those can be everywhere killing everybody all the time but there's going to be some camera footage of that and so you can't you know what i'm saying i'm like that that that's what it made me think of is like if these were around a little earlier everyone would be dead wow yeah right yeah right they would just pick they're gonna pick the flesh look there here's here's what it looks like this is what war looks like in the future and the future war looks like some kind of cargo thing flies over a village opens up the bottom hole opens up you would look up from the village and see this cloud just a cloud it looks seem like a like bees like a swarm of bees and then you hear that because they make this terrible noise and then the fucking swarm would just descend pick the bones off of or the meat off of everybody i see piranhas like piranhas just yeah and then there's just dried skeletons there and the drones go back up into the ship and fly into the next village that's what war looks like in the future that's going to be the last thing so many people here that's it those fucking things are who are those guys who are those guys testing that stuff that's the weird thing it's goddamn north central positronics i don't know who it is some weird you know north central positron oh you guys got to get into the dark tower series you ever read the dark tower series steven king's epic my dad loves dark tower but so good i haven't read it it's so good man played the board game dark tower oh my god get the fuck out of here i still remember that song from the dark tower no do you remember the song for you're talking about the one with the tower in the middle of it yeah i still i think that was it brigands remember that sound it makes yeah that's old school pen that's old school i've got in my closet if you want to play man oh let's play man me and my dad and my brother used to sit and play that fucking game when we get so into it have you ever played it no like an old school it was really intense when it came out because it was like it's this electronic tower yeah it's got some kind of rotating random selection device as you roll that picks like i don't remember exactly how to play i don't remember exactly but there's you can you move around the circle and the tower turns and and makes lights that indicate whether you're fighting brigands or whether you're fighting something else or you know if you're in town what's is it based on the steven king it's not the steep it's just some other dark tower this is pre-dark tower okay the books the books are incredible the game is also quite good yeah it's good holds up hold yeah i mean i yeah that's good to know that it holds up because i haven't yeah i haven't seen it in ages yeah let's play oh fuck you're cool man oculus rift oculus rift and the dark tower jesse makes the good you guys are the coolest people ever thanks minecraft right back at you man hey i don't think i feel weird about having guys that aren't that funny on your podcast oh are you kidding look who the host is i don't think i'm that funny yeah no you're super funny man i just feel like i've been on one other podcast before with other with comedians you know and it's uh it's intimidating because you're like well i'm not a comedian what do i do no that you know man i tried the whole comedy thing like comedy podcasts are great and i've been on podcasts that are just like this is a comedy podcast and when you have a comedy podcast all of a sudden everyone's doing comedy all right and it's like it's fine but it's kind of like uh it gets old quick doesn't it it seems more fun to just like have conversations that evolve into something or maybe they don't and if they don't they don't there's no pressure because what is it really yeah i like this this is my style i think just talking talking stuff out talking about ideas yeah i like that oh yeah i was about to say you were just saying we're cool i think you're super cool man uh i've been listening to your podcast a lot it makes me feel really good and i've sold you but i haven't said it on your podcast thank you sir thanks me too man i listen to your podcast all the time me and my brother both listen to it well geez you guys thank you very much thanks that's super that's super cool man i mean uh you guys are both oh sorry uh i want to tell you the story when i was crying uh behind behind the the what do you call it backstage at the the steve allen theater you were crying uh i was i was drunk i drank too much and i've performed a couple times uh and so i was drinking to get up on stage and i was dressed like santa claus because it was it was christmas time and i was going to get on stage and and draw uh the the the the bit was i was going to draw like elves with big boners or christmas trees with big boners and then davie and randy the guys there davie johnson yes we're gonna just scold me and that was the whole thing and i was i was really really really drunk and then i decided to drink more uh so i was i was in an emotional state and then my buddy pat um he was a good friend of mine he came backstage uh because he was in town and he was just going to go back to new york he was leaving he came back to say goodbye to me and and this is an example of like what i what i'm like when i'm drunk too is like and i was like pat by pat i'm like we're gonna die and since when we're 60 man by pat and i just started busting up you know i was just busting up and uh when kate mccuchy was there and i was just bawling uh and pat left and and i've got like you know boogers and snot in my beers i'm sharing those tears everywhere and uh kate just hugged me immediately she was really nice to me me and then i just started telling her about pat and then uh and then i was like i have to leave i have to leave uh and i was like yeah have you listened to dunkin trestle's podcast and then i just ran away i like ran i grabbed i had an easel and some newsprint that i was drawing on i scooped it up and just scampered off crying and dressed like santa claus yeah you were telling her that she had to listen to dunkin trestle's podcast right yeah i told her to listen to the one with your mom actually and that's the one i think about a lot uh which is an awesome awesome it's full of was a barn burner that one yeah that something happened there that was really intense because it like uh it like captured weirdly a moment that uh you know i i hadn't had that talk with my mom yet and then it kind of captured it and it captured it in an honest way and that was a really intense that was a really intense man yeah you know that's a crazy moment to have with your parents uh i tried to interview my parents last time i went to home for christmas just to like put something some things into context about things i don't understand about them uh but it didn't how i felt like weird i the whole time i was thinking about doing it and then i didn't do it i still have to because they're more far out than i am my parents and uh i i don't understand some of the things that they they tell me i kind of want to figure some of that stuff out you got to do it connect with your parents as much as you can you know it's a great thing to do don't i mean you it's very strange man parents are you know my mom's super sick now like i've got to like uh i actually thought i was going up there uh this weekend to say goodbye to her because she's uh very close to dying and and i um but then i've i had this little cold and she doesn't want me to come now because of the cold so maybe i'll come no it's very weird where did where does she live north carolina oh north carolina very strange thing isn't it this uh this problem whether it was like when your parents start blinking out it's really crazy isn't it i haven't had that experience yet but yeah i don't know i don't know what that's a totally different experience my father's passed away uh but i didn't know him very well when uh i think like seven years ago or eight maybe now uh we were pretty distant totally distant uh yeah that's a weird story what's the story uh you don't have to talk about your one i don't know i can't i haven't maybe not i don't know maybe i won't yeah it's intense man these are the things that you know your first experience with masculine entities your dad your first experience of femininity is your mom and those are the two archetypes that like yeah i just got a big helping of femininity i didn't give them yeah me too i was i mean my my mom from you know yeah my folks got divorced so i got the femininity too yeah not so bad no i like it i got a balanced meal yeah masculine and feminine yeah i guess yeah that's cool that's special these days a lot of people didn't get that you know most people got one or the other because everyone gets divorced yeah yeah i got my own share of the i mean my mom my mom did have a heavy impact on my how i am now she came out she moved away from japan because she was like a black sheep you know like really strong personality yeah i think in that culture of her era to be a woman and move to america uh in japanese culture you have to be like sort of like a live wire person like sort of you know i mean otherwise you would just stay in your town and marry someone be you know that's a very that generation i think it's changed now but of that time period is pretty radical to move away to another country and she moved to israel and she was living on a kaboots and stuff and she was like trying to find god and all this so she you know did all this stuff and then came to america a total wild wild minded super idealistic uh person and so that uh but that that that combativeness is what i experienced she blasted out a cool kid yeah yeah no i love my mom she's great you know but she has that fire that fiery thing that i reacted to growing up i became different from that or purposely be was different from my mom right yeah my mom super powerful yeah you know and she took care you know three boys by herself uh and so i became maybe more uh laid back and yeah what's the opposite of powerful you don't seem the opposite of powerful you seem quite powerful you don't strike me as someone who's i like to harness it but it doesn't come naturally i don't think i think if if anything it causes like cross wires in my mind to like harness the power to take on the power well i mean because you do out you're you're a boss yeah like you run a business you're you're in charge of a whole yeah huge business yeah yeah so yeah that must that must be intense if yeah super messes me up like my brain yeah uh yeah i think you get bummed out every time you you would tell me you would get bummed out every time you had to like tell us to change something because i don't it's horrible to make to cause misery in any way even the slightest way to to to be a person i like i have to create misery do you yell at people i don't know maybe i sort of i raised my voice the other day when we were talking about we got in a fight what was the fight about uh this character named ranicorn yeah jake and ranicorn jake uh do you know jake or jake is like the dog yeah and there was wars between the dogs and ranicorns right yeah there was like a terrible war war right um i was trying to play a situation scenario a certain way um between in the relationship and pens really protective and i got really protective and upset and loud about their favorite lady ranicorn and jake the dog's relationship and how how they're they're they're really healthy i think their relationship right but i was saying that you can't i've been i've been thinking about this ever since we had this conversation and i'm still gonna change it the way you want it but i was thinking to myself like how do you prove a thing in fiction or whatever in life how do you prove a thing is uh healthy if you don't challenge it should we provide some context to this this isn't boring no i think well i think i know i know a lot of people on the message board are into adventures a lot of people probably know this but yeah maybe just give some if someone's listening to this and they haven't uh can we provide it without revealing without spoilers that's spoiling it i don't know i think you're spoilers and then people can skip ahead if they don't want the spoiler look let's let's tell you know zoom out of adventure time for a moment though and i think what you're talking about is like the what a lot of people who are into non-monogamy which i'm not and lately i know what you're saying jessie because i feel like a goddamn pervert because i only want to be with one person like i was so many people are like i get out there and fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck you gotta fuck until you gotta fuck all the time you're fucking all the fuck all these different girls and i don't like that like my fetish i feel like i have this fetish where i like to be with one girl who i care for and it makes now these days that makes you feel like you like to fucking take goddamn sprays a piss in your mouth makes you feel like a damn perv if you just want to be with one person you're supposed to be out there fist in america yeah that makes me feel like a perv but what i've been what i've been doing for three years is like humping just humping just you're rolling through the life humping and rolling through life humping sucks i hate it yeah it sucks i hate now fuck the thing that you're talking about though is like if you do want to be non-monogamous the one thing that like uh they say is honesty is the most important part of that or it's like you're if you're going to be non-monogamous don't sneak around the whole point of the thing is like yes we're going to be with other people we like hanging out with each other the most but we're going to be with other people and i'm going to tell you when that's happening and then if you achieve that level of honesty then apparently that's how non-monogamous relationships work but the moment a non-monogamous or monogamous relationship you add that goddamn forbidden element where somebody's sneaking around and you know looking then yeah a demon comes into the garden you know that's the snake in the fucking garden it fucks everything up man yes i look at porn yes i play video games yes i play video games i like to look at porn yes i go into a hole eat pizza play minecraft yes are you saying that that's like cheating on your girlfriend i'm saying it's all part of the same thing the moment that you get the feeling like ah shit now i'm not going to be able to eat pizza in the hole because she's around now you fucked yourself you know what i mean you've created this wall around the pizza have you ever had a girlfriend catch you jerking off catch you catch me jerking off yeah uh no i did i got caught once what happened she cried see that's what i'm saying she cried she you gotta find better ladies it's fucking terrible one of the worst moments did you used to date your mom just imagining your your expression turning around like a door creak because i tried to the weeping the weeping like oh god what was she why was she weeping because i had tried i had tried to i wanted to have sex earlier and then she was being distant this is like at the lowest point of our relationship here we go skip ahead she was being this hour fifty she was being distant and i was like i'm gonna go jerk off fuck this and i went into my room and because i was so worked up i can't remember we weren't having sex like once every two weeks or something like that so i could never predict and she walked in she walked in like trying to get like a book or something like that and i was like oh fuck and then she was like what's going on and then uh she was like i thought we were gonna this is a whole thing this is like a therapy it was terrible i you know it it was i don't know what i'm trying to prove by talking about this actually well let me try to say what we're talking about the like the in relationships the moment that you have this forbidden thing that you're i think if a girl catches you jerking off it should be cool yeah yeah it should transition into sex well i mean ideally or you know like yeah you shouldn't feel ashamed of it yeah they shouldn't make you feel ashamed because then you're in this like creepy like then now you're in a whenever it gets to the place where it gets creepy is where someone is trying to control someone else's sex drive yeah or someone's trying to say oh you can't have sex or you are this i'm in control of your orgasms you can't have an orgasm cop yeah orgasm cop yeah you can't have that and then you need to be in a relationship where you're completely open to the fact that yes that we but i'm going to masturbate sometimes yeah sometimes we're out of sync but you don't want that to be like if that's forbidden then then it's then it starts festering you know yeah i think in theory she was cool i mean obviously she knew i looked at porn and masturbated in theory she was cool with it but i think when you're confronted with that moment where it's like he decided to do this instead of try to hook up with me then it gets i don't know gets hairy it can get weird i would you know i this this uh there was a as i was there's this girl i really like and like we took out we were dating for a while and like uh or i mean dating in the sense that we would like go out and then she would come back here and sometimes we would drink and like a couple of times she spent the night here and there's two beds here and i would sleep in the other bed and i let her sleep in in my in my bedroom because it felt you know like uh it wasn't the place where we could sleep together yet and the first time she went into my bedroom because i just wasn't really thinking i didn't think that that was going to happen and on my bed is lotion and an ipad like laying next to each other side by side you got to put that shit in the bathroom i didn't i didn't think about it and she's like yeah she laughed it was like oh lotion and an ipad huh but she thought it was funny yeah in other words it wasn't like ew you've been jerking off it was just more like haha look what you did dummy you left out your jerk jerking implements and it wasn't then she started we she starts weeping well you guys want to see the idea of weeping there was a lot built up to that moment like there was some other shit well what were you jerking off to that might explain why she was weeping i don't think she saw it was like click you know click it off my mom caught me did your mom ever catch you my mom caught me one time yeah your mom caught you that was also a moment that's you know i think that for a parent not funny what did your mom's what did your mom say that was when the internet was slow too so i couldn't click it off it was like 28k modems i think she was like uh i think she was like okay okay okay i think that's all she's close the door bam permanent memory yeah uh jeez burnt in forever i my dad used to keep these i mean this is way back in the day before the internet but my dad used to have these fucking books called beeline books you ever remember beeline books you guys ever know what is that i think it was beeline it was a series of porn books so it was like but you used to read i would read porn before the internet so you read sexy fiction yeah like erotic fiction that's just like fucking weird my dad i would always find my dad's like porn books and that's what he caught i'm gonna can remember laying in bed reading some crazy fucking like crazy crazy step it was like about a brother and a stepsister and just like just just really fucking heavy duty bondage i'm reading that shit in bed and i'm jerking off as a kid my dad walked in and i like whipped to the side and threw the book into the wall just making it more obvious and i've thrown a porn book into the wall but he just laughed he thought i was stupid funny yeah i used to read those porn penthouse letters remember the best yeah and the collections of them the lies the lies just lying lying dudes at their house right yeah you know it wasn't even a guy you know you know they didn't really get those letters it was just someone on staff who like came up with these bullshit fantasies that's all right as long as it gets your mind going that shit never happens yeah when i was a kid i thought that that's like one of the things you look forward to when you're growing up as a lady at the fucking car wash is going to suck you off if you smile at her the right way i hooked up with a girl on a train once that was sort of like a penthouse letter no shit what happened that was the first girl i ever kissed was a girl stranger on a train and uh she tried to have sex with me but i was too scared you didn't have said i thought you did i thought you said you had sex with her on a train no i sucked i like i kissed her titties and i was a virgin and uh she like came on to me so hard on this train that you put lipstick on first no but that's what broke the ice for me with girls was meeting this girl on a train and for a while my friend convinced me that it was a conspiracy and she was planted there to like break my uh losing streak a honeypot yeah you've got a lot of stories where your friends convince you of things right where that was part of that was a part of an elaborate year-long lie was this girl was a plant who put her there this like this uh cabal of satanic sainess really it was a year-long lie where i started believing in in uh in demons and uh yeah so wait you believed that a cabal of satanist put a girl on the plane yeah train and she let you suck her tits so that i kind of satanic conspiracy so that i could be able to have sex with girls yeah so i love that meeting where they're sitting around before when they're planning the whole thing out we've got to get jesse lady yeah there's a boy we'll be on a train next i was 23 father i was 23 this is a can of worms man you can delve deep into this oh it was a huge lie i don't know it lasted a year and i legitimately thought the demons were following me and i had to wage war on demons this is a fascinating story it's a that because i was just talking about it yesterday with a friend this is the hell trip yeah there's variations of the hell trip but it's usually for me it's like if i get too stoned sometimes i'll look at my friends and think what if they're fucking demons what if everyone's a demon and like part of hell is like they just pretend to be your friends but they're really just here to torment you as you like and it's a hell trip it's a quite common it's like jacob's ladder that's what it's all about is you're in your you're in this lower dimension i definitely feel like some people are legitimately demons it's like hard not to believe that sometimes about some people but yes for sure i think some people do have demons in their lives for sure sometimes you will have someone in your life that is a demon who is always like fucking with your own sometimes they're fucking related to i try to tell that to people people you know sometimes i turn into like advice man and then people you know people telling me their problems and stuff and that that comes up a lot where it's like dependency on someone that's sucking your life out you know and that you feel responsible for making them happy when they're trying to destroy you yeah yeah you feed yourself to them yeah yeah feeding you're like you're like a feeder mice you just let them suck your life energy man you guys it's almost two hours oh this thing could go on forever

One of the really cool things about having a podcast is you never know who could be listening. Fortunately for me, one of the people who listens to my podcast is Sherman Trueheart, the man running the artificial intelligence program over at Google. He's one of the very few people who have access to the Chamber of Forgotten Dreams, which is where they keep the aquarium filled with a plasmatic ooze that has within it the sentient gel which calls itself Clancy. It has the processing power of every human brain on the planet and Dr. Trueheart allowed me one question for it. Here is the question I asked the robot called Clancy. Is there a God? That's what you would ask. So yes, that's my question to you. Is there a God? My answer would be that's what you asked. That's what you chose? That's what you would choose? Yes. What do you think would be a better question? I don't know. The cheese. There you go. A conversation with one of the most advanced AIs on the planet today. And now a quick message from the DTFH family to your girlfriend. We are so sorry that your boyfriend decided to share this episode of the podcast with you on the romantic road trip that you both chose to take. We understand that you find my voice to be annoying and that you don't connect with this at all. That you feel a certain level of resentment that your boyfriend would inflict this upon you instead of letting you listen to the music that you would like to choose. Why does he always have to be in control? Doesn't it seem odd? I want to sincerely apologize to you for any moment of uncomfortability that I've produced inside of you. But with all due respect, might I remind you that that's your boyfriend? He made the decision to play this podcast to you. And now he must make another decision. The decision to bring you home to your family. To drop you off here at the DTFH family compound and allow us to bathe you, to comb your hair, to oil you down, to ring bells above you, and to allow you to experience transcendent, unconditional love. When he comes to pick you up, you will be born again. You will feel that feeling that you thought was lost forever. But most importantly, you're going to smell great because we're going to soak you down with oils and we're going to lather you up. Come on home, it's time for you to come on home. We'll spank her and we'll soak her in glass of water's tea. We'll make such sweet love to her that it will make her weep. And you'll last full sleep at night because you are feeling peace as we are sucking gently upon your girlfriend's feet. Come on home, come on home, come on home to your family, come on home, come on home. Oh sweet children, the podcast I present to you today is so infernal that I recommend that you have nearby a golden chowice filled with chilled nun's milk that you could pour down your scorched throat just sure to become blistered and dry as you deal with the malefic charismatic potency of today's guest who has written the encyclopedia of hell and has direct communion with the dark one who was and will be today. Martin Olson is with us here today friends. We're going to jump right into this episode but first some quick business. A heartfelt thank you to the people over at Squarespace.com for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Right now if you head over to Squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan, you're going to get 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain. Why do you need a website? That's a question you might be thinking. I would answer why do you need a skeleton? Why do you need organs? Why do you need atoms? Why does there need to be an interconnected web of energy connecting us to everything that is simultaneously sentient and completely obliviated by its never-ending expansion? The answer is because it's a blast. You don't just have to make a website because you want to start a business or because the website that you've currently made for your business looks like something that was vomited out of the mouth of some splattered ununderstandable crust rotting at the bottom of some ancient sea on another planet. Why would you want it to look like that when it could look sparkly, beautiful and amazing? Squarespace gives you all the tools you need to do that because they use beautiful templates created by world-class designers. They have these wonderful templates that you can mix and match together to make a beautiful website. They've got a powerful e-commerce functionality that lets you sell anything online, the ability to customize look and feel, settings, products and more with just a few clicks and everything is optimized for mobile right out of the box. They've got 24 seven award-winning customer support. I've tested the customer support like testing gold and let me tell you I've been chewed upon by the foul dogs of bad customer support services from other companies. I've had my psychological carcass tap danced on by the stinking feet of some of the monsters who work in customer service in other corporations but dealing with Squarespace is like standing in front of a demigod and breathing in his mystical exhalations. You'll love it if you need it. It's being used by creative consultants, wedding professionals, museums, performing artists, undertakers, real estate brokers, clairvoyance, Ouija board designers, people who have spilled blood on the altar of truth, jewelry designers, wellness coaches, studios, spas, athletes, crows and I use a Squarespace website.

Send that energy down and welcome to the dunkintrustle family hour podcast. My friend, Martin Olson. Martin, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. Thanks for having me here. You just returned from a pretty intense, uh, intense, um... Yeah, one of my best friends, he passed away. It was very intense. We were back east. How long was he going through cancer for? He had liver cancer, so there were a lot of toxins hitting his brain, so he wasn't quite... I didn't see him when he went back. He had died when I came back and he didn't recognize Bobcat or his wife. But in terms of the diagnosis, how long did he know, like, how much time did he have between diagnosis and... Short amount of time. I don't know the details. Short. So you... Sudden. So it was unexpected. It was just an unexpected... I thought he had months, I guess an easy way to say it. I thought he had a month or months and he had, like, days. Well, tell me about him. What was he like? Um, like, uh... What do you call those things, uh, Russian dolls? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he was like a series of shells with this magnificent, um, super bright light inside. Excuse me, and he, um, was able to channel the mundane into the profound all the time and, uh, and vice versa. As we're doing right now. And he was, like, my dearest fucking pal. That's all. You know what is... Where'd you meet him? When's the first time you met him? I walked into... I was kind of a spy. I had, uh, been playing piano for the comedy connection in Boston and was trying to write for comedians for the gong shows. There were no comedy clubs before that. What year was this? 1977, 1978, 1979. So I went into... I heard that somebody else was starting a comedy club in Cambridge. We were in Boston and so I walked in kind of undercover, Barry was behind the bar and he gave me a sales pitch right away, uh, because he was kind of a you know, a together dude in terms of a salesman. So he, uh... Sales pitch for what? For the club. Oh, okay, I see. So I'm a random dude coming in. Gotcha. He's got it down. Maybe he's practicing on me. Yeah, okay. Turns out we're best of fucking friends and it's all a fucking ruse and a multi-layered fucking Russian doll. You knew you were best friends right away? No, I knew half... No. How long did it take? Quite a while, but then it was obvious that it was all an illusion. I might, that, that, one of my... Quite a while. One of my favorite things is the, is that kind of love creep where you're like, you run into, so the way it works is you run into somebody and... I haven't thought this thought before. Oh, it's so, it's so cool. You run into somebody and you'll, you'll have a brief flickering interaction with them. You know what I mean? There's like a little like, a thing happens. And then you'll, you'll forget about the person. You'll, you, you, but we, but it's the way you forget about them is different from the way you forget about the trillions of other people that you forget about throughout the day. You don't forget about them in the same way. In fact, you haven't forgotten about them at all. They're sitting in your mind spinning like the rainbow wheel and on your Mac. They're spinning there, but you're imagining you've forgotten them, but you haven't. And so they've impacted you in some weird way that you don't even understand. And then you run into them again. And then, then again, and then you realize like, wait, we're caught in each other's gravitational field and we're being pulled together. Let me ask you a question about this. Is this, this is the big question for me. Do we create meaning? Do we, do we back engineer in meaning? You're asking me that? Man, you've seen the example you just gave. Well, okay. So, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. I mean, that's one of those questions where to answer is to just be a done. Because the problem is it's all happening at the same time. So we have to break it down linearly in fucking time. Yeah. Yeah. So it's anyone's, depending on the, on the, I can't think of the word of the way that we can manipulate words so that we could see who. Do you know the book of John? No, I don't. Is that the fucking revelations? No, it's the book of John. It's like, it's like, in the gospels, there's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Oh, I don't know it. So Matthew, Mark, Luke are considered the synoptic gospels, which means there's, I think it means they're similar. They're similar events, whereas John is just this like more psychedelic, trippy gospel. Didn't he also do the, the last one? What's the last book of the New Testament? The revelations. I don't know if it's the same John. I mean, it's a pretty common, boring fucking name. John. Was that really his name, by the way? Like, it doesn't sound very Hebrew, like John. The fuck was his name? It couldn't have been John. Were people in the desert really named John? How annoying. John has always struck me no offense to any John's out there, but it's so close to John that it's like, it's just always seem like what, like, what, like, it's like, only because it's like the sound of like the thing you do when you're bored and to name your child after the sound of the universal sound of boredom has always seemed odd to me. That being said, I can never look at my friend, John anymore without thinking about it. Listen, plenty of John's have proven that this John Carpenter, the fuck, you know, come on fucking Carpenter fucking John Law, one of the founders of the cacophony society, John, so many, whoever the fuck John was that was in the Bible, it's like, so it's just like the parents are to blame because the parents are like, oh, John, well, just fuck this. It's like, oh, baby. So, so the book of John starts off, it's very beautiful because it says, in the beginning was the word. And I've always loved that because it's like this, it's, it's this I, yeah, in the beginning was the word. That's the best. Yeah, it's the best. It's the best. So it's like, what is the word? So it's like, sort of this idea of like, the universe speaks itself out. Yeah, right. That had to be the beginning to speak. Yeah, it's so and whatever that first vibration, yeah, whatever that first vibration was or the thing was or what the idea was, I am right. Well, yeah, I mean, that's that was that's one of the enigmatic. That's pretty much all you have. I am. That's all you're armed with. That's it. That's your total shit. Thank God. I mean, because what else do you need? It's like, everybody else wants everything expands up from that and then has to go back into it. Everything else is glitter. It's like, I love glitter, though, it's fucking great. I mean, it gets everywhere and it's like, and but the, that moment that you're talking about, I do love it is like that moment when if you're lucky and you're walking and then suddenly you're like, this is happening. Yeah. And that's it. Yeah, right. You know what I mean? It's not you're not adding on anything to that. It's just like, well, this is happening. And then you're in that moment. I really love that moment so much. That's the same problem I have though. It's hard for me to stay in that moment. Oh God. Yeah. You don't stay in that moment. I mean, stay in that moment and watch out because if you stay in that moment, then now, then people are going to start shaving their heads around. That's it. That's exactly it. That's a diagram of what happens. Stay in that moment too long, man. People are going to start shaving their heads around you. They're going to start singing and dancing. And you know, this is like in that, in Jesus Christ superstar that, which I love, there's like that great, the song, I don't remember which one it is. It goes, what? No, he goes, Jesus has like been told to shut up and he, and his response is, why waste your breath moaning at the crowds? Why waste your breath moaning at the crowds? Yeah. Keep going. Nothing can be done to stop the shouting. Really? Keep going. God, it goes, if something like, if all of us were quiet, the rocks and stones themselves would start to sing. Whoa! That's killer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's in that fucking news ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So, so the, so the, so the, so if, that's beautiful. If you get into the predicament that you become a represent, not, not, not the representative of that space, but become that space, but your skin at the same time. If you find yourself in that predicament, then what will happen is the ripples around you are going to start taking on a, a formation that looks like people celebrating all the time around you. Huh. And that's the big, yeah. Cause that, well, that's what, that's what. Let me backtrack for a second. So the moment that we were talking about would be the personification of that moment. Yeah. So that is the problem because that's like not a real thing. It becomes a caricature, like a guy on the beach. Oh, the character. Yeah. No, caricature. It's always going to, if you run, if you run into the personification of the present moment, God help you. Well, that's what we're doing. That's what everybody does every fucking day, dude. So the personification of the universe is what we're doing. Yes. Yes. The, the, the, the, yes. I, and this is Bakhti. This is the idea of like, well, it's the, you know, lowering the filters to begin to assimilate that information. What's Bakhti mean? So like Bakhti's the yoga of love. So Bakhti's that. Sounds good. Bakhti's the concept that B-H-A-K-T-I. Yeah. Bakhti. Yeah. Bakhti. Bakhti yoga. Okay. The yoga of love, the yoga of the heart. So like, you know, there's like mind yoga. There's hatha yoga, the yoga of the body. There's all different forms of yoga for the different types of people. I'm ignorant of yoga. Keep going. So yoga is, means to yoke. So it's like a, What? Yeah. Yoga is like, you know, it's, it's to, to connect. It's like a connection. It's like a, What word did you just use? Yoke. Like when you're putting the, the. Oh, yoke. Yoke. Yoke. Not yoke, like a yoke. Yoke. I said yoke. Not yoke. Mystery of yoke and yoke. Yoke. It's like, when you fucking break an egg on a, a cow's back. Martin, have you ever broken an egg on a cow's back? It's so. In my mind right now. It's a fetish of mine. I pay lots of money for those videos. But so anyway, you're, you're sort of like, it's, it's basically the idea of like, how to, here's some, like, oh, you want to make a con, you want to connect with the thing. So here's some ways that we. That's what it's all about. Here's some ways that, that have been. That's what we're doing now. Yes. Yes. That is what we're doing now. Right. Yes. And, and, but, but what's beautiful is for thousands of years, people have been refining systems. Yeah. To connect. To connect. So like, here's some refined systems. That's all it is, isn't it? Yeah. Just like refined systems. And, and within the systems, depending on whatever the system is, you, there's interpretations of the systems. And there's, there's a kind of like, I guess what you could call a fermentation process that is always happening. Talk more about that. So the, yeah. So like, so, that's a good one. It's like, so, so we have this like, series of like. Levels. Overlapping levels of interpretation, essentially. And all those things are like, on top of each other, and they're rising up and steeping and winding around and fermenting and growing and that's growing into increasingly complexified, yet harmonious expressions of some universal or not harmonious. Well, hope. Yeah, or not, or not, depending on what the system is. There's no harmony without this harmony. So. Right. Yeah. Right. Well, and right. So this isn't, so this, so we have different ways of describing that. Right. So I like Bakhti Yoga because the descriptions that are used are romantic. And so, so the way we describe this is we have Krishna, which means, or there's many different ways to describe what Krishna means. The one that always comes to mind for me is the supreme reservoir of all pleasure. So we have Krishna. That's weird. And then we have Krishna's lover, Radha, Radharani. So, so, so really ignorant of this. So Krishna has a lover, Radharani, and they're, and they're, they're so in love and they're so in love with each other. What would be the lover of pleasure, though? It's not pleasure. What's that? The lover of pleasure, which is what Krishna is. Yeah. How could it not be pleasure itself as well? Well, this is why when we chant Hare Krishna, we're not chanting to Krishna. We're chanting to Radha. So when you chant Hare Krishna, you're chanting to Krishna's lover, because if you can, if Krishna, if the thing that God has fallen in love with. Krishna's like the egg that's the, that is being sought after. Krishna is, and I don't know how to, I don't know how to respond to that. Krishna is the Krishna. I mean like a zygote. Krishna is the, yes. So Krishna is the, sedentary immobile fucking egg. Well, we, no. It makes him sound so fucking poor. Who wants the fucking egg, man? Is Krishna the one with the fucking pan flutes and jump it around and? He just got one flute. Okay. Now the flute, of course, all these things are like, we're talking about math. We're talking about symbol systems that have been designed to try to convey a very, very big. Maybe not design, maybe naturally came about. I like that better. But the thing that is to be conveyed is so, is quite difficult to wrap our minds around. So there's all these ways to do it. You could go E equals MC square. And some people are going to hear that. And with their training and their understanding, they're going to be like, yes, yes, yes. And, and, and it's beautiful. And that's, that's a connective moment. Like that's a moment of being like, wow. And, but then some people, they're going to hear a story. And that's where I connect is, is this story of this beautiful being that is, tell me the story of Krishna. Well, Krishna is in love with Radha. And who the fuck is Radha? Radha, Radharani, Radha, Radha, Radharani, Radha is, is Krishna's lover. And so they, um, they, so they have a relationship. Yeah, but give me, how did they meet? What's the whole deal? They were on tender. Okay, keep talking. She swiped. What's weird is like, she did not swipe for Krishna. She was not swipable. I don't know how they met. I don't know this. I don't know that part of the mythology. Um, I'll tell you the pieces. Were they two halves of one is what I'm getting at. I'll tell you like the pieces. Oh, was she, was he as I go? Sorry to interrupt. I'll tell you the pieces I know. Okay. It's just that moment when you fall in love for real. The best moment in life. Yeah. And you, in that moment when you fall in love, if you are, if you, if you're, if you're practicing any kind of mindfulness at all, and certainly maybe if you are practicing mindfulness at all, fuck you. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? What are you a connoisseur of love? Are you like some foodie for love? You pompous pig with your fucking mindfulness. So it's like, so, and of course this is where some collisions can happen between like bhakti yoga and the, uh, impersonalism that manifests in Buddhism. And it's a beautiful collision, but the, so in, in the deepest throes of love with a lover, you suddenly will recognize that your identity no longer is your identity and that your lover's identity is no longer your lover's identity, but it appears that you have somehow become some kind of universal, never-ending, romantic companionship that seems to be transcendental or. All my love experiences were exactly like that. It was, the lover was, uh, was suddenly personifying the universe and your unification with it. Yeah. Every single time it was that. That's it. Yeah. Well, that's bhakti yoga. So bhakti yoga is an acknowledgement of that and, and, and, and then, um, method, method, methodic, um, uh, analysis of that phenomena. What do you make of the analysis in religion? This is religion we're talking about, right? No, religion I think has to come after. I think, so the religion would come after. So religion, religion has to come after the religion must come after because, because it's like we have the, so, so, so we fall in love. Yeah. And then we make the rules. We fall in love and then there's the, oh, and then let's do this and this and these are the things that we do now. That's what I call you and here's your name and what you call me and here's how we touch it. But the primordial, essential nature precedes religion, which is what one of my favorite verses in the Bhagavad Gita, which is he who is attached to the flowery words of the scriptures is like a person who drinks water from a well when it flows everywhere. That's great. Yeah. Wow. See that again? He who is attached to the flowery words of the scriptures is like he is like a person who drinks water from a well when it flows everywhere. That's great. Yeah. So, so, so we're talking about a kind of primacy and then the, then, then the interpretive, the interpretation of it, which is a joy because it's like, oh man, did you get to experience it in time? Yeah. And part of the part of the joy of experiencing it in time is the articulation of the awestruck moment. You get to back into, you get to, what do you call it, go into the, you get to fractal into it. Yes. You get to fractal into it and it's, and, and, and that's where it gets really fun is it's like we say we are fractaling into it. You know, as though we are, we are an individual fractaling into it and, and that's the game that we're playing when probably the reality is that it is fractalizing out of us. And yet as part of the way that we're experiencing it is that we take on these identities and we're like, yes, I'm fractaling into it. I am the discoverer. I am making the discovery. I am the cartographer. I am making the maps. I am the one making it. You know what, you're bringing up something I'm so interested in, which is role playing. So for example, just to wipe clean the entire thing we just talked about, the idea of like a priest or a, or a person, whatever the opposite of a priest is, or a therapist and a patient or a What is the opposite of a priest? A, some word that I love that has a Y in it that I can't think of the name of it. Yogi? No, no, no. Yeah, subservient fucking dude. So Cuck. Yes. So I just mean about role playing because then you could just switch it and obviously the person who is the, in one role could easily be the other one. It's just because they determined these values to be, the roles to be, to be determined, predetermined. Yes. So, and that's one of the main interests I'm having right now in terms of story writing. Because I'm sort of realizing the process as I start the story of what's the roles happening and we're, and then it's always the fun of, of reversing the roles. And also the main nature of the joke is always the reversal anyway. Talk about that. It has something to do with the creation of the universe. Yes. Because the ultimate joke would be what? What's the first joke? What's the shape of the first joke? And that would be a good thing to say, the shape of the first joke. Yeah. It would be a reversal, probably something to do with. Oh, I was thinking to be a rubber chicken head. See, now you're getting right to it. That'd be so sad. I pray that's not the shape of the first joke. Why did rubber chicken heads even become part of comedy? How did that happen? Oh, it was joke shops. Joke shops were fucking primal territory for humor. What's a joke shop? A joke shop, when I was a little kid, there was Jack Horner's joke shop downtown Boston. So I'd go in there and they would have jokes that you'd buy. Wow. And they'd have magic tricks, the egg cup that you'd buy. Wow. And they'd have the egg bag. There were a lot of egg things. It was pretty primal. Wow. And I remember my first time a woman ever came onto me and said anything sexual to me, was in a joke shop. What'd she say? She was like a middle-aged woman, and I don't know anything. I'm like fucking nine or I'm 12. And I was looking at the jokes, and then I went to her and I said, do you have the time? And she said, after work, I get off at so-and-so. And I didn't get it, obviously. So then after was like a slow burn joke. Wow. My favorite kind. I love the slow burns, man. It's all about the slow burns. Those are the best. Those are the best. Those are the best, especially when they take lifetimes. But like the... Oh, my friend, Dan Poppin, I had some great stories about that. He actually selected a bunch of stories he had about the longest punchlines of when it comes true. I could have asked him about that later. It was really fucking great. A lot of the ways that the miracles I've experienced in my life happen... What do you mean? ...are slow burn miracles. They're time bomb miracles. So for example, one of the... It wasn't Eureka? Well, no, because sometimes the people who want to give you the miracle understand that if they are so garish as to give you the miracle right in front of your face, they're going to put you in the uncomfortable position of having to react to a miracle. Who wants to be around that? You know what I mean? It's like, I don't want to see you react to the miracle. You just describe religion. That's exactly what it is. Yeah. How do you mean? Because the guy who's trying to illuminate you or whatever it would be realizes that it's so simple. There's nothing to it. Yeah. You have to fucking stretch it out. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, I think so. I mean, the thing I'm talking about is sometimes if you run into some... Sometimes you'll run into really smart, smart, smart, smart people. And they'll know that if they were to show you something right, and the thing you've desperately been wanting to see so badly, wanting to see or something, and you want to control... First of all, you want to control them. Your ego wants to control them. Your ego always wants to control the teacher. So like, you know, of course, it's like that's part of what the ego wants. Is that true though? I don't need all of this. Fuck yeah, it's true. Sometimes it's not fucking true. You just want us basking it. My ego. I should have said my ego. You're a pretty modest dude. Yeah, but no, but I know that I have an expectation. Of things. So in other words, I have an expectation. Here's how a miracle would look. Like anyone listening to this right now has an expectation of how a miracle might look. And that's a very funny thing to think about. It's like, let your mind produce its simulation of a miracle. Let your mind produce its simulation of a miracle. It's really funny. And your mind is going to throw up some... I don't know what it is. Water's parting, walking through a wall. I don't know. Right now I'm seeing like a bunch of fucking rainbows and it kind of like, I don't know, some kind of like levitation phenomena or something. Who knows what ridiculous thing your mind's gonna like come up with to try to in some way or another, simulate the progenitive, creative... Well, the ultimate miracle would be personal. So going back to the I am, the ultimate miracle would be the splitting. That's what we were talking about watching that Rogers thing. The splitting. What the fuck? It's all one thing. So the splitting is caused by what? So that's all I'm really interested in. It's so fun to get there too. And it's so fun to play around with that. One of the playing around with it is just to jump in with it. Is the self looking, okay, so there's only you. So then you're going to look at yourself. So automatically you're split. Yep. Then suddenly without your participation, the whole thing, each thing splits a fucking billion times because there's no time. Yeah. Into the whole thing we're looking at right now. Yeah. Yeah. But how does that, what the fuck? How does that, that means that there's a... There's a internested fucking reality happening that can do that that was previously created. What the fuck? What does that mean? So the whole thing is mental is the main thing we all agree on. Well, that's your mind. Yeah, for sure. Well, it's a mental construct. That's the mind. And the path life is the emotion. That's when suddenly something's happening. When I was being, the story I'm going to tell you about the time since the time bomb miracle. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. And it completely goes along with what we're talking about here. Completely. Because my teacher, Ragu Marcus, he's my teacher. And so he's so funny because like when he called me, he called me. What's funny about him is he'll always call inevitably right before there's something I'm desperately trying to avoid doing or in a really critical moment. He always calls right before. You're implying a psychic connection, right? Oh, for sure. But he won't admit that. If he was listening now... Maybe you could be back engineering meaning into the whole thing. This is, I'll give you an example of my teacher. So he called me yesterday, Ragu. And I answered and I go, oh, my teacher. And he goes, fuck you. Of course he said that or he's a dick. Yeah. Of course he says that. But he means it. Of course he means it. Because that's fucking retarded to say that. Yeah, yeah. But he is. And it's not retarded and it's real. And it's an ancient pattern and it's real. And Martin, I see you cringing. I cringe. I see you cringing. But I... Oh, we had this argument with Aaron and with Penn. This is our big disagreement. And we're going to hit it. And I love it. My favorite... You know, I had someone on recently who I disagreed with. And it was a real great moment of relief, I think, for him. When he realized how much I love the disagreement. You know, it's so great. Because it's like, who wants to agree, you know? And also... It's so right. And it's just like, fuck, man, I'm sorry. It's like... It's good to take the agreement and disagreement and make music of it. Yeah. Well, this is... That's the whole thing. Well, this gets us back to the thing we were talking about, which is like the... We're getting to the binary that's for matter and to matter, the dialectic or whatever, the tension creating the whole explosion. Oh, yeah. That's what I meant to... Because the moment they agree, we've now... We're going to fall into it ourselves. And we go back to being the... What's it called? A monad or the unified thing. And it's like, what's the fun of that? Like, we need some fucking division here, baby. It's a blast. But so... We need conflict to have meaning. We need conflict to have meaning. So this guy... Say that again. What? We need conflict to have meaning. Contradiction. So I'm writing with Ragu who has surprised me because I'm at this retreat. My mom has died recently. I'm sorry many of you have heard this story before. My mom has died recently. I am fucking devastated. Like I'm depressed. I'm wrecked. I'm just in all of the... All those places that you go to... Were you able to be there when she died? No. So that was the pain? No, that was not the pain. The pain, the idea of being next to her when she dies, I wish I had been. That is not where the pain comes from. The pain comes from more of a... Donning realization of how I could have been a better servant to her in her last... That's rough. Yeah, it is. It is, it is, it is. And what a great teacher she was to me. And that's one of the ways she taught me. And it's when it was a hard teaching. And I don't think she would have chosen to teach me in that way. But she did. And I'm so grateful to her for it. Now this is... What was her name? Danine. Danine, great name. Yes. Yes. And so I was all wrecked. And so I met this... I'd been laying in bed completely paralyzed with depression. Like I was in the kind of depression where you're like considering wetting the bed. You know what I mean? Where you're like rather than get up to piss, you're like, you know, I'll just lay in my own... I'll just lay in my own piss. Just like just paralyzed. And so the phone rings. And I guess luckily the phone is near me. And I'd been in a depression sleep. So the phone is ringing me out of a depression sleep. And I answer it, it's Ragu. And he's saying to me, Duncan, come to the retreat in Hawaii. Because he knew my mom had died. He's like, Duncan, come to the retreat. And I'm like, I don't... I'm literally mumbling. I'm like, I don't know. I can't. I don't know. And he's like, Duncan, I want you to get out of bed. Nice. And go to the computer. Nice. And buy a plane ticket. Nice. And come to the retreat. Oh my god, perfect. So he... And I did. I remember getting out of... Oh, fucking great. I'm in my underwear. I'm sitting in... You know what, that's what a teacher is. Not only other bullshit. That's what... That's great. That's what it looks like. So like, I'm sitting in my underwear. And I'm in front of my computer. And I'm buying this plane ticket to Hawaii to go to this retreat. It's nothing but enlightenment. It's about buying the plane ticket. Yes. It's about getting to the fucking gym. Yes, that's right. Yeah. You just got to get to the gym. That's right. Once you're at the gym, you're set. Like, you just got to get there. That's the main thing. And that's what a teacher will do is get you to the gym. That's all they can do. So like, so the long and short of it is, when you're talking about this mind stuff, the way your mind starts contemplating, like, where did it come from? And what before that? And then where was the thing? And then the... So when... The pen was making fun of us for doing it. Yeah. Yes. But it's... Make... And it's very... He was right. It's very make funnable. But by the way, it's like, make fun of me for playing Overwatch. Make fun of me for playing Hearthstone. Make fun of me for whatever you want to make fun of. Like, make fun of me for whatever, throwing salt over my shoulder, whatever it's a blast to contemplate. But so I'm riding... So at this retreat when I got to meet Ram Dass at his house, Raghu, they were doing... There's some tour happening, whether they're going around Hawaii, to spiritual parts of Hawaii. And it's like, really, I'm just not interested. But Raghu came up to me, he's like, hey, don't go with them today. I want to... We're going to go somewhere today. And so I'm riding in the car with Raghu, and he's like, we're going to go to Ram Dass's house now. And I want you to meet Ram Dass. And so now, that's when like the... For me, that's the floor... That's like the floor is dropped. There's no more floor. You're like, now, like, what the fuck is happening now? And so we're riding there. And so I'm trying to make small talk. I'm trying to deal with what I know is about to happen, which is that I'm about to get healed. And I'm trying to deal with it. And I'm trying to make sense of what I'm dealing with. This is such an alien series of thoughts from the way I think. It's the mind. So the mind is going... This is Richard Alpert? This is Richard Alpert. So the series of thoughts is so alien to anything that I think it's hard for me to understand. Oh, yeah. Well, because the thing about it is, is your mind and your heart, they're wonderful things. But these two things, the mind and the heart, they're two things. And I think that they're all functioning holistically, and they're all there. But just let your mind... I mean, God Jesus, thank God. Thank God that the mind tries to interpret love. Tell me the rest of the story, because then I want to get back to that moment, though, about Richard Alpert and about what it's like to be him. Well, so with Ra-Goo... What's like to be him? With Ra-Goo, as I'm writing to go see Ram Dass, and I'm yapping. And when I'm talking about Neem Karoli, Baba the Guru, and I'm saying, was he... Do you think he was outside of time? Was he... Do you think he was? Does he know this is happening now? Did he know all things are happening? Is he omniscient? Was he aware of this? Was he aware of that? And I'm looking at Ra-Goo. And Ra-Goo says to me, he goes... And I can't imitate him, because he's the coolest person ever. But he says, he goes, I don't know. Perfect. And then he says... I like him. And then he says, he says, I don't know. And he says, but let me tell you this. We work on ourselves so that we can help the people closest to us. Oh, that's the best thing ever to say. Yeah. Say it again? We work on ourselves so we can help the people closest to us. That's the best thing ever to say. That's it. And that's what Neem Karoli Baba said. And so... I don't know what you're talking about. That's what Ram Dass' Guru said. And that's the essence of the thing. And so we get to fucking Ram Dass' house. And this is the time bomb thing that I wanted to talk about, the time bomb miracle thing. And so I get to have what is called darshan. And this will make you cringe. This is definitely an Olsen cringe time. So cringe through it. Thanks for humoring me about it. I'm not. That makes me feel like you think I'm patronizing you or something. No, no, no. But we're equal beings. And so we have a different way to get to this place. Yes. And we both think each other's way is funny. Okay, great, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, I mean, I mean, to like... To get... I do think you're funny. And I do... Well, likewise, of course. Yeah. And I think the way with it... My favorite... This is what I love about these Ram Dass' retreats. Yeah. Is because what they do on purpose is they get these hardcore Zen Buddhists. Like the one coming up is with Roshi Joan Halifax, who's like a hardcore Zen Buddhist. These are not people who are theistic. To call a Zen Buddhist theist, ask as... The next time you get to be around a Zen Buddhist, ask them about God. I never assumed that. Yeah, and because in... Zen's in the moment. Yeah, and they're theism in Zen. It's not an analytical thing. Right. So, but what's really cool about these retreats is they will take that, and then they will pair it with Bhakti. Oh, shoot. So they push the two things together... Of course. And then let's just see what happens. And that kind of... That kind of the way those two things mix and bounce off of each other... Does they calculate which mix makes the most money? That's so very funny. Well, they figured it out. It's one third. It's one... Oh, I see. I'll give you the exact amount. I'll give you the exact... So, right. So, that's great. Obviously, I'm just making a joke that has nothing to do with reality. No, let's fucking hit that point, though. That's no relation to reality. No, no, no. Let's hit that point, though, because I think that that's... Fuck no. I want it... Whoa, you don't want to go into there? I want to go into that one. Obviously, it's a joke. Well, no, but I think that... No, but I think it's more... Oh, just a joke. Yeah. Okay. But I think to get into that... Don't... I'm being sincere with you about that. Many people... In other words, of course, the reality of trying to find oneness with everything and get back to the core is the only thing that matters. But it's funny... How do we hang money off of it? Yeah, it's funny about making money. That's what's super funny. So one... Me and my friend, Emil, have had this conversation many times, which is... Anybody named Emil, I love. Oh, you would love Emil so much. But me and Emil have had this conversation many times. And one of the things we like to talk about, and I don't think we've acted it out... What? But one of the things we like to talk about is Alan Watts negotiating a speaking fee. That's the greatest bit ever. Oh, my God. While he's drinking. Yeah. Hammered Alan Watts trying to... Like, getting pissed? He's like, you know. You know what I make. And you offered me $3,500. Do I get a percentage of the bar tax? All you got to do is back engineer that to Buddha. Well, no. Right, right. So the way we back engineer it is instead of trying to ignore it or trying to treat it like some kind of molesting uncle or something, you know what I mean? Instead of like trying to like pretend it's not there, it's much better to pull it completely into the light. And look at it. And so the way it's described, this is the marketplace. And it's like, when you go to work creating your art, you get paid, man. You get paid. And I get paid. And people get paid. We make money. This is called the marketplace. So we're in the marketplace and we make money. It's crazy. I don't understand it. Well, it's how it works right now and not just the way things are. Are we the way things are right now is that people do certain patterns of movement or basically people put certain types of energy out into the world. And that energy gets converted right now into digital numbers. And that number is called currency. And that currency is what we call money. And that or I don't remember who called it. Maybe it was Bill Hicks or someone called it freedom tickets. And so basically, so then what ends up happening is like we begin to have this sort of reservoir of potential energy that is all imaginary that we can then use to buy houses. All imaginary. Well, I mean, in the sense that it's like it exists in a kind of liminal potential. When the meteor hits, the stock market means nothing. You know, paper currency means nothing. It's a thing that's existing within an agreed upon game that's very complex that humans are playing. But it's real. And so on one level of reality, this is happening. And on one level of reality, what is happening is that there is an exchange that is being symbolized with money. And there's no fucking way around it right now. It is, it is. Now you can, as much as you want, be as altruistic as you want. You can give all your money. You can give it all away. And let me give you a recommendation, Martin. And this is the whole reason I had you. We should have given my money too. Me! Okay. The reason I had you over here is because I want to talk to you about... Martin, I want to talk to you about planting seeds of faith in the garden of your heart. And I tell you, if you plant right now, Martin, if you plant it, if you venmo me $30,000, I promise. So one of the basic comedy shapes is cheapening of the profound, right? That's one of the funniest. Absolutely, yeah. Sure. And the reversal too. Yeah. Making profound the cheap. Yeah. Blasphemy. Yeah. Well, blasphemy is what? Well, I think if we're going to... Blasphemy is a political thing. I think many people would consider making the profound cheap to be a form of blasphemy. I think there's many people who... Oh, of course. You know what I mean? There's many people who, if we play around with that kind of alchemy, one of the great results of that... One of the reactions that happens in the laboratory of that kind of alchemy is offense. And so people are like, how dare you? How dare you? And you break down offense and offense is basically just conflict, which is what we need. Absolutely. Or it's resistance, isn't it? It must be resistance. Explain that better. So if I'm offended, I'm resisting something. Totally. So it's like... In one of the things with... Oh, yeah. So with the Ramdas people in particular, Ragu in particular, as a comedian, one of the many things that I have done throughout the years of knowing them is I have tried in many ways to offend them. I have said the most offensive things to them that I could... You have not. You fucking did. Oh, oh. You have not. Are you kidding? I'll say it now. I could say it now. Let me hear it. Oh, you guys are living the glory days. This is what I'd say. I was like, oh, please. You guys were like, high as a kite. You ran into some... You ran into... What was your motivation for taking this tact? If I can offend them, it's not real. If... Please explain better. This is really interesting. If I can offend them, if Ragu or Ramdas or any of them call me a blasphemer. They'll never do that, you fucking nut. No, man. I mean, I could tell, though. If like, you know what I'm saying? Like, what I'm saying is, what do you mean? Explain better. If I can offend these people... You can't offend people who don't have a... If you're a supposedly a teacher of oneness, that's all we're talking about, a teacher of how to fucking not to get back to the... To merge. There's no way you could be offended. But if you can be, then you're not a teacher and I got to get the fuck out of there. Oh, so of course that's your point, so I didn't understand your point. My point is testing the thing. I see. Because my feeling was... I stand corrected now I get you. That's what I was doing. My feeling with them was if I offend these people, if I offend them... Because you're a fucking rebel, dude. Well, I don't know, but my feeling was if I... If there's a sense around these people that there's forbidden zones... Your comedy is so fucking... Fuck you, that's... Thank you. Thank you, Martin. It's for real. So it's like the Andy Kaufman type thing. That's just like a big fucking genre, you know? My sense with them was though, if there is like going to be a place here that is the forbidden zone, you know what I mean? For real, forbidden zone. Then... They're fake. Yeah, then we have a problem. And which is okay, which is okay, because by the way, I don't think any of them necessarily, if you were to go to any of them and say, hey man, you know, you're fake. I don't think... They say, yo, I am fake, and let's analyze how I am fake. They would be like... I think they would be like, yeah, on one level for sure. Of course they would. For sure. For sure. Like, you know the story of like Ram Dass in the porn theater, right? I don't know what you're talking about. So you know, Ram Dass is gay, and so... I don't know anything about this. So Richard Alpert... I didn't know he's gay. I don't know anything about it. Be here now. You know the book Be Here Now. Maybe. Hippie Bible. Oh, shit. I don't think I know anything about it. Oh, shit. Okay, okay. I'm a fucking dummy. Richard Alpert falls in with Timothy Leary at Harvard. They're doing shit tons of acid. I know all about that. They become Harvard apostates. They become like, you know... I know all about this. They become infamous. Leary... Who wrote the book Be Here Now? Ram Dass. Okay. But this is actually more of like a collaboration between artists taking things he said during lectures and turning it visual. But what happened is Alpert goes to India with LSD created personally... He brought it back for Leary? No, no, no. Alpert, after... Leary and Alpert, they don't have a split, but Leary is a scientist. Leary is a materialist. Who I knew. Who you knew. And he was a scientific materialist. He would be talking to me about fucking t-shirts. Like selling them? How'd he be talking with his... I'm there with him and his manager sitting at a picnic table and they'd be talking about t-shirts. Right. Well, no, I can remember... It sucks so bad. Listen, man, the reason... Eric Gardner, his manager. The reason I'm not gonna follow this rabbit hole down... No, no, no, forget that. Because I know Zach and I love Zach and I don't... No, no, Leary was a gentleman to me and was fucking great to me. I just meant that I was disillusioned because I had thought that there was other thing happening and there wasn't. Well, okay. Well, that's... Okay, so... That was me, not Tim. Right. And that's also... That was on me, not on Tim. Well, that's because you're... On one level, Martin, you're completely right. You understand. Like, on one level, like, you're completely absolutely right. Because on one level, what we're dealing with is like the human, egoic, monopoly level of human interaction. And on one level, man, it's a bunch of fucking hooey. T-shirts. It's a bunch, it's a big fucking pile of t-shirts with logos on them and it's a... And people mailing them out. And that's called the marketplace. And that's one of the ways that the universe, unfortunately... By the way, Zach? Zach Leary. Your dad was a total gentleman to me and I fucking loved the dude. And I know you know... I know, but the point is on one level... I'm just telling you the truth. So that was something I wanted to say. I am deeply... Because I have a son and so I know what it's like when you hear things, people will say things fully. I'm deeply indebted to Tim Leary and we all are. And I have many stories I can tell you. Alan Watts had to negotiate fucking speaking engagement deals and that's the marketplace and on one level that's fucking real. Because that's where we're at. And that's the way it works. We have not gotten to the point where we can like vibrate and gold appears around it. There's ticket sales, there's venues, there's insurance, there's bars, there's cars, there's highways, there's intersecting connection points that are made of concrete. Say insurance again. There's insurance. There's fucking like liability insurance. We've got to get health insurance. We've got to deal with the show fucking contracts. This is just the world that we're in right now. So... Oh, now we're rolling now. So yeah, we had to get booze. So we manipulated the flow. We took up... No, we didn't. Well, this is the... Interrupted. The next thing that happens is the way. Have you ever heard that before? No. I think it's called vagriana, but it's the concept that the next thing that happens is the way. So just whatever's happening is basically... It's not what's happening now. It's always what's happening. No, it's this, is it. Of course. So when we're... Right, it's an of course kind of thing, but a lot of people think that the thing that's happening now is like we got to get out of it. Which is also part of the way. It's called the... I think it's called... Anyway, it's a different conversation. So the marketplace. So on one level... We're talking about t-shirts. T-shirts. On one level, we got t-shirts. On one level of the bardo, we got fucking t-shirts. We got door deals. We got profit margins. We have commodification. Right? One of the things I love about Burning Man is that it's a renaissance fair for pure communism. Yeah, that's right. Because when you go there, it's called a gifting economy, which means that you can buy ice and coffee there and that's it. And then when everything else, it's like you either bring your own shit or it gets given to you. And sure as shit, it gets given to you. And it gets given to you in ways you could never even expect and you start learning about this beautiful circuitry in the universe that just like in the way that the primacy of the sort of original all-ming call of love or the infantile cry of the thing that made the Big Bang happen is then preceded by all religions and languages, etc., you realize in the same way capitalism is a secondary reaction to a kind of circuitry of innetry. You know what you're doing now? This whole thing of you're personalizing things that are generally demonized. And that's what beauty is. That's what that's what we want to do. Yeah. We want to personalize things that are demonized and make it so that there's no fucking demon, dude. It's all us. So the whole thing is all fake. Well, let's personalize the demon. I mean, the thing is like with these poor demons. You know, you want to talk about like, you want to talk about real fucking bigotry. What do you mean? I'm saying like if like we lived in a world where demons walked the earth. Yeah, which we do. Well, no, I'm saying like, but if like, I'm talking about the symbolic demon. Okay, sure. Horns, tails, mischievous, trickster, creatures. Yeah. The fucking kind of cool. It's a human. Now we've got a real problem here because like, do they get to vote? And they have two things that need a dentist. Maybe the other specific demon dentists. Yeah, we're dealing with like, not aside from all the demon like health issues, like we're just talking about a basic caste system where now we've taken demons and now, oh, these demons, they're rotten. Let's ex these fucking exorcists, man. They're going around driving demons out of people in the same way that fucking like the Trump boy is driving like tenants out of his fucking housing projects. Like, it's like, we're driving demons out of people. It's like, let them live there. What's the deal? That's the key. Yeah, like, why are we so demon? Why are we so demon phobic? And like, the thing is like, what is this demon that we're talking about? And let's run into like, God, let, let. So what is the demons? So the demon is yourself, obviously. So then the idea is to try to what? To purify yourself? What is that? No, that's considered an aggression against the self. So the moment we start getting into the thing of like. There's only yourself. But when we start getting into the thing of like, you know what I'm going to do? What? Purify myself. Basically, you're telling the self that you are right now. Fuck you. You're like, you're dirty. I'm a dirty little. No, but it's okay. You could say the wrong thing or you could say anything to anybody. Yes. So it doesn't matter. You could tell yourself you're an idiot and I'm an idiot saying that to you. Say, call yourself whatever the thing is that you want. But the moment that we're resisting what is the thing that is right now. That's where the truth comes in about the stuff that isn't what, isn't worked through. Help me with this. Well, I just think it's the resistance is what? What causes the resistance? What we're, I don't. It'll be something that's not worked through. I have to like go from the full outside. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. In on this one. Right. So like I have to start with a premise. Yeah. That let's argue about. Gotcha. Gotcha. So I'm going to start with a premise. Okay. Everything's perfect. So that very premise, of course, would be wrong. Well, let me ask you this. Would it be perfectly wrong? There you go. And it's infinitely subtle. Yeah. But if it's, because the thing is like, like if we find the thing that's wrong, like tell me something that's wrong. Like we're just, I don't mean like, just tell me a thing that's just basically wrong. I don't exist. Okay. So it would be the ultimate. Okay. So you don't exist. Fuck. Of course you exist. So that would be the number one. Okay. Okay. So you, so I mean the statement I don't exist is wrong. Okay. Now, is that perfectly wrong? Yes, it is. Okay. It's fucking perfect. So now you were dealing with perfection again. So now we're in this problem because it's like, the thing is like, even in, we have perfect wrong. So, so the, so the challenge actually would be to find the imperfection. Because like, because now if we, let's find some imperfection, let's find some imperfect imperfection. And the more we analyze the imperfection, all that we're going to find is perfect imperfection. Yeah. That's one of my favorite topics, by the way. It is. It is? Yeah. Cause that's where comedy comes from. From what? From perfect imperfection. Yeah. It's the juxtaposition. Yeah. So, and it's all a game and it's all just sort of thoughts that fuck with each other. So. It's called the lila. Have you heard that term? No. That's one of the terms is lila. Tell me about it. It's the play of God. So it's like, yeah, it's just. One of my best friends, girlfriend is lila, and she just went through this major stem cell thing, which changed her life. So. What was it? She had pain because she was in an accident when she was a child. And stem cell blood, her own blood was in a, was put back inside of her. And it's, the whole point is that the, it then can regenerate and the pain is lessening. So she's one of the first. Yeah. It's a, it's a wave. Yeah. She's the beginning of this new wave of healing that's happening where we lila lila. Yeah. Lila. So yeah. So that's the play and that, and, and, and it's a, it's like, and it's really amusing. And it's like infinitely entertaining. It's the source of all stories. And it's, and, and, and so it's just a blast. And to, to find yourself on either side of the predicament. Oh, are you the perfect one? Oh boy. I hope you are. Cause then if you're perfect and like that, what's more fun than to be around a perfect thing? Cause then that's when the comedians appear. You know what I mean? Because it's like, then, then it's just going to get deconstructed and broken apart. And, and within that never ending sort of dissolution and resolution, or I just read it as a folding together and folding apart in, in, in that kind of like undulating respiratory process of creation, we find ourselves. Yeah. Right. And, and, and, and where the, the big, you know, one of the great disagreements and a perpetual and eternal disagreements that pops up is heaven or hell and, and, and, and, and, and perfection or imperfection. And the way, the way what I fall onto is perfection. I'm theistic. What do you mean you fall into perfection? That's obviously evil. What are you fucking talking about? Well, I mean, you would say it's evil. Yes, of course I would. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause it is. I don't mean I'm perfect. No, no, no, I don't mean you. I mean, but what I mean is that my sense. I'm sorry. No, please don't apologize. Perfection is the idea of what is, that's what, that's why everything's fucking bad, because the concept of perfection is, is not what's good. I don't mean to go back to something I already talked about. Oh. But when you say it's bad, is it perfectly bad? It's perfectly bad. You got to deal with it, man. Got to totally deal with it. So that's the problem is like, we got to deal with it. What I said was retarded. Well, and it was perfectly retarded. And, and so, so, so, so that's what we run into here. And, and, and so what you end up finding. This is like what Penn said that we're idiots. Yeah. We were saying the same kind of argument. He said, dude, you're saying the same thing from opposite sides. Shut up. Yes. Yes. And there's always inevitably someone will say that. We were having too much fun. Rightfully. No, we're, to us, we're having fun. To us, not to him. But I've been sitting around many a fire and I've looked, and I've been in the midst of like a deep psychedelic influence conversation with someone who I feel like, my God, we've become the primordial pillars of the universe slamming against each other. And I've looked, I've looked over and the look on people's faces is like, get me the fuck out of here. Like they would, they would, they wanted, they would like it if an accidental nuclear bomb. I've experienced that so many times. Anything, anything other than the listen to these idiots. That's what Penn was feeling. The poor guy. No. And he was so soulful and nice and, but hard edged in stopping us. Thank God. Yeah. For them. It was good. Thank God for them. And because like, because within that dynamic is the lila, within the dynamic is the game. And within the dynamic is the beautiful sort of way the thing, the thing bounces and bounces and like is solidified and then, and liquefied and solidified and liquefied. And, you know, one could say in the solidification and liquefied process, we're dealing with absolute absurdity and what could be defined as the kind of inescapable fundamental health state. One could say that within this, there is only meaninglessness and we are, and we are dealing with a, you know what, there's no way we could go there though. Once you're past a certain point, you can't go back. So once unless you go have mental illness and you are unable to go back. So once you've encompassed that and you can, okay, we're going to freeze right in this divisive moment. That divisive moment is funny. Yeah. So there's no way you can go back to thinking that it's not funny. All right. I mean, we're, now what is a chain, it's a chain reaction of some sort happening and it's like, it's like a hot, well, it's just looking down. How do you say that? Looking down. Well, it's like a perspective from above. Well, I mean, yeah. And then, oh, great. Now we're above. It was looking down on us, right? And so you end up in this like problematic thing. And, you know, the encapsulation of it for me, when I really, what really freaked me out was like, I had, it was on acid and I had this idea of like, fuck man, what would happen if like I suddenly came to and I was everything, but there was no differentiating anything. And it was, and whatever. Like it was initially. There was just no one to say like. I thought this thought so many times. I just came to. So now, and I was thinking like, I think my reaction to that moment of coming to, would be to be like, fuck yeah. Yes. It's a big bang. Yeah. Yeah. And then I think that the, within every single person, the thing that in Buddhism is called fundamental dissatisfaction is an ember of that initial nervous breakdown the universe had upon coming into being. And now we're all dealing with it as individuals that have within us this alchemical laboratory that has at the core of the laboratory, this, this fluttering of impossibility that can produce so much suffering and horror. But yet there appears to be the potential somehow that just maybe because there was the coming tooness that happened from the nothingness to the somethingness, which is original novelty and impossibility. I like the coming tooness. Yeah. Novelty and original novelty and impossible novelty. What it means is that because that happened, therefore there could be the potential for another thing like that of equal import to happen. That is subsequent to that thing. Yes. Yeah. The distillation of this down is to sympathy with all things. Yes. And so the idea of all of these viewpoints and so on, which is fucking, luckily we're in comedy. Yeah, thank God. Luckily, what the hell? Yeah, thank God. So there's something that's kind of, it's going to be an ultimate thing where comedy is just juxtaposition, two things, juxtaposition and self-awareness. Yes. So the whole nature of this conversation is amplified because we were in the, because we work in that field. Yes, that's right. You know, and we love each other's work. Yes, that's right. That's right. Yes, and we disagree. Yes, we disagree. And we both love the disagree. There's no, there's no creativity happening without disagreement. But I love our disagreement. Like our disagreement is so primary. And I love it. Like, I would, in fact, if at some point we began to agree, I would suck. I would be so bummed. It would be a sad moment. And like, and so, and I can remember this wonderful moment with like sitting with Ram Dass and this day I was telling you about. Tell me about my cringing right now. What? Tell me about my cringing right now. Well, so the cringing thing, I'll tell you about this day that happened where I got taken to this guy's house, Albert's house, Ram Dass's house, this teacher, this amazing person. And so I'm sitting at the dinner table with this guy who I have, and he, this is not fair to him to do, but a person, I have placed him in a very special nook. And, and he wouldn't. I mean, when I. That's why I said the cringing thing earlier. I was referring to this. Yeah, he does. This is not his problem. It's my problem. Yeah. So, but I'm sitting around the table with this Roshi, Joan Halifax, who's this like Zen Buddhist. The greatest name ever. And she's been friends with Albert from, she was friends with Ram Dass when he was Albert, and they have a fundamental disagreement. Which is? Which is that Ram Dass is theistic. He believes in the guru. He believes in God. He believes in love. Guru isn't theistic. What the fuck? Oh, please. The good. Come on. Okay. Okay. This is exactly, exactly, exactly. Theistic means total freedom. There's no guru. Theistic. Theistic means total freedom. That means it's all one thing. Okay. So, okay, this thing that you're saying is the guru. So, okay, okay, but aside from all that, I'm not going to get into that. I am ignorant about this. So, I totally acknowledge. Not me. I know everything. No, no, no. I mean, I am ignorant about this. But I am ignorant. We are both ignorant. Because we are using words. Think of us. I'm saying I'm laughing at, because I'm going a step to the left or to the right about the concepts. Well, I want to focus on the beauty of the disagreement. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And how it got symbolized at this dinner table where we have this zen teacher. And we have Ram Dass, who is a heart teacher. And so, at one point during this conversation we're having, Ram Dass says, this is my fantasy. He says, this is my fantasy. And Roshi Joan Halifax, I don't think she hit the table with her hand, but it was something like that where she goes, finally, after all these years, you admit it. Really? Yeah. And they all laughed. But what's the hold? But they howled because that conversation, that back and forth between them, that's been going on since the 60s. The shape was primeval. Yes. And it's been going on since the 60s. And they love the game. And the game, they love it. And no one is at any moment. So that's like what we're doing. Exactly. And it's joy. It's joy. And it's where it gets weird is the moment any one person is like, but don't say that. Oh, wait, not that thing. No, you didn't say that. Oh, well, now you've gone too far. And now once that starts happening, we run into all kinds of like, this is where we start running into like, this is where we run into the calcification thing that becomes a kind of like dogma and religion. So I guess the main thing would be like the idea of the teacher and the pupil. Like, of course, that's a reality. There's something that gets calcified about that that I don't like. That doesn't mean it's not good or bad. I don't like it. Yeah. And so I try to analyze that, but I don't know. I'm sure there's a bunch of shit you don't like. Sure. Likewise. Likewise for me too. It's just, but the thing is, it's just one of the forms that emerges. Yeah. I'll tell you one. Because I'm so interested in role playing. And I'll tell you one thing Raghu doesn't like. And if he listens to this, I promise you one thing he does not like. I reckon. Is when I call him my teacher. I love the guy right away. It's like I love him. He doesn't like it. I love him. He doesn't like it. Fuck that. And I do it. And I'll keep doing it. You fucking jerk. Why do you do that, dude? Because it's funny. Because it is funny. And it's... Yeah, it is funny. And it's basically funny. And it's real. And I don't care. And he can like... Tell me about it being real. Because you know he's role playing. Oh. Dude. I mean, he's role playing? Yeah. Who else? I want you to tell me who isn't role playing. That's what I mean. Well, yeah. So there's nobody there. It's just a structure that you've imposed upon it. Well, yeah, I know. But I mean, like you saying that Raghu is role playing is a lot like telling me water's wet. It's like, it's like, I think it's like... No, I wasn't saying he was role playing. I was saying it's role playing. A relationship is role playing. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Absolutely no blaming or finger pointing whatsoever. I'm sorry, Martin. I got you. I got you. That's beautiful. Yeah, I love it. It's funny. That's where comedy comes from because it's about... What was I going to say? Well, it's about role playing. Yes. That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's the same oneness broken up into ridiculous juxtapositions or opposites. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, and I'll tell you, I mean, the I think probably for Raghu, it's like to find himself in the predicament of realizing that he has to deal with me being like his kind of student to him and just having to deal with that. That's the game I'm playing with him. It's puzzling because you're so opposite of that. It's so hard to understand. Oh, shit. Yeah. But it happened. Because you and I became friends pretty quick after you fucked with me. Remember? Yes. So I don't... It's hard to understand. You know, when I first met Ramdas, it was... Yeah. It was over Skype because you could sign up for these conversations. Get the fuck out. You could sign up with these conversations with him. And I was like, so like, so like, and he would like Skype into you. Get the fuck out. Didn't cost anything. There was no money. There was no... Because he's a guy, so it shouldn't cost anything. There's no asking for anything. The point is there wasn't even like, hey, here's a suggested donation. It was just like, you could sign up for this thing and this guy will talk to you. Wow. So like I signed up for... How cool was that? Oh, that's the coolest thing ever. So like I was there with Natasha Legerro in my shitty... Also, if you don't mind me saying, is the coolest chick ever? She's the fucking coolest chick. Has to be. Has to be. Like, yeah, like, like, mythic... Her like comedy, that juxtaposition was the funniest shit to me ever. Well, it's just mythical. Fuck yeah. I mean, and it's going to be remembered and it's amazing. And like, it's like being around that kind of comedic mind is like, just when you get a chance to be around that kind of comedic mind. It's just like... But to you together was like, what? Yeah. Well, we weren't... But we were friends who ended up like, you know, that was a friendship that was romantic and then was... But now we're friends eternally and it's the best thing ever. It was a super fucking cool mixture. It was a cool mixture and it still is a cool mixture. You know, it's like, she's one of my... She's like one of my probably best friends ever of all time. So, it's amazing to be around her. So, Natasha... Sorry to interrupt you. Natasha has come to my shitty apartment in Echo Park, where Ramdas is going to like, phone in. How would she dare when she did it? Yeah. So like, so suddenly Ramdas pops up on the Skype screen. And he's like, hello. And I'm like, how are you? And he goes... He goes, well, I'm in Hawaii. I'm doing great. And he laughed. And then I said to him, are you my guru? And he looks... You know, he's looking into the Skype camera and he goes, he really said this. He goes, sure. Let me finish. He goes, he goes, sure, I'm your guru. Now what? That's the ultimate moment. Yeah, yeah. Now. Perfect. Now what? Perfect. Okay, now we've gotten through that dumb part. Remember we started off talking about role playing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's so beautiful. That's great. Yeah, it was so beautiful. And it was such a like, sweet moment. And it was such a great way for him to diffuse this like, heavy thing that I was doing. And so to like, I think a good way to like, kind of wrap the podcast up or to like, tell you about this time, the miracle time bomb thing. Oh yeah. So like, the cool thing that happened at this cringe inducing moment for Martin Olsen at Ramdas' house, is that, so Ramdas like, I'm like... Wheelchair. Wheelchair is up to me in his living room. And I'm all heartbroken because my mom died. And he's looking at me. And he's smiling because he's like, he's cultivated this thing that he's love. He loves. And he's beaming at me. And I'm looking at him and of course I start crying. And I say to him, I wish my mom was here because she loved you. And he gets this big smile and he goes, she is here. Right? And so I'm so... Perfect. Yeah. So, you know, when we've lost someone, you know, and when we've lost someone... How sweet of him to say that. That was the perfect thing to say. Yeah. And so, we have this conversation. And the conversation is a really great conversation about getting out of your head and going into your heart. And it's real simple. Sure. And basically what he says to me is, you should move from your head into your heart. That's essentially it, you know? And then he did say, he said, we can help you do that. And that's real. And then we talked. And then after the conversation, so we had this conversation, now get ready to cringe. Ha ha ha! We call this darshan is the name for it. It's a... The word for it is that it's a meaningful, formal encounter with a being that's been doing a lifetime of work on themselves in a certain way and is playing the role, you could say. Sure. That's more... So, I'm sorry to be cynical about everything, except for playing the role. Don't... No, but this is an important thing. It's a beautiful thing for someone to take on this role. Yes. It is. Exactly right. I acknowledge that totally. So, within the context of darshan, everything someone is telling you is very formal and it's something that's very important. Thanks for being so nice to me about this, by the way. Oh, please, it's kidding! It's not a... It's kidding! Hi, you are kidding! It means a lot to me. I'm not kidding at all. Not even funny. Okay, well, listen. This is my... It's my favorite thing and I love you and I love this and all the contradictions. I love you too, likewise. And embarrassments with it that I acknowledge. Yes, exactly. And so, the time bomb thing was... Yes. So, he says to me, at the end of this darshan, he says, his cat jumps up on the couch and he looks at the cat and he looks at me and he says to me, oh, the cat sleeps on my chest at night. And I was like, whatever. I didn't say that to you. Oh, I thought you did. But I'm just kind of like, all right. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I guess the cat sleeps on your chest at night. You know what I mean? In the midst of this remarkable conversation I had with this being, it certainly isn't like... In my mind, it's not like something I'm going to put at the top of the things I think about that we talked about. Right. So, I'm telling my brother about this encounter with Ram Dass and I'm telling him every detail. Of course. And of course, as I'm telling him the detail, I say, and Jeff, and then he said the cat like sleeps on his chest at night and my brother, there's this pause. There's this long pause. And my brother goes, you don't remember, do you? Yeah. And I say, what do you mean? And he's like, well, that's what mom used to say about her cat. Like, she would say how Bill, the cat slept on her chest at night. Get the fuck out, holy shit. But that time bomb happened probably a week after the encounter with Ram Dass. Oh, my God. So, if had he in the moment done some weird, cheesy, clairvoyant thing and been like, no, actually, your mom is actually here with you right now thing, it wouldn't have been a goddamn thing. That's the most beautiful thing ever, dude. Time bomb. Yeah. And that's it. I love it. I love that story. I love that story. And we call that grace. Yeah, right. Because it's graceful, because it's like, it really isn't about doing some magic trick in that moment. It's that, and it wouldn't have really meant anything. It's time and space showing respect for something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's- Which is our goal. We all wish we could be that way. We're so disrespectful, dude. We're comedians, so it's a big fucking horrible thing. They were so disrespectful. We have to find that middle ground where we find the sympathy with all things and the opposite of what we do. Yeah.

And one thing I've learned over the years of doing this podcast is that if I'm having a hard time getting a podcast intro recorded, it's because there's something I'm afraid to talk about. And the way I deal with this is I will either sort of skirt around the issue. I'll do the ultra cop out, which is like, we got a great episode, no need for an intro, or I'll try to do some kind of like really psychedelic, funny, weird thing in the beginning, but all of these are usually attempts to procrastinate saying what's going on. And I think that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world, because sometimes it takes a little bit of time to really figure out what it is you're thinking or what it is that you're going through. And yet I always feel a kind of aching guilt when I'm not honest with you guys about what's happening, because over the years that I've been doing this thing, what I've learned is whenever I'm honest with you, usually the feedback I get is thanks for being so honest that helped a lot. And then you'll often give me little tips or advice or things for me to think about that encourage me to be more honest the next time. So I feel like I'm letting you down a little bit if I don't fully report in. So fuck it. Here's what's going on. I'm going to, I'm just going to say it. It's probably going to come out in some imperfect way. Of course, duh, but I'm just going to say it. And then we're going to dive into this hilariously weird episode with Johnny Pemberton. All right, here's the thing. Since that Chris Ryan episode, uh, I have been experimenting with, uh, non-monogamy polyamory. I've been seeing two wonderful beings who have a lot of experience being non-monogamous polyamorous, who just aren't monogamous people. And, uh, they've been teaching me in a lot of things about how to, how to, how to do it. And, um, man, it's really, there's a lot of things that keep coming to mind. One of them is the time I was hanging. Well, one of them is any time I've been hanging out with some of my friends who have given up monogamy and have judged those friends. So I think back to time, and I don't know which of them I can, I can name. So, um, I'm not going to name any of them, but, uh, I could just think of times that they've been talking to me about what they're going through. And I've secretly been judging them, thinking like, oh my God, really? You're okay with that? Like you're, it doesn't bother you that you're, it doesn't bother you that your girlfriend is like fucking some dude somewhere that doesn't eat you alive, man. That doesn't drive you up the fucking wall. And, um, of course, I wouldn't say that. Or if I did say it, I would probably be a little less brutal about it. I would say something like, man, well, I'd say the truth, which is like, wow, that'd really fucking bother me, man. That would drive me crazy. I don't think I'd be able to sleep at night knowing that was happening. And then I would think to myself, well, they're, they're being weak. That's not very masculine is what I would think. And, um, that's, it's, it's all insanity. It's all, it was just crazy, crazy, insecure judgment, all stemming from, I think, uh, a kind of massive flaw in my idea, ideas of what intimate love is supposed to look like. And I think a lot of those ideas got implanted in my head, um, through in a lot of different ways. And I think it's a real brutal burden to carry around that this insane idea that love looks like a person being controlled by your expectations and that love looks like a person giving up intimate connections to half the species so that they can be with you and that love looks like a person cutting off all the potential sweetness they could experience from different lovers than you. And, but I think I really believe that for a long time. And I think because of that belief, I probably caused a lot of people, including myself, a lot of heartache and pain, people who had to put up with my jealousy and, and, and weirdness and attempts to manipulate and control all because I just wanted to like be the most important thing in their life out of a kind of narcissistic, egoic need to be the center of their universe or something like that. I mean, it's not so cut and dry. Like if you've ever gone through anything like that before, you know, it's not like cutting, it's not like you're waking up in the morning thinking, how can I make myself the center of this person's universe? How can I prevent this person from, uh, experiencing happiness with another person other than me? How can I make sure that this person is, um, definitely not going to pursue anything that looks remotely like something more than a basic platonic friendship with other people in their, in their life. You don't think about it like that. It's, it's almost instinctual. It's like some low level, like adjusting of their rules, producing rules and questions and there are interrogations. There will be interrogations. There will be questions. Their phone will buzz and you'll look at it. You'll try to see the, the text that pops up on the screen. Just really embarrassing stuff like that. And, and that's the person that I have become in many relationships. And I'm really sorry that I was that person. And now that I'm learning about this other way of doing love and realizing that the thing I was most terrified of is in fact, the thing I should have been like headed towards, um, I'm having a similar experience to somebody who's like sobering up after a two decade alcoholic blackout where I'm looking back and thinking, my fucking God, what was I thinking? Why was I acting like that? Who was I? Why would I be so jealous? Why would I be so embarrassing? Why would I be so controlling? Why was I, why was I like that? So that's kind of where I'm at. I mean, it sounds like I feel ashamed or guilty. It's, it's not so much that as much as a sense of regret. A feeling of like, fuck man. Like there were a lot of times where I was like talking to people, you know, someone who's like completely public about his Aubrey Marcus. There are times when I was talking to Aubrey and he was like laying it down for me in this really like cool, honest, vulnerable way. And I like, and every single one of those moments, like there was a chance for me to sort for something to click into place and it didn't. It took like, it took a, it took a lot of luck and it took like crossing paths with some pretty advanced beings who were able to sort of literally like move energy through me so that I could kind of let go of the rotten burden of being a sex cop. You don't want to be a sex cop, man. If you're going to be a sex cop, the kind of sex cop you want to be is the kind of sex cop that shows up at parties and strips for people, but you don't want to be a sex cop who is monitoring every single indication emanating from your partner for any sign that they might be finding another man or woman attractive or that they might be pursuing some kind of intimate trist with someone other than you, you don't want to be that person and man, I've walked that beat for the last two decades and it is a grim beat to walk and it leads to no joy and it leads to no happiness and it leads to nothing more than a general feeling of bitterness. So what's happening to me right now, and I think this is going to be the intro I'm going to use, is I'm, I feel like I've sort of come under the tutelage of some pretty cool people who have been showing me a completely new way of experiencing intimacy that I had always secretly reviled and judged, enrolled my eyes at and thought to myself that doesn't work, which is truly one of the most hilarious things for a serial monogamist who's been in many, many long-term relationships to say non-monogamy doesn't work. It's like somebody who's been in like 30 car crashes saying motorcycles are dangerous, really, really, really ridiculous. But the hesitation I'm feeling is also, I know that when I find something really cool, I get starry eyed over it and then, and then, and then get a naive idea that this is going to be some utopian way of existence and that this will be a turbulence-free modality or something, which is why I hesitate. So if in the next few weeks or months, as you hear this, what thing that I'm figuring out evolve over the course of this podcast, please forgive me. If suddenly at some point I'm like, that was fucked. That was wrong. I was wrong. It's a mess. There's nothing more horrible than having the experience of love for more than one person. God, why would you ever want that? Why would you ever want to experience sweetness and love with many, many people who have spent a long time cultivating their ability to experience joy for you, even if that joy isn't related to them? I don't think it's going to happen, but who knows, man? I don't know. But for me, this podcast has been a combination of things. It's a way for me to sort of work shit out in my own head. It's a way for me to send signals out to you, the universe, and get signals back that help me sort of work through my own shit. And thank you for that so much. And, uh, and it's my job. And it seems like it's, it has something very, it has something in common with one of the fundamental pillars of non monogamy, which is something Chris Ryan has talked about and, uh, the people who I have been with have sort of taught me, which is honesty. Like it's, it's the more honest you can be with yourself and the more honest you can be with your lovers and your friends, even when it doesn't feel good to be honest, the better your life becomes. And, uh, this is an experiment that has worked for me. The experiment of monogamy has not worked that well. Or I guess you could say it has worked in the sense that it has gotten me to the point where I am now really aware of how important truth and honesty is when it comes to intimate relationships and any relationship for that matter. And so that's where I'm at. And that's, I did it. That's the intro, 12 minutes. I had to get it off my chest. That's God. You should have, I've been like, all these fucking, I've tried like multiple stupid intros over and over and over again, just desperately trying to avoid saying, man, I've been doing this thing and I met these people and they're teaching me the stuff about polyamory and it's crazy and beautiful. And it's like filling my heart with joy and it's making me feel so light and good. And I've been grinning from ear to ear and I feel really good right now. But, um, uh, instead I've been like trying to do it. It's just like rants about how I should be allowed to heat my hot tub more than 104 degrees, which by the way, I fucking should. It's insane that the federal government is dictating a limit on how hot we can make our hot tubs, but that's another rant for another podcast. This podcast, my friends, is a dark journey through the weird phone labyrinth that springs up around you when you find yourself waiting for AT&T to install internet at your house. And I know that might not sound like, um, something horrific, but the podcast you're about to hear happened within a period of time where I was basically put under home arrest by AT&T three days of sitting at home waiting for someone to come to put internet in my house and being unable to leave. It was like the most boring episode of Black Mirror ever, a three day episode of Black Mirror. I just sat and waited for a knock at the door so I could get internet. Very sad. We're going to dive right into that. And Johnny Pemberton is going to be our guide right after this. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the Kings and Queens of sleep over at Casper.com.

Casper's breathable design helps you sleep cool and regulates your body temperature throughout the night. Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?

Okay, sweeties, this episode needs a little bit of a preface because at the end of the conversation with Johnny, there is an hour long recording of a conversation we had with AT&T. And I thought to myself, well, maybe you should edit out the whole music. Maybe you should edit out the awkward moments. Maybe you should edit out the points that are kind of boring, but I realized that to do that is to rob you of the spiritual punch to the solar plexus that comes from interacting with the super organisms that we currently call corporations. Also, not to spoil the whole thing. I feel like I have to say that after lambasting AT&T throughout this episode, I would be remiss if I did not mention that the person who actually came and installed the internet in my house spent eight hours, six hours here. And it was a really sweet, dedicated, cool person. So I can't really completely hate AT&T. In fact, I don't hate any one person at AT&T any more that I hate any one cell in Jeffrey Dahmer's body. I don't even hate Jeffrey Dahmer, but it's the interaction of those cells that produces the monster. And when it comes to corporations, it's not the individuals working at these places that are bad. None of them are at all. They're all pretty cool, sweet, the very worst bored people. But the sum total, the thing that Fritz Perls called the Gestalt of these massive corporations is sinister and is something that we should be very, very nervous about as corporations continue to grow and to spread and to gain incredible power. All right, so let's do this. Everybody, please spread the legs of your heart and squirt all over the face of today's guest, who has a wonderful podcast called Live to Tape, who is about to release an exclusive cassette tape of his phone calls that he's made to various corporations. He happens to be a master of it, who is a brilliant comedian who if you live in Los Angeles, you should definitely go to his Dicker Troy show and who is someone I am so lucky to have in my life. Please welcome to the Dunker Trussell Family Hour podcast, Johnny Pemberton. Johnny, Dougie, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for coming. It's great to be here in the Diffish. It is. Diffish. So yeah, man, this is like you are on day three of the strangest two days in my life, really the strangest two days of your life. I'm going to say like the strangest in the sense like the most sinister. Oh, like bad, like not. I've had strange days that are great, but this has been so it's been disruptive. It's been the most freaky thing that's ever happened. It's been the opposite of lucky. Yeah, it's it's it's diabolical. OK. And it's it's ominous is another way to put it. It's an ominous few days. I'm excited to hear about this. So like, I don't know. I just moved into this new place, by the way. It's beautiful. Welcome. You're the first. Thank you for shaking my hand. We just touched hands to to conquer. Conquerify the bond. Concretize. We've concretized our fraternal bond. Right. Oh, great fan. Just know it's the fan up there. So he's moved in the new place. You've moved into this beautiful new place. I've never been in a place I've been this happy about in my life. It's amazing. That's really good. It's got a good feel to it. Nice woo, as they would say in China. Yeah, that's got strong woo. I think that's their actual term. I'm not kidding. It's really someone told me that's actually made up in Chinese. It may be like a like a Shinto thing. Woo woo. It's a hanger has to do with Feng Shui, like in terms of the like, you know, you see a stick and it's like, oh, that stick looks really nice. You know, woo is definitely one of the words I would like stricken from the vernacular because it gets used so many times by people who more than likely couldn't tell you basic scientific principles. Like me. Yeah. Well, right. But you don't throw out like what I'm saying is like you'll get in conversations people and they're like, that's like a bunch of woo. And as though they were really? Oh, sure. Like new people act like they're fucking Newton or something, you know? It's like, oh, really? Like they're Neil deGrasse Tyson or something. Like you throw out something like synchronicity or some real thing that happened to you. Line luck, you know, about line luck. What is that? Line luck is when you show up at like a bakery or a coffee shop or any place that would potentially be a line and you walk in and there's no line and then seconds or maybe less than a minute afterwards, you look behind you and there's 15 people behind you. Yeah, I just had that. OK, yeah, those line luck. Line luck, those kinds of things, the kind, the kinds of things that are seemingly difficult to quantify and that people will throw out something that they read in a book that were skimming and they'll be like, oh, no, no, no, this is confirmation bias or something like that. But the reality is much like most of us, they don't really have a firm grasp on the scientific method, the history of science. And if they do, they're somehow missing something and you just get that sense. And yet they will disregard anything that seems slightly outside of their discovery channel level, understanding of the world. Like it's the thing where you just kind of because you're like, oh, that doesn't make sense to me. I don't know why, but definitely there's definitely something up. Enough of the woo, man. Enough of the woo. It's making me sick. You're really spewing bullshit. People say that, say woo in terms of bullshit. Yeah, woo is, you know, and I've, you know, I use it as a, I didn't know that. Honestly, I've only heard it in terms of like, yeah, woo that like Wu Tang clan. No, woo is like, what's the word for it? So if you, if you decided to become a bro scientist, then more than likely you're going to use the term woo. How's it spelled? Oh, W-O-O. Oh, see, I'm talking about W-U. Okay. That's different. That's woo. I've literally never heard W-O-O used before. That's woo. Really? Not woo. You're telling woo. So they're talking about like woo. Yeah, I get it. It's a thing you call out, you call bullshit on something. You say it's like, yeah, it's just, you know, it's. Yeah. And it's, I know I've used it, but I use it just because if I'm around, if I'm talking to someone, I'll use it as a term of convenience to try to like calm them down a little bit. If it's just so that I don't set off their like, their, their cosmos bristles, you know, like somebody's been watching someone. Okay, many people will sit and watch three episodes of cosmos. I don't think they got it. And become convinced that they understand the great mysteries of the universe and or maybe they throw in a couple of planet Earths. Yeah, they're like, they've got it down. They understand. They'll be like, no man, it's all evolution. I feel like it's the opposite. You see stuff on planet Earth when you see like two slugs have this weird, like spiral drip mating ritual and you're like, oh, everything is the same. Everything is just completely bizarre and there's no, there's no sense. That's because you're a wise man, that's because you're, well, that's it. But I think many people, their reaction to the madness and the understanding that the universe they're in is a thing with the blinking, spinning, whirling eyes. Beach, beach, beach like a fucking iron lung. Yeah, they can't handle that. So what they do is they produce a false sense in their own self. No, no, no, everything is rational. Everything is logical. Right. Things follow a very specific pattern that can be quantified. The flow justin. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, but that's more of a defense mechanism against the reality of the thing, which is that we're probably in some kind of kaleidoscoping, temporal ablanche of multiverses that keep collapsing in on each other. And we're being stretched and spun and split. Our reality tunnels are constantly fracturing at the subconscious level. We keep failing to transcend the next dimension that everyone else in the universe has done, or just they're like, God, they're so fucking close. That's it. Ah, man, that guy had to tie up those kids in Riverside, man. They would have done it. Exactly. So you're no power in your computer. What's that? Your computer is no power in doing 91% battery. OK, just, you know, sometimes to thank you for pointing that out. Sometimes when you put the I know because we've had some we'll get to that little OK, speaking of like turbid bumps and our particular acreage of the multiverse, we'll talk about that. But to get back to what's been happening to me. OK, we haven't we haven't talked about yet. You just sort of hint you alluded to it. This beautiful place. So I'm like, OK, OK, I got to get the internet. So I go online looking at the internet services and holy shit, man, AT&T. They have got a fucking fiber optic option, which means I can get a thousand Mbps download speeds. That is a fucking that's like a T one line. It is a T one line. That's a T one line, literally a T one, right? So that's perfect for streaming for government data for everything. That's just insane. And it's just the most amazing thing. So I set up an appointment for for two days ago. Between eleven and one o'clock, right? Whatever, it's just like, you know, like you do for things. I set up an appointment. So I'm you know, you got to be home. It's the window you got to be home for the window. Right. It's always the very first minute of the window or five minutes after the window. Right. Yeah, exactly. So I'm there for the window and no one shows up. So it's like whatever, whatever. I mean, I'm sure they're just running later, whatever. No deal. I don't mind staying home for a few more hours, but they still haven't shown up. So I call, I get an offshore place. You mean like an offshore call center? Yeah, you know, and that person is like, oh, no, no, no, you know, they're just running late, they'll be there. So I'm like, God damn it. All right, it's like two or three now. It's like, fuck it, I'll just wait. It's T one line. So still no one, no one shows up, right? So I call back now it's like five. I call back and I'm like, hey, what's going on? You guys said someone's coming. They haven't come yet. And they're like, OK, OK, we're going to have them call you. So this guy calls at like five o'clock. And I'm like, hey, what's up, man? Or what's going on? Are you guys why don't you guys call just to say you're not going to make it? And the guy's like, I'm calling you now. And I'm like, OK. I'm coming. What do you mean? What kind of tone was that he was pissed? Dude, that I because I didn't realize at the time to get a call from a technician from AT&T is like up there with like getting a call from the fucking pope. Bullshit. OK, so now check. So so I'm like, look, you guys just have to like tell me if you're not going to be here. What am I made of money? I'm like, so but when are you guys going to be here? And he's like, he says, well, we don't really know. And I'm like, wait, what do you mean? Do you do you tell them about the window? Like you guys are supposed to be here from 11 to one. I was given a two hour window here because I'm not a slave to your to you. I have I have got things to do, places to be. I'm moving into my house. I want to get some shelving units. I want to get some speaker stands. I want to run some errands. The dog needs walks. I want to get shit off site. I want to go shit off site. Look, I want to go shit off site. Oh, dude, I want to take a shower. You know, I don't want because like if I'm in the shower and they show up, I think you'd like, oh, no, we got to wait three weeks to reschedule. So he's like, oh, man, I'm already getting I'm already getting. Just just wait. Just wait. This is enough. So so so the guy. I'm like, all right, all right, I'm going to I call he's like, this is what he says to me. I'm like, so when are you guys going to get here? And he's like, we don't, you know, we don't really know. And I'm like, well, what do you mean? You don't know am I supposed to wait at my house for however long until you guys show up? Right. And he goes, it's complicated, man. And I'm like, I'm like, all right, look, give me your do you have something? Who do you work for? Can I call them? He gives me some number. What's the tone of this conversation at this point? Is it the guy? It's the same tone you get with every AT&T person. He's being defensive. No, it's like. It's like you've made a phone call to a chasm. Like how dare you? No, it's like a chasm. OK, just not a soulless chasm that speaks with wind. You know, a mysterious thing that is somehow abnegated. It's personality is like it's personalities. It's like a fungus. Like imagine like you're talking to like a collective, a fungal collective. OK, it's like more like that. So I call the call center and I talk with the guy. What did the guy finish saying and finish what he said? The guy is complicated when we're going to be here complicated. He's like, you know, he can't explain when they're going to come. He seems like, you know, I don't know the right word for it, man. Not not. He just doesn't know what's happening. But he sounds overloaded, maybe. You know, like they've got a bunch of shit going on, you know, they're backed up. So I call again in the call center and I'm like, what's going on, man? All you guys have to tell me is you're not coming. You know, I don't care. I have a hotspot on my phone. It's not like I'm desperate for the Internet right now. So they're like, OK, well, they're going to come tomorrow. They're going to come tomorrow. They tell you time. What? Yeah. They gave me a window and now I can't remember what the window was. Now, this is yesterday. So I think it was between one and three yesterday. Tomorrow, a classic two hour window. So. The same thing happens yesterday. They don't show up. I call again and they're like, no, they're coming. They're coming. And they don't show up. But the thing is, they're not telling me. They're not coming. They're literally saying, just wait, they're going to be there. They're going to be there. So all day yesterday, I keep calling. I've recorded one of the yes. But that's towards the end, you know. But all day yesterday, I've been I'm calling them and they keep saying, no, no, no, no, they're they're going to be there. They're going to be there. So I wait because it's like, shit, I've already waited one entire day for AT&T to come. I've invested all this time. It's a T one line, right? I want the T one line because I can stream video for sure. But it is just it's just the same as anything else. They don't do anything special. They don't have to like dig a hole. They just cook up the wires. Well, and even that, like maybe it is special. Like maybe they've got to run some crazy line or whatever. But I can't think it's significantly. They've been running fiber for years. All this isn't new. All they have to do is just tell me we're not going to be there today. We overestimated our workload. So we're going to come a week from now even. And for sure. But they're just like, we're going to they just keep saying we're going to come. I'm ordering groceries and I can't go out. So all day yesterday, I am staying in because they're saying they're going to come all day. They keep saying you're you are on the docket. Like you're on the there is a work order out. Did you talk to the technician too? I can't you can't get in touch with the technicians. And the other thing is you can't get in touch with a specific person at AT&T. Every time it's always a new person, always a new person. These are the things I learned. One, if you get an offshore person, that's it's like it's like the board. You can tell the offshore person to talk to someone in the United States, because sometimes their accents are difficult to understand. So you can be like, hey, can I speak to someone in the United States? They'll be like, I can handle it. You're like, I know, but they they said I could talk to someone in the United States. It's just a little hard sometimes to understand your accent. And so they will send you back to the United States. You'll get to the United States and you'll talk to someone in every one of these times. You have to go through the exact same series of questions. It takes about five minutes. Anyway, the long and short of is I have been on the phone with AT&T now for a total of four hours, not exaggerating, literally four hours on hold. And so last night, it's, you know, the sun has gone down. It's dark. You realize, holy fuck, they're not going to come two days now. I've been waiting. They're not going to fucking come. So I get on the phone with this woman and everyone is just like, look, you know, we're, we're, I'm going to, we're going to do this. We're going to work on it. I'm going to call the dispatch center. We're calling the dispatch center. The dispatch center will say, yeah, they're on the way. They're on the way. They don't fucking come. So whoever I talked to last night is like, we're going to have someone call you tomorrow at eight AM and let you know about the dispatch person. So this is today today. So no one calls today. So, so then I call AT&T again and they're like, yeah, yeah, we've got someone coming now. He's been sent. He's coming. This is eight. He's going to be there. And so it's like not then it's like nine 30 or 10. Still no one has come. So then I call back and they're like, oh, yeah, we're sorry. As it turns out, the line outside, it isn't even working. And so how the fuck do you know it isn't working? Because the dispatch center tells him this. So how do they know they haven't been here? Dude, at this point, I start screaming. Like I start I like I start like like somebody who is like finally broken through the thick sheet of ice in the Arctic covering the cave. It's filled with the Cthulhu ancient beings that drive you insane from looking at it. Like I break, man. I'm like, what do you mean? What do you mean? I've been here for two days. Two days. Dude, I don't understand. I'm screaming, man. All the Ramdha shit, all the names out the window, out the fucking window. Man, I am like the poodle is like cowering. The dogs are freaking out. I feel like I'm going to fucking I don't know what to do. There's it's like I'm in the sick part is I could easily just like forget it. Yeah, forget I'll get different service, different service. But I want that fucking T1 line. So what's happening right now is it was supposed to be here now. It's 1141. There was supposed to be here between 9 and 11. And so right before you came, I was on the phone with them and they're like, they'll be there between 11 and one. So they just keep pushing it ahead by two hours. And this is my and I'm sorry, you guys, if I had to listen to this long. I want to call him. Well, let's do it. Let's call him right now. I'll call him. I've you know, this is like a specialty of mine is talking to to these people. Yeah, let's give him a call. I mean, let me just I want to play something for you. Well, no, you're going to cause it will hear it. So I guess let's let's do that. Well, well, Johnny, you can make this call my technique. I have a special technique for I call it being overly explicit. Well, I don't actually don't have a name for it. But what it is, it's a combination of being extremely explicit to the point where you almost assume the person has no understanding of anything, but also super nice. But also there's a thing I think you have to do. You have to be like, you have to be sad to be like, I'm just I'm at my like not angry, but sad, like I don't know what to do. I think I'm so like almost you have to you have to give them the the whiff of suicide. OK, that's a good tactic. Just so you know, here's what's going to happen. You're going to call. They're going to ask what you're calling about. It's going to be a computer at first. Right. It's going to not know my phone number eventually. Like it'll say is this the number? And then I'll say you're calling about a work order and you'll say yes. And they'll be fake typing sound. And then it'll say there's no order associated with your number. Don't worry. This has happened. There is an order. This is happening. And then eventually you'll get a person. The person will be probably in India. Right. And then you could either talk to that person, depending on how well you can understand them. And and then not or you say, transfer me to the United States, please. And then you'll talk to someone in the United States. Now, if you can, I think you should make it as your goal to try to get a supervisor on. Yeah. And then I'm from the top. I'm sorry. I've been dealing with something for for several days now. It's it's becoming a huge problem. I'm looking to cancel my service completely. Don't say that. They'll cancel it. Don't they won't? That's the thing. They hate it when you cancel your service. You call they have a whole thing called customer retention. Those people, those are the fucking guys who walk around the office with their balls hanging out. These are like the fucking badasses who keep you from if you ever have a cable. If you have a cable around their balls hanging out. Yeah, because these are like the fucking like these are the the bad. These are the fighter pilots of the cable company because they people. If you ever have cable TV and you want to cancel cable TV, you want to have a fun time when you want to get your ego stroked, try to cancel your cable. They will fucking like, hey, man, how's it going? Yeah. Oh, cool. So what do you watch? I mean, that show is pretty crazy, right? So so you don't really interest in the service anymore. OK, maybe you could just kind of tell me why. Maybe we can work something out because I mean, obviously we've got a lot of different things here. We can figure something out. OK. Oh, so you don't really watch that. OK. What about this? What if we were to offer you forty nine ninety nine for six months and for interest rate? And you can you know what? Actually, you can still keep HP. How about that? You want to keep that? Because I know I obviously I've had you guys again. That's and then they just won't let you. OK, OK. Cool. I was well, what about, you know, a really? Yeah, you want to come over and I've got this great. I got a great rib recipe for you. OK, you know, actually, I am too. I just like you want some souffle over. I'm making souffle now before you make the call. Right. Here's where it's gotten. So it went from being. I just can't believe this because I know I've had a lot of. Well, I just don't know how there's no accountability and how it's. Well, that's where that. See, this is what this is where it gets really interesting, right? Is this is the concept where corporations are a sociopath. So corporations are essentially a superorganism. It's faceless. There's nothing. Right. It's a sociopath. It has no real care for anyone. Amorphous and so every person I've been talking to when I'm not freaking out and like yelling, I've been saying like, look, I know you as a person are fine. But the thing you're part of is broken, is is beyond broken. It's not broken. It's it's working. But the way it's working is the most horrifying thing ever because it is what. Potentially everything can turn into, which is this sort of the human worker is a node who has a sheet of things to say. Yeah, and that node is part of a web of people who sit in front of a screen with lists of things to say. Well, we're already there. We're there. It's all I think it's all just AI training. Like when you see an Uber driver trying to make a left into across three lanes of traffic at 430 p.m. And because Waze is telling me to do that and not go up a block to the light when there's a left turn arrow, it's like, OK, this is a person who is being is just following instructions by rote. They're just like, they're not thinking at all. Yeah, they're they're basically and there's that thing that they found out years ago from Google that that they as a reason Google gave Uber so much money is because basically Uber is doing their R&D for them with in terms of driverless cars and all the technology and the mapping and stuff. Because if you have a driver who's following the map guidance has been given by the computer, how is that driver anything other than a computer operator? Like it's really no different because they're not they're almost never like 95 percent of the time they're just following the computer guidance. They're not making any type of decision. It's like why like when you're like Uber, you call Uber a lift. If if your address is on the map a little off from your addresses, they're never going to show up at the address because they're not looking at the fucking street numbers, they're looking at the map, the guidance map. Because if you're doing that as a job, for the most part, I bet not. I bet the vast majority of people who do that kind of settle into that theta state where there's sort of just, you know, like when you are on the highway, sort of your your your right brain. It kind of everything kind of I don't know the technical word for it, but you kind of go into that state where you're just sort of not really thinking. You're just that's how you can drive so long and not really know where am I? Oh, I've just been sort of like a sleep, essentially. But and all that the dollar does is just give data to the people who are programming the machines that will eventually be able to do this much better. Oh, my God, it makes it makes so much sense that that's the case. So wait, you're saying that the people have been hypnotized by the AI into a theta state, but really what they are is unwitting or or I guess oblivious servants to corporations that are harvesting their data mining, they're just data mining the way they handle navigating through traffic to give more rules to the AI that they're building. So because they so they can make the the more data. It's like if you have a if you do like a medical test, right? Let's say you have to want to test the effects of sugar on ten year olds. So if you do a test and you only have 15 ten year olds, your data is not going to be as strong as someone who we tested it on a group of 10,000 ten year olds. Yeah. So the data set is so massive that it's like this when you present something like that. And that's why people work. That's why scientists who want to do research want to work for the bigger bigger companies because they can their data sets are so big. When they present their findings like look how much information we've gathered. And so you think about like Google's doing the same thing with Uber. It's like, well, how do we get the most real time traffic data? Well, how about we pay Uber to let us mine this if you use our software? And so they just have they have fucking got that is several million hours of data. Dude, so it's kind of like, OK, we want to study wolves. Right. And so what we do is we go in, we smack one of them with a dark gun. Knock them out, put a tracking chip on the wolf's neck, track the wolf. And then we understand the way that they, yeah, but they move. This seems to be more like instead of tranquilizing people, we've given them something that is innately tranquilizing, which is technology. And we like shift their perception, their their their perceptual apparatus to a mode of kind of a numb, empty focus so that we can fully track them gathering their data so that we can eventually replace them with something that is a pure AI. Right. So it's the replacing them with a collective. It's like, why would you have these autonomous drivers when you have a system that's all working together, traffic would disappear because you wouldn't have someone making a left because the computer learns that, OK, for the past thousand times, someone's tried to make a left on the street. It's caused this happening because you have all this data coming in from everywhere. And if you can measure all that data, you're OK, we don't ask them to make a left there. We ask them to make a left at the at the arrow because that increases the flow of traffic and makes everything faster and more efficient. So you make more money and everything's better. The same reason that UPS UPS drivers, they don't make any they never make a left turn. Their routes have been like some badass mathematicians figured out. If we program their routes, they never have to make a left turn. They'll save some massive amount on gas because they're not idling. They're never idling to wait for a left turn. And so they fucking save shitloads of money. Do you ever play around with the idea that AI is an alien intelligence that is is kind of like the beginning, the process of colonizing the planet. And so the first step is to do a full analysis of the bio rhythms and patterns of the human, the most advanced species on the planet prior to the invasion. I kind of feel the opposite. I don't think I don't feel like it's an invasion. I think it's more just it's just the next the next step. I don't know, man. I think that it's like in my most that's like a bike. It's fun to think about that. I think it's kind of you're so about to say in your most paranoid or something. No, not paranoid. My most high moments when I think about it, I my my idea is we have made a classic mistake, which is it is truly one of the classic mistakes. Humans have, you mean? Yeah, humans have made one of the classic mistakes because the classic mistake doesn't just happen with UFOs. It happens with love. It happens with happiness. It happens with everything. Which is that you think you know. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they're fucking here. No, that's Amazon. Oh, my God. It was Amazon also. Like I had some girl with him with like the most the largest fake eyelashes I've ever seen in my fucking life. She's like fucking parachutes on her face. Kidding me, what's going on here? Dude, dude, hold on. Let me let me calm the dogs down. I'm pretty sure it's just Amazon. OK, so the classic mistake. Right. You think you know what many people think they know what love looks like. Many people think they they have an idea in their mind of what their happy life is going to look like. They have an idea in their mind of what success looks like. They have an idea in their mind of what so many things look like when really they don't have any idea at all. But they're looking for the thing based on their idea, which has been created out of materials that have been given to them by TV mostly or by their parents or by friends who are adult. Because you know, like the idea they have of what the thing is like warped is warped and it's like from weird influences. Yeah, so it's kind of like an example is you're telling someone, hey, can you find a key? It's in my house. I need you to find this key. But you don't tell them that the key looks like a pentagram with an eye in the middle of it and has like glowing rubies around the side of it. Right. They're looking for a little piece of metal with a little jagged piece of metal. So even though that's that fucking crazy ass thing that you use to open up the annex in your temple where the imps are housed is laying right on your obsidian fucking table, they're looking everywhere else for what they thought a key would look like. So they're never going to find it. So in the same way, people think, oh, I know what love looks like. I know what love feels like. It's the bachelor. What? It's the bachelor. That's what love is. Yeah, exactly. Right, right, right. So in the same way, people think they know what an alien invasion would look like. And people think they know what a UFO would look like. People think what's really hilarious about people thinking they know what an alien would look like is that the very word itself alien implies this is a thing comes foreign beyond foreign. Like we're talking about something that could have emerged from some biosphere that is interdimensional, that is even not even interdimensional, that comes from a non-linguistic, non-articulable area of something that we don't even understand or know exists. And so we have no, not even the vaguest possibility of even saying what it is outside of saying it's alien. Yeah, we think it's like, oh, it's going to look like a missile coming at us or like some sort of thing hovering that's going to block the sun out because it's all based in, I mean, it's the same. I always think about the same way that people think about what they eat in terms of how, oh, we can't, I can't eat this because it's because I don't want to eat this animal because I am sensitive to it. But it's like, you never think that you're consuming billions of bacteria. Those are alive, essentially. That's just there's always things that are programmed in us because we want to save things that remind us of us. We don't want to hurt each other. So a fucking puppy is very close to humans. The thing where you never want to eat this puppy because it's like, oh, that reminds me of who I am and it does things that I do with my brother and sister or something like that. So it's that thing where if you, if you expect it's an alien invasion, because you'll, you think it's going to think like you and not the opposite or beyond, think around you. And you might even think like, oh, you know, well, maybe it's going to look like a virus or maybe it would look like a bacteria. Maybe it'll look like a carbon molecule or maybe it'll look like molecular. Maybe it'll have an atomic structure. Maybe it'll have something that obeys the laws of physics. Maybe it'll, you know, there's all these things. Maybe it's an it. Maybe it's there's all these things. But really what you end up realizing is that your preconceived notions of the way things in the future are going to look are actually modular pieces of a symbolic blindfold that is completely keeping you from possibly witnessing something that is right in front of you and is so spectacularly odd that it makes planet Earth and cosmos seem like watching paint dry. It's so bizarre. So this is why sometimes I think, oh, clearly what's happening here is that we've been dusted. The we've been dusted with some kind of inspiration that has allowed people to create technology and the technology is sticky. Well, you could say it's just spores. I mean, that's the classic idea. Yeah, it's spores. It's a kind of literally spores, like literally fungal spores. This is that old idea. It's not that old, I guess, but the idea that because you know how they they map fungal networks and they have identical shape and pattern to internet and highways. It's the same thing. Yeah, it's like that. That's the stuff that sort of got me off of feeling like I'm thinking about sort of like the doom of the Earth because you realize I always think about how like when you really boil it down to the idea, like the idea of like a like a 3D printer, right? Yeah. That's a really cool thing. It's really it's amazing and they're probably going to get so much better. They're going to be able to do anything. Yeah. But if you think of like a garden, right, like a vegetable garden, like I can grow a radish, like a full size radish in like very short period of time. How long like 40 days from seed to this big fucking thing that's filled with sugar and all kinds of stuff. And you think about I mean, I'm not joking. I feel like there's really no difference between that and a computer. Like there's obviously like sure. But it's that's essentially just a little fucking computer. It's like like biotechnology. Right. And that there's always physicists. That guy, Michio Akaku, who say he's the guy who studies at, I think, University of New York or New York City College or whatever, he's a physicist. He talks about how the 21st century, how you can only do so much with silicone because it only gets so small, how he's he's convinced that the technology that will take us off the planet and just in general technology that's that's really pervasive and like does the next iteration of whatever it is to come is a technique is going to be the century of biology because he thinks that that integration, that's where the that's where the real deep, heavy computing lies. Because you're only going to make a hard drive so small because you're limited by them by the size of the chips and stuff. You can make them small and compact. They it's going to keep going, but they're going to hit a wall. And that wall is because the substrate they're using is just it's not. I don't obviously don't understand the the tech the technical stuff about it, but it has to do with like the molecule size and the way it works. And so they have to move into biology. So it becomes this thing where that you're making things that are computers, but they're biological entities. Like the idea I always think that the best thing to have to me is the whole idea of nanobots like they have a little tiny like microscopic computers. It'll go into our body and heal it. But we already have those. They're called bacteria. So imagine if you could take a bacteria and program it. You could like find a way to tinker with whatever the bacteria knows to do. And you tell it to do something. You tell it to go in and fucking cut your appendix off. Isn't that CRISPR is that's what they're doing. CRISPR is cleaving out parts of the DNA and then sending in some kind of virus to replace the DNA. They like flood it with these viruses that are I think they're called. I'm not part bacteria phages or I'm not sure. Yeah, well, bacteriophage is a thing. Yeah, some kind of thing that goes in there after you've like basically somehow annihilated the some part of the DNA strand. You flood the cell and in these things go in and then replace it with some new piece and now you've got inside of you a reprogrammed bit of code. And it's just going to start producing the right thing or the better thing or wherever it is and eventually they'll be able to do it ever. You can do anything. You'll be able to change any aspect of biology whatsoever. Because it's like to think that like our bodies are like they're fucking incredible. Like we have these these massive computers that can do like you don't need to eat food for 40 days, no and any one of us who has even like just 10 percent body fat, maybe 15, but you could you can go out someplace if you've got clean water and you're not freezing or burning up, you can you'll be fine. Yeah, that'd be fine. You fucking you'll be totally fine. That's one of the funny things like the when I was in New York, I fasted for two days without food and the shock when you get to day two and you realize like, whoa, I'm not really even that hungry anymore. And that's a really odd thing to realize because part of the thing that we've been taught here, especially in the West, is we're always supposed to be cramming shit in our mouths. You have to. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's like a job like you should always be, you know, have a snack nearby something that what if you get hungry? Yeah, God forbid you should get hungry. I mean, this is like terrible that you're hungry. You're hungry. Meanwhile, it's like being hungry is such a purifying, healthy feeling. Yeah, man. So yes, I know what you're saying. And I know you're saying, oh, no, this is it's not coming from outside the earth. It's coming from the earth. Right. But one, I guess one thing that we both agree on is that what we're looking at is a shrinking down like we're to achieve the kind of computer power, the processing power, the ability to manipulate things at the molecular level within a human being. All of these things require not big stuff, but little stuff shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking. And so somewhere in there, in that micro sizing of of our tools, that I think is where there is going to be this interesting communion with an intelligence that is completely and spectacularly alien. And that it's almost, I guess, a witch came first, chicken or the egg argument. But I think that that in the same way that we're realizing now that many of our decisions are being controlled somehow by the chemical output of our gut bacteria, which is producing cravings that are making us do certain things. Yeah, it's all your genome. Yeah, I think we're going to start realizing that many of the or I think it's possible that many of the epiphanous moments and the inspirational moments that have produced the technology that is allowing us to have Uber drivers who are being controlled by an artificial intelligence are not even coming from something with human DNA, like what you said fungus. But I and where that fungus came from, who the fuck knows? But this shit with AT&T has made me like think whatever the fuck it is, it's a really ominous and creepy interaction. I would rather have read some kind of spell out of a book covered in like crucified baby flesh that made a little pig thing appear in my house with black eyes and fangs. What have you called me for, you man? Do you seek terabytes? Do you seek a 1000 Mbps connection, you man? I would much rather have that happen. Something that smells of sulfur and those swampy pits of health. Pay the pay the piper. If you want this fast connection, I want seven of your fingernails. I want to eat your pinky. Our technician is going to come over to 1130 and give you 45 lashes. That's a bunch of lashes. I would take that. I would take that. They were like, listen, OK, here's the thing. Here's what you can choose. We're going to keep giving you windows of time that we may be there and we're not going to show up or Jack from the dispatch unit is going to come down and he's going to you, boy, he's going to suck you. He's going to suck you dry. He's going to he's going to he's going to. Now, listen, Jack, Jack's got a rough. Jack is not what you would call symmetrical. Well, Jack's got a rough mouth. So what we say about Jack is he ain't no to caprio. Let's just put it like this. Let's just put this way. Jack's had him had a share of Dorgan Gunch in his day. Jack's had a Jack's had a few cups of Dorgan Gunch. Jack's not what you would call an androgynous man. Let's put it like this. But this way, Jack's not what you call a sexual being so much as a as a rock that moves, Jack's like just a rock that likes to Jack's. Jack's a rock that likes to suck dick. And he's and he's got a little problem because his mouth hasn't been able to produce saliva ever since he accidentally inhaled chloroform a few weeks. You ever heard of a rough ride? I'll just say it's going to be a rough ride for you, but we'll get that T one line and we'll get it up and running by the end of the day. But it's going to be a rough ride. You've written in the back of a bus going on a country road. OK, OK, OK, thinking, thinking what it would be like to put the most sensitive part of your body in a the least sensitive thing that exists. Like a mouth made of gravel. Just thinking that I would definitely take. I would take a dry, gravelly blowjob from a 68 year old man with hooked hands and like some kind of terrible hooked hands, some kind of terrible protein bar level flatulence. So they asked he was grinding away, slurping in my cup. Just this this this I would I would take that any day over a series of phone calls with the fucking void. I think that you're you're in the halo climb right now. We talked about the halo climb before. I feel like we have let's go back into it. It's this thing I learned about years ago and I was I was reading up something about as a kid about how how when you scuba dive. Yes. And you go areas. There's certain areas where there's freshwater outlets into the into the ocean and they create something or it happens. A lot of caves that are like coastal caves, underwater caves. The halo climb is a thing where when the salt water and fresh water and meat, because they're obviously like different different densities, it's like this area of a few feet, it's all looks like you're in like, you know, an oil and water mix. It's swirly and it looks like you're looking through the vision. You know, when heat rises in the distance off a road, it looks all squiggly, squaggly. You're inside of that. You're in like a liquid confusion chamber. So you got you have to it's called a halo climb. And so it's this thing where the things are the meeting. There's like a disturbance, a turbulence between the two worlds. And I feel like right now we are in the halo climb. It's going to be a long halo climb. It's the halo climb between purely biological life, like maybe how people lived before the Industrial Revolution, where you lived up the land. Everything was essentially handmade. Yeah. We're pre-Industrial Revolution to when a time when human beings, as we are before the Industrial Revolution, don't exist, because we don't have the on board biological integrated technology to do things like look at a phone for look at look at some sort of a interface for a certain amount of time without getting extremely depressed and isolated, because like that's a fact. If you use social media all the fucking time, it's just a fact. You will get depressed because you're just not your body and brain are not meant to be taking this much information in that way. Just we just weren't designed for that. And so we haven't upgraded yet to that level. So we're OK, maybe maybe human beings won't exist, but I think there'll be some sort of weird some sort of weird like I guess you could call it a cyborg. But I think the idea of a cyborg is so like outmoded and so like based in science fiction, like, oh, I'm going to have a fucking arm made of metal. I think it's not going to be that. I think it's going to be humans will be the same as they've always been. They'll just will have this some sort of weird integration with technology to the point where it's not really what is technology like you could say that fingers fingers are a technology in a way, any kind of thing that helps you interact with the world is a technology. Just the idea that technology is separate from biology will be like a thing of the total past to the point where we're just like I was going to argue with my dad about this Christmas house. I was drunk. I was like, dad, humans aren't going to exist. It's going to be a point in time when we're done, because I was talking about how they found code and that's more like the simulation theory. But just the idea that that humans like we're just not we're not how we were designed does not work anymore with the world that we've created. There's so many people who are so depressed because they're the way how how we live. We're just meant to live in like a tribal society where we're like constantly stressed in a good way where we're feeling like fulfilled by by like fucking hunting or doing doing stuff that makes you feel good about what you do because we're like we're so strong like the humans are just they're fucking bad ass like we're these incredibly designed. We can do so many things that we have like the most multi. You can do humans can do fucking everything. We can we can swim, we can fly with all this crazy shit. But we don't ever most of us don't do anything at all. Like we don't have any kind of there's nothing to keep us. Oh, my God. Second false alarm. Yeah, the poodle got out. That was a very nice family that returned him. Thank God. Yeah, so keep going. Well, I think I was sort of at the end of whatever I was saying. But essentially, I feel like that the human body as it is now is not like the job that was designed for is done. And now we we just need we need to start integrating and I don't know. I think maybe there'll be a die off. Who knows? There'll be something something something big will happen. It's like this is how I picture it sometimes. You know, when you're when you're I don't know how you when you've done this recently, but taking this shit now got laying in the bathtub and gone underneath the water and you look up and you have the water above your head and you look and you can kind of see through the water to what's outside, but it's shimmery and wavy and weird or like if you go scuba diving and you look up and you and outside above the water, there's really seen there's reality. But what you see is just this shimmering thing, which represents the boundary between the ocean and the land and the ocean and the sky. And so I think what's happening is human beings are beginning to what we call reality is, in fact, the shimmering. Hey, what did you call the halo clan? Yeah, what we're literally you and me and when you're looking out in the world, what you think is reality is actually an undulating veil that is separating us from what is an entirely brand new biosphere and that somehow technology, evolution, magic, whatever you want to call it, aliens, just the expansion of the universe is pushing us through the very thing that we consider to be three dimensional space time and we're about to push in to some completely new place. So when you say, oh, the cyborgs, they'll have it be equipped with some kind of, I don't know, new tropic, right genetic implant that makes their enhances their IQ or that whatever it may be, what I think what really is going to happen is it's going to be a thing that allows us to see some completely new facet of reality. Something that we we don't even know what it we can't even describe what it is because it's not even in the language that exists. That's it. It's like a fucking someone. And what's they always say? What's the whole language thing like the people that have five words for snow, but no word for for rain or something like that? It's just that we don't we don't have it as human because we don't even know what it feels like. That's it. And that, I think that that place has been sending through that the surface of reality into our consciousness, innovations and ideas that are giving us the necessary tools to get there to climb out. And so somehow in that process, we have begun to dehumanize or something. We've begun to collectivize and the collectivization and dehumanization. One of the manifestations of it is a tea and fucking tea, man, which is doing two things. One, it is, you know, uniting and unifying and collectivizing. God knows how many fucking employees all around the planet in this incredible network of numb, down, droning people who are clear. I mean, God, God, help someone who works at AT&T. It's not like you wake up in the morning and you're like, ah, here we go, baby. I'm going to head to the call center and take a call. This is it, man. I've really, you know, when I was a kid and I was in the beach with my mom and I was running at the waves and the waves were crashing against the sand and I was laughing, my little brother was with me when you're laughing and there was the smell of a phone. That's, you know, when you're doing that, you never once were like, God, you know, one day I'm going to be a manager at a call center dealing with people who have entered into a kind of brand new form of psychosis that has only just existed in human history, which is the psychosis resulting from spending several days at home waiting for a super fast, talking to different people who don't understand what the other person said, because there's no communication, there's no intercommunication, no one dreamed of that. No, no, no one at AT&T is like, man, this is just exactly where I want to be. You don't come home after a day of working at AT&T and sit down and say to your kids, guys, listen to what happened today. I read the script on the computer screen 700 times. It's the most times I've ever read the script. I heard a gunshot today. I heard a gunshot. I heard a man, a nice man named Duncan. He started crying and then heard a gunshot. And then there was silence, except for the barking of a dog. And then I heard the technician arrive. Maybe you have to do that. You have to kill yourself or pretend to kill yourself and then they'll send the technician out and call 911, tell them the technician hasn't arrived. I mean, I've said I've tried to explain it to them in different ways. I've been like, you guys, just so you know, like in the past, I've had drug dealers that were 7000 more fish times more efficient than you, a billion dollar company, just silence on the other line. So they don't like that shit when you mention stuff like drugs. Well, they don't. It's like what you were saying about suicide. It's what you were saying about the Uber driver. It's like it's not that they don't like or like it. It's that they have on their outside the program, a series of. Yeah, they have things that they're supposed to say. It's a freestyle. And they can't. Yeah, that's and if it's coming off of that, those those modes of response, they they don't know what to do. It's confusing to them and they don't know what to do. They don't want to lose their job. So AT&T is doing two things or any of these big companies. One, they're harmonizing, dehumanizing and programming some massive amount of people, their employees, and focusing them on this task of making money, but also of putting technology into people's homes, which is moving us closer to some kind of like what you're talking about, some kind of new thing. And I have, as you know, been quite excited about this thing until this experience with AT&T, like it's all it took. So if you think about it in a way, maybe, maybe that's bad because it's like it's sort of like the terrorist of one type thing. Right. If the bad experience of the AT&T can get you off of your off your thing, then it's like one man. Yeah, they fucking did it. Yeah, it's almost like you failed the test. Yeah, yeah, man. Yeah, like the hardest test is the one that seems like it's not a test. It's it is a it is fucking it's it's just it's crazy. And I do I want you to call them. And I would love to. OK, why don't we do that now? Let's make it call to the alien and see what see what happens. Maybe you have to like, well, you have to give me your information. You have to bleep it out in the post. Yeah, well, we'll just yeah, you don't even need the information. You'll see. Don't just keep saying operator operator. They're going to ask for your name and you ask for your phone number. OK, I'll just pause it when that's happening. OK, here we go. Go. And let's do this. OK. Calling about regulated local exchange telephone service. Press one for any AT&T sales or service need. Press two. Right, sales or service. Yeah. Oh, welcome to AT&T. Para Español o Prima el ocho. No. Fake typing for quality. Are you calling about the account associated with the number? Yes.

Well, you know, I guess you could trauma. You could say this is a trauma. It feels a little bit just like it get being burnt on the stove or something. But if that, oh, wow, it's quick. Hello, good day. Thank you for contacting AT&T. This is Genesis Genesis. Hi, my name is Duncan. Hi, Duncan, how can I help you this afternoon, sir? Hi, well, I just kind of start off tell you I've had some very frustrating last couple of days and I'm really considering canceling my service because it's just been so difficult. I just moved to a new home and I'm trying to have the internet installed here. And three days ago, the technician was supposed to be here. They didn't arrive within the time window. They didn't even arrive later that day. And the same thing happened the next day. And now it's the third day and I'm considering canceling the service because they can't seem to communicate with me to install it. And I was wondering if you could help me. OK, all right, well, I completely understand the frustration that I get. I would probably feel the same if I'm on your choose, but I'll be more than happy to assist you. I would have considered moving forward with that. Thank you. You're welcome. I just need those awesome questions to pull up your account. That's OK. OK, what information do you need? Do you have the account number or the contact number attached to the order? Thank you. All right. Let me just go ahead and pull up the account here real quick. OK, give me one moment for that. No problem. All right, so. Street Street. What's the zip code? OK, thank you. OK, also, as we go on, well, I just want to secure a good mobile telephone number that we may use to reach you via phone contacts with information about your APNP service. OK, I just gave it to you. Out of the same number. Thank you. All right, one information, one more information, though. I just need the four digit. Thank you so much for that. And by the way, I'm seeing you that you have called in earlier. Assuming this is about the same problem. Yes, like I said, this has been going on for three days now. It was supposed to be installed on Thursday morning. And the technician never showed up. They never called to say that they would be late. I called up and then they said they someone put me in touch with the technician. They said they were they didn't know when they would be arriving. And I called again to the call center and they said it would be there later that day. The entire day passed, sun up to sundown. No one arrived. I was forced to stay at home the entire day, even though I have a lot of pressing matters, I had to have I had to pay someone to go pick up my children at school because I couldn't make it there. And then the next day they said that we established a window when the technician would arrive. And they again did not show up during the window. I had to again pay someone to pick up my children at school. I had to pay someone to deliver food to the home because I could not leave because I didn't want to miss the technician during the window. And I have been unwashed this entire time. So again, the technician did not show up during the time that was set up by the company. And I called again and they said they would be arriving. They again did not arrive. I had to spend more money to have my children picked up at school and to have more food delivered to the home because I could not leave because I was told the technician would be arriving. And now it's today, Saturday, the technician was supposed to be here from 11 to one. They have not arrived and no one has called me and communicated any type of lateness whatsoever. And at this point I have two questions. Who do I send an invoice to to pay for the things that I've had to pay for because of the lateness, the tardiness of the technician who's never showed up and also do you recommend a different internet provider other than AT&T because clearly AT&T is unable to provide service? OK, let's do one by one. Let's go with your questions one by one. OK. Your first question. Just to clarify that, are you asking for a department that can compensate you? Yes, I would like to be compensated for the time I've had, the time, the money I've had to spend because these technicians have not arrived. I've basically been forced to stay home for two days straight because I've been, they've been stringing me along saying that this technician is going to arrive and no one shows up at all and no one calls me to inform me they won't be showing up. You have my phone number. You're a telecommunications company and yet no one can communicate with me. It's incredibly frustrating. My family has had AT&T for 70 for I don't know how long. Our family's always used AT&T. I love AT&T. It's always worked for me. I have an AT&T. I mean, everything. And this is making me feel so disillusioned and losing my complete faith in AT&T as a company. I'm considering selling my stock. I don't know how to rectify this. OK, all right. I see what I want is the Internet to be installed. And I want someone to show up when they say they are. But at this point, if you told me that someone was going to be here in an hour, I wouldn't believe you. Because so far it's happened four times someone was supposed to be here. And no one not only have they not showed up, shown up at all. No one even called to tell me that anything was happening. OK, all right, I see. Well, I completely understand how frustrating this is when you're and I will blame you, you know, if you want if you will doubt that somebody will arrive today to do the installation. I'm actually I'm currently checking on your ticket right now here. It's actually pre-assigned to one of the technicians already. However, there are two technicians actually involved on your installation. We have the first the first technician or the primary technician is the one who will install the services inside the premise. So he'll be the one to hook up the modem. The second technician here, this is an outside technician. This is like a stay and play technician. For example, the the inside technician had a problem activating the services and he needs to check something outside. That's the that's the time that he will take assistance on the second technician. OK, well, this I don't know how this matters at all because no one's no one's been here. No one's been to the house at all. So I don't know what you're obviously these technicians need to be replaced. Is there is can you have this service order given to technicians who are able to able to actually follow up on the call that they're supposed to be on? Because clearly, I mean, obviously, you have nothing to do with this whatsoever. But there's something something's wrong because something's not happening. There's someone someone's not getting the message. And as a result, I've been imprisoned in my home, forced to live in my own filth because I'm at the mercy of this company that will not refuses to uphold their end of the service. If I were to call you up and not pay my bill for three months, would you guys would you guys keep sending me service? You'd cancel my service. I'm I'm not allowed to not pay. So how is it that the technicians are allowed just to not show up? Doesn't make any sense to me. Oh, of course, I got your point done again. You made it very clear. And I know you're under the impression right now that, you know, we are not, you know, keeping our promise. It's not an impression. It's not an impression. It's a fact. Well, particularly, yes, it's a fact. I must admit, and again, on behalf of my team, I really apologize for this inconvenience. I know, sorry, it will not get us nowhere. But actually, what's happening is that there is no available outside technician as to why the inside technician is not yet dispatched. We are we are waiting, you know, for both. We need two technicians to be dispatched out there because the premise technician alone, you know, I understand to complete. OK, well, how come that how come that was if that's the case, how come no one told me that? How come I say someone's coming when no one's coming? No, no, I must admit, again, that is our shortcoming. I understand, you know, somebody should have contacted you at least and let you know what is going on to be honest with you when it comes to this matter. It's actually, you know, a business of our dispatch sector. But I would be more than happy to send the feedback. And if you still would like to to do the installation, since you're not getting a feedback from the dispatch team, if you want, I'll be the one to keep you updated from time to time. We're not getting much calls today, so I can monitor you. This has already happened twice before with someone telling me they'd update me and I haven't received a single incoming call to update me. Here's what needs to happen. There's two things that need to happen. One, this installation needs to be completely free and I need to be given a credit for the I need to be given a credit for the first month at least. I think I need, you know what, they've already there needs to be some sort of a credit in place here for this. The second thing that needs to happen is I need to be connected with someone stateside, someone local, someone who is in the area in which I live so I can communicate with them to get to the bottom of this, because obviously you're far away from this whole matter. So it's hard for that to be you to communicate with them. So is there a way I can be connected with someone from the local branch of whatever this is? So I can I could connect you over to someone from US, but there's no guarantee that it will be someone from your area or from your states in California. Well, I'll take it. OK, well, I just need to be connected to someone who who has a who understands what's going on here. Just ask when they're coming. It's boring. No one wants to hear this. Anyway, this is a nightmare. I feel like they inflict this on people. I don't know how. OK. If you want, I'll connect you over to someone from onshore. That's the least thing that I can do about your request. OK. OK. I'm committed now. Isn't this crazy? This has been going on for like this. This thing, this conversation, you just said, I've had it at least seven times. The exact same thing to this weird shit about one technician and another technician. But what a crazy thing is they keep saying, no, they're going to come. They keep saying they're going to come. That's what's weird about it. Is there, by the way, would you mind if inflation work for a minute or two so I can dial the US Department? Go for it. Right. Thank you. Whoa, that's what I've been hearing for fucking that fucking sax blast. Isn't this the craziest thing is because they can't say, hey, we're not going to make it today. They just keep saying, no, no, no, it's right around the corner, man. We're going to call you. Let you know it's the first insane thing. And the other crazy thing is I bet that all over L.A. right now, there's at least 2000 people stuck in their house, maybe for months, months. Yeah, mentally ill people who just can't let go. Oh, my God, people who can't assert themselves. Yeah, just in their home. Wow. Waiting and waiting prisoners. So fucked up, dude. Prisoners, maybe it's some sort of a cabal. Fact. What I want to say is I talk to some America, I'm going to say. What should I do? What would you do if you were me? Yeah, that's a good one. Because right now I feel like I am insane. It's true. I mean, what I'm doing is I'm just giving up. I don't I'm just going to like go live my life. And if I miss the appointment, who fucking gives a shit? Oh, I feel like Tina Turner in 1975. This is the fifth time I've given me flowers this week. But where it's really creepy is I'm the one it's like the monkey. You know the stupid thing about how you catch a monkey? No, put a jewel in a hole. Yeah, and the monkey grabs the jewel. But can't get his hand up describing the jewel. It's that it's all goes back to me. I'm the consumer that's like wanting a fucking T1 line. I could easily just like, no, I'm just going to get another internet thing. It's like all what I think the reason it's so particularly disturbing is that it's my it's my fault. Yeah, if I really gave a shit about my life, I would just be like, no. But it's still their fault because it's something where how come this is don't they want to they want you to have it? It's a premium service. They make money off. No one wants anything at AT&T because it's diffused among the infinite number of people that the corporation has no intent or will. It's a zombie. It doesn't want a thing. If this is just like this thing here, this is just like a number that pops up on a stack of probably thousands of sheets. There's just it'll say suicide, suicide, suicide, suicide risk, suicide risk, suicide risk, suicide risk 2.4, suicide risk 6.5. There's no like there's no there's no like, you know, even if like some somehow like putting this on the podcast, it got back to AT&T, it wouldn't it wouldn't mean it doesn't matter. The thing is so massive. It's unstoppable. It's not like you're and especially it's unstoppable when idiots like me are not cancer, like you're just not like, no, I'm not going to be. I'm not going to get you as my service. But they've got the fucking fiber, baby. The only ones have the fiber in the area. The only ones at the fire. They're the only ones who have the fiber because it's like only one company owns in one area. Right. Is that how it works? I think so. Yeah. And so you're just kind of it's like it's like a drug dealer. Yeah, it's like it's like you're a heroin addict and there's one dealer who's got the heroin and no matter how much you want to assert dominance, doesn't matter, it all comes down to the basic essence of capitalism, which is supplying a man, baby. They've got the product you want it. They're the only ones with the product and there's nothing you can do about it. No, so except not have it. Except not have it. Yeah, except not have it or just stay at home. Day after day, you know, maybe this isn't actually more of an example of like what happens with communism when the state is the only dispenser of items and you're just doomed, maybe this is like more of an example of what it was like in the Soviet Union when everything was fucking just state run. Right. And the state provided the jeans. What's that? Oh, God, the sacks, dude. My fantasy is that when the installer comes, I'm going to play that sacks music. You should loud as I can. You should also have a hold them up at gunpoint. You should force them to stay in your house for three days. Oh, you're staying here, buddy. You're here now. Hope your cards are a good spot because you're not leaving. Dude, that is a great fucking movie. Like like that stupid falling down with Michael. Yes, somebody kidnaps their AT&T guy. Dude, I keep thinking they need to be a remake of falling down. It definitely does. There's so many times when, like, I feel like that is just right. It's right. It's right here. Nothing's changed. It's the same thing. It's only gotten worse if you think about it in terms of falling down things, the things to fall down about. So this time would be like it could be like not like some guy wearing a with like stodgy old clothes and stuff would be like a regular regular dude who's loses his mind. That would be the best because he was kind of like an older generation. Honestly, this is it. I think we've thought of the movie. We've got it right, which is just a guy who's been in his house for three days waiting for fucking an AT&T tech and the guy finally shows up and he freaks out and captures the AT&T tech and then tortures him over the course of a couple of days. Then it becomes Stockholm syndrome where they fucking fall in love. Or just, you know, like one of those classic Japanese torture porn horror movies where it isn't like there's no real plot. It's just just brutality after brutality. It's just no just, you know, slicing off the very top layers of his eyeball. There's no goodness. There's no goodness at all. And just it's just the saxophone just keeps playing and keeps. The guy's like shitting and pissing. Hello, Duncan. Yes, this is Duncan. Hi, Duncan. I apologize for the whole digital genesis, but I have your call. He's from U.S. Moving forward, he'll be the one to assist you further. Thank you, gentlemen. You're welcome. I'll leave you both now so you can have this issue settled. Great. Hello, Duncan. Yes. How are you doing? Well, not the best. OK, so so he just updated me about what's going on with your account here. So you have somebody supposed to come out today and are they supposed to do an insulation, I believe? Yes, I moved into a new house and there's no internet here, obviously, because it's a new home and this is I've been strung along now for two days. There was four separate appointments they were supposed to someone's supposed to show up at and no one is no one showed up and no one has even called me at all. Even though multiple times I was told I was going to be called and it was always on me to call up and wait on hold for I've probably been on the phone at this point for about five hours, literally on the phone for five hours. So it's so frustrating here. I just I honestly don't know what to do because I mean, you could tell me right now that someone is going to be here in the next hour. And honestly, I wouldn't believe what you're saying because so far people have canceled, not even canceled, they just haven't shown up. And no one's even told me that no one's coming. Like I would understand if I oh, there's been a problem. The technician will be an hour late. Fine. But I've had to I've had to do all these things. I've had to pay someone to go pick up my children at school because I was waiting on the person I've had to spend all this extra money on my own because I've been basically held hostage at home, waiting on someone who never shows up. And I guess I just feel at this point, I don't know. What do you think I should do? Well, I'm going to say this like I'm on the BFA team, I'm sorry about what you're going through. I know I've been through myself personally. And that's never, never a good thing. It's usually tedious, tedious experience to go through. This is this is beyond tedious. You know, so what I'm going to do is I mean, I can get you over, I can get you over the loyalty if you want. I don't know if you already gave the details about them supposed to be coming today. Yeah, I mean, what what details are that? Because they've they've they supposed to have already been here by now and they're not here. So yeah, they were told to come today between well, it says 1 PM here. Yeah. So yeah, they should they should definitely be there now. No, they won't. But they won't be a little late. But I really hope they do actually show up and not reschedule on your game. Because that's not that's not that's not good. But yeah, they're supposed to be out today. I could also get you over over the loyalty as well. What is that feeling? Basically, your loyalty department, they can give you any they can basically if you're having a problem with the services that were you know, I mean, and having any issues with what's happening, you can tell them to give you for motions or whatever they can to you know, I mean, try to satisfy such a customer after what you're going after what you're going through. So I mean, I can get you over to them and they can be and collecting only thing I can do is I can just give you the information that we have on files for when they're coming out. What does it say? I can change and or I can change that. It says they're coming. It says everything's still pending. OK, I just still pending right now. So it looks like they never rescheduled anything. Everything looks like it's going to happen. But that's the thing is that this has already happened four times where they've they've not rescheduled either and I've called up and they said they're coming. And it's just like what's happening right now is the same thing has happened to me with four other people I've talked to. So I guess I just understand how obviously you're a different person than who I talked to. But I can't think you're seeing anything in front of you that's any different than the four other people I've talked to previously. And I can guarantee you that's probably your accident. Correct. I'm pretty much seeing the exact same thing. Right. They've seen and they probably already told you just like I've heard it before. Are you even seeing do you even have a record of me calling and this happening? Like is it showing like a record? OK, so I'm not like crazy in saying that this is this is just keeps happening and nothing's nothing's changing. Nothing's going forward. So we have a record on here. And like I said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Half of it to you that you're going through this. Yeah, like I said, it's not it's not the best deal to go through. And it's very frustrating. Well, I guess I can get you over the loyalty if you do want to them to like you see if they can offer you anything special. Yes, please. Now you're going through. You know what I mean? That's fine. I guess that's all we can do right now. And then, yeah, like I said, everything's still pending. It looks like they're still going to come out today. OK. OK, what will I do if they don't? If they don't come out? Yeah. I know they're supposed to show up for one and they're supposed to let you know and they haven't done either of those things. So that's not a good thing at all. No, definitely supposed to let you know what's going on. I guess it's in the area. But at the same time, you know, that's just on the technician, I guess, so that's supposed to come out there. It's supposed to let you know, though. You know what it sounds like? It sounds like maybe these technicians should be fired. You know, some people that just, you know, you just don't know what they're up to. They could be they could be taking taking massive dumps and they could be they could be actually doing it. Bogged down with current jobs that they're on. You know, I mean, yeah, they get bogged down pretty hard. You don't have to say about that. Life is a problem. Right. OK, I'll be connected to loyalty, please. I appreciate that. Yeah, for sure. Definitely. And again, thank you for calling AT&T. My name is Kyle. I'm going to get to loyalty and just bear with me. Thanks, Kyle. No problem. Can you believe it? It's the craziest fucking thing. How much how much free internet do you want? They already gave me a month. You need three, maybe five. I five thousand. I just want the fucking internet. I know you do. That's the that's the big that's the big irony of customer service is that all you want is the thing that you want. The funny thing is this is maybe a new job is like somebody who like negotiates with massive soulless corporations for you when you're getting fisted by I love it, the fucking apocalypse, because it's like I don't have to deal with it because it's not me. So I can like look at it from a different almost like a like a puzzle. I can't do it. Like I'm like in Game of Thrones. I'm like, if you wait, you don't watch that, do you? I love it. Yeah. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like Greek at this point. I just my lip starts trembling and I just like I just shake. I don't know what to do. You know, I'm like, again, because what this means is like I said they're inviting me to stay at my house for another day. Yeah. You know, which I can't I can't do that. I mean, there's so many things I just I just want to go for a walk. Right. Get outside. Beautiful day. I can't wait to drop this all on him. But you can't even go for a walk. I can't even go outside. I'm developing rheumatism. I've got fucking pneumonia. I just want to go outside. That's all I just want to go outside. I want to like walk the dogs, get some exercise. I want to go get shelving. I want to and the thing is, is I'm listening to myself talk. I'm thinking, oh, this is the sound of. This is the sound of the apocalypse. It's the hymn of it's like this is the sound of like how it used to be that you would just you wouldn't fucking be worried about a T1 line. You'd be up to your fucking knees and some string manure. You'd be, oh, yeah, you'd be up to your knees. That'd be great, though. Maneuver is clean, good, fresh manure. Yeah, you'd be up to your fucking knees and manure. Just just shoveling, grinning ear to ear and shoveling, shoveling. The kids are out there playing them a newer too. No sacks playing. It's a good idea for a serial killer movie. There's someone who plays that shit. Like, you know, you're about to get murdered when you hear that. Yeah, oh, shit. Oh, yes. Hello. Hi, yeah, we got them on the other end here. I just brought you right now on hold. So just bear with me while I get them on. OK, great. But the lady I talked to yesterday, I was like, hey, do you know who decided to play that sax music? Oh, and she's like, no. And that's the other weird thing is somebody made the decision. Yeah, someone was like previewing different loops of music. I'm like, no, let's use that fucking sax. They have always new things now where they can this even old stuff. Years ago, we used to have the computer has things that can tell the tone of your voice. Yeah, so if you come at them hot, even in the interactive computer menu, you get routed to a different place. Yeah, so that's why I was with the computer. I'm always very calm, like, yes. Because then you get the you know, if you come in hot, they know you're like, they'll send you to the loony, the loony area. They won't service you because they know it's like it's a whole thing. You know how you can't do something when you're angry? You can't. So they know they know that they have all these fucking psychologists. How long have we been on hold? Thirty three minutes. OK, so this is hour six with AT&T now hour six logged. The AT&T Chronicles audience. You guys, I'm sorry to put you through this. Those of you who are still listening and you're just tasting a little bit of the bitter river I've been drinking. The better river. I'd be a cool name for a podcast or just something. The bitter river. Wormwood, man, I just want to stream after. But once I get that sweet T1, get some fucking cameras set up. That's you could. I'll be able to stream in like 4K, I think. I don't know what the upload. I don't know what the upload speeds are. Well, the history of uploads, he's probably going to be. It's going to be five. That's what I get you, man. I'll be five and be PSO4. Dude, we don't we don't want you. Oh, hi, sir. What are you doing with that much uploading? Typically, we'd only have like a content distribution platform using that. All of our customers are very happy with the download because they're just consuming media. Are you, sir, are you are you sending media out? Are you profligating media? Hang on, I gotta piss. I'll be right back. We have a second tier for if you're actually a media provider, sir. And that's a different rate altogether. John Coltrane with the bad blues. Living my life inside my house.

I got this on the line here. OK. I mean, this is a. Yeah, this is the world's ATT loyalty department and she's going to help you. She's going to give you some more answers on what you were talking about as far as what we can do for you about this. These mischedules. OK. Got it. OK. Yes. You have yourself a great day, Duncan. Thank you for calling AT&T. Thanks, Kyle. And thank you again. Peace. Hi, Krishna. Melissa with AT&T and I do also want to apologize for the trouble with the delay with the service. I know how much of a huge inconvenience that is. And I would certainly be frustrated as well. They let me know that you were looking for some type of compensation for the delay. And I'll be more than happy to see what we can do because this is certainly not the experience that we want you to have as a new AT&T services. That's correct. It's the only number I have. OK, perfect. So much. I know the Kyle, he said that he reviewed over the status of the service that there was a delay. I know a little will still be follow up there for you. And then besides wanting to see what else we can do to compensate for the delay, were there any other questions on this account or any other AT&T services that you have that you need help with? I mean, really, for me, it's just the thing of I don't I also don't know what to do because if I had to spend all this money, because I've basically been sort of kept kept captive in my home for the past three days because I've been waiting. I've been told multiple times, four times at this point that they were on their way, literally, and not a soul has showed up and no one, not a single person has ever called me, even though they have my number. So it's this thing where I just have constantly I've been on the phone. I think I've kind of now for six hours now. So that's the time on the phone. So, I mean, it's just something where I don't know like right now they're supposed to have been here by now and it's past the time I'm supposed to be here. I have no hope whatsoever that anyone will show up at this house today. So I just I mean, I would see I would love to have and I have to pay for this service for four or five months, but at the same time, in order to not pay for the service, I have to have the service and I don't even have it. So it's like this idea of you giving me credits for something that doesn't exist. I just that's why it's like an existential nightmare here. I don't even know what to ask of you. Obviously, you're a wonderful person and I'm sure you have literally nothing to do with what's going on here. I just don't I'm just sort of at my wits in because it's like how many times do I let myself be abused before I walk away? And I feel like at this point, it's just I don't know if it's worth it to get this service if it's somehow like it just keeps going on. I'm in the fifth circle of hell here. And I'm paying for I'm literally paying to be abused. Order of the different changes were a date put in and that doesn't work. The order, it looks like there was initially a a further out date, not till 2036, which normally means that there's some type of facility errors that are there. But it's two thousand. It's like how what is that? Two thousand thirty six. What is that? What does that have to reference to? That's like we'll all be dead by then. The order on hold. I can see that it was put on hold a couple of times. So our version of hold is changing the date, the due date to December 31st, two thousand thirty six, meaning it's on hold. Do you get is that what the apocalypse is supposed to be? What is that date? That's an arbitrary is an arbitrary date. It's a random date that our system automatically does when the order is on hold due to facility issues. We have to get that fixed. It sounds like your system knows something that we don't. Oh, that's scary. And that's not the date that showing your today, it shows that your due date was supposed to be today. OK, but I just wanted to point out that I can see that your service order, it was on hold a few times and it looks like we were under the impression that it was fixed and that there was a due date put in the 18th and the 19th. I see it now. So again, I sincerely apologize, but I can clearly see from what you've mentioned and the technician that you've certainly been through a lot with the changes here. I'm just getting this order pulled up here. Are you saying that all life on earth will end December 31st, two thousand thirty six? Oh, of course not. That's just something random that the I'm sure that the system has picked just the date plucked out of the air that's far enough in advance and Harvard putting your order on hold. Oh, OK. Yeah, just a random number. Just just it's nothing, just a random number. Yeah, just random. Yeah, let me. Strictly on that in the calendar. Circle December 31st, two thousand thirty six better get your shit done. Maybe they know we're going to die. That's it. Maybe it's my personal service. I'm showing that this is for the Internet alone. Did you have any other AT&T services? No, that will do me. They still there? Yeah, OK, I got it. The information to come up fully. At first glance, I could tell that the installation, I know that was already waived on one of the things that occurred here. OK. Sorry for the delay, just waiting for this morning to come up. It's OK. I'm building a fire. Oh, OK. Got brisk weather here. Imagine. You know what they say, wind is a brisk business. Yep, that's what they say. I'll abort myself just farther up north. Oh, cool. And it's pretty brisk up here. Yeah, wind is a brisk business. Ask, ask. Am I supposed to just wait here for the rest of the day for a bit? Shit's loading. They'll have such shit computers. So you're trying to get the information here or I'm just just curious. Yeah, I'm just checking to see what else we can do with the service here. OK, do you know what should I continue to wait today because the window has passed? Yeah, I mean, although I mean, the window is passed, the appointment is still. I mean, it's still here. I mean, it's still here. How about let me just check one other system. I was looking to see what other options with the service here. I know the technician said that he already checked for today's time. But let me check the window and see what's going on. It's still being expedited or not. Like it means that I put on late. But you haven't gotten a call yet. I think it means that they haven't ever called. Well, they haven't ever called, actually. Some things amuck. I think maybe the computer is trying to destroy humankind or some of these technicians are have a severe drug problem. Or some there's something in their life that maybe maybe someone's had an accident and they don't want to report it or just just some sort of something foul. Well, I've checked the tech notes here and show it says that this is assigned to a technician. I want to see if I can message the technician at all, if I'm able to reach him. I mean, this is I've honestly I've been through all this before. This is just we're in a cycle now, I think this is just my life now. It seems like the previous technician you spoke to, did he also try and reach the technician? Never spoke to anyone. I spoke to someone the first day and that person was completely not helpful. They acted like I was a lunatic for asking them and how I'd been connected with them. And the fact that they they couldn't even give me a time when they would be here. I was like, well, can you at least tell me when you're going to show up or something? Like, we don't know. Which is I don't know how you don't even at least offer to reschedule. Hey, maybe you can come a different a different day. But that wasn't even presented as an option. I honestly feel like we're in like a some sort of a weird dictatorial regime that's about to fail, like a failed state. That shouldn't be the case. If the appointment is missed, then we should we should negotiate having a new date in and if that wasn't done, then again, I sincerely apologize. Yeah, different previous thing is I was under the impression that that was done before. Let me let me just check in here. Is this the strangest thing? It's the strangest thing, dude. What's being checked? I don't get that. I'm on mute right now. It's the weirdest thing. This has been going this this could theoretically go on infinitely. How long have we been talking AT&T 48 minutes? So like this is like a double pot. This is just a two part podcast, one part, our conversation. The second part, the most boring phone call. Those of you who are still listening, you guys are fucking incredible. I'm not. I don't think I'm going to edit any of this either. I think it's pretty good, though. It's kind of it's kind of nice up and down or now we're weaving. I want people to experience the the the the the horror. This is what horror looks like. We're still like, what is she checking? I don't know what I'm going to ask. Hi, just checking in. How's it going? For me, yeah, just I just not hearing anything. Oh, are you what's being checked right now? Check the notes. Yeah, I'm sorry about the delay. I'm just checking on the notes here to see since you were asking about the appointment and you said you hadn't heard anything about the previous appointment. Right. So I'll check to checking on that. Since the the tech other the tech site that we're able to check, it still has the same appointment for today. And it says it's assigned to someone, which normally if that's the case, that means someone should be on their way. But like I said, wait, right. But this is the fourth. This is now no one's here. And this is the this is the third day. And this is the fifth appointment now that's been been missed. So also, I've been on the phone now for about seven hours. It's I've been on the phone just now for the past 50 minutes. So it's almost one hour. And nothing literally nothing has changed whatsoever. No, and I'm sorry, because the technician who connected you over, he I was under the impression that he already went over what was happening with the appointment that there is a delay, that he was connecting you here to see if there's something else that we can do for compensation of the appointment being missed. Yeah, I would love that. Yeah, as far as that, that was the first thing I was checking before you were asking me about the date not being notified. That's why I kind of veered off into a different direction. OK, so for the initial portion of the call, I can see here that with the service itself, it already shows with the waiver of the install. So that's taken care of also at your cost is discounted. Normally I'm ten dollars more and we did get an extra discount off of the base rate of the service being that it's in it alone. You mean taking off the monthly charge or what? Discounted off of the monthly charge. So for for how long? That is it's for a year. So they sent it alone. It's normally ninety dollars for the one thousand. And with the extra ten, that's changing it to ninety. And then the install, it's normally ninety nine dollars. So that means we need some previous calls due to the trouble. I think it needs to be less a month. Yeah, there's let me double check here. Normally the cost is less when it's combined with another service. I'm supposed to wait here so far. I think it should be the whatever that cost is then. Yeah, it's a difference of ten dollars. The extra discount that we can get to get it down to seventy is only when it's bundled, your cost is normally the one. Can you just make it seventy as though it were bundled then? Yeah, I can't make it seventy. But what I can what I would recommend is once the service does start, then we can do about maybe getting a month's credit in for you. And I'll make it here. I've already been given a month's credit. Well, there's no credit yet because your service hasn't started yet. But if you've already been offered to have one month's credit in addition to this ten dollars off and in addition to the ninety nine dollars more for the install. But it looks like those are the three things that we normally do. OK, well, that's what you normally do, but I normally don't have to wait three days. No, I do understand. There's there's just nothing else that I can put on the service like you mentioned earlier is a service that hasn't started yet. Right. So that's by what I would recommend is once the service actually comes on and starts starting to work and your bill comes off, comes out, then, of course, we'll be able to go from there. But as far as extra discounts, as if it's bundled, that's something that no one can change unless it's actually combined billed with something else. You have to have another AT&T service. Any any like the cell phone or or right, but we're just talking about numbers here. You can actually do anything you want. That's sort of something that's that's an arbitrary construct. I mean, it's not like, well, it's literally it literally is true. Ask if I should wait for this. Here's my question. Should I should I wait for the rest of the day now or what? I mean, I just don't know how to go on living, like what to choose to do. Because at this point, I've spent hundreds of dollars for services to compensate for my inability to leave my home. So I'm just sure if I'm at this point now where I feel like I'm Sisyphus, except it's with. Delivery. I will check here and see what other date we have so that you don't have to stick around. They won't come for that day. But I didn't have a different mission, but I didn't hear back from him. I think this technician is AWOL. Just say if they create another day, if they create another day, it's going to happen on that day. Usually we can tell us representatives are in. In this case, as a technician, it may be a little different, but I just. I don't know where I can do an instant message and I'm not hearing back. Can you give me the technician's phone number name? So I don't have a phone number for him. But the technician that's assigned, I can see his first name is Jesse. I can tell that. Where does Jesse live? Phone numbers I have. I'm sorry. Does Jesse have like a way I can contact him? Is he have an address or a appeal box or something? No, there's no there's nothing like that. In our system, we there's a link up to the order where I can send a like a sort of instant message to the technician. I was hoping that through tech support. And again, I don't know all of what you went over because it sounds like I was given half information and I'm so sorry. The I thought maybe the previous technician did the checks to try and communicate with this technician to see what's going on since he's still assigned to it. Yeah, that has happened and we can do one of two things. I can I can recheck and see what the next available due date is here. And we can we can try again and change this. I'm just afraid that with the with what's happened with the address, if I make a change here, I just don't want another missed appointment. But the missed appointments already happened. Like, like, I just don't know. I don't want to put another date in that may not work. We can certainly get tech support involved and see what it can be expedited to and go from there. Is there someone I can speak with who has like a general overarching understanding of everything to the point where they can like have some sort of actionable intelligence with with the agent in the field where they can communicate. Actual information, not just speculation in terms of what's going to happen. Because any time I've ever done this before, I've been able to connect with the technician. The technician has my phone number when we talk on the phone. The technician calls, hey, I'm going to be there in 15 minutes. Hey, hey, I'm here and I talk to him or even even an hour before anything. I communicate with the technician because they're the ones doing the work to the point where we can we can use our what people do is they communicate and we figured out and everything's fine. Because right now I'm being run through a series of different phone numbers. And I spoke to three people today alone. And it's just this thing where there seems to be no one has any. No one knows what's going on. It's like the hand doesn't know what the head doesn't know what the hand is doing. And it's it's I'm just I'm a prisoner in my home. Let me ask you this, Duncan. What did the previous technician advise you of this appointment before he connected you to me? He said it was before one o'clock at that point. So he still had hope that someone would show up. But now it's it's oh my god, it's 20 minutes past one. So obviously he was he was thinking that maybe someone might still show up because it was still within the window. But now we're we're past the window now. No, I understand that was certainly a possibility unless or something has happened to the technician, which I hope is nothing serious. Well, I at this point, I kind of hope does something does something serious does happen. Maybe he goes to a meeting and or connects with a loved one and sees things clearly or something. Some sort of a maybe a breakthrough or like an epiphany of sorts. Because something's happening in that van. And it's not moving. Yeah, no, I understand. Maybe he's being held hostage. Anything is possible, but let me do this. Anything's possible, except getting that bundle rate without the bundle. That, yeah, that is certainly out of my range. And and as far as the cost, that's why I advise bill wise. We would have to wait until the start. Wait until it starts. OK. We'll make a change there to see if there's some other way to help compensate offsetting for that difference. Yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'm sorry again, Duncan. I know that you're frustrated and I wish there was I wish I was a technician. I can fix this for you. Me too. I'm just trying to help here. So if you don't mind holding, I can give a call back to tech support and to see if I can get a hold of someone who is able to reach out or find out what's happened to this previous technician if someone else is in this place. Can I ask one thing? Can so can someone call me on my phone? Because I've been on hold here for so long now. OK, I understand. But and I know that you're you've been on hold and you're wanting this taken care of right away. So being honest, if you do need to drop the line and go, I don't blame you. I can set this for a follow up just a follow up to usually take one to two days. OK, I'll hold. I'll hold. OK, I'm just being honest. OK, I know you don't mind holding. I will go ahead and call and see if I can get someone to answer for you right away. OK, and if so, then I'll be able to connect you to them to get that taken care of. God, I'm ready to hold. And if anything happens here during our call, you'll be by phone or text one moment, please. All right now. Isn't this wild? I got a piss. OK, OK. What the sanity? This is the future, dude. This is this is the craziest thing. You know, I think I think it's an AT&T thing. What do you mean? There's something about AT&T because it's the oldest telecom telecommunications company. Yeah, I think there's some shit because they're so old that there's like these weird legacy kind of like baffles. There's like weird old things that have in place that have to do with old operator, something that doesn't something that Time Warner did. Yes, something that doesn't doesn't happen anymore. Like with Time Warner, because they're like a cable company. I just think that that's what it is. I think it's some weird shit where they. It's just I think it's just corp. It's a corp. It's a massive corporation with a million departments. And it's this woman doesn't really understand what's happening. And the people in tech support don't know what's happening. And no one really understood. There's no way to like there's no cohesion. No. And there's not a person. This is but this is what's amazing because it's this dystopian bureaucracy, essentially, that is like amazing in the sense that it's literally it could drive a person insane. Like this is the kind of thing that like you could have a heart attack. You could like just eventually just go nuts because you can hear it's like something is Joseph Heller. It's like you can you can you can hear like, OK, we can do something. But it might take two days for that thing. You know, or we can do this thing, but she's going to come back. Having spoken to someone who's going to say either something about the outside line and two technicians coming, but it'll always just be more confusion. We're vagary. And it'll also what's really funny is no one for the past three days has been able to get in touch with the technicians. And the specialist just answered. OK, now got it. Well, that's the account. Great. Thank you so much. So now they have a specialist, which I've I've gotten to a specialist level. This is like a video game. I have a specialist. I've gotten this specialist level a couple of times. This the specialist essentially what it comes down to is you you need to call the tech person. Yeah. But my theory is that the tech person is in a backyard, slowly being eaten by pit bulls. That's my theory is that for a couple of days. And I or maybe the technician has been kidnapped and he's praying. He's like, please, God, please, God, please, God, someone's got to just know. I'm not answering the phone. Yeah, I'm not showing up. So and we might be saving a life right now. It might be like because I picture this guy. God, I can't believe this. Oh, I know. I just can't believe how long it's like a thing. It's just incredible. New music, at least this is good stuff. It's good jazz. Well, we've got next level. We've gotten into an upper level. Ladies and gentlemen, we're in jazz two now. This is this is distinctively less annoying. This is almost like a pink panther type thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's baby. It's going to be cool. Well, no, it's like a mystery because the technicians like one thing we know, the technician Jesse, he's got a phone, right? Like you and all you need is Jesse's phone number. And theoretically, Jesse is like they know an address he's working at. Yeah. You know, and so you fantasize in your head, you start coming up with these weird fantasies, like I'm going to find the tech support center and I'm going to drive to the fucking tech support center and just burn it down. Shit in my hand and just smash it in the face of the first person. Your brain produces all these really awful things because nobody likes to be trapped. No, again, it's like all you got to do is just cancel the service. Yeah, the reality is, is that this corporation has a thing that we want and there's nothing you can do to punish them at all. You can't just be Tom Hodgkins and talk about that shit about how, like, you know, like any company that you get service from. Jesse, we're talking about Jesse here. OK, we're talking about Jesse. Yeah. Oh, I'm saying what the technician is, Jesse. Oh, yes, Jesse. Yeah, I just like to call people by name just to put a face on it. OK, I'll see if she can give out the number. I don't know if that will be possible, but I will ask. I mean, it's possible. Yes, I will definitely ask. Got it. Thank you. You're welcome. Watch out. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like when you think about it, man, like. I could have just not called and just sort of gone about my life. Yeah. And it would have made no difference because they're not coming. Right. I could have disregarded that they the appointment means anything and what's but somewhere in here. It does start entering into this existentialist. Well, you're priced in. You spent so much time. Yeah, they're not clamped in deep. Yeah. So so yeah, my my life has now become. You're invested. I mean, I'm essentially manacled to a corporate entity. Like it's like it's this kind of technological tornado that has to co-dependent relationship. Yeah. And I've been pulled into it with this collective of people who are equally confused. Like this woman doesn't really know what's happening. Whoever she's talking to probably doesn't really know much of what's happening. And every individual at AT&T, probably all the way to the very top, all the way to the top, the dude who has the triangle head with a fucking eyeball on the surface for us. Eventually, as you get up to the upper levels of AT&T, the language shifts, things I bet the higher up you get is just fax tones. In between, there is a level of like pyramid head men. You're just like walking up and eventually when it reaches some point, we're at the very top of AT&T, there's just a spinning ball of glowing black light. It's a black hole. Yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile, fucking Jesse's femur is getting not on by a fucking dog or he's like, I think Jesse is probably smoking some meth. I think Jesse doesn't know he's a technician. I think that's really funny. Yeah. He's a mindless automaton who is doing stuff. He's unaware. He's like a zombie. He's like, he's like someone on Ambien. Yeah. They just are unaware that they're doing they're moving. Yeah. He doesn't know Jesse. Jesse, no, Jesse probably surfing somewhere. Jesse. He doesn't know what's happening. He's just like. Yeah. He's he's like plugged into the matrix. Yeah. And his body is doing stuff. Yeah. He just doesn't know. Yeah. He's unaware of it because he's being like he's being pacified by some sort of a grand vision. I don't think there is a Jesse. I think Jesse is like it's a prime acronym or an ancient God or something. An ancient God. Jesse is like the name of some Illuminati low level Demiurge or something or not Demiurge, a demigod that they worship. You know, Jesse, what's Jesse doing? We can't get in touch with Jesse. You need the blessings of Jesse to achieve the blessings of Jesse. Yeah. Yeah. We can't get it. Do you remember that Star Wars Star Trek movie where they had the nexus? It's this big, like crazy nebula that goes through space when you're inside of it. You're basically in heaven and like Picard and I think Kirk are both in it. And they have to realize there's one point where they're in there without chopping wood on this farm they live on and everything's so great. And they're like, oh, shit, we're in the nexus right now. They're like in perfect happiness, but they realize, oh, we're we're trapped inside this prison because we have to break out of it. But to break out of it, they have to deny this sort of heaven, this perfect cyclical heaven that they live in. How did they figure out they were in the nexus? Because it was like it was too good to be true. Did they try to get AT&T installed? Yeah, well, they had AT&T installed. And they knew like, what a second, this T1 line has been installed. This isn't right. It's like that thing, all those movies about dreams. There's a signifier to allow you to know your reality. It's the spinning top and what's it called? Inception. It's any of that shit. It's all like the what's your signifier to know that you're in. So right now, I know that we're in the real world because this is happening. Right, because you would know something's fucked up if AT&T was like, yeah, we're going to be there between 11 and one. Yeah, just a drum break. That's probably just some sort of it's literally probably just a sound design to cause you to stay alert. Meanwhile, meanwhile, you know, I have friends who I have friends who live in a van in Kauai, yeah, who are just like walking in the sand right now, eating, eating delicious Hawaiian tacos, sunning, sunbathing in the sand, not thinking about a T1 connection. Maybe listening to this music, though. No, no, this is a beach jam. This music is I guarantee this. I bet this music isn't being generated from technology. I bet that they have a laboratory chimpanzee that they figured out a way to turn its fear in the music. The electrodes power this. Oh, God. Oh, that's that's chimp fear number two. That's Jesse. Jesse is the chimps. I'm still working with the technician and just to confirm the specialist she's speaking with are the Uber Dispatch Center and evidently your order, it's been assigned to a different technician. The system I'm looking at is still showing the original person. But she's saying that as of a minute ago, she said two minutes prior, another technician has picked it up. So I'm just trying to get confirmation from her of where I can get that information confirmed to make sure someone's still coming out. What's the technician's name, the new one? That I don't know, that's why I'm trying to get confirmation from her, because I'm still seeing the previous person's name and still not knowing the person. So just continue to hold and I'm going to keep checking back until I get the answers for you. OK, thank you so much for your patience. Got it. I don't know. I was just thinking maybe having a barbecue. How far north of California do you live? I'm actually in Roderick Park, about 40, 40, 45 miles north of San Francisco. Oh, that's a nice area. That's really pretty up there. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You got to love a good farm. Cleans the air. Also super cold. Yeah. Give me one moment. I'm just going to put the magazine up on me. OK, someone's calling me right now from Gardena. Let me see it. Hello. Hi, this is Jesse with 18. Holy shit. Hey, what's up, Jesse? How's it going, man? Hey, I'm right now. I'm about to head out that way. I should be there in maybe 30 minutes. I'm kind of far, like in West Hollywood. You're definitely coming, though, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No way. How's your day going? It's been all right so far. Have you dealt with any like pit bulls or kidnappers or anything? Not not not yet. Cool, man. That great, dude. I really can't wait to see you, Jesse. I'm excited to meet you, man. Yeah, Jesse, you can be right there. That's right, baby. All right, all right. All right, I'll be there soon. So, Jesse, you'll definitely be here. Yeah, yeah. I'm about to start driving up there. Will you call me when you're when you're outside? It's hard to find. Yeah, of course. OK, great, man. Thanks. All right. It's hard to find. Just call when you're outside, Jesse. Hello? Can you switch back? Oh, we're back in hold. Holy fucking shit. You know what did it? I'll tell you what did it. What is when I asked her about me? What do you think did it, man? I think it's when I asked her where she lived and she told me she was she wasn't lying. She told me where she lives, where she works. And that activated Jesse. I think it injected some sort of reality into the equation that activated Jesse as a sleeper cell. It's some sort of thing we're like, OK, so this she's Melissa has been asked a personal question. She answered it personally because I was a sense I was about to invite her to our barbecue. We're going to have our internet barbecue because obviously I've got no I know Melissa better than most people in my life at this point. So I was about to invite Melissa to a barbecue. She lives kind of far north of San Francisco, so she'd have to drive about six or hours to get here. But, you know, this is why I tied her in, I tied her in. And so she hit that panic button. It's Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Awaken, Jesse. Awaken, Jesse. Awaken, Jesse from the Stasis Chamber. He's in West Hollywood. They had to defon that's why it took so long. He's in West Hollywood. I'm sure he's in West Hollywood. He's probably in some fucking deep underground chamber. He comes up in this special tube. Gets it gets like shot into through the sewers. Some sort of what's amazing is how happy Jesse sounds. Yeah, Jesse's like Jesse's like he's a savior. He's the state he's filled with what he's like. Somebody was just I didn't see the Chappelle special, but somebody was telling me there's something called the pimp stew. Have you ever heard of this thing called a pimp bath? Yeah, I've watched the special he talks about. Basically, yeah, how you make you trick someone into you. Beat someone, yeah. And then you give them a bath after beating them because it confuses them. And they're like feel like you're their savior as you're like washing them off. It's yeah, yo, this yo, I'm here. I just talked to Jesse. Oh, he did. He called. He called me and we spoke. He said he's going to be here in a half an hour. He's in West Hollywood, which is not where I live. And he's going to half an hour away. We talked, he sounds like everything's OK. I asked him if he's been injured. You say he hasn't been and he's got my number and he's going to call when he gets here. Great, great, great. I'm so glad to hear that. Then if he is calling, then hopefully the other person has mentioned about it being being connected to someone else, they still couldn't tell me the name. So if Jesse's still going to be able to come, great. Maybe he got my message because I got a message when he came on. Let him know, are you heading to the next job or gave your account number? But he didn't respond to me. I'm glad that he didn't call. That's great. Well, maybe maybe the both show up. Yeah, well, as long as at least one of them shows up and gets your service in, that's great. And I do want to sincerely apologize again for the delay and your patience while we've been on the phone. I just wanted to make sure at least that your needs were taken care of. If you have the direct number already for our tech support, if you need to make any other calls, do I have you registered for my app? I don't think I have the number yet. No. I will give you the number. And if you have a smartphone that I would definitely recommend in the app. Do our app as well, because that's actually the quickest way to save time. You can check order status and pending appointments as well. Cool. The number that is you ready with a pen and paper? Yes. One, eight, seven, seven, three, five, three, five, nine, seven, two. Mm hmm. And then the website, it's just ATT.com. Got it. My ATT app. Got it. The downloader app. OK. All right. Once you register for that, then you can check your order status, check appointments, everything. Once your service starts, you can do other things as well. Cool. Have a barbecue. Can I invite ATT people to come to my barbecue? And look up barbecue information. Great. Thanks, Melissa. All of that here. And now, did you have any other questions for me? Yeah. Well, I guess a couple. Do you do you like to barbecue at all? I don't actually do the barbecuing. I would in my Harry Popeal laboratory if I could barbecue in that. Oh, wow. That my husband, he likes to barbecue. So yeah, stay away from all the smoke. My friend, my my my partner, Jorgensen has a question for you. Hello. Hi. Hey, I just want to know if you have any suggestion on how we can make ourselves feel better after having lost two days of our lives waiting for AT&T to come, because we feel so sad now. I understand. And I sincerely apologize again for the frustration here that you that you both have experienced. I know that this is not the norm for AT&T being that I've been here 19 years. It's just not not a normal thing. It feels like I've been waiting for 19 years. Jorgensen. No, and I apologize again. I've reviewed with Duncan the other things that we've done already on the account due to the delay, and it was due to the initial system errors that were there that we had to update, but it looks like that's all done. May I ask I'm sorry to cut you off. May I ask you a question? OK, thank you. Do you ever think that you might be a node in a super organism that has the personality of a sociopath, Jorgensen? I'm not quite sure what you mean by that. What I mean is that you I'll explain to you. You as the end of you, I'll explain. No, let me explain. You as the individual, you are a wonderful being. You're a soul deserving of love. But the entirety of AT&T, somewhere in that massive network of employees, humanity has been discarded and replaced with something so dark and malevolent that all it wants is to absorb the life force of those waiting for their T1 connection, a kind of massive vampiric force that is intertwining into the very depths of the souls of humanity. I can understand that. Jorgensen. The idea is that you are OK and your co-workers are OK, but together they form a kind of Voltron, the toy from the 80s, a kind of super organism that has no soul. I think that we are complicit in that. Jorgensen, I'm sorry about that. He's a classics professor. He's I think what he's trying to say is that the question is, are we complicit all of us in the goings on of the super organism? I'm still not quite understanding that question. I guess if you think about I understand that he is also upset about the delay and I understand that for both of you. And again, I can only apologize. I know that we took the different steps of certain compensations that we've reviewed already on what was done with the previous delays. Right now, since the technician is coming all by at Lake, if you do have any other concerns at all, then we're certainly here. You can you can give us a call or if you are whenever you're ready for other services where we can see what great value we can get from those services. Because I'm sure you have others besides just the Internet, right? Other maybe television, home phones. Don't have those other items or areas where we can check. Wonderful. Thank you. It's Jorgensen again. I'm I'm actually, believe it or not, eager to work with AT&T and to connect every aspect of my life to AT&T. But I have one final question for you, my dear, and thank you for your patience. If you will forgive me, I just had my left leg amputated. I was attacked by a dog two weeks ago and it became septic. My question is this and I know this is outside of your range, perhaps. But personally, can you offer some advice to me and my lover here? Some advice about how we can enjoy life more? Just something you do on a day to day basis to connect more with the joy of existence itself. Yeah, I'm sorry, Jordan. That's something that I can't really discuss during this call, if I value my job. But if you have any other questions regarding your Ubers account or any other AT&T services, I would be happy to assist. Thank you. OK, I appreciate it. Thank you, Melissa. I'm going there. Melissa, thank you. Thank you. I'm going to say. You're both very welcome. Again, totally my goal from the beginning was to provide you both with excellent customer service levels. I'm sorry. Hold on a moment. You're dropping bomb on my leg. Jill, I was soon as Jesse gets here, I'll take care of it. OK, thank you, Melissa. Thank you so much again. Sorry about all the trouble. Sounds like he's in pain. I just wanted to ask you real quick, have I said anything to ensure that you were very satisfied with my overall service? You crushed it. He did a great job. Jorgensen is without, you know, he it's a it's a every day is a struggle at this point. My bills. OK, I hear you. Give me my bills. Jesse, once Jesse gets here before thank you so much. Thank you, Melissa. You too. Have a good day. Have a good day. Use the rotisserie. It's a good day. Good day for that. Thank you, Melissa. Yeah, thank you again. Good luck with that. OK, thank you so much. Good luck. Thank you very much. Oh, you're very welcome. Have a great day. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. Thanks, Jorgensen. That's much better. That's good. Thank you. Oh, you're very welcome. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry for my I'm in so much pain. It hurts so much pain. Is it is a construct? It isn't a construct. It hurts. Just please give me my bills. It's a construct. We've talked about this before. Why did you tell me to go in that yard? Because we had to get the we had to get that ball back. Otherwise, you know, Mindy wasn't going to have that. I can't run anymore. Jorgensen. Did you still have questions? We're still connected. I know. I just want to know what you would do if you were if you weren't able to do the things you loved, the pain, it haunts me. You can still read. I don't want to read. I want to run. I want to go in the woods again and walk and look at Jorgensen. Jorgi. Thank you, Melissa. I'm sorry, Jorgi, he's he's difficult at best. No problem. Right. Well, good luck with that. Good luck with the weather. I know everything's going to work out great. We're doing fine here, for the most part. He gets in these things where he's like he's a classics professor. He has his dissertation due. I feel like what happens is it exacerbates these things physically. Have you heard the book Healing Back Pain by Joseph Sarno? It's it's it's interesting as it talks about how it is from the love song of J. Alfred Blufrock, I grow old. I grow old. I shall wear my trousers rolled that you feel better. I have seen the mermaid singing each to each. I do not think that they will sing for me. That's an illusion. You know, it's the class that's he's referencing this poet that he's a professor. He knows that it's a it's an alliteration. It's not like it's an illusion. It's not really not an illusion, like an eye, but an eye. It alludes to a moment in time and in the brain, not specifically, not a literal fact of mermaids or trousers. But either way, yeah, I'm sorry, I was just trying to explain his behavior. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for helping us out. And can you send Alex our love as well? I'm sorry, I was Kyle. I always get those names confused if similar tones and similar internal tones. Yes, if we could, you could make sure that Kyle has been thanked. And also, I don't know who we spoke with. So I named Genesis. I don't know if it's his real name or not, but it's a good name. Obviously, it's a great name to start the call with with a person named Genesis. So as the as the Bible says, cool, Paul has gone, but I did know I connected you to me. And I did hope that Jeff, he did finally reach out to you. He did heading to your home today. Ask, ask, ask where we can send a card. OK, Jordan, ask where we can send a card to thank them. Yeah, is there a place? Is there an address we can send a card to to thank? Thank you, Melissa and Kyle and also Genesis. The back of your bill, there's a main address for anything mailing. I don't actually know what the other representatives are in. OK, yeah, any correspondence or if you do get a call, hopefully you'll be able to leave a message of the comments as well. And that usually happens for a while, I really appreciate that. Thank you so much. I just want to send you a card and say that even though sometimes it feels as though happiness is always outside our grasp. It's the longing that is the grace. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's a good point, actually. All right, I know you want to send in the main AT&T address for any correspondence. It's listed on the back of your bill. OK, what paper list, though, I believe. Then you'll just want to check if you check the through the my ATT app. OK, you get version of your bill and it will still list all the same information because all the pages will show there. One more thing, one more thing. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. When I was a child, I held a dandelion. I held a dandelion and I blew it and the little drifting seeds made me think of the souls of all of us. I do need to go. OK, sorry, Melissa. He just has for both of you this weekend and you enjoy the rest of your day. Likewise. Good luck with the rich history. OK, take care. Thank you. Bye, Melissa. Bye bye. Thank you so much. Bye bye. Appreciate everything. Thank you again. My pleasure. Great. Thank you. I want to thank you as well. And in the words of in the words of Daniel Fanay, your thing. My thanks to you is a thousand stars burning bright. May it light the darkest of your. This is Jordan's. Give me the phone. May it light the darkest of your nights and may it be a guide stone in your mind. I've talked to her. I know you want to share this information with me, but respectfully, unless there are other AT&T business, I would need a phone. OK, OK. Bye, Melissa. You appreciate it. All right. Bye bye now. Bye. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sorry. We don't. I didn't mean to say I think of the courage poem. A damsel with a dulcimer and a vision once I saw. She was a fair Abyssinian maid and on her dulcimer, she played singing of Mount Iberra, could I revive within me that symphony and song to such a deep delight would win me that with music loud and long, I would build those domes and those sunny domes, those caves of ice, those ice, those wonders, those crickles, those crows. Thank you. Thank you, Melissa. Sorry, he just keeps taking over as he always does. We'll let you go. OK, go for it. Go ahead. You got it. You're free to free to roam, free to roam. Free range. Wanda free, my dear, into the great green hills of your life. And since you're both staying on the line, is there something else that you're needing assistance with since you're not hanging up? I want to make sure your knees are covered. Thank you. I need I need the assistance that you give yourself to find a lover that you truly connect with a life of meaning, but most importantly, that you love with all of your being. Planet cash. Because you don't know it can change on a dime. I was jogging in marathons and a dog chewed my leg. You asked for it. And that's because of you, Duncan. That's because of you. I have nothing to do with that. You know that you told me to go in that yard. I asked you if you wanted to go in that yard. Hi, Melissa. Sorry about that. He he I my hands are tied. I'm just asking, are you able to disconnect the line? I don't know what that means exactly, but I don't think of the phone. Are you able to hang up the phone? Oh, this phone, this is a cell phone. So it's just like a it's just an iPhone. We don't have we don't have a traditional handset. All option on the iPhone. In call. Other terms, if you can press the in call option, if you're done with me, I would appreciate that. I'm just not familiar with I don't personally know about that feature. It's like a merge iPhone. Right. iPhone button that says in call or disconnect. However, you hang out the call on your previous calls when you talk on your iPhone. I never do, actually. I'm always using it in the Bluetooth or I do the thing where it's the satellite device that is it's connected to it. So I never end up, I guess I didn't realize that. I don't I'm always just waiting for someone else. I think I don't I've never actually had to do that. Hang up the phone. Jorgensen, you don't know it. You don't have no idea what I'm talking about. Let her go. I've done. I've said, Melissa, thank you so much. Like a dolphin and a net, you monster. Let her go. Melissa, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. OK, bye bye. All right, bye bye. It's supposed to hang up now, right? It's best to hang up. I'm so sorry, Melissa. There's no hang up button. He is ruined my life. I have and now he's trapped you on the phone. As he's trapped me in this chair, in pain, in sorrow, in bitterness, all because I loved him once and now I am doomed. This is a temporary this is a temporary state. You know, OK, have I disconnected here? I think I've done it. OK. I think it's disconnected. You are a bastard. You kept her on the line for an hour. No, I didn't. You kept her on the line. I have not at all. That's not true at all. Look at you. I was on hold. Look what you've done to her. The same you've done to me. I was on hold. I can't control. The same you do to all of your lovers. I was on. I had no control over that. I was on hold. I was waiting. We've been waiting here. You are waiting the last two days. I was. Because I can't fucking walk anymore. You bastard. There's nothing to do with me and you know it. Hello. Is anyone here? I'm trying to make it. I'll call. I'm going to call. I'm going to call David and tell him what you told me. Hello. Yes. Hello, David. Yes, this is still Melissa. Oh, I'm sorry. I was trying to call David, our friend David Jim. Oh, no, you haven't hung up from the line here. But what I'll do if you're OK with it, then I'll go ahead and drop the line. Is that OK? I can't hang up. Wait a second. Let me just try calling David here. This this should this always does it when I do the new call. You will not call David. You will not tell him on me. Don't make your call because we've resolved everything. Yes, yes, that's true. I'm just trying to make a new call here and I can't seem to. I just want to make a new call. OK, wait, wait a minute. Let me go ahead and release the line. You have ruined her. Hold on. I'm releasing now and I do thank you again for calling 18. Melissa, thank you so much. OK, you're very welcome. Bye bye. OK, here we go. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, my fucking god. It's going to have something to talk about for the next three weeks. Oh, Jesus Christ. Wow, what a journey we just went on. Here's the other thing is Jesse's still in here yet, man. I know, dude. I know. And he might not come. It's like a but I think you know, that is that the call from Jesse. The fact that we captured that you have his number, too. I have Jesse's number. Ostensibly, it's maybe his number. Man, holy shit, you guys who are still here. Thank you for taking that journey with us. That what you what you've just listened to truly is just the climax of the last three days of my life dealing with AT&T. And now, thanks to your patients and Johnny's help here, you're we're going to have a fucking T1 line. And theoretically, I'll finally be able to stream this motherfucker. And you also may be able to use that to purchase the latest cassette in the Starburns cassette series called Recorded for Quality Assurance from Johnny Pemberton, which features the greatest of customer service calls made by myself. You're a master. It's coming out in February. Yeah, that was amazing. That was artful. You were that was just that's just, you know, it's like a little taste. And you're this tape is just a series of calls. Yeah, it's not like that so much, but it's it's a little more, a little more. Less is more comedic, I guess you could say it's also a little more condensed. That was I know. I mean, I what do you think I should edit this down or should I just give them the whole fucking enchilada? I don't know. It depends on what you have. Maybe I should like put the whole the entirety up on Patreon if someone just wants to suffer and then I'll cut out the I don't know that. But there's something about the dreary, long, there is length to like really get across the horror of the thing. You know, I'll just thanks for you guys. I'll I'll just put it in the intro. OK, the last part of this is an hour with a great ending, but a long build up. So people don't maybe can skip to the end or something. But it is people need to hear that because it's kind of like how often it's like putting a stethoscope into Satan's asshole. It's like hearing the rippling pulsation of the intestinal tract of Satan is what that is. It's like hearing the fucking mucusy, bubbling innards of the devil. Because it's so it's all it's all with that face, the face of, oh, hi, yes. God, you know, we can't do that. We can't do that. We can't, you know, the bundled package. And if we wanted to re-bundle your package, then maybe we could send a signal to the end of what's really funny is when she said that that was the best. The invitation to do more stuff with AT&T is really funny. It's like it's it's like the like it's as though if you're of an it's like if a flu virus could call you and ask permission to continue to spread through your body. Like, hey, you know, I'm down here making your stomach pretty fucked up. I was wondering, would you be cool with me getting into your lungs? You know, if you spend a little bit more money, it might be a little bit better. Yeah. Yeah. Let me just spread. Let me just spread into your mucus membranes. What do you think? Well, you know, if you let me do a little bit more, should give me a little bit more to work with, I might be able to give you a little bit more. Yeah, that's crazy. Oh, you know what? Your problem might be because you're not giving us enough to work with. Wow. Maybe if you invested a bit more, are you serious about working with AT&T? Well, you know what? I think that we owe AT&T a big thank you for finally getting somebody out here after three days to get to the T1. I guess you guys, if you feel inclined to do it in a non-malicious, sweet way, give them a call and thank them for getting a T1 line over here for the DTFH, because we're going to be able to stream video. Melissa. Yeah. Melissa. Kyle. Kyle. Genesis. Yeah. Give them a call. And I don't, by the way, don't do it. I don't want you guys, I want to thank them. Yeah. So just sit, call them and whoever you talk to, just thank Melissa. Say, you just want to get a thank you. There's nothing more disruptive than kindness. Yeah. To thank Melissa. Kyle and Genesis for solving this problem that I've been going through for the last two days, sitting, I stink. I smell that. I really do. AT&T shut down because of they've been flooded with calls of praise. How cool would that be? Yes. Yeah. Call and thank them. Shut them down. And don't do what we just did, which is like, don't accidentally leave them on the line for a long time because they can't hang up. Just call them and do a concise sweet thank you, but certainly don't keep them on the line and definitely don't, if you do keep them on the line, don't record your calls and don't record them and get it to me, even though it's completely legal. It is legal to do because they're already recording you. But definitely don't do that, guys. Just call them and say thank you if you feel so inclined. Yeah. You definitely should not, you know, find a way to have a computer respond to intervals long enough to maintain a presence of the person on the line by continually asking AT&T tangential germane questions, using a special AI speaking program that you developed because you're saying that you can't speak. So using this program to speak for you, don't do that. Don't do that because one thing's for sure. We don't want to waste their time. Yeah. Once we're sure, we definitely do not want you to call up AT&T and keep an operator on indefinitely, like mid-air refueling by using a special computer that has enough intelligence to respond at intervals with intelligent responses that keep it germane so as to essentially take a person to the level of possibly exhaustion or falling over to be replaced with another human to a call that never ends because it's never breaching protocol that would terminate the call and don't do that. And definitely don't ask them about that mysterious date. Yeah. What was December 31st, 2036. Definitely do not circle that in your calendar as the last day that you have to live. That, you know, that's completely random date. That right there, man, that right there was worth the entire fucking day. Absolutely. Finding out that that is the date that the fucking telecom computers think that that's a good website to buy December 31st, 2036.com. Oh, that shit's taken. If you buy that, they're like, why are you buying this? What interests have you in this date? What have you to say? There are so many days. Why does this day have any special power over any of the other days? I just chose it random. Oh, you chose it random. You say, how is it that you arrived at such a number last day of the year of of our interval and sent it just that he's six. I would say forty or thirty five minutes make more sense. I'm just looking like December 31st, isn't it? Johnny, I'm excited as hell about your tape. I can't wait to listen to that. Yeah. And thank you so much for helping me with that. You know, honestly, the thing you just did, I didn't have the energy to do it anymore. Like you can hear I'm losing my voice a little bit. Yeah. That's from being on the phone with them for five, not seven hours. Right. But me personally, five, the most insane thing. Thank you for you.

Everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast Ian Edwards. Ian, thank you so much for coming to do my podcast, man. My pleasure, fam. Can you really not swim? No, I can't swim. That's 100% sure you can't swim. I was just thinking about that the other day. I don't even know how you know I can't swim, but I definitely can't swim, which is one black stereotype. It's online. That's hilarious. It's online that you can't swim. Isn't that weird? Everything about you exists in the world. I wish I was for a second, I had this awful thing. I'm like, maybe I'll tell them telepathic. That's how insecure I am. I wish I knew that. I would have believed you. I wish I knew what it's like. No, it's just one of the things that popped up. I was thinking, whoa, man, why don't you learn? I might. Oh, I don't know. I can't swim, but I wanted to double down and not being able to swim at first, and then now I might learn how to swim and then while I'm learning how to swim, maybe have some jokes about it. While I can't, I'll clown the fact that I can't proudly and double down on it, and then when I can or when I'm learning, it'll be something fun to learn. I want to leave some shit for me to learn. Right. Yeah. And that's the attitude. I have a whole list of shit I'm still afraid to talk about on stage. That's so cool, the thing like that. You're like, no, this is like magnificent material for your art form. Because good God, Almighty, what a vulnerable position to be in, man, not being able to swim these days, not being able to, like in any time period in human history, not being able to swim is bad, but during like whatever this time period is, climate change or whatever, you got to learn to swim. You got to learn fast. Yeah, probably. But before I'm like, fuck that, I'm not learning. I tried when I was a kid. It didn't take, so I just like left it alone. It's just, you're like a, probably in a past life, you were probably a sailor or something, because that was the thing. Did you know that sailors would intentionally not learn to swim? Why? Because when you're out in the middle of the ocean and your ship goes down, what are you going to do? Tread water? So they just would rather drown. Rather drown. In fact, they would swim down. Like that was something that sailors would just, if their ship went down, they would just, all right, see you guys later and swim down. Yeah, let's end this fast. Yeah, because sharks would eat you up. Eat your life. Yeah, sharks. Drowning is one of my greatest fears for somebody that doesn't know how to swim. But maybe it is one of my greatest fears, because I don't know how to swim. Do you bind to past life stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When did you start contemplating the idea that you don't just incarnate once? When I was a kid, and there used to be like these tragedies, like natural disasters, and like kids or young people would die in masses. I would be like, if there's a God, you know, back then I was Christian, there's no way he wouldn't give these people another chance to do it again. You know what I mean? I was like this, like, you know, when you grew up Christian, when you're 13, before you're baptized, or you're christened, which is a version of baptism. Were you Catholic? No, but it's the Church of England, which is Pentecostal, which is Catholic, but they just wanted to have their own power, aside from the Catholic Church. You mean Episcopalian? That's how it was raised, Episcopalian. Well, I guess it's Pentecostal, or Church of England. I don't exactly know what Episcopalian is. It's a similar thing. It's like Catholicism light. Yeah, there it is. So it's like that. So then you're christened, and then your parents or your guardians, like control of your soul or whatever, until you're like 13, when you can be confirmed. And then you're like, if you died, and then you can be judged by God, you know, however they had it planned out in their religion. What does it mean confirmed? I've always, I hear that. What does that mean? Like you're a confirmed Christian? Yeah, confirmation is like, now you accept God at the age of 13, as your Lord and Savior. And then you, every Sunday in church, when they have a communion, you get the blood of Christ, which is wine and the wafer. But before that, you don't get to eat it? No, before that, no body of Christ or blood of Christ. So you're saying during this time, you didn't believe in reincarnation? I mean, it's not a typical Christian. No, no, it's like afterwards, right? I was like, I used to wonder, so what happens? So, so now I'm confirmed. If I die, I go to heaven. That's what they say. Yeah, right? Because I've accepted. So but what happens to the people who die before they were old enough to accept God? Like, it's like, would they just go to hell? You know what I mean? It's like, that wouldn't be fair. So they must reincarnate limbo, right? Isn't it limbo? Isn't that the idea? There's some intermediary state between heaven and hell where all the unconfirmed, unbaptized children who died in the womb, folks just hang out eternally. Just be there forever. That's stone cold. So I feel like reincarnation is the only answer. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. I mean, it does seem pretty logical. I mean, it's like, it's either it's either that or like an annihilation, right? It's got to be like, because even if there was some paradise, if you were in that paradise perpetually in some unchanging state, wouldn't that gradually devolve into like a hell realm or something when you get bored, so bored not dying? I don't know. Like, I wonder if there is a threshold for fun. Like every fun I've ever had has always ended. So it would be, I'm willing to find out if there's a threshold for fun. If there's like, man, I don't want to have any more fun. I'd like to have that problem. Yeah, me too. Well, you know, like there's those famous like forms of epilepsy or something that caused you to have like 10 hour orgasms if you heard of this shit. Yeah, it's like, and I think I saw a story on it and this woman committed suicide because it was having an orgasm. What's the longest you've ever come? Less than a minute. Oh, yeah. Like it usually lasts, it's quick, man. I don't mean the longest, for me, that's the longest I've ever had sex, but like, sorry, easy joke. But like the longest, you know what I'm saying? Like, if you were to extend an orgasm by 10 minutes, I think four minutes in. But I'm thinking not even orgasm, I'm thinking like euphoria. But I've seen like that the documentary or something on a woman or several people that can't control, they just keep coming or having orgasms and they can't work and shit like that. And that is miserable. Yeah. Yeah, that is miserable. Embarrassing. Yeah, embarrassing and miserable. They're afraid to go out because they don't know if they're just gonna come or have an orgasm in front of people. So yeah, that's gotta be, it sounds cool. But yeah, it's not. Whoever dates them is like, was that me? Or did you have a seizure? Is that me or him? Like, focus here. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing coming, looking at that? Yeah, looking at that guy. Yeah. And then everyone you meet, like it's gonna, whether, unless they're like really hyper compassionate, they're gonna probably do like this weird little giggle that you've heard so many times and you're like, you don't understand. I'm in hell. Oh my God. I'm in hell. You know, it's also, does that mean we don't have sex later now? Are you tired of orgasm all day? Right. So are we, it's just a weird realm to be in with a person. It would destroy your life. It's like so much of a human's life rotates orbits around orgasm, whether you want to admit or not. So much of it is like that having that moment in your week or day. And then once that gets fucked up, what a nightmare. But yeah, okay, other things. Let's think of like, what's the mo- Start hating one of the greatest feelings ever. If you're like, if like, people have diseases or illnesses or, you know, like, say, celiac disease or whatever and whatever the symptoms are. What's celiac? I think it's something to do with gluten or some shit. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Right. But what if you have like that, just the last thing on the orgasm thing, you have something that people don't take serious. So that's another level of it. Like, you having an orgasm, how bad could it be? And then like, so then now like, celiac disease or cancer or something, other people can sympathize with you. But, but you're just a person. You're just a guy who comes all the time and is bitching about it. It's got that's another level of terror to it. Oh, really? Do you come all the time when I shit my asshole falls out every time? Yeah, man. I mean, that's the problem with any kind of pleasure based disease. Like, for example, think of like, pleasure based disease. It's a pleasure. What do you have? I have a pleasure based disease. Yeah. And people are like, what? What are you even talking about? Yeah. How do you call it a disease? You know, like think of like the most famous person you know, and like, you know what I mean? Like by now, you know, you've met people who are like, super global superstars, man. And just think about how if you get to know people, you know, then you realize the amount of like their day to day experience is universally coveted. And yet, from their POV, a lot of times, they're in a weird, not so great dream sometimes, you know? And but they can't bitch about it. Is there anything worse than hearing a hyper successful person bitch about it? And like, how many fucking songs? I don't know how many weird songs hit, but I've heard so many different songs that have within it, some kind of like honest appraisal of this hell trap they've gotten themselves caught in because they're too fucking talented and charismatic. And now they're in there's no way out. You know, that's another version of the orgasm problem. Yeah, it is another and even talking about it, I still don't feel sorry for some people. Because everybody's like, well, if I'm in that position, I will enjoy it more than you are. You're still something wrong about you. That's ruining this for you. And I'm not like that. So this is your fault. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? That's the dream. That's what we hope. We hope they're damaged goods. We hope that the famous people are bitching about, you know, I was listening to some Kanye song, where he's like, and then my wife was telling me one of his cousins ripped him off. Oh, yeah, I know that song. Yeah. And you listen to like, all right. But really, you know, like my, but then like, if you just think about that, shit, man, that's betrayal in your own family. You can't trust people and you're also you're also fucking genius. But also he's like publicly mentally ill. Yeah. And so then whoa, so then you're like, that's just Kanye, he's mentally ill and talented. So that's why he's having issues with fame. What do you think? Are those two things go hand in hand or it's one a byproduct of the other? Well, I think he's his ego is I think he's mentally has mental some form of mental illness, some form of mental illness, but his ego is also bananas. I don't even know if you count the size of his ego as his form of mental mental illness, or it's two separate things that are good and bad. Yeah, you know, like, but he's definitely, definitely not normal. No, yeah, like, which is nothing wrong with that, but it's definitely not normal. Have you like, oh, it seems to me, I remember Mitzi said this to me about when I was the talent coordinator. And I don't remember which comedian it was, it like done some crazy shit. But some comedians are always doing the craziest shit, man, being on that side of the fence. You get a firsthand view of just how hilarious, insanely self destructive comedians are, you know, at least a few times a month, a comic would call up and be like, this is what I want you to tell Mitzi. Tell her to fuck herself, tell her I hope she dies, and tell her she's a witch. Now, you know, you'd have to be like, okay, okay, okay. And then, of course, you would never do that. But because within a week, you know, they're calling in spots again. But the some comedian had freaked out, which is, you know, usually happening up for there at some small degree or a major degree. And she was like, everybody goes crazy, honey. And she meant like, when a comedian starts getting in the updraft, things get incredibly wonderful for them, because it's like, Jesus Christ, they've worked so hard for this. I mean, you know what I mean? Like, you have had an amazing career. You have been a writer on some like on many hit shows. You have been a producer. You just had this like, like, you know, you work fucking hard, man. But now you're hitting this. I would say I have an amazing, amazing mediocre career, which is amazing, which is, but I would add the word amazing to it. It is amazing. I mean, you're saying insane, man, you've done so much work. And like, yeah, I know what you mean. Like, are you, I don't know, Will Ferrell? No, no, are you? No, but you've been working out here, man. And that's the most competitive. And I can say, I'm not Will Ferrell. And I can say, I'm not sure Will Ferrell has had as much fun as me. And I'm sure he's had fun. Right. So then, like, I measure shit, like, on fun more than cash, you know what I'm saying? Sure. Like, like fun is like, has to be a big part of it. Right. So there is also a fear of getting to a certain level and finding out you can't have fun at that level. So I'm like, I kind of want to make, I'm not, I'm like kind of leery of certain things, if there's no guaranteed fun there, you know what I'm saying? Oh, I'm trying to make sure. Like, how is this going to be fun? Right. Like, you don't want to get backed into some dark corners. Yeah, yeah, yeah. With your, you don't want your success to end up blocking you in some, in some shit that's not going to be fun or healthy. You mean like becoming like a series regular on a show you don't like or like, what do you mean by that? What would that look like? I don't know. I just like, I was just talking, say, well, I guess there's a lot of successful comics who are happy, like Joe's happy, Russell seems happy. Yeah. Yeah. But then I've seen the ones that are successful and not happy. So I'm not sure if it's them or it's fame. You know what I mean? Or success. You know, it's hard to tell. I don't know. I mean, I want to find out. That's for sure. I wouldn't mind finding out. Listen, if like that's the way I go out is some level of insanity brought on by some like, you know, reaching some career altitude. Fuck it. I was just watching this documentary. It's a good way to die. I want to be in control. That's what I'm, that's, that's my thing. Oh, yeah. So then that's, that's why, yeah. You want to be in control? Yeah. Like, when, when you, when you were saying your answer, I was realizing why I said what I said. And it's like, it must be, I just want to be in control. I hate not being in control. You know what I mean? So what, like, so you mean like, you hate being in an airplane, not being in control or you that I can deal with because you get conditioned to that, but just control. Like, I didn't do drugs for a long time because I didn't want to be out of control. You know what I mean? Like, I didn't want to have a career that was like, I was dependent on some substance. Right. You know what I mean? Yes. But then when I did do it, I was like, I enjoyed and accepted like the loss of control and how much fun it was. But I'm still the type of person that wants control over how I feel. And maybe I'm trying to get, and I kind of do want to get rid of that, but it's still there. The desire to be in control. Yeah, that, yeah. Without even knowing. Go to Dominatrix. I know a good one. She will fix the problem. She will fix it. You know what's crazy about that? You're right. But I would never go with your fucking right. Of course you wouldn't. You like to be controlled. You know, it's therapeutic though to some degree. I mean, a lot of like, that's what at least I interviewed her. That is so true. Mistress Justine Cross. I interviewed her and she, she was, you know, without, you know, exposing anybody. She's like the thing they say about really powerful people going to Dominatrix is that's a hundred percent true. Like the people who really want to be in control, they're tortured by it so much that going to a place where they're tied up and like wit. The most humiliating things happen to them. They have to walk around and like, you know, like beg and suck her feet and stuff. And like for them, that's like a massage. It's freeing. It's a vacation. Relaxation. I went to a clown class once. So that was when I lost control. So those are serious. I don't think people realize how serious clown, like the philosophy of clowning is. How long was this class? It was like seven weeks. Damn. Seven weeks on a Sunday, like for like two or three hours. What's the name of the class? I forgot. It was like a while ago, but it was like in this strip mall upstairs, like maybe Highland and Sunset. And, you know, I was, I went because I wanted to be a better comic. So I was like, what's, so I'm thinking they're gonna teach you like movement and shit like that. But it was just the whole thing. So when I went there, it wasn't like them teaching you movement is them trying to make you let go, let you let yourself go. So that then you create movement and not care how you looked, what people thought about you when you, when they saw you. So then I was like, Oh, so that's, so it was, it wasn't what I thought I wanted, but it was exactly what I needed. That's cool. Yeah, you can't be in control of not being in control. Yeah, you have to be fully, I guess, like, you just have to hang it up for a second, see what happens. Yeah, at least for the class. Yeah. Well, man, one of the things I love about your stand up is the, man, I feel like I am out of control at stand up. I feel like my levels are all off in general in life, my levels are always like spinning, the dials are off. And I've come to terms with this something, but I love your stand up, man. And I love the way that you kill, but maintain this like deep calm up there that's so cool to watch because, you know, that, that to me is a diss that's a disciplined, clearly a choice that you've made to be that way. And it's beautiful. But is that related to you wanting to be in control when you're working out your, do you up when you're working out your material and your set? And when you're like, up there, is it some kind of regimented, disciplined way that you approach the craft? Now it might be both me letting go and not being in control and both being in control because there's other ways to do comedy, but they might not suit me. So I might, so from now for, so the way I do comedy is like, I, I do comedy the way I am. And I can't be afraid of who I am. So I'd like to be an animated comic, but I'm not, you know what I mean? And I know I've seen animated comics kill and shit like that. So now I have to trust and stay me and be free enough to only way I can kill like an animated comic is to let go and completely be me. So then it could take my last to that level. Otherwise it's phony, right? Otherwise it's phony. It's not going to work. And I'm just being a fake crazy person. So it does help. The way I do comedy does help me be loose and be me. You know what I mean? Yeah, this, this, I don't know of, I mean, I guess because like being on stage is a compressed version of your life or something. And so, you know, like if you're going to become phony in your life or whatever, you can kind of water it down over the days and maybe cut and maybe not even be so aware of what a fucking phony you are or something, you know? But on stage, god damn, that's the shittiest feeling, man. When, yeah, have you ever experimented with that? Like where you see a comic and you see someone and you know, that is not the kind of comedy I do. But you, you decided to try it out, not stealing material. Like you're growing up as a comic, we've tried, there's been so many versions of me on stage, you know? And then the only way I get caught out now is like, because sometimes we can go adrift for ourselves. But then like, like, I'll see like a clip of Chappelle online or I saw his last special. And then I, oh, shit, that's what I'm, then I'm like, oh, that's what I'm forgetting to do. Like, I thought I was connecting while watching him or just somebody else at the time reminds you, oh, that's what you're not doing that you're supposed to be doing that you were doing and then you went adrift from it. So now I'll come back to that. You mean connecting? Connecting and just like, like being my honest self, I guess that's what I mean. Because sometimes I can pretend to be me, you know what I'm saying? Sure. And then I get caught up in that and I think it's working. But then you see somebody really being himself. And you're like, fuck, I'm pretending to be me. So this seeing this person be himself is a reminder for me to find back my base so that I can connect to it and just generate 100% me. You know what I mean? Yes. I when I was a talent coordinator, young comedian, getting shitty spots, desperate for Mitzi's approval, but knowing that I couldn't bring up, she knew I wanted to be a comment. You can't bring it up to her because she get pissed. You can't like, you know what I mean? You got to do your job. So funny. But I can remember at one point, you know, and you just want anything, her to give you any acknowledged anything. And she knows knew that about comics. Right. So she knew that like tormenting you in that way to give you an ambition and make you try harder maybe. But I remember at one point, I said to her like, yeah, Mitzi, you know, I just want to find my voice. Because when you're coming up as a comic, that's the thing you hear allies, you'll find your voice one day as a comic. I just want to find my voice on stage. She goes, why happened? Did you lose it? It was such a deep thing to say. Because it's like, who are you then? How do you not have that? And yet this brilliant thing you said about faking yourself. Yeah, I've done that. Oh, me too. Yeah. God, that's the most confusing form of fakery there is. Yeah, exactly. You're lifting from a form, you're, you're lifting from a form of version of yourself. And you don't you're so deep and you don't even know until it hits you. And you're like, oh, shit. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not that person anymore. Yeah. That's not me. Yeah. Now you're fucked. Because you have to jump off the ledge again. You have to like go back and you're like, and you're like, I thought when I jumped off the first time, that's everything was complete. And then you, you realize, oh, I'm going to have to keep on jumping. And keep on this never ends. You know what I mean? It's a never ending series of cliffs. Yeah, that you always have to jump off until you die. Until you die. And that's the final fucking cliff. But all those jumps. So this is what clown school taught you is that you have to be out of control to be yourself. Is that what it means? It told me it taught me to not care what people think of me, because you do silly things. Like, it's like, so much improv like today, you're in it, we put you, they put us in a group, five people, and the rest of the classes over here. So you guys are going to sing a song about this or make up a chorus. So the group makes up a chorus. But then everybody has to do a solo and step forward. So then the solo is whatever comes out of your mouth. Then you step back with the group, you do the chorus and somebody steps out. So this is like, what the fuck am I going to sing? You just told us this one minute ago. And but you got to open your mouth and make words come out and sing, you know what I mean? In front of the rest of the class. So it just, you got to be open. You know what I mean? You have to go somewhere you wouldn't wear and stand up. Like, I know what I'm going to say. That's the beauty of a new joke. It's like, when you have jokes that you know are going to work, you're comfortable and you can say them. But it's the new joke that you're going to throw into the, into the, into the, into the, is the monkey wrench. It's the one you're not going to say, right? It's the one that's going to make you feel uncomfortable for the set. It's the one that might derail the whole set. Then you have to figure out a way after, if it doesn't work, how to get back on track with the rest of the shits. And then that's, and that's why a lot of comics hate trying new shit. And they get stuck. And then, so I never want to be a comfortable comic. Because if I'm comfortable, then I'm not growing. So I always want to like, jump off the cliff, jump off the cliff. Yeah. Now, now just I'm a, I'm a cliff jumper, like by profession, you know? Wow. Cool. Yeah. Oh my God, man. I have, there was a time, a long period. This is when I stopped doing stand up for a while. Because I realized, how many times have you stopped doing stand up? Probably two big times. Like the last time was the longest where I was, where I, I was in, I was in New York. I was watching these fucking New York comics crush it. I didn't want to be on stage. I didn't like what I was saying on stage. But it's because I had like, pretended there wasn't a cliff. I'd camped out on the cliff. You know, I'd like made a house next to the cliff. And then I moved into the house and was like, what a great view of this wonderful cliff. And then somewhere in there, your soul just dies. Because you're like, what am I doing here? Why, you got to jump off the cliff. Yeah. P.S. gang. Don't jump, literally jump off a fucking cliff. This is a metaphor. But like, but, but, uh, the moment you finally do the thing, you finally break out of the trap of your old self. I mean, this is, somebody told me that if a snake doesn't shed its skin, it dies. Right. Like it's, it's snake skin entangles in the, in the forest floor, I guess. And it just dead meat. You know, like if you don't recycle yourself, your fuck, but that feeling of being up there, like some kind of animatronic thing, just gang, gang, gang. And then I'll do that. Which is funny because I've seen comics kill. I've watched comics die while they kill, while they kill, because they're doing the same shit all the time and they're not taking any chances. Like you're stopping yourself because you want to get these laughs and you want to guarantee you have a good set. And I was like, you could be getting so much more out of this, but you have no idea. So you're dying. You're stagnant. You're, you're like a snake that doesn't want to like lose, you know, like you want to keep that skin. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, and it's, I've seen it too. I've done it. And I've done it too. Yeah. Yeah. I've done it. Oh, it hurts. And, and, and I have compassion now when I see comics doing it because it's like, I know, I know what you're in. I know as you were driving over here, how you felt. I know it's a, it's a fucked feeling, man. And, you know, but then there's different, isn't there other schools of thoughts here? Like Seinfeld, I've seen him do interviews where he's like, no, you do the material that works. That's what you do. He, he like seems like, and he's great. Right. And he, his analysis of this thing that I saw, and I might be misinterpreting, it's been a while, but it, it was really funny. He was like, I think he was calling the other thing art comics, you know, like, you know, there's these comics who do new material or whatever, but it's like, let's just. So what does he think about Chris Rock, who's one of his best friends? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Cause that's a completely different philosophy. His philosophy is like, I mean, look at his standup. It's technical, precise. It's like, I saw him in the main room. I can't get out of my fucking, you know, like when you, the long you do comedy, when you see someone like him, you're looking at literally every step, every movement, everything. And he came out and did some Charlie Chaplin shit with a mic stand. He did a little like Spinneru or something. I didn't know what it was. Some weird, like, you know what I mean? Like a fluid, graceful thing, just like, and then puts it behind him. Chapelle does the same thing. He like does that. When I've seen him, I don't know if he does all the time. It sounds, I've seen it. It's like, he lifts the mic up and does like Thor's hammer, like the door. Oh yeah, I've seen that. You know, yeah, that thing. You know, when you look at comics like that, anyway, Seinfeld, I don't know. My, my feeling is I like jumping off the cliff. Now I would get bored as fuck if I always do the same shit, not to say I'm not going to do all stuff on the road coming up Denver. I wanted to ask you something about your comedy. I know you're interviewing me, always just talking, but like the you I've been seeing on stage is fucking hysterical. Thank you. And I'm like, what happened? Not that nothing was before, but like, if I'm on the outside looking at you and the way you've talked on your podcast and how it's like, I'm like, how is he going to combine this spirituality and this knowledge that he has with comedy? Or when people listen to the podcast, how do they, it's like being on a TV show and you're one character and they come to see at the club and you're this other person. How do you combine it so that the people who hear you from the podcast come to the club and they're satisfied because they get what they thought they would get or how do you not give them, I'm like, so I was like, this is a job right here that you have. And I was like, how are you going to figure this out? That's just me thinking of you without even asking you. And then, and then be like, so how is he going to do this? Yeah. Yeah. Well, one thing is like, I had to come to a real like, you know, you just have no, it's so, the answer to your question is really boring. Not really. Because I feel like, I mean, the answer is boring. The question is great. The answer is boring because the answer is just like, what happened is, I just had to, I realized like, you got to write new material, man. And if you're going to write new material, you better write jokes about things that you're interested in. And then it's so obvious and dumb, but it's like that thing you were talking about before, the weird like ego paralysis or whatever it overtakes you, that gradually destroys you, you know, it, it, what ends up happening is you're caught in time. And the shit you're saying is like, you're in a time loop or something and then I just started writing again and, and like, you know, paying more attention to like classic comics or like, you know, fuck, watch Argus in the main room and see this beautiful old school standup style. And these are not clean jokes, but you know what I mean? Like the, the, the foundation is, it's basic math, not based, I'm not calling it Argus basic, but it's all the foundations of comedy that you need to build. They're the building blocks of comedy, watching them and you need them to create. That's it. That's it. And, and like just basic shit like that, like, you know, trying to figure out like how to structure jokes in a way that's like, and then also to work into, Oh, what am I interested in? I'm interested in conspiracy theories. I'm, you know what I'm interested in? Buddhism. And I'm still working on that right now. But one thing I know I don't like is when I see fucking comics, or it doesn't appeal to me, any comedian that's on stage and is like doing great. Wow. What a fucking miracle that you figured you got that far. So I don't mean to sound like a hater or whatever, but I personally don't like, I am a spiritual person and I want the world to be a great place. And I want love to reign forever. And I want people to find themselves and open up to their hearts. And I want joy to reign supreme forever throughout the planet and the universe forever. I don't know how to make that funny. Right. And if you're going to skip making that funny and just get on stage and say that, that's great. But it might not be comedy. That's another thing. You know what I mean? So I don't want to like, I would rather be my set. That's just what you're saying. Like, I don't know how to put it, man. But for me, I just feel like you figured it out. But I know you, it was a task because first you were dunking the comic and then this is my assessment of your progression. First you're dunking the comic, you have your material, then you start growing spiritually and then you have this material, but you can't really use it no more because it doesn't match the people who. So then you have to figure out that. And I'm like, good luck figuring that out. Like, good luck. And then to see you figure it out, I was like, Oh shit, you figured it out. That's great. It's perfect. This matches. Thanks. You caught up with you. Because you're jumping off a cliff as a human being, as a soul, your material has to do the same thing. There's different cliffs. It's like, man, that's some shit. Yeah, it's fun. What a joy. By the way, if you, this is like, there's a saying in the Bhagavad Gita, it's better to be an honest street sweeper than a dishonest king. And then there's another saying in the Bhagavad Gita that I like, which is, you know, it's, it's, it's, and it's a Viking thing too. The idea is like, it's better to die in battle than to die some rich son of a bitch. And you know what I mean? Comfortable. It's, that's why all the great myths, it's like, if you die in battle, that's incredible. Right. And as a comic, I think our, would you say our battle is writing new material. And if we die in that pursuit by bombing, it's better than killing with our old shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I've been miserable. People say, I was a great set. And I know I punked out of doing the new joke that I wanted to try because I wanted to match the last comics level of killing in the room. So I didn't get anything out of the set growth wise. So this is technically, this is a, this is a, this is a spiritual bomb or this is a spiritual comedy bomb. This is like, this killing was, I wasted, I drove down here to do the shit that I knew would work and I wrote this other joke. I didn't even try. I skipped out of everything and I punked out. Like this is not, I just stagnated my growth. I just held onto my snake, snake skin. So this is why I have this look on my face while you're smiling at me, telling me, great set. This is like, nah, fucked up. See, you have identified, it's like, you know, trees, they get, I don't know, it's like a tree fungus for comics. And what a dark trap to, because yeah, yeah, your shit worked. You knew it worked. But it's like the comedy store and any good comedy club, that's a laboratory. And it's like, you're a scientist. You've been given access to this laboratory for 15, like imagine someone gives you access to SETI, you know, which is really hard to get access to. They can turn those satellites to tune into specific other galaxies to listen to sounds and you turn the shit at the moon. You know what I mean? It's like, what are you doing? You know, there's nothing up there. You know, and you keep turning it to the moon, right, getting the same results. But also, I do think there's something to be said for respecting the audience too, meaning if you're not, to me, the real weird dance you have to do, which is like, also, people got babysitters. You can't just get up there and do, you know, poor shit into weird beakers and nothing, and it all fizzles. You need a couple of like banks. Yeah, you mix it up. You have your tried and true, but you have to do some work that night and you have to entertain. So you just mix it up so that they, they leave happy and you leave happy. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And figuring that out. Cause like, you know, that's to me, like, though I do, you know, I've seen the greatest comics on planet earth coming to the OR with a piece of paper and get up there and eat shit, eat big bowls of shit. And I've always respected it. Cause I know they know that for the audience, they got to see the great comic. And so there's already a gift happening. And I also know that all of us are in the back watching them bomb and like getting some dark pleasure out of me. You know what I mean? Like they bomb too, you know? But it's a weird thing to see that go down, which is like, okay, I know you needed to work on 10 jokes, but couldn't you thrown in like one old classic or something? Or there's a way to do it too. They could all bomb, but if you have something funny to say about the bomb and you made the set like this, I'm working out, but I'm going to entertain you when these jokes don't work, you know, just something, you know? And I guess maybe at the store is safe too, because then there's going to be other comics afterwards. It's just clean up the mess. Yeah. People entertain them before and more people will come on and entertain you afterwards. Yeah. And then some people like to see the joke, the growth of a joke. People don't get comedy. Right. They only judge it based on seeing you that one time. They don't know it's a whole thing. Yeah. So until they come back, store has like a lot of repeat customers. Yeah. And then they'd be like, oh, I remember when that joke. And then you can see their appreciation now for it. So it's, you know, it just, it just all depends. Yeah, I love watching it. I love just watching like, I was watching like Whitney Cummings. I watched her go through a joke cycle or whatever. And I watched it start with some joke. They're all of shit works because she knows how to make people laugh, but like watching it like crystallize and then watching the like trimming of this and that. It's pretty, that's what I love about the store is it's such a, it's such a university, you know, where you really do watch. I'm a, I'm slow at it though, man. I take forever to like work on material, but fuck, we're talking. Hey man, take your time. Fuck it. Right. Yeah. But let's jump away from comedy for a second though. I love talking about comedy with you and get back into reincarnation. All right. Let's reincarnate reincarnation. Let's do it. Well, you know, it actually applies to comedy because you do reincarnate as a comic, you know, you have various incarnations as a comic, but what are your views on death, man? Do you have a sense that like, are you afraid to die? No, I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid of how I die. I don't want to be uncomfortable. You know what I mean? I don't want it to be slow and painful, but I'm not afraid to die. If you had to pick how to die, what would it be? To sit in my sleep, painless, just, you know. Dying your sleep. Yeah. Everybody, I don't know, man. I've thought about that myself. I don't know if dying in your sleep is the best, man. I think that's like a... Me neither, just as long as it's painless. But we all assume it's painless. Yeah, I know. We do. That's the problem, is it's like just because they're not talking doesn't mean they're not in hell. Right, exactly. That's one of the creepiest things I heard is like they were giving lethal injection to this dude. And it was not working. And he was saying, it's like, I'm on fire. I'm on fire inside. Oh, shit. You know, so, yeah, that's the... I could think of the deaths that I wouldn't want to have happen. I would not... I don't want to get eaten by something. Yeah, I wouldn't get eaten. I don't want to be on a plane that's going hurling down towards the water because I already can't swim. And now I got to be like, just in the air, just... So fucked. Even if you survived. But you could use your inflatable thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those work, yeah. Those work 100%. Yeah, well, yeah, they don't... Yeah, that's a sad... All that does is make it so that it's easier to find the craft for all the corpses floating out there. Yeah, exactly. That's all they want. To find the craft, to get that black box and hopefully like they're not fucked and the insurance company will cover. Yeah, that's all your flotation devices so that you can help them find the rest of the plane. Are your parents still around? Well, my mom is. Dad passed, yeah. How long ago? Like 2009. Were y'all close? Yeah, because first there was this thing where we never had any beef, but I didn't know how to talk to them. Then there was this article in the New Yorker. My mother used to bring the New Yorker home from work. Where was work for her? She's working in Manhattan. She's been like a nanny for like these rich people. So she used to take care of their kids. My wife was in it. I'll get out of here. Yeah. That's hilarious. So then she's bringing the New Yorker home. This one guy had an article about not knowing how to talk to his grandfather, but then he realized that his grandfather was his history book to his past, to his great grandfather and the father before that and what life was like before he was born and the lineage of his family. So then he started asking his grandfather questions about just their past. So then when I would just call him up and we start talking, I'd just ask him questions. He would answer the questions and tell me a bunch of shit. So that then, you know, when he died, I felt like I knew everything. I'd asked him. There was no regrets. I'd spoken to him enough. I didn't let not knowing how to talk to him. I didn't let not knowing how to talk to him affect me, never talking to him. So then we spoke and so it was and he died at an age where like I'd watched him and saw how he operated in life and that had guided me to the point where I was then and was it good enough to like keep me for the rest of my life? So it's like I couldn't be like sad when he died, which like you're supposed to be. I was like, I feel like I got lucky. I had a dad. He handled his business and like, so so why cry now? I cried for like 10 minutes. Then after that, it was like, and then people would call when they heard he died. And I was like, Hey, what's up? How you doing? I heard your dad died. So they're talking to me with I heard your dad died voice. But I'm responding to them like normal. Yeah. And they're like, Is this Ian? Yeah, it's Ian. Where's your dad just? Yeah, he died. Yeah. And they're like, trying to like, take me down to there. I'm sympathetic voice level. I'm just talking to them regular. It's like, no, we, you know, what is there? I listen, we're all gonna die. Yeah. So I'm not surprised he died. And it was good. So I can't be down there with you. Right. You know, man, I'm so glad you're saying that. I, this is the thing when you lose a parent, or anybody, right? The last thing you need is these fucking grief Nazis, grief Nazis. And it's like grief Jehovah witnesses. Yeah. They're like, Oh, you must be in denial. It's coming around the bend. Soon you'll feel the pain. It's like, maybe not. Yeah. And also, why would you wish that on me? Yes. Yeah. What because because here's your judgment now, I guess right now to you, I'm like an insect. I'm like Jeffrey Dahmer, some shit, actually having a good day. My father passed away not that long ago. Yeah. I remember seeing that post. Yeah. What's that? I remember seeing the post when your dad passed. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. Well, that, you know, like grief. I don't think it's fascinating because it's of all this, like, I don't know what you would call it, some kind of pressure release valve or something of all of the things that psychic processes or whatever, like grief is wild because you'll cry. I mean, not to be a grief Nazi, if you don't cry, it's great, but you'll cry again. Yeah. And it'll come out of left field. That's what's fascinating to me about it. You know, I'll just be like hanging out, just doing nothing, playing Mortal Kombat. I don't know. And like, this doesn't happen all the time, but it has to happen. All of a sudden, I'm like, out of the blue, like a meteor from my subconscious comes like erupting out or something. And it's wonderful when it happens. It's like, those kinds of tears are my favorite grief tears are cathartic. And do you know what you're crying about? Oh, yeah, like, like a lot missing them. It'll be a realization like, oh, I'll never feel what their hand feels like. I'll never smell their apartment. I'll never, you know, be annoyed when they call. And so those moments are, but, you know, I was interviewing Ram Das who passed recently, and I was on stage at these meditation retreats that I go to interviewing him, trying to come up with like, God, talk about being a fucking phony, man, you're in front of all these spiritual people you want them to like you, you know, and like, I'm terrified of Ram Das. It makes me nervous. And so you want to seem like a good person. So I'm trying to think of the right question to ask him. I really, that's a regret I have. But I remember being up there with him and being like, what are we going to do when you die? And he looks at me and mocks me. Oh, it's hilarious. He sticks his lip out and he goes, woo. This is like a guy who's had a stroke, you know, but all of a sudden he's like really animated in a very, very fervent way, just completely burning me up there. Because it's like, give me a fucking break. Number one, you don't really care that much about it in the way you're saying. Number two, if you're not listening to any of the shit I've been talking about, which is, you know, this is not, this is a temporary vessel I'm in right now. And but I feel like somebody had to ask that question though, right? Probably everybody else was thinking it and not saying it. And his answer probably gave them like some type of peace and shit. I think so. I thank you for saying that. I do think that was like a cool, like Matt is a great way to encounter. And it's so Ram Das, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah, it was cool. But I think the damn in our culture, we're so like death illiterate. Yeah, we act like, like the thing that's like so in our face every day, like the news reports death every day. But the society tells us to act like it can't happen to us. And every death is such a surprise. Like, Oh my God, did you hear what happened? These people died in an accident. That plane crashed. There was a natural disaster and all it's like, this is life. Death is life, man. This shit happens, you know what I mean? Yeah. But we're taught to think it can't happen to us. And we're the lucky ones were alive is not a shit. This shit is real. This shit, this shit happens, you know, it does. Yeah, I used to entertain the idea that I was a moral. Did you ever like play around with that? Like, still do. You do. I used to do that. As long as I'm alive, when I feel like I'm in the water. Yeah. Why me? Why? Why them and not me? I must be immortal. You're the only one having this objective experience. I mean, you can't prove I'm having it. And then you know, is maybe you are an eternal being having this sort of like dream experience. I mean, I like I go, I used to go really far with it, you know, or, or I would like for a little bit, I got into transhumanism and stuff and like would study the research behind like like prolonging life and is old age even isn't maybe old age is just a disease. We haven't figured out a cure to and we might be able to reverse age and stuff like that. And so I would imagine like, Oh, you know, yeah, sure. I mean, right now that I death is a possibility for me. In 20 years, there might be a way to live forever. But would you want to live forever if you could depends on the terms and conditions. The one condition is this, you give up your right to die. That means I can get like, just be in the way. But not even even worse, like, or maybe not worse, but my fear is like, say, say, say, as a joke right now, I'm vegan, right? Say, I don't know if it works, but I'm doing it. But what if it does work? And I live so long, I run out of money. And then I'm homeless. So how this giving up my right to die, there's a there's a point where you can live too long, you can't afford to live too long. If you're not super rich, that's right. Like, and I'm not at the point where I can afford to live to be 100 yet. So that's so fucking crazy. So economically economically, you can't be immortal. I can't afford to be immortal. It's like, you're not ready to be immortal yet. My immortality is a curse. Oh my God. Yeah, right. Like, it's not like sometimes I watch these like, you know, movies about Dracula, vampires and shit. And it's like, where are you getting your money? Right? Like, are you just robbing the people you eat? But you're, you're like, they bought Google stock when the early on. Yeah. Yeah. The odds are, if you're immortal, you're going to go through long periods of being broke. But that being said, you're going to get good at shit. You're going to get good at shit. You're going to figure out the trends and shit. And then you should be able to financially figure it out. Yeah. To me, this is why at least extending the lifespan, it's highly desirable because just, you know, as a comedian, I don't care, you're going to start disintegrating when you start getting older. And that's just the way it is. We've seen so many great comics. They get old. Your body's old. You're in pain. You're shitting your pants. You're like, your mind is slowly like, you know, collapsing in on itself. But man, to see a 500 year old comedian who still has a young body, hilarious. How funny would they be? I don't know. They'd be like, if they were not afraid to jump off cliffs for those 500 years, they'd be the ultimate funny. This, and this right there, to me, that's the like creepy shit about, because I do think with like gene editing technology and the stuff I have read about it, I do think if they haven't already done it, which if they did do it, they might, they might not be in their interest to tell everybody that they figured out a way to, a way to reverse the aging process. But if they do do it, that's going to be expensive. Number one, like it's, if you want to reverse age, it's going to be millions of dollars. At first it's going to be really expensive, but then it might get cheaper like how VCRs got cheaper. First people had like the flat screen TVs. Yeah. They were like, how much did you pay for that? 10,000? Yeah. Then they dropped down to like everybody starts getting them. Yeah. So then they just dropped the prices down. Soon as it's CVS. Yeah, yeah. You can go get your aging, anti-aging, de-aging thing done at CVS or some shit. Honey, you need to go to CVS and reverse 10 years. You're starting to look really old. It's like a haircut. It's like getting a haircut. Oh yeah. I'm going to go reverse age. Like I've put on about 10 years over the last 10 years. I need to slow down. Over the last 10 years. Reverse it. And then, but then if it is expensive, what ends up happening is you will end up with an elite species of immortal beings that are experts at everything. And then the rest of the world will be manipulated by them and controlled by them. Just the same way it's being manipulated now by people who aren't like that. So you might as well. But they are like that, aren't they? They're super rich. Right. They are kind of like, I read this thing. I'd love to know what you think about this. Are you like not to get political, people get pissed when I get political? I don't care. Are you a socialist? Do you lean towards socialism like Bernie Sanders, Yang like university? I like Yang. Me too. And I like his numbers. And yeah, why not? Why? Why don't I just think it's funny how one side has tricked the people who need and they use the words like maybe they use the words like socialism and stuff to make normal shit seem bad. Right. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And it's like, no, that's just a human right. You mean healthcare? Like healthcare. Yeah, it should be. It should be. Yeah, it should be. Why wouldn't you want that? Well, I think, what do they say the reason you don't want that? The reason you don't want that. And this is not me, PS. This is me like hate watching Fox News. Oh, we love sitting and watching. If you if you're smart, you should watch some Fox News. Yeah, to see what they're saying, what they're saying. Yeah. So I so this is the idea. I think the idea and I think that the entire concept is obliterated by the existence of the military industrial complex. You can't fucking say there's not enough money for healthcare when we're spending however much it is a day, $200 million or whatever overseas to have bases in countries that are not America. Right. So you can't say there's not enough money for healthcare. Exactly. You could argue, well, if we don't have those bases, the entire global balance will be distorted. What balance? We're at war anyway. Exactly. Exactly. So so to me, that's the thing that has always been deeply infuriated is this sense of like, wait, there's $200 million a day that we have. Yeah, something like that. Because I think about it in terms of like the hood, you know, and like it's funny, I was watching an interview with Sammy DeBull Gravano. And I think he just got out of prison recently. And he was just speaking on like some of the stuff he's doing down how the prison system is rigged against like ethnic people, like just being a guy, a white guy in jail, how you get convicted of a trial, you get accused of something, then they give you a lawyer who has a thousand cases. And then the government has 10 lawyers, and they're determined to put you away. And then even if some and they can manufacture evidence, like you're playing against the house in Vegas. So you're so it's like, you can't win. And they the law says you're entitled to what an attorney. Yeah, but that attorney can't really help you. So it's just, and so you're going to lose anyway. And it just and just how and I and I and I just had a I forgot what the question was. Because I know, I mean, what we're talking about is that basically the imbalance of power imbalance of power. So it's like, you have money, like, we're spending money on prisons. Yeah, when that money that was spending on prisons and for correction officers and facilities could be spent earlier on in the life of young people to show them that you love them. And that take care of them so that they don't end up feeling unloved, unwanted, and into criminals. So I say, spend all this prison and rehab rehabilitation money earlier on in their life cycle so that you won't have to spend it later on, right? You know what I mean? So that's that's where I don't like where all funds are going. No, you know what I mean? Oh, I mean, anyone who has even the slightest soul in their body, right, should at least scratch their chin for a second. Knowing right now, there's somebody's mom dying of breast cancer, who can't afford chemo. Right. And we're fucking paying money for drones to drop bombs on some fucking weird Iranian general. Give me a fucking break. Right. And then the people ordering these things are all millionaires and shit. And then somewhere in there, people like, what? They love America. They don't love America. They're turning their vampires, they're literally converting human life into dough. I mean, that's like, that's the truth of the matter of a drone strike. A drone strike makes Raytheon, Halliburton, DARPA, I guess. There's a profit margin there, man. You know, like, have you done any commercials? Yeah, rarely. Yeah, like some voice over shit. So remember, I never, I got one commercial, I never got that sweet fucking commercial money. God damn, you know, these comics will book these fucking things and every time the commercial ran in the old days, at least, they'd get 10,000 bucks. And if they got it now, you'd hear these comics, I booked a national and then, oh my God, every month they're getting like 50 grand, just fucking mailed to their ass for doing like one day of work. And it was a dream in the old, I heard it changed a little bit. Yeah, it changed. But fuck, if you're a weapons manufacturer, and you hear about a drone strike, there's a PC that's like, well, well, well, we just made a little bit of money this month. We're making money. Yeah, you're not thinking we shouldn't kill people. Yeah, you're making those weapons so that they get used so you could sell more weapons. So like, like, you make clothes, so people will wear them. And then you make up reasons like we have so many different types of clothes, we got pajamas, we got pajamas that are sexy, like lingerie, so that when you go to bed and late when a woman lays next to a man, he's going to do something to her, like have sex pajamas, then there's a work clothes, and there's different types of work clothes, and then there's there's a hiking clothes, and there's, there's a yoga outfits, and then there's suits, and then it sounds like, but you always, when you, if you make these things, you make up a reason why people should wear these things. So if you make weapons, you're going to make up a reason why people should use these weapons, you ain't making them just if they just buy them and never use them, then they'll stop buying them. So anybody that's selling weapons is doing some shit to make people use those weapons. Oh man, that's the dark, dark thought that I try to avoid. I had a fucking Uber driver say this to me, if you're making umbrellas, you need it to rain. Yeah. And it's like, fuck, this, this shit is like so, it's so unreal to me to imagine that there are people in the world that are so insane, greedy, that they would want to perpetuate war infinitely to make money. Oh yeah, they're there. And yet they exist. Yeah. And we let them live. Yeah. You know, like in, I thought like, you know, Dracula movies, Frankenstein movies, they surround, like you surround the castle with the torches. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would happen to you. It's like, if you were doing this shit, the villagers set you on fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now we're just like, yeah, it's just, we know that's what the vampire does. Because we have a certain level of comfort that as long as it doesn't affect us, like we're numbed by our own comfort. Right. And we're like, oh, well, that's not happening to us. But like, this is some guy said this, you know, this is, and I wish everybody heard this. And I think he was, he's like a black sports journalist, right? And he was like, hey, man, like if you're some rich, non black person, right? And I think cancer or any disease is a good equalizer just because of this. So say you don't care about the poor segment of society. And you don't mind them going in and out of jail and having ruined lives because there's, you could make money off that, you know what I mean? But say you're rich, your whole life. But one of the equalizing factors is death and uncertainty of when it's going to happen. You can get any sickness, any illness, any disease. Do you know rich person that somebody who's in jail right now, if they had the great upbringing, and I had not been oppressed, they could have come up for the cure for whatever you're going to die of, or a relative who's close to you is going to die off. So you think you're getting away unscathed, but you're hurting yourself by hurting other people. And that's how connected we are. You know what I mean? That is the craziest. I have a fuck. And then they said that I was like, Oh, shit. That is true. It's like, we all need each other, you know? Yeah. But we just selfish, like that's why that's why death is great. You know what I'm saying? Or some unforeseen illness is great because you can't get away from it until people start making these connections and realizing what they're doing to other people to hurt them, eventually comes back to hurt you. You know, they won't get that shit. There's a Ram Dass foundation is called love, serve, remember. And the remember part they say remember God, but I've heard it actually remember you're going to die. So that's their like, you know, motto love everybody serve everybody and remember you're going to die. Because if you forget that, you will become the biggest fucking asshole on planet Earth. And the fact that these bastards have forgotten the fact that every single great, many of the great things that come into this world do not come from a predicted source. They don't come from a they are sure they're not coming from the fucking Ivy League trust fund babies all the time. And this is why I love the Christian story. Because this is a major situation. This thing pops up in the middle of a barn. And it's the hope of the world. Right. And sometimes this is when I'm definitely eating too much weed. Sometimes I think, Oh, actually, that's not a mistake. Right. They don't want things to get better. They don't want a hope of the world. They want to get into the places where there's the highest likelihood of some kind of novel idea. And how many times have you like heard the story and that does happen, man, there are comics, I know, who are brilliantly funny and wealthy upbringings. But more often than not, that is not the way it works. And so if one of the fundamental seemingly universal things that, you know, if you're, you know, we want to grow carrots, there's a certain way maybe they're going to grow. If you want to grow wine, wine country, right, want to grow fucking, you know, great minds, adversity, unfortunately, right. So if we start making it so these diversity is imprisoning people, destroying their consciousness, turning them into survivors. Yeah, occupying their mind with survival. Yeah. Then they can't use their mind to just create and do things. You know what I mean? Dude, it's almost like if you were a reptile alien taking over the planet, it would just be standard. Like, oh, you need to start putting the poor people in jail because they come up with ideas. You need to imprison the first step in conquering any planet is immediately get as many poor people imprisoned or dead as you possibly can. You don't want socialism because you need them to die. Because otherwise, if you let them live too long, what are you going to get a fucking car? You want a Karl Marx? You want another Jesus? You want another Gandhi? Do you see how bad Gandhi fuck things up for us? You want another Martin Luther King? Is that what you want? No, you want sheep that you can suck their life energy off of so we can live forever. Right, right. Yeah, they're definitely like vampire in us. You know what I mean? Like we're just, it's almost that's why the matrix hit so hard when it did. Because it's like, oh, shit, we're like, like batteries that they're just feeding off and shit until, you know, until what? Until they just don't care you throw out the old batteries, just wait till the new ones come in. People are going to be born. And they just keep it moving. Man, this is truly the I think one of the grim realities until man, I like I remember I had this guy Rick Doblin on my podcast to is the guy doing the MDMA studies with people have PTSD. And I was raging against the machine with him. I think I was talking about the FDA maybe or I don't remember he was really bitching about it. And this is the guy who went to the Pentagon and like met with generals and he somehow managed to get the insane, you know, viewpoint of the United States when it comes to psychoactive drugs to change enough to at least allow the studies to happen, which are now, you know, having a lot of great results. And the thing he said to me was really fucking unnerving. He's like, no, they're not all bad up there. And then you know what I mean? So now it's like, where is the evil? Where's the vampire? The system itself seems to be more like some people are just brainwashed to and they're unaware until like something close to something close to them happens to them. And then he goes up there and speaks to them. And then, you know, like, like a lot of people in that lifestyle, some of them, like they believe in their like the American system, the way it was taught to them and they have they've succeeded listening to it. So there's no reason to doubt it or to think that they're wrong or that they've been doing anything wrong. You know what I mean? It hasn't even it's like it's a flickered across their fucking screen. Yeah, exactly. It hasn't occurred to them. Like, nah, those people, they fucked up, they made those choices. But you haven't seen the positions they were putting, they were putting in survival mode. And when you're survival mode, like, if you're born in the jungle, man, you learn how to kill lines and shit like that. But if you're in America, you're like, Hey, man, the line population is down. You can't be killing lines like that. You know what I mean? But you're not the lines ain't walking next to your goddamn. You know what I'm saying? You're gonna tell me not to kill lines? You're gonna tell me not to kill lines. Like, so it's like, right. And then you're occupied with like, trying to not being killed with a lion, you can't create or do anything or come up with nothing. You're just constantly under survival pressure. And this is why we made the world it was so you could have time to create so you'd be in a house, you'd be protected. And there's water and there's electricity. And people who have that can think and come up with other shit. And the people that don't have that staying survival mode. And they keep the prisons as chaotic as they possibly fucking can because otherwise the prisons will become the house. They'll become like, if you were to do like the way some, what is it, Sweden, their prisons look like dormitories. It's true. They truly want to rehabilitate the prisoners. They're trying to make it so they don't kill people anymore for real. And they have a very low recidivism rate. But if we did that here, then the prisons would become monasteries or something. They would become places where people would begin to write great poetry, not that it's not happening now in prisons. And there's a lot. Do you ever think about doing, do you do any kind of like volunteer work? Like I always think if I was going to do volunteer work, it would be some kind of prison outreach or something. I've done like, once like Tosh has like, he'll say, Hey, you want to do a charity show? Like, so we're doing it for free. But then every comic on the show gets to pick a charity where they want to donate the money to their money to. So I'll do like the innocence program. Is that a prison? Is that a, yeah, it's like where, you know, it goes to a fund and there's these lawyers in the innocence program. Hope I'm saying where they try to get people who are already convicted and in jail for a long time, if they believe that they're innocent, you know, they keep on appealing and trying their cases and trying to get them out of jail. You know what I mean? If they feel like this is what went wrong in this case, you know, and so this is why we believe this person didn't do it, you know, then they try to do that. That's cool. Yeah, but I don't do it enough. I need to like stay on that. That's like my main cause of any cause, you know what I mean? I think it's one of the great causes. People aren't fucking dungeons, man. Yeah, man. They're in dungeons, a lot of them are in dungeons and they did do a crime, but the crime isn't even a real fucking crime. Right, exactly. They're just selling acid. Yeah. They had a Grateful Dead show and they're in there for 50 life sentences straight. It's crazy, right? Some southern fucking judge was like, you're trying to drop it in the water, supply hippie. Yeah, they make up like, I like when the judicial system makes up your motive for you and you're like, what? I wasn't even thinking of doing that. Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? Yeah. But no, they're not. They're just like their friends were in the prison. They need to keep them stuck. Yeah. Good God. This got dark and awesome. But before we wrap up, He said dark and awesome. I love it. I love it, man. Why don't we just start milking them? Why don't we, why don't we just admit what we're doing, herd people into prisons and start juicing them for their stem cells? I mean, it's a version of basically what they're doing. It's a version, yeah, but you got to make it seem like it's not otherwise. Yeah, exactly. If we were, if the prisons look like fucking dairy farms or the prisoners just had weird tubes attached to dicks and nipples that were sucking their life essence that rich people were drinking, we'd shut down prisons in a day. Yeah. Every time they're making a phone call or something, you're milking them or buying, getting something from the conversation or $30 a minute to talk to your son. I'm in jail. This is how I got here. I was broke. I did, how am I going to pay 30? Yeah. So crazy. I had an ounce of fucking marijuana in my backpack. And now my son doesn't have a dad. How am I in jail for this and you ain't in jail for what you're charging me for a phone call? Well, that's crazy. I'm glad you asked that question, prisoner. Now back to the milking room. Tell me about your special. Bill Burr, this is the one Bill Burr. This is the one Bill Burr. How did that happen? I mean, fuck, that's incredible, man. How did that phone, was it a phone call or a chat or how did that originate? So Bill got a deal from Comedy Central to produce three specials for some crazy reason. He hits me up through, first my agent hit me up because I think I'm not the same agent, but my agent hit me up. So Bill wants to give me one of the specials. And I was like, and I was looking, I was going to shoot a special. I was going to use my own money. We were looking at venues with the same guy who directed this special, which is cool because Aristotle, a theorist, directed my special. But he was like, before that, he was like, you should have a special. I agreed with him. So, excuse me, I was just going to use my money and shoot it. And then, you know, just putting that shit into action and taking the steps and Bill getting a deal and then Bill being able to offer me money and me not having to spend my own money and it having a location like Comedy Central just worked out. Beautiful. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, man. But like, to me, I do get like paying for your own special in the sense you own them. That's your IP. And that's what I liked about it. Yeah. And that's what I still, even though I'm happy it was on Comedy Central, I still like want to own my shit more than it being on Comedy Central or even somewhere else, unless they're going to pay me so much. I don't have to worry about owning it. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah, right. That's and also, you know, I don't know how much, I guess that did they put it on YouTube or they put it online or anything like that? How accessible is it? It's at comedycentral.com. But Comedy Central's like website is not the greatest and their app ain't the greatest. Right. So and then so only people in America that have Comedy Central, whether the app or maybe somewhere on Amazon, and maybe Hulu now you can watch it. When I haven't seen it yet, I was reading about it and it said it's like a TED talk. Yeah. So okay, so this is it's not it's not tradition. It's not traditional stand up. It's more Well, it is. It is. But when I when you look at stand up, like dependent on the type of stand up you are, you are explaining something. Right. You are explaining something. And but you're giving your like a TED talk is like somebody's perspective on something or a new idea on something. So I just presented the same jokes, but in a TED talk format. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, man, if you can, to me, you know, I think that is an emerging form in comedy right now is figuring out a way to in a funny way, also be like informational, you know, not just like, you know, all good stand up is like that. But I do love that, that approach, that approach to it, man. Yeah, that's cool. That's always like fantasize about that. Like, look, you know, I really do want to talk about Buddhism on stage. Right. But I have no idea how to make funny. I have no idea how to work it out where it doesn't sound preachy. Just do. So I get caught up in stuff that that I'm passionate about. And then I will say, Oh, just let me just do a one liner about it first. So just do it a one liner at a time. And then you add a tag to that one line, then another tag. And then it turns into the bit like if we try to make the whole bit, then it's going to be preachy, but just make the first single joke about it and then tag it and then tag it. And then you build a whole then you get to say what you want. But I think sometimes when we sit down to write, we're trying to do this whole thing. And it's just you just got to simplify that shit.

373^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 313: Alan Sacks Transcript and Discussion^2018-11-17^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, sweet friends. It is I, Dee Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. Now with premium sound. Some of you may not be aware of this, but a few years ago, I got into a pretty bad contract with a company called Xaethor Labs. You're probably familiar with their jingle, but if not, here it is to refresh your memory. Xaethor Lab. Xaethor Labs. It was 1998. I was in Beijing. I was sitting across from a man in a velvet suit with a handlebar mustache. He was smoking a cigarette that smelled like moths playing tennis with moth balls. It was a very strange and interesting day, perhaps one of the most interesting days of my life. I was sitting with Routarg Winder, the CEO of Xaethor Labs. I was in desperate need of money. I was wearing rags. I was in rough shape to put it mildly. I'd been on a mescaline bender. That and a few lime reedas had gone to the wrong part of my belly and it led me down a very dark path. It was almost incomprehensible to imagine that my entire life had been transformed by simply opening an email. Two weeks prior, I had received this email from a woman in Beijing. Dear Duncan Trussell, you seem hot. I'm horny and full of fun. I love kinky stuff and want to party. Will you come to Beijing with money so we can party? Let's fuck forever. Patricia Luna Lila. It was less than four hours later that I was sipping Jin on a one-way flight to Beijing. The Jin was doing nothing to abnegate the nervousness that flustered my brain. I kept going through a checklist in my mind. Suitcase, check, cash, check. I had everything that she had requested. I kept thinking of this poem by Albert Camus. Zoo by Albert Camus. When a man journeys to a zoo, he does not see the colotype and chain of gold. That yanks him into cage. There in that place where chimchests are laid bare with shavers and cream, chimp nipples a nipple of man, towers of loneliness. This perfect poem by Albert Camus perfectly describes what every new lover feels as they in plain ride across the planet to meet some new lips that their mouth will fall upon. I'm going to tell you what happened to me in Beijing and why I got into a contract with Zathor Labs right after this. American Hysteria is a brand new podcast from Skylark and me, Chelsea Weber-Smith. It explores our moral panics, urban legends, and conspiracy theories. How they shape our psychology and culture and why we end up believing them. I'll cover moral panics like stranger danger, satanic panic, and tinky-winkies homosexuality, urban legends like poison Halloween candy, and conspiracy theories like the Illuminati's secret plan for world domination. I was raised around a ton of wild conspiracy theories and I know how easy it can be to freak out over the sensational, the rare, and the untrue. I want to understand why we fear the wrong things and how these fears shape our past, present, and future in sometimes devastating ways and also what these bizarre panics might be covering up. I promise to show you a good old time while I try to figure it all out. The first two episodes of American Hysteria drop November 12th. Head over and subscribe now wherever you get your podcasts. I was met at the Beijing Airport by a strikingly beautiful woman named Patricia. As it turned out, she had seen some of the exercise videos that I'd been putting out. International Workout is what it was called at the time and she'd been attracted not only by my physique but by my training patterns. We spent the next five days passionately making love and training together. But at the end of the fifth day, I woke to a sweat-soaked bed musky and pungent with the stink of our love-making and a gun firmly placed against my temple. This was the infamous Rutar Gwinder. Rutar Gwinder, the CEO of Zathor Labs. He kidnapped me, wrenched me out of the bed of my new lover and forced me into a horrific contract where I agreed to produce podcasts with really bad sound quality. And two days ago, that contract expired. So now you can enjoy premium sound from the DTFH except for this interview because in this interview, I was still, and I guess some other interviews that I recorded previously when I was still under the Zathor contract. But from this point forward, it's gonna be great sound. And thank you all for being so patient with the shitty sound quality of this podcast. It's been a real depressing thing to know that I have this pristine sound equipment and an expert level understanding of how to engineer audio. And I haven't been able to use any of it because of a dumb contract I signed when I was a kid drunk on sex, gin, mescaline, and limeritas. We have got a fantastic podcast for you today. Alan Sacks is here with us. We're gonna jump right into it, but first some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Audible. How does anybody have time to sit around and read, to lay in your hammock and open a book and just relax? Come on, there's cleaning to do. Half of us are either hang gliding or lifting weights or climbing mountains. Some of us are hit men or hit women stalking a hit. And some of us are out there farming or painting or tap dancing or giving tap dancing lessons. And there just isn't as much time as there used to be to sit with a book and read. This is why I love Audible. If I need to wash dishes or clean or if they're just driving to be done, I can actually enjoy a book simultaneously. Here's what I'm listening to right now on Audible. Cutting through spiritual materialism, which is fantastically infuriatingly fantastic. It's by Chogyam Trumpa and it's narrated by John Baker. I'm listening to Hallelujah Anyway by Anne Lamott. I've got the New American Standard Bible on here though. I'm gonna admit I didn't spend as much time with it as I thought I would. The Ramayana, narrated by Ram Dass. How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan. I have not read that, listened to that one yet. Calypso by David Sideris. I love Audible. I love having all these wonderful books being read to me by professional narrators. It's like being a kid all over again, only instead of your mom, your dad, who barely know how to read and you jump in that mess. You've got an actual professional narrator reading books to you and it's just fantastic. Try them out. If you haven't tried them out yet, right now for a limited time, you can get three months of Audible for just $6.95 a month. That's more than half off the regular price. Give yourself the gift of listening and while you're at it, think about giving the gift of Audible to someone on your list. What a wonderful, wonderful gift for that busy person in your life. Go to audible.com slash DTFH or text DTFH to 500, 500, to get started. That's DTFH and is what you would send us the text to 500500 to get started. And again, right now for a limited time, you can get three months of Audible for just $6.95 a month. That's more than half off the regular price. Truly, truly, what a wonderful, wonderful thing. And my day when we wanted to get audio, any kind of recording of books, it was like ridiculously insanely expensive per book, like 50 bucks, 40 bucks, a big fat set of CDs. Now you can just go online and get any book. And by the way, the Gunslinger, my God. If you wanna hear a well-read, well-narrated book, the Gunslinger, I think it's like the first three or the same narrator. I believe his name is Frank something, but I'm not sure about that. Regardless, give Audible a shot. That's audible.com slash DTFH, or text DTFH to 500500 to get started. My dear loves, a sincere thank you to those of you who have subscribed over at patreon.com.

Truly, truly, I am grateful to you for spending any time at all listening to the DTFH. PS, we got lots of merch in the shop. If you're interested in getting some Dunkin' Trussell family hour gear, it is at Dunkin'Trussell.com. Okay, pals. Man, I gotta tell ya, this episode, this entire week I've been working, not just on the intro to this episode, maybe it's a little too long, I don't know, but on the sound equipment itself. Getting all this stuff wired in, like I got an Apollo X6, it's a very nice bit of audio gear, but there is a lot more than just getting the gear. You've gotta dial stuff in, put the right stuff on it. I'm trying to learn this stuff. People go to graduate school to learn how to do this. So my apologies if the sound is not completely dialed in yet. I just want you to know I have heard your complaints regarding the way the sound used to be, and I am working literally night and day trying to get everything dialed in so that I can offer a really great sound to you guys. I can't believe it took me so long to do it, but now I'm doing it, and hopefully pretty soon, it will just have that nice NPR sound to it. But until then, let me know. Give me feedback. I am really interested in figuring out how to refine the sound on the podcast. And I love you guys, and I want you to not have to deal with the weird cognitive dissonance that comes from wondering how the fuck can somebody with a podcast not have good sound? What's he thinking? Is he out of his gourd? Today's guest is so fucking cool. I'm so lucky to have met him. A big thanks to Martin Olson for introducing me. Alan Sacks is a producer, an artist. He made a show that was a big hit when I was growing up called Welcome Back Cotter, and he also made a show called Chico and the Man, and he also made a bunch of other great shows, but he was also, he is a punk, and he was in the punk scene, and this is a human who has so many cool stories about living in LA through the 70s and the 80s up until today that we are gonna do many, many more podcasts together. He's a new friend of mine, he's really inspiring to me, not just because of his amazing stories, but also because he is a practitioner of Nima Buddhism. I think that's the right way to say it. And he's, I don't know, he's just, you'll see. Why am I even telling you what he's like? You're about to hear him. He's a wonderful person who has soon to have a really great podcast coming out himself. You'll hear more about this during this episode. So now, without further ado, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast, Alan Sacks. Also, unfortunately, or fortunately, is part of working on the sound. I got a brand new computer, so I'm missing some files I usually work with, meaning I don't have the theme song. So this is gonna be theme song free, or I'm just gonna play some guitar chords as a theme song. Why am I even telling you this? I could have just jumped into that episode. [""Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast""] Dogs are barking at the moon. This guitar is out of tune. Now they're howlin', not just at the big ball in the sky. There's screaming, because I'm singin', and that's no lie. It's the DTFH, it's the DTFH. Shit, has nothing to do with it. Yeah, that's for you recording your music. That's for me being high and wanting to dial in aliens. What the fuck did I hear? Oh, no, it was you I heard the other night. Did you just do something with aliens? Yeah, you sent this on your show. With aliens? Yeah, who? A channeler, the Paul Selig one? No, I heard that, too. Oh, yeah, the alien thing, yeah. Some guy, fuck, was doing that. Maybe it was Selig, I don't know. But it was very recently, and you sent out some signal. Oh, yeah, that's right. What show was that? Oh, yeah, that's the last episode, man. Yeah, what was that? I started listening to that. And you played some alien stuff at the beginning. I did. Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, to me, the reason for doing a podcast, even though it's wonderful, I mean, it's like the best thing in my life to be able to have a job like this. But that's secondary. To me, what's incredible about it is when I find myself sitting across from people like you. And it gives me goosebumps to imagine that you're listening to my podcast, and it really does blow my mind. I'm listening to every one, man. And this is before I knew you. I told you that. Every one. I look for the Duncan Tressel family hour. Yeah, when Martin reached out to me, it was just a very odd moment, you know? Because I know it was ages ago. But welcome back, man. That made an imprint on me. That was a series of show. I still have the theme song in my head. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Welcome back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. It did it burn. What do you call it? It burned something in your brain, you know? A brain worm or something? Or a sound worm? A meme. A meme? Is that what it is? I don't know. No, no, no. But it burns into your head. Absolutely. And so then when we were hanging out and I realized the strange connections we have. You're connected to Ram Dass. Oh, yeah. And Buddhism. Yeah. And all in the comedy store in the 70s. They don't even belong together. Good luck then. It's very, very, very odd. And so then that's why I realized this is like, the dream guest for this podcast. Oh, I love that. Thank you so much. So thank you so much for being here. Thank you, Duncan. It's very exciting. I love it. But equally, you know, it's like you're playing ping-pong. You need somebody that's good opposite you. I don't play ping-pong. But that's, you know, that's great. Yeah, man. That's great, man. I appreciate that. I was thinking if I, I would tell you how I met Ram Dass. That'd be awesome. And I was invited to an event in Beverly Hills. It was a dinner party, small, maybe 20-some-odd people for Jerry Brown. Wow. He was running for governor. No shit. And Ram Dass was there. Wow. What year was this? I was trying to think. So I'll tell you, about 74. Wow. Before you even thinking about incarnating on this planet. April 20th. I incarnated on April 20th, so I could have been here already. I don't know. Yeah. So I was there. And there was Ram Dass. And it just blew my mind. I probably, one of the few that knew who he was. Because I had known Timothy Leary. And so. But this was post-Majoraji Ram Dass. This was Be Your Now Ram Dass, right? Like, he came back. Yeah, he had just come back. This was the, maybe came back a month ago, man. This was, he had just written Be Your Now. That was taking, that was like hitting everybody of my generation. We finally had, holy shit, man. What is he writing about? This is amazing. And it's like a picture book. It's so easy to read. You know, so it was Guru Maharaji. And so he asked me what I did. And I said, I'm producing a television show called Chico and the Man. It hadn't gone on the air yet. It was in the summertime. It hadn't gone on the air yet. But they were running the promos. And he said, you know, with that Puerto Rican kid who goes up and down, I had a head that, remember Freddy's joke where he had, like he was one of those balls in the back of a car? Ram Dass did that. So I said to him, holy shit, you know, you know that comedian? He said, he looked at me and said, do you think I live in a cave? Wow. And it was great, man. That's so cool. It was really cool. Was he, that is wild. That is like, you know, Ram Dass has had all these different phases. Yeah. And fresh back from India, Ram Dass. That's the long haired Ram Dass, like the glow, like the, you know, still probably still taking LSD, Ram Dass, you know? Not sure. Not sure. Not sure. I don't remember what he said in that book, but could have been, could have been taking little micro doses. I know he was probably smoking. Yeah. You know, but I don't know, but, but it was amazing to be with him. And it changed my life that moment, you know, to be near Ram Dass was something else. How do you, when you say change your life, what do you mean? Like how? Well, I kept staying there. I was into, I was looking for a teacher at that time. I didn't know where, there was so many different things to 70s in LA, the mid 70s around this time was nuts. You didn't know where to, it was like your show, man. You didn't know who to listen to. You know, it was all coming at you like, and, and that's why I love your show so much. Thank you. Because it's still just, you're exposing me to shit that I just, it blows my mind. Wow, man. Duncan, I'm telling you, you know, it blows me out of the water. Yeah. Well, me too. I mean, this for me is just like a trap for gurus. You know, I get these like beings and they, they like, I get to sit with them and they, they, they blow, they, they blow my mind too. I, that's just what, what, what has happened. Like if your mind's being blown, my mind's being blown. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I realized that and that I'm saying, wow, that's really a blessing that you be, you get to do that. But you're also doing something really important that you are putting these people, you're introducing these people to the world, to a lot of people, you know, there was people you, you have on your show that I never even heard of, what's his name, Lucian Gray, Lucian Graves. Oh, sure. I never heard of that. Temple of Satan. Yeah. Yeah. And how about today I get, I get an email, a text message that's, you know, just because you're interested, it says, the temple of Satan is suing Netflix. So, and at the same time, the town of paradise is fucking on fire. I mean, what kind of letters is going on, man? You know, my guess is there's no correlation. No, but I did see a very sad, somebody tweeted this very sad thing to me. I don't know how I ended up on the tweet on the, you know, sometimes you end up on these tweet chains. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're at, and this guy tweeted this very sad tweet. As a pastor, you know, I, I think, I try not to just tell people about abundance, but the reality of hell. And now seeing what's happening was like four images. One of them, the satanic temple in some kind of march. Another one, I don't know, some dude who would like apparently like implanted something in his forehead and then something that looks awesome, which I'll never get to go to, unfortunately, which is in Columbia. Someone's opened up some church to Satan, but it looks like Stanley Kubrick really designed the interior. You know, it's like really, really cool. Like it's definitely not. It's really funny and really cool. It's got that carny feeling. I love it. I love it. Sometimes has attached to it, you know, what's your take on Satan? What do you think about Satanism? What's your feelings about it? It's, you know, it's like, I think it's very close to Buddhism. That's, you know, I saw that in and I started to read Damien's book. Oh, yeah. And, you know, he talks about being a Zen practitioner through sitting, you know, sitting there and, you know, doing visualizations. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, he doesn't. He does he self identify as a Satanist? I have to go a little deeper than on that. I'm not sure. Hey, guys, I got a message from Alan this morning. You want to clarify something regarding this question that I asked him? It's actually a dumb question. Because I was sort of halfway through Damien's book and isn't at all a Satanist. There's nothing in there about that at all. But yet I asked the question and I was done on my part. Anyway, Alan sent this awesome voice memo to me to answer the question. So, Duncan, you asked me, does Damien identify as a Satanist? And I said, I don't know. I have to go a little deeper. But in thinking about it, listening to the podcast and in retrospect, that wasn't the answer. I know in my heart, Damien is absolutely not a Satanist. He's a magician. He's an amazing visualizer, a meditator and a teacher. OK, thanks, Duncan. Let's wrap this weird interruption up with a quote from the notorious Mark Twain. I have always felt friendly towards Satan. Of course, that is ancestral. It must be in the blood for I could not have originated it. That's the autobiography of the blasphemer himself, Mark Twain, not back to the podcast. Hail Satan, just kidding. There's a lot of problems when it comes to like practicing what is, you know, what people call magic or whatever, which is really just like a kind of religion or a kind of practice that I think I guess it kind of reminds me of the Aghoris in India. You know, the I don't know the Shyvites. They worship Shiva. They do magic. You know, kind of reminds me that to some degree. But, you know, we had this whole beautiful, magical, religious, spiritual tradition here in the United States and in Europe that got like wiped out. It got wiped out by, you know, people calling themselves Christians. And that's real. That's not some conspiracy theory. They're burning them alive and they're killing them and cutting their heads off and going into their groves and desecrating the crowd. They're basically, I think you could say they were doing what the thing that is currently happening to the Tibetans or has happened to the Tibetans with the invasion of China happened to an entirely different religion, except that religion got mostly just wiped off the map. So now what now what's going on is like we have these people who see a goat and they're like, that's the devil, it's the devil, the goat in the hoofs and no one even spends any amount of time asking themselves, why are goats considered evil? Is there a less evil? I mean, like if I had to like bees are more evil than goats, little tiny heads. They're like lambs. Yeah, they're like lambs with weird eyes. Yeah. The but Kenneth Anger told me that look at the cover of Goatshead Soup. And what's Goatshead Soup? Oh, it's a Rolling Stones album. OK, it's a Rolling Stones. That's great. I think you like chicken soup or the snow. No, no, no, no, no. And it's a weekly. It's a picture of it's a picture of I think it's Mick Jagger sort of with a goat. Like on his face and he's got like menstrual blood on his mouth. Yeah, wiping it off. Kenneth said that's scaring people. Yeah, yeah. So think of that. So here, like imagine if like he'd had a bee superimposed over his head and his face was covered in like just like the dripping love juice of whoever's pussy was licking. That's what that's what that was. Yeah. You know, if that had happened, everybody like, cool, man, he's like a hornet bee. But like you could put a goat and menstrual blood. One is like the prerequisite for one of my favorite dishes, goat cheese, at least on salads. The other is a prerequisite for life to happen on the fucking planet. And you put those over his face and everybody's like, he's at a league with Lucifer. You know, it's ridiculous. The symbology is not diabolical at all. I don't know where it comes from. Well, I think it comes from. I think there's like a mischievous, carny, coyote sense. Wouldn't you say like whenever I've met whenever I've met these these Satanists in general, there's a trickster sense to them. Absolutely. Well, Ramdas calls it. He calls them rascals. Yeah. Is that his word to use? That's right. He used to use that word. Yeah. He said, I'm around. He called Christian Dasarascal. You know, have you heard the the Anton Leve podcast? No, no, not him, not him, but they're doing his bio in a podcast on cults. Oh, cool. And he was he was a carny. I know he was definitely a carny. And he was funny. Did you ever meet him? No. How'd you meet Kenneth Anger? Can you, first of all, this describe to the to the listeners who Kenneth Anger is? I just say no, because they might not know. Kenneth Anger is like one of the foremost independent film directors in the world. I mean, he's made movies that he's revered by in the 60s. And now today, the current prop of, you know, millennials are freaking out over Kenneth Anger. Yeah. But he was also he was a I guess he was a practicing satanist. Wasn't he more? I mean, I do. What's that dude on his chest? What's that thing? Satan. Oh, Lucifer Lucifer. What does that mean? What? What does that mean? That Lucifer Lucifer is on his chest. Yeah. Yeah. You know, a big nice one, goth lettering. And yeah. And so he has that. He also has a jacket, a satan jacket that says Lucifer on the back. Oh, yeah. That that my daughter is dying for. It's like a thousand dollars. I'm saying you got to relax on that, Sim. I'll get you that for Christmas. We'll see. What do you mean, he still makes him and sells him? Yeah. On his website. No shit. Yeah. No, those are cool. It's cool. It's cool. It's really beautiful jacket. Yeah. Yeah. It's beautiful. I know. But and it's written. It's just it's embroidered. It's very nice, very nice, very classy. Yeah. And so, yeah. So I met Kenneth. I met so many people in the same way you do through what I do in the entertainment industry as a producer. I wanted to produce Hollywood Babylon, Kenneth's book, as a movie. And I tracked him down. And and that that was that began our relationship. And I worked with him on that for like two years. I did that with Leary. That's how I met Leary. I wanted to do a a sitcom like Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, a serialized version of family living on a space was it called the space station when Leary was doing his, you know, his home aliens, you know, going from planet to planet, traveling in the stars. And that's how I met Leary. I met him at Dantanas. That is so wild. Yeah. But I want to jump to Leary. But let's stay on Kenneth Enger. Yeah. Yeah. This isn't also the sense when you when you when we were hanging out for the first time. I thought, my God, like this is like a thousand hours of conversation. Potentially. Yeah. Yeah. Because I can't just jump. Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry. I think or sorry to to to Leary that quick, man, because I think there's something that just, you know, one of the things that really bugs me a lot right now is like and that, for one, like, because I've had Satanists or the head of the Temple of Satan on my podcast or that, you know, the new incarnation of it. Well, you know, that that was the former. There's the Lucian Lucian, yeah. But that's the Temple of Satan as opposed to the Satanic Temple. There, too. Yeah. Wait, which Anton Levé was the Satanic Temple. That's so confusing. And Lucian is the Temple of Satan, the Temple of Satan. Yeah, he reversed it. Yeah. But there are two, you know, communities of Satanist. Yeah. Yeah. And so one thing that really bothers me, I don't mind being lumped in with Satanists at all. Like, that doesn't bother me at all. I'm not a Satanist. I don't identify as a Satanist. But my my encounters with Satanists throughout my life has always been mostly good, you know, it's like. And if it's been bad, it's only been bad because of my own, like, how would you say, inability to discipline myself? Because they got great drugs. Some of them. I'm having dinner with one of them tonight. But in general, I find them to be like really ethical and moral. And I find them to be intelligent and intelligent. It was probably that I sent you a. You picked up a transmission from me. And and that was I was thinking before coming here. Do I want to talk to you about Joey Diaz and Naropa? Or do I want to talk about this thing? Or talk about Buddhism, man. Like, that's the thing that blew my mind. I mean, everything. Like, yeah, because you're just so deeply intertwined with so many things that I love. It's likewise. What do we pick from? Yeah. You know what I mean? But this will be part one. OK, great. Yeah, you know, and it's right. And it's exactly. And it's this this woman who's this executive at Stitcher who said, do you know, Duncan? She came in when I was doing a recording over there. And she said, do you know, Duncan Tressel? I said, no, who's that? She said, check out his podcast. Cool. It blew my fucking mind. Awesome. And I couldn't stop listening to you. So cool. Yeah. I've gone back and into to Joey Diaz's podcast of five years ago. Digging deep into it, you know. I love Joey Diaz because, like, you know, Buddhists and I identify as a Buddhist, so Buddhists like me. We talk about it a lot. Yeah, the levels of it, the noble truths, the what you call the perfections, the parameters, this and that and this and that. Perfections, right? Yeah. Meanwhile, you know, as far as like a living practice, you know, I don't know. I don't know how I'm doing there, you know, but someone like Joey Diaz. I think you're doing fucking good, man. Thank you, brother. Really good. But Joey Diaz, you run into him. And he doesn't really talk about Buddhism. It reminds me of what Jack Kornfield said to me. He said, we don't want you to be a Buddhist. We want you to be the Buddha. Oh, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Well, I think you are an important part of what's going on in in the Dharma in the West right now with your show. I really believe that. What is going on? Well, first of all, do you think for people listening, you could talk a little bit about what the Dharma means, what the Dharma is, even because maybe people listening don't aren't clear on what that term is. But I want to just back it up a little bit because I was thinking about some of the things that I've been pondering. And one of those is I've had a lot of Buddhist teachers over the years, a lot of, you know, Rinpoche's and Guru's and. There's scandals. You tell me about this. You said it. I was talking to you about my my third ex-wife or something and that she she got involved in Shambhala. Yeah. And then you said, oh, she involved in the scandal. Yeah. And so so I went to look this up. Yeah. And it turns out. She is the secretary of the wife of Trunk Pasan, whatever his what is his name? I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, that's it. She she's his wife's secretary. So she's like right in there in the inner circle. Jesus Christ, what you have to say? I didn't call her. I haven't called her. But I might, you know, I don't know. This thing, when you see that man, when you see like this kind of like sort of flying apart, that's happening in that way, you know, which is not just there. It's like, you know, those women talk to the Dalai Lama about this. And like you go back and like, you know, if you look at like Buddha, the Buddhist history with women in general and the misogyny and the patriarchy and the like complete dismissal of women. Yeah. Yeah. It's being like a road bump. Yeah. Basically a kind of just a road bump to realization, like something you just got to like look out for women. You can't. Yeah. I've right now. Two women are my main spiritual teachers. Who are these? You wouldn't, they're two. One is a former nun. She was ordained for set 27 years and gave back her robes. Her name is Tenzin Katcho. And another one is called Lobsang Dreamay, who is who is still a a teacher. She's amazing. Is this Ningma? No, they're part of Mahayana. They're part of the FPMT. What is the FPMT? The Foundation for the Preservation of Mahayana Buddhism. Oh, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Acronyms don't. Yeah. Yeah. So she is she's the director of a place called the Land of Medicine Buddha. And and when I got sick, I picked up through Ningma, I picked up a medicine Buddha. I called up there. I called up to talk to Tarthang Tolco, who is the head cash. Yeah. Who's got some some stories around him, too, that, you know, people question. And I called him and he said he introduced me to the the tanka, the deity of the medicine Buddha, Guru Medicine Buddha. And I wanted to delve a little deeper into it. And I found that there was up in Northern California, a retreat that was going to happen on the medicine Buddha. And I went up there and this none venerable Dremay was teaching it. And that saved my life, man. You mean literally saved my life. It cured you. It cured me. What were you sick with? I cancer. Which kind? Bad kind. I had it was it was a variation of lymphoma. And it was called mantle cell lymphoma. Jesus. That put me to the edge of the fucking world. And I would go in. I went for nine months of chemo. And I would go in to Cedars every other week to stay there for four days to get an infusion. And I would go in with my tankas and my mantras and my underground comic books. And I would sit there for four days with my beads. And it was fucking incredible. And in addition to the chemo and a good doctor and my wife, all that should save my life. That was 18 years ago. And I put that away. Thank you. It's great. Yeah. And I never talk about it. I don't want to talk about it because I don't want it to be to stigmatize me in any way. But now I'm in a position that it's so far and back of me. And if somebody has a problem out there, medicine Buddha is the way. And it's being taught by a teacher. And he's one of the only gurus I know in in Buddhism right now. That it's not involved in any sort of scandal. Oh, that's that's the Dalai Lama is one of them. And there are so many others that are just like, oh, are you kidding me? So I said, and I was going to answer you the question, answer the question. What is the Dharma? The Dharma is the work, the teachings of the Buddha. It's the teachings that Buddha gave after he sat under the Bodhi tree and woke, came out of the meditation and he taught for several, I don't know, several months. And he was developing the Sangha. The Sangha is the group that studied with the Buddha. And he talks about the turning of the wheel, the turning of the wheel of the Dharma. That's the teaching. And so that's what I was getting. And this teacher is named Lama Zopa Rinpoche. He came here in 7070. That's when the wave of these Buddhists came. These Rinpoches came to the West. What is that? Why did that? Did that was that planned out? I don't I don't know, man. I really don't know. I think it was. I think maybe his holiness or the Karmapa came then and and his holiness hadn't come yet. But I could very well have been. But there's a whole wave. They all came out of Tibet. They escaped Tibet. They went to Damsala. And then they started coming to the United States. So I got to find that. I'm going to get the answer to that. It was we got when we didn't just get them. We also got Ramdas. You know, we got like it. There was this like incredible infusion of Eastern mysticism and philosophy in the Dharma. That injected itself into mainstream culture in the United States. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And it intertwined weirdly with this like wave of like comedy. True. True. Because I didn't know that. It's absolutely true. I don't know why. I don't know how Gary Shanling and the whole documentary. I didn't see that documentary. Gary Shanling studied with Tik Nakhon. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. He worked with me on Welcome Back. Holy shit. Yeah. And I have no idea that he was, you know, practicing. He was doing it a long time. Yes, he was. He was, you know, it was important to his existence too. Well, I mean, it is. I mean, to me, it's like as a fellow cancer survivor and but not quite so bad. Just had one of my balls snipped off and got some radiation, but still fucking scary. And still makes you sick and still teaches you something. You know, the great teaching, the great, great teaching. That's what it was for me. Yeah. Impermanence. That's it. Impermanence. Yeah. Because you do. I mean, I remember like walking around before that and really toying with the idea. You know, maybe maybe this is like some kind of dream and maybe I'm immortal. I like maybe like, but they're going to like, I'm not going to die. Maybe I'm not one who doesn't get sick. You know, you hear like all these people. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know that. And I really believe it. I didn't believe it. Believe it. But it just kind of the sense of like, you know, people get sick. My mom got sick, but not me. And then it was not me. You know, yeah. And that's that's one of the things the Buddha saw, of course, you know, prior to leaving his opulent life, he saw a dying, you know, he went out into the street and he saw he saw people dying. He didn't even know what that was. His parents were protecting him. Yeah. And he saw he saw pain. He saw suffering. Yeah. He saw suffering. And so I had no idea, but I did it. My sister says to me, I went to the edge of the Circus of Horus. I woke up one night in fucking intensive care and the guy next to me couldn't take it anymore. And he pulled out his tubes and he was flapping around like a fish on the floor up and down and they put the sirens on and shit. Yeah. It was like, whoa, I never forget that moment. I have PSTT from that shit. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah. It sticks with me, you know. And so going back, my thought was there's some we're jumping all over the place, but my thought was that there are so many of these teachers that are taking advantage of students of women, of the me too stuff. Yeah. That what am I going to do, you know? And what I was going to do, it's just last night, I got to stay with the Dharma. That doesn't mean the teachings aren't good. What it means is I just got to find the right teacher. Right. You know, and that's where it's at for me. I love the, I love the Dharma. I love the Buddha. I love the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has performed miracles for me. I mean fucking miracles. I saw it. Oh yeah, man. I've been around. I saw it, man. I don't think, you know, weirdly with Buddhism or like kind of the neophyte phase I'm at right now. No, you're not. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. But you know what I mean in the sense of like, one of the things I love that Trumpa said is, you know, it's good to kind of like when you're starting off just realize, oh we're absolute fools. So we have something to work from, you know, because if we're going to start off from a different spot, when I go to college, when I went to college, I needed this attitude of like, I don't know this yet. Because if I knew it, I wouldn't need to go to college. You know, and that's good. You know, with all things like that, you know. Where did you go to school? Warren Wilson. It's liberal liberal arts. It's a great school, man. North Carolina. It's one of the schools my daughter was thinking about going to. Oh, it's great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Great, great, great, great. Great fucking school. They taught you how to garden and grow things. I mean, one of my favorite professors there, I remember sitting down for the first day of class and like, you know, this is like a super liberal arts school. Like we sat down under a tree and the first lecture he gave was just drop out. Guys, like, this is a mistake. And he's like, trust me, it's better for you to spend this money on travel. I would say I taught also, and I would say that to the students too. And they wanted to go to film school. I was like, there's a fucking waste of time. You're on it. I mean, that's the best. And I remember sitting there and he goes, this is like one of the great teachings I got my life. Wow. As he goes up, here's the way it works. Right now, life seems kind of slow to you. You know when you're speeding up on a street and the telephone poles start going by? He's like, that's what's going to happen to you. Wow. Wow. Yeah. And so don't really, you shouldn't be here right now. Like just go, go to India is what he said. And then he goes, like, I know you think you can't go to India. I know you think you don't have enough money or you can't figure out a way to do it, but you can figure it out. So just drop out of school now and go to India. That's the best. But so it's, but to get back to the point of hand here, in a weird way, like my sense in talking about Buddhism, even though I yap about it too much, is a feeling like, man, I don't want to spoil it. Like the way I don't want to talk about Westworld or something. The way I don't want to talk about a great show or something. Because there, I think there are things that when I was like learning about Buddhism in the beginning or when I had an idea of Buddhism, you know, actually the first time I heard about Buddhism, I was with my friend Emil on acid at Warren Wilson. And I'm tripping and it's cold and we're sitting outside in the cold. I'm in my jacket shivering and he's like, Duncan, listen to this, listen to this, listen to this. Life is suffering. And I was like, oh, weird. He goes, that's called dukkha. And he goes, you know, and the cause of suffering is attachment. That's, I think it's called tanha, I think is the second one. I can't remember the names get mixed up. And I remember him, I'm tripping and I'm like, whoa, I think I said to him or I thought, what is this? Some kind of Eskimo religion or something? Like that's because I was cold. But he goes, that's Buddhism. And I was like, what the fuck? Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. That's crazy. Because, you know, when we talk about the teachers in particular and the problems that we're experiencing right now, which are very sad, very problematic for a lot of different reasons. You know, number one, it's hurting people who trusted power dynamics, all of it. And then on top of that, there's like an additional problem, which is doesn't the dharma heal? Doesn't the dharma shift and transform? And if the dharma is truly transformative, then what, how did you rationalize this type of aggression? I don't know the answers to these questions at all. But what's cool about Buddhism is regardless of the, the, these things that are happening and probably have happened again and again and just haven't been documented. I don't know. We have a very scientific systematic approach to suffering. That's what I was going to say. And the healing. And the healing. Yeah. There is like, though, we do need the teachers. We have to, it's a fundamental component from my own experience. You can't do it on your own. No way. You could, you can have all the books in the world, but you still need to have a teacher to help you. You have to. I think that's what, that's what I understand. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, it's kind of a little bit like if you're going to do the Olympic torch thing, unfortunately, you need people to pass the torch to in the passing of this dharma. One component of his knowledge, but there seems to be another component, right? Oh, I think there is. I think there's, I think there's something that I have no idea what it is, but it's some sort of transmission that I've received over the years. I think I've received it through the Kamapa. I've received it from Tothank Toku, the first time I ever met him, first time I ever met a Buddhist teacher. He looked at me and said, what do you do? I said, I'm a producer in LA. He said, ah, you work for me in Los Angeles. So I went out to my wife and I said, he's telling me I'm going to work for him. No fucking way. Next thing I know, I'm helping him distribute his books at the Bodhi tree. I'm like schlepping books. I've turned, we had a guest house. I turned the room into, into a meditation center where people could walk in, you know? Yeah, man. So, um, man makes plans. God laughs. Yeah. And my, my teacher, you know, he has a similar story. My teacher's a, he's, I think he's won Grammys. Oh, David Nectar. Yeah. Yeah. He's a great music, great, great musician. I'm going to try to come to the November 16th night. I want to see that. I want to see that. He smashed into Chogym Trumper Rinpoche, you know, and like this happens. You run into these people and it doesn't, it's like, that's the funniest thing about it is like you cross paths with Ram Dass. You cross paths with these teachers and like you said, oh, I was just at a dinner party with him and then my life, something happened, something happened, which is why I asked you, what do you think that is? And that brings us to what you're talking about now. Which is the transmission. Yeah. Dharma transmission, as it's called. What is that? Is this a, what, what is it? Is it magic? Is it an energy? I can't, I can't answer that question specifically. I could just tell you from experiences that I've had, that I was talking to a friend of mine before I came, I'm sorry, Duncan, that, that was New Yorker with my hands moving all over the joint. That, that came, I sent him an email. I said, Nicholas, I really would like to talk to you. There are a few things I want to discuss. And he emails me back. He said, this is really amazing. I'm in Los Angeles. He lives in Europe. I'm in Los Angeles today. What are you doing? You know, so, and I said, well, I guess you picked up my, my message, you know, from a transmission. He said, we don't even need to have phones, you know, you and I talked about that the other day. Yeah. So that's what it is. I don't know what it is, Duncan. I don't know. All I know is that some weird things that happened to me since I've been around Buddhism. And that's 40 years. The other night I had a dream and the, the dream was it was really intense. I was looking at my computer screen and all I saw, I didn't see myself, but I saw the screen. I saw an email and the email was from you saying, I have to switch our appointment today. And I said, oh, fuck, man, something must have come up. I'm really sorry. This is my dream. Yeah. And then I woke up like three hours later and I said, I better check my emails and it wasn't. There was no email. It was just in my dream. I dreamt an email from you. Yeah. And so I don't know what that means, but that was certainly. Was this when I canceled on you? No, no. This was last night. Okay. This is my anxiety about wanting to be here that I'm dreaming your emails in front of me. The weird thing that happened when I met you, which was really kind of mind blowing to me is, so I'd been, you know, I've been studying, I keep saying this. I don't know why I keep saying it. So I've been studying Buddhism with Nick Turn and, you know, his teachers took him Trumpa. So I'm going Kagu Buddhism. And then within that, suddenly Nyingma, is that how you pronounce it? Yeah. Yeah. Nyingma Buddhism pops up. And then I'm just Googling that. I don't, you know, I still, from my research, I didn't really understand much of what it meant. But then the next day I meet you and you're like, oh, I practice Nyingma Buddhism, which is the second time in my life I've even heard of. You know, there's something it's called Rime, R-I-M-E, and it's mixing different schools. Okay. It's being open to the different schools. You can ask Nick Turn about that. Okay. And I believe like Lamasurya Das. Sure. He studied, studies Buddhism, studies Nyingma and Kagu, what's the, uh, Kagu. Kagu. And he was a student of the Kamapa. Okay. And so he had a combination of both. That guy got me good. And I thought, I thought you mentioning the Nyingma because of him, that you might have met him. No, I didn't know he practiced Nyingma. He got me. He got me. And they get you. That's the other thing about Buddhists. They get you. You know, not in a bad way, but they, you do forget. And that these, you know, this is a llama. He's heavy. So like, but he's wearing a Hawaiian shirt. I know. So he's like, get this Buddhist, you know, rather, uh, the Ram Dass retreat. And I've been up there doing these interviews and I've been like putting on the show where I've been trying to act like I'm skeptical, but I'd started at that time to not really be skeptical anymore, but I felt like it was cooler to seem skeptical. Um, so I was just trying to, you know, uh, it was, it was not truthful, you know, because I'd already been experiencing this love, like this opening and like, but it was, this was early on still for me, you know, I'm still scared. Sometimes I do get skeptical to this day when I was putting on the show, you know, skepticism or something, trying to be cool. So, um, he comes up to me. It's the last day. It was perfect timing too. You know, he like really gave it to me on the last day and, you know, and skillful means they talk about these, I think it's, what is it for skillful means? One of them is, um, the sword is like cutting. Cutting. Yeah. Cutting. And then there's some other ones, you know, including there's ways of doing it, but he just, he did the right thing. I think, uh, I'll never forget it though. My jurisdiction holds the sword of knowledge that he, I think that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So cutting through the bullshit, as they say here, cutting through spiritual materialism. Yeah. Yeah. As, uh, Chogan Trump wrote, but anyway, he, uh, I remember like, he came up to me in a freaking Hawaiian shirt, you know, so that I, and I'm not saying, like, he's just wearing it around the retreat. You see him, he's somebody like, you think like, this is a guy who's going to be giving you like burgers at a barbecue or something, man. Like he, he just is like, you don't realize this guy's trained for a long time. For years, years. Yeah. He studied a long time, still studying. Yeah. And teachers, you know, so when he's teaching, you're studying. Teaching. And he goes, Hey, can I do, can I talk to you for just a quick second? Yeah. I'm like, sure we're talking. And he's like, you know, just might give you a little bit of, uh, criticism respectfully. He said, in a really cool way. I was completely, all my defenses were down. I'm like, Oh yeah, sure. Well, sure. He goes, you know that, uh, that thing you're doing where you, you know, you act skeptical. He's like, that in like 20 years or 10 years, he's like, that's going to be the same thing as saying groovy all the time. That's great. He's not going to age well. Fashionable cynicism isn't going to age well, man. And then he's like, also, you know, if you, uh, by pretending you don't, I can't remember how he said it. He said it in a really cool way and he said it in a sweet way. The way I say it sounds sinister, but the way he did it was so sweet and bubbly. He's like, you know, also that kind of like, I can't remember. So forgive me. Uh, students of llamas, psoriasis, llamas, psoriasis, I mean, no disrespect. I just, it's been a bit of time, but he said something along the lines of, uh, you know, that kind of deception, you didn't even use those words. He said them very sweet way. He's that kind of thinking kill you. You know, you could kind of rip you apart from the inside. He didn't say it like that, but that's, I knew he was right. You can't fucking parade around. You can't do phony picked it up, huh? Yeah. And it was awesome. And then he was like, okay, well, you know, and he left and I'm sitting there having been essentially flayed by a llama in the sweetest way, you know, and then the, and truly the most compassionate thing you could have done was that it was great. Wow. Yeah. It's great. But that's, does he know that? Have you told him that? I don't think I've ever told him that. I'll never talk to him again after he said that shit to me. What was he thinking? When I saw, he's an interesting cat. When I saw him, we were at a talk of his holiness, his holiness talk somewhere. I forget where it was in New York. And at the break, we both got up and we would walk. I didn't know him. We were walking. I knew he was and we walked by and he looked at me and said, how do you like that? That was pretty funny. He does these like dad jokes. Then he said, yeah. And then he said, where did you go to college? Was it in Queens or in Brooklyn on Jewish, you know, enclaves, you know? He, these Buddhists, man, like that's the thing. It's not what you think it is. Number one, right? Like probably, and if you haven't done any practice or you haven't spent any time with it, it might not be anything that you think it is. Like you see, you think like, what did you think Buddhism was when you first heard about it without knowing anything about it? Did you have any sense of what it was? No idea. I had no idea. I didn't know what I was standing on the ocean in a kaftan with psilocybin with Larry Hagman working on a comedy. I was producing a show that he was. So you're asking how does, you know, the comedy blend in? I was with Larry on a Sunday. Larry's Sundays. Larry Hagman. Can you tell everyone who that is in case they don't know? He was one of the great comedians. He, one of the great comics, one of the great actors. He was in, he was like, you know, an iconic actor. I dream of Jeannie. I dream of Jeannie and J.R. in Dallas. And I produced the show. A pilot with him. God, that whole. He was J.R. The cowboy hat. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I had the cowboy. He had the cowboy hat and he had a house in Malibu and he had a beautiful wife. They're both deceased now. And on Sundays, he had a day of silence. Every day, every Sunday, he stayed in silence, which was a great thing. And I was producing a pilot that it was called Here We Go Again. It was, it went on the air, but it didn't do very well. So it was on in like 11 weeks. It was off. But I would became very close with Larry. And where was I going with this? Oh, he asked me. He asked me what I, how I knew about Buddhism. And so he's standing out at the ocean and I'm standing next to him. He's in silence. He's looking out at the sunset and he's going. Oh, money. Pardon me. Oh, and he's doing this chant. Oh, money. Pardon me. I never heard that before. And oh, money. So it's like a basic, you know, chant, chant. I'll look at the shavara. It's, you know, it's, you know, asking for compassion to blessing your friends. Behold the jewel. Yeah. Yeah. And the heart of the load. Exactly. Exactly. And so that's, so he explains that to me. And I like the sound, the vibration of it. Yeah. And I feel it going through me. And that's all I knew. And I didn't know. Are you on acid too? psilocybin. Oh, psilocybin. Yeah. I'm sorry. I thought LSD because I know Hagman was at that time was doing the LSD therapy that people were doing back then. Didn't he use it to treat his alcoholism or something? Or am I confusing him with someone? He, he, he liked, as he told me, he liked to have the trickle of champagne going through his body all day long. And I did too. And so, so he liked that. It was very sensible, you know, but he was drinking real bad shit. He was drinking La Domaine, which was like $3 a bottle. Why would he do that? That makes no sense. I don't know. I don't know. But, but anyway, so he was liking to smoke and all that, but it was psilocybin. I don't think he was doing any sort of acid treatment. I'm not sure. I could be wrong. A quick Google search. I feel like I have to do it just so that I can clear his name from such a terrible accusation. Let's see. Larry Hagman, LSD therapy. Let me look it up real quick. Kavira, you know what it is? No, it's not LSD therapy. It's that there is a wonderful clip of Larry Hagman saying all politicians should use LSD. That's it. That too. That's good. But so he was doing psilocybin. And he had it. He had it ground up. He would snort it or eat a little bit of it. And he had a lot of that. And I remember going to the Grateful Dead Concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Now, I'm in Hollywood like two years. I'm a kid. And I was going to the Hollywood Bowl. I'm sitting in the back of Larry's van. He had a Chevrolet Step Van like the size of a food truck. And he had a dome in it. And he had a hammock in it. And I'm sitting in the hammock. He puts me in the hammock. He's in the captain's seat. And we're off to the ball to see the Grateful Dead. It was wonderful. That is the coolest store. I mean, man. Oh, I just can't even imagine standing in the ocean with Larry Hagman, tripping on mushrooms. And that's where you heard Om Mani Padme Om for the first time. It's like, what is, I mean, and then when you consider where that vibration came from or comes from. So I guess if you wanted to get into the semantics of it. But what do you think, behold, the jewel in the heart of the lotus means? I think the jewel is the dharma or the Buddha that was in the heart of the lotus. And it's experiencing that. It's hearing that sound, which is the sound of, I think that's the sound of the Buddha. It's the sound of everything. Om Om Om Vajragara Payma iye Om That that was the Vajra Guru mantra which is very similar to Om Manipad Me Om but that's the Om Manipad Me Om is called the six syllable mantra but what I just did was a Nyingma mantra that Padma Sambhava who brought Buddhism to Tibet in the eighth century did. I got them mixed up I got too much shit running in my head so anyway um that was intense man oh good we could do that for now or if you'd like I would like that I love doing that I love I I I you know my like I've had a couple like mind-blowing psychedelic experiences when it comes to religion one of them reading the book of John on LSD and then this like thought occurred to me somebody wrote this you know and that was like a really intense moment because somehow I'd forgotten that this was written by someone I don't know you know like it just been here or something but then you realize like wait I can almost trace the personality I can almost not just trace the person like when I'm around the uh well what actually I think it is a verse in the New Testament isn't it you you'll you can know the father by the son uh and there's like a thumb print that is in the the scripture of something I don't know what exactly but it's a thumb print I don't know what it is in the same way saying what's this transmission thing I don't know but similarly and this is something I would I've talked about David a little bit at some point and chogum Trump or Rinpoche talks about this at some point after gaining realization or whatever happened to this person called the Buddha which is a true historic figure it happened he started talking he was not talking and then he started talking and there was this thing that he he was now or had found or saw or realized or connected with or I don't know the right words for it merged with or melted into or something and he was quiet and then he started talking and then something came out he had to take this thing that was before language shunyata or whatever you want to call it the fruitful emptiness the clear light and it had to turn it into words and there was some first moment where that happened and then we have these sounds now and you can see this thumb print in it or something right like there's a thing yeah and his um his voice when it came out if you were sitting in front of him it was like a bell you know when they ring the bell um beautiful sound that's what it would sound like but if you were three miles away it would sound equally as powerful and beautiful as the same so when the Buddha started talking you didn't have to be right in front of him it just spread out I'm sorry it spread out to to the land to the people yeah it was and it spread out through time yeah it was an I think of these things as like a nuclear a temporal nuclear spiritual bomb that was detonating and rippling the time space continuum all the way the point up until right now because right like we're still the ripples of that moment we are in the ripple of the moment of this being's realization it's not a this thing didn't happen in the past it the past is on is not as fog it's like it's fog and there's a landscape and the past and the present the future this foggy thing on top of this like thing that is not doesn't seem to be very touched by transient phenomena you know and so that's where one of the weird traps or tricks of buddhism is you can start thinking it's archaic primitive antiquated past thing you know and that's one of the I think the spoilers I didn't I don't want to do necessarily suddenly realize like wait fuck it's still now oh the bell ringing thing oh shit you could be thousands of years away from it and still here it just is clear if you just listen a little bit that's where it's pretty intense to me and then you realize oh I see what meditation is you know because if you don't like yeah I when I'm thinking of meditation or go home self-knowing or whatever I've always thought of it as like prior to like working with a teacher and he didn't tell me this shit PS I'm sorry David if this is completely off the mark or something but um prior to working with a teacher I had this concept of meditation of being really kind of painful boring like like kind of like a uncomfortable position in yoga a sort of thing you do in the way you jog or do push-ups or some shit and I didn't know that what you were doing is getting quiet enough so you could hear that bell ringing you know I didn't realize that's what it was and then maybe you hear just a second of that bell even if it's just a second and you're like wait a minute what is that I don't want to hear that again and then you don't get to hear it again because you're thinking about you know I'll tell you one thing what you just gave me is a great teaching just being here with you is a teaching oh thank you it's true Duncan thank you yeah I'm learning a lot from you I'm learning a lot from you this bell idea is beautiful I love it so much and that's why it looks really funny about it oh there it is when you were doing that chant I was after you finished I wanted to grab this oh let's hear it ah that's my bell you see that's the that's the Vajra at the top of the bell yeah yeah I see that I see that sometimes it's good to have the Vajra and the bell because the Buddha has the the he's holding a Vajra and a bell so in one in one of my visualizations when I do the six the six the six yoga practice I visualize the Buddha sitting on a seat of a moon seat and a sun seat as if it was slices of cheese and the Buddha is sitting there and he's holding his consort with him and he's holding a Vajra which is like the Dorje the lightning bolt symbol and the bell and then I take refuge in the in the three jewels the three jewels being the Sangha the Dharma and the Buddha take refuge in those every day and then I recite a mantra to the depends which one I do but you know we could do um Om Mani Padme Om right now if we like Om Mani Padme Om Om Mani Padme Om Om Mani Padme Om Om Mani Padme Om Om Mani Padme Om wow yeah your face was right that was really trippy man that concludes this episode of the Dunkin Trussell family out that was amazing what I just saw what did you see well the shit man it was timeless it was completely timeless you filled up I saw you but your head was just floating filling up my whole screen wow amazing and you were in me I was you were in me that's what I was about to tell you oh you were just seeing some reflection of yourself yeah that's could be well because you have this practice you know you can't that thing you're doing I don't know we the funniest thing about this the Dharma I think or talking about this stuff is it's like a river it's weird because it's like a river and it's it's streams going into a river or something and the streams are like no you're the one making the river all these trees this is the episode this is the first segment we're gonna do we can we do this in a month I love to thank you so much love to because we didn't are we okay are we okay

leaving you know a little box I have this was there this was a Christmas card I got last year I'm giving you I'm recycling I'm recycling a card for you that's my Christmas card to you Duncan to you and Aaron and the baby I just want to like just only because we're talking about my you know Nick turn has this term um called uh tendril and tendril no it's a it's a Tibetan term I think Sanskrit term I'm not sure Tibetan I believe but uh the the the term means um the weird synchronicities that happen in relation to a practice you're not supposed to you're supposed to disown them that's what Trump is I just don't get you well that becomes spiritual materialism if you talk about it you get addicted to miracles yeah right but um uh but uh a friend of mine and I were texting just today and I said my my compassion muscle is weak and she said oh that's something you can work on and I said uh she said I'm not a very compassionate person by nature I work on that every day of my life um and then you give me this thing and I'm just gonna read it yeah it's good it's good that's an important muscle that's the muscle you need for enlightenment yeah yeah look holy shit you have compassion tattooed on your arm remember I was a punk also and let's just mention my podcast for one second could we mention it no we're gonna talk about it I'm gonna read this card first and also as an aside I think it's cool to have compassion tattooed on your arm than Lucifer on your chest I don't have Lucifer but that don't give me any ideas I don't want to make that commitment to Lucifer what's that the the tattoo yeah it's a pretty sounding word and yeah yeah too bad it's like I mean it's like it's I don't know I don't know unless the guy I'm having dinner with tonight see what he says um who you have oh about Lucifer yeah that's from podcast to you I'm gonna read this and then let's talk about your podcast for a second okay can I go to the restroom yeah of course pausing now and and Phil Spector did that to me what did he do well he held me a gunpoint in his house that's a long story I'm recording should I delete that no I don't care it's on another part I don't care but he but he was amazing so he had he had me locked in his house I wanted to do I wanted to him to do the music for a pilot I was producing yeah so I'm locked in his house with George and he locked me in and I'm sitting there for like four hours and his gun is out and you know he's but he looks at me and he says why are you here I said you know why I'm here I wanted you to do them I wanted you to do the music for this pilot that I'm producing and he said no you're here because you want to go back and tell people I drink too much I take drugs and I play with guns and with that he takes his jacket off and he's wearing the biggest gun I've ever seen Jesus Christ right and now the gun comes out and I'm locked there but he was prophetic because I'm still talking it's one of my best stories I've been telling people that fills back the hell of me at gunpoint I liked him I liked him you know but you know anyway cocaine no really no drugs no drugs not that I should get to the point of paranoia where you're holding guns on I think I think it might have been you know some you know bipolar medications I don't I don't know but it was also um he was drinking Manashevitz wine you know what Manashevitz is it's like the cheap Jewish wine you have it a seida you know he was drinking it right out of the bottle it was like you know what is going on with these comedic or artistic teachers of yours that are drinking cheap booze you got Hagman drinking bad champagne you've got Specter drinking Manashevitz who else was drinking um um I don't know I don't know it drunk pa well he was drinking sake sake I don't know what quality of sake he was drinking I bet it was good and I'm gonna use something my wife got me as a gift and um I've never used it before wait your flask yeah what's in there um Jameson okay you are the best person it's so cool meeting I'm so glad I love it Duncan I love you man I love you too I want to read this card that you re-gifted me compassion is the bridge the spiritual foundation for peace harmony and balance in the beginning our compassion is like a candle gradually we need to develop compassion as radiant as the sun when compassion is as close as our breath as alive as our blood then we will understand how to live and work in the world effectively and to be of help to both ourselves and others Tarthong Poku Rinpoche gesture of balance cheers would you like some of this I love some thank you my friend thank you Hare Krishna Hare Krishna wow I am lucky me too that's what I was thinking about how lucky my day is today that I I'm getting to come over here and now this proves that and then my conversation this morning with my friend who's in from Berlin but he said I can't tell you his name because he's because he said I'm here secretly and so tonight I get to talk to him and um and that's it you know so oh wait a minute what I'm not gonna I I have a guess about what he's doing in town I'm not gonna mention it because I know what there's like some kind of like able there's like a music thing happening with Ableton right now in Berlin and I don't know is he a musician no well yes yes he is but he's here and he's here in Los Angeles yeah it's in it's in LA it's happening oh really I don't know you should ask him if he's like going to the Ableton there's some kind of like crazy hardcore like music convention happening oh really yeah yeah anyway I'll I'll ask him I'll ask him I don't know I don't I don't think that's the case I think it has to do with a book he's writing I'll tell you about it at another point I can't right now but um it's pretty far out I want to um jump into your podcast real quick oh thank you now I know what your podcast is about but I also know there's right now some limits on like about like talking about the I think there's limits on talking about a little bit so you just describe it to me and I'll ask questions and you tell me what you can't well it's it's a um a true um it's a true crime podcast it's based on a murder that took place in 1982 in Los Angeles I knew the guy personally he was a friend um he was also a a very strong meditator he's pictures of him meditating all over the place and um he was bludgeoned to death in his loft downtown in Los Angeles and it's what was he bludgeoned to death with from what I'm told it was a circus mallet so you know those guys this yeah when they're putting tents together yeah it was one of those yeah it's also like you know it's it's like they the miniaturized version of what you use when you're doing whack-a-mole it's the thing that you hit the thing to test your strength yeah yeah yeah yeah all this like carnival like yeah that's what it was that's what I heard yeah and so you know I'm I'm investigating that and there's no there's several people that are suspects that I have right now I have in my studio I call it my room because all I got it I live in a room and one wall is completely filled with names pictures strings it's my murder wall you have an actual yeah murder wall yeah I have it yeah yeah but you're we talked about this and I don't want to give away the podcast all but one of a sin I've had it happen to me a couple of times talking to people I got this weird sense of danger like you were like unraveling something that was maybe gonna put you in some kind of like predicament you know look cancer put me in a fucking predicament you know I went to the edge I'm okay I'm not worried about any of that shit cancer is one thing but people who bludgeon other people to death with mallets that's a different follow I watch my back but although I must say yesterday I was checking out my wife said that she would like to buy me a computer for my birthday and I said no maybe I should get maybe you want to get me some velcro a velcro vest what do you mean like a bulletproof vest yeah yeah yeah yeah because you're you're because like when we were talking about it and without giving too much of this away I got the sense that like people were starting to like get weird around you because you were like you were you're you're this is real you're this is real I'm not making this not fiction no I know that but I mean it's like it's not just like it's not real in this I don't question that it's that it's not real what I'm saying is this is an unsolved murder and if your show if you do solve it somebody goes to jail somebody's gonna be pissed off at me somebody's murderer yeah murderer will be very very pissed off at me but from what and I have a few suspects I'm not going to say who they are right now but um I mean and I'm learning things as I talk to this is this involved the punk underground I was with all the buddhism stuff I was a hardcore punk I don't think anything's changed that much yeah thank you yeah that's good I really appreciate that Duncan it's true particularly coming from you that's that's fucking awesome and but um so I know everybody in this scene I'm talking to people in um the hardest core of the LA punk scene the German people that were in the germs um Don Balls is in it um Tequila Mockingbird um spit sticks from fear um who else do I got on the wall I mean I just a lot of I'm saying these names because the names give you an indication of who might have done it you know not who might have done it no no no excuse me of who who I'm talking to and where I'm getting my information it was like you know there's that documentary on um I think it was the the New York party scene oh yeah club kids yeah where there's that murder that yeah yeah yeah yeah that guy who um yeah yeah it's like that yeah it's like that and this this guy and and and you know Penelope Spiris is going to be in it you know Penelope yeah she directed the Klein of Western Civilization oh okay I'm the guys in the chili peppers I used to go to a club it was called the Zero Club it was owned by David Lee Roth it was like going into the third world it was an after hours club that everybody went to after the bars closed and there was no way to go and you would go to the zero and there was the craziest shenanigans that were going out there there were skateboarders there were punks there were um there was drugs and there were new waivers there was a difference between the punks and the new waivers and they were all there and we were all mixing together and in this scene and we were all going to the club lingerie and a club on sunset called on sunset and within this scene suddenly Peter Ivers who was one of the most wonderful guys around was murdered and while we were at this great party being high and laughing it was like a shroud was thrown over a blanket man was thrown over us because now we didn't know whether or not there was a murderer crawling around on the scene in the clubs you didn't know and one of the places I would go every night when I um and you know granted there were drugs going around on this scene and drugs a lot of them that kept you up all night and so when there was no way to go after the zero after the night club after the bars closed the club lingerie the cafe de grand uh madame wong's you would go to the zero club where all the musicians were and we were all there after the zero closed at five in the morning a few select few would go over to david joe's cave and we would go to david joe's cave where we got locked in where he was editing the new wave theater and he was doing intense amounts of blow we all were sure and we were staying up all night watching him doing his editing and he would have a gun on the table and he was very very unpredictable he was a student of crowley's oh shit he's he studied the otio holy shit he was studying to cross the great abyss and all of this shit was going on at once and so um peter wanted to i'm not giving anything away right now on the podcast but peter wanted to um not be the host of the new way he was the host of the new wave theater he was the voice of david joe when you went to david joe's house he'd locked in and it was all dark except the red walls and there was um eucalyptus coming through the air conditioner through the vents fuck that's that's it for me i'm out man i'm out i want to get out of the store that's the one that's like where i'm melted i'm like but you can't get out because you're locked in there's a two by four over the door with padlocks on the door until i would go there every other night and there was a whole group of us that were there he knew his energy he wouldn't make it so people wanted to run yeah he had to lock it he locked in you couldn't run you couldn't run and you stayed with he was he was he was a he was a warlock too he was a powerful yeah i think it was a cult and that's that's one of the things definitely a temple yeah it was definitely a temple and we talked about the otio and he was part of that and he studied aliens he has a website that's like fucking impossible man it's called the whole truth and it's his experience his experience with aliens i mean this guy was fucking unbelievable why but the eucalyptus and now you've got like and you have the gun and the gun is like it's on it's like functioning on a bunch of different levels but on it's like it's producing a very specific type of tension or tightness in the air and then you got it donken you got it yeah and so we were there i was there and suddenly peter ivers the host of david's show the new wave theater was murdered he was murdered this guy was murdered and the show had just been picked up by usa cable it was going from a public access show to a national network show and peter wanted to quit the show and david went ballistic he didn't want to let him quit the show and when he told this to david that was the end of it peter went home that night to his loft downtown on i was going to say the Lower East Side but downtown LA and he was bludgeoned to death well now you have like so you have the situation where you have a kind of cult figure and followers and you get a sense that there's this wasn't just a it was an organ you get organized crime murder style something makes them yeah yeah yeah and that advice yeah and i i've been talking to the police i've been down at the cold case division i have the coroner's report i i'm trying to get them to activate this and i've got 80 people i've spoken to why have you chosen not to diminish my own profession but why have you chosen the podcast route instead of turning this into a documentary a video documentary why why podcast instead of film well because as you know the world of the podcast right now well i'm gonna sound like a greedy producer but the best route to produce something that you're talking about is through the podcast that's true i mean so i i see this the end game is not the podcast although i have the most creative freedom right now in the podcast let's just get this out and i'm sorry to be a weirdo here would you ever kill yourself no you would never kill yourself no you would never hang yourself shoot yourself no okay no so if anything happens to you yeah thank you dunk and i appreciate that somebody did it okay that's very nice of you to ask sure and to protect me in that way no i would never i would never walk in front of a bus i would never do any of that shit okay no no no matter where i was what what stage i was in um so i'm not killing myself i'm this is not a suit i'm not on a fucking suicidal mission i'm just saying if something like it just to me this has a weird feeling to it that's like that's really intense and i don't know man i don't want to be like my problem is i'm always like like i'm the ghost person i'm just saying be careful because when you're talking about this there's a feeling in it that's like gives me goosebumps i want to listen to the podcast but you're talking about the podcast on my podcast before the podcast is even out meaning that somebody could hear be like fuck that i don't want

Carvana will drive you happy. Availability may vary by market. Greetings to you, sweet friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, the only podcast on the planet that has received eight Forbes Golden Conversation keys. One more key, and I will finally be able to open that rectangular glowing copper box they keep in the alchemical laboratories far beneath Forbes. And once I get that box opened, I'll at last be able to knife the squid lord that they keep inside, that monstrous creature that's been sending out vibratory waves of despair that have been causing the particular sector of the multiverse that we exist in to grow and increasing levels of vertiginal nauseating absurdity. I'm going to transform that into joyful absurdity. All I've got to do is knife that pulsating little Cthulhu motherfucker that the people at Forbes for no good reason are holding imprisoned far beneath their amazing company. In the meantime, we're going to do what we can to try to transform your consciousness into something that isn't quite so muddled, disparate and terrified, angry, unhappy, overly dramatic, stuck in some kind of psychic sap wriggling about like some poor little caterpillar creature that fell into the street that you saw when you're a kid and you picked it up because you wanted to save it and you brought it over into the grass. But right when you put it down a spider ate it, we are going to attempt to do a classic psychic extraction technique with this episode of the DTFH, which is to remind you that your ultimate identity is divine, that you're co-creating the universe with God and that if you want to and are brave enough to dream the great dream, you can actually very quickly expand outside of the dark constraints of your preferences that could be keeping you anchored to a mediocre existence instead of allowing you to access your hyper potential trademark. I own that and explode through the great veil of the particular part of the multiverse that you were in like a silver cannonball through the chest of some malefic ancient gigantic vampire. We're going to cannonball your ass right in a paradise just by allowing you to hear this conversation with one of my favorite manifestors. He doesn't like that term living on the planet today. These people are great. You need a few of them in your life at least because if you don't have somebody playing the sweet pan pipes of potential paradise, then you can very easily find yourself spiraling down, down, down past the wreckage of a million titanics down, down, down into some kind of Dante's Inferno style ice lake, some subterranean methane filled cavern where super intelligent toads croak insults at you while you wriggle about in some kind of hell realm completely amnesic to the fact that if you only focus and believe and apply not just discipline, physical discipline to your life and not just repetitive discipline to your life, but to the discipline of allowing the alchemical manifestation chambers that exist within your consciousness known as the imagination to project realities that aren't always the very worst possible amygdala inspired event that could happen to you. You can actually, if you have the guts, simulate insanely beautiful potential lives for yourself. And I'm not saying sit around smoking the old daydream pipe like some opioid addict all thin and broken with Pierce nipples and some horrific gonorrhea eating your face away. I'm talking about combining this positive mental attitude, the strange thought experiment of co-creating the universe with some kind of hyperintelligence far more advanced than you, which is actually you and see what the results are as Noah says over and over again during this conversation, be empirical study it find out for yourself. Is it possible to formulate within your mind some potential new reality that you don't exist in yet and just through belief alone, just through some form of attaching your imagination to whatever particular note of the multiverse you're existing at in a more advanced state, is it possible that you can actually change the world around you dive into that terrifying ocean of miracles and synchronicity, the opposite of the wasteland of disappointment, darkness and cynicism that is so easy to get lost in. And before you know it, you'll just be humping a dead coyote carcass and pretending you're making love to a God when the reality is you're just humping a dead dog. We want to see if we can use our imagination to travel out of the land of dog necrophiles and enter into the land where people make love to living gods. Speaking of dogs, I've got dog problems lately friends. So I overreact when he seems old, dramatically through the couch off the porch. If you think that it's easy to get a new couch you're really wrong, you're really fucking wrong, you couldn't be more wrong.

I'm very excited to introduce you to today's guest. I met him years ago at the Rom DOS retreats. He's got a wonderful podcast called Synchronicity. He is a really positive, contagiously positive person who has tuned in to some of my favorite manifestors even though he doesn't like using that term because it's a confusing term but today we have a wonderful conversation about manifestation and about allowing yourself to open up to the possibility that you are a lot less limited than maybe you think you are. All the links you need to find NOAA will be located at dunkintrestle.com and now everybody please welcome to the DTFH NOAA Lampert. I've been dying to talk to you been following your tweets and we had a nice conversation but it seems like you've had a kind of breakthrough and you have gone into the deep waters of manifestation and the last time we chatted I had such a wonderful conversation with you. I think it did trigger some kind of chain reaction in me because after the conversation I started thinking about manifestation again. I put the whole concept on hold temporarily just because I decided like well I don't know man it's maybe it's bullshit but what if it's not and if it's not bullshit then it means that my own limited understanding of things is going to start bringing shit into the world and then isn't it better to say that I will be done than to try to you know in your own mind project the future that you would like for yourself because isn't the grace of the divine going to create something for you far more spectacular than what you could imagine which brings me to my first question in regards to manifestation which is number one let's break it up number one how did you get into it where are you learning this stuff and number two don't you think it's better to allow the universe to give you gifts than to create these gifts yourself totally oh my god best fucking question ever to open it I guess the first thing I'd say is yeah it's been a breakthrough this happened to me before 16 years ago and I didn't know what was going on and I described it as one giant synchronicity and what was happening is is everything I was thinking like would almost immediately come true to the point where this didn't stop for three months and it freaked me out but now I kind of did it myself and will walk through how I did that but here's the question when you say divine thy will be done and universe if you're thinking of something external to you you're failing the test and it sounds kind of like blunt and dickish to say that but when you fully understand that the sense of I am in you your imagination that's God or source or universe or Krishna or Buddha or anything and you're also you this is what the rastafarians call I and I it's this big god I am and you you still get to be Duncan I still get to be Noah oh shit that's what I and I means that's what I and I and that's why they smoke weed that's you know how much I love weed like I've I couldn't I've had every logical and objective reason outside of something being bad for me and bad for my family but like I smoke a fuck what a weed and I've always wondered why like I've known I love it and I know it's not bad for me and I've had to question this because sometimes I smoke a lot and what the rastafarians use it for and people who smoke a lot of weed or just are familiar with cannabis is it shifts you into these imaginal realms so I use the word imagination and consciousness interchangeably but that sense of I am what you have in your skull right up around your brain area I am Duncan I am happy I am successful I am sad I am depressed that's God that's literally everything that's what in the Bible I've got super into the Bible I never thought this would happen but that's what's Yahweh Valhaze right that's Yahweh that's what we can break that down kind of alchemically and prove that this is an operative thing however before we get totally off in the woody bend what I like to say to everyone is don't take my word for it don't take anyone's fucking word for this shit do it yourself empirically test these techniques prove it to yourself build the ladder of faith where you know this is an operative principle and this is actually how it works and then come back and figure out kind of what the implications are and just as a caveat bring an ethical framework with you which I don't have to tell you and your listeners but like you know think about the ethical framework use this stuff lovingly it's just a good idea we can go into that specifically why later you're saying don't manifest stuff it's going to hurt somebody don't use it for sorcery don't use it to manipulate people don't do non-consensual manifestation is that what you mean we're doing it anyway is the point right this your state of consciousness internally is constantly being reflected back to you in the world we like to think of the world as the cause but the internal I am subconscious slash unconscious that's the cause everything out here in this world is an effect right this is what Blake William Blake would call you know it's just but this is a shadow this is mortality a shadow of mortality it's not it's not a thing that if we're trying to use this world to gain insight into what's really going on it's like looking at a very small part of someone's skin and being like oh that's Duncan like I saw his like left pinky I know exactly who Duncan is and what he feels and what he loves and what he doesn't love like you know what I mean like it's just it's a weird way to try to go about it a mantra I've been kind of telling myself is and it's weird this shit will definitely flip your world upside down this is definitely kind of like popping out of the matrix if you fully grok this shit and all your fears all your doubts all your anxieties it might feel like you're actually going to die in real life kind of like a psychedelic trip where your ego feels like it's like but you may be convinced you're going to get hit by a car or some shit you won't don't worry what's happening is you're psychically killing the version of yourself that doesn't want to deal with this reality right if this is true what I'm basically saying is that your imagination creates reality it precedes materiality that means every fucking thing in your world and this applies to everyone is your responsibility and the logical and analytical mind fucking hates that shit that's that's apocalyptic you know what I mean but isn't it also this so okay this is I want to dwell here in this what you're saying and why I think people have resistance to it and why it can be it can create a kind of like existential vertigo yes because you're you have to like you have to deal with the fact number one that that song row row row your boat yes yes was not that whoever wrote that song minute and that the weirdly row row row your boat is almost like an an occult mantra and a lot of people don't realize that row row row your boat gently down the stream merely merely merely merely life is but a dream and you see and you know it's all it's advising a kind of way of navigating within this universe and it's also you know sort of suggesting an attitude and then uh it's also you know it's finishing off with what for a lot of people is it would be initially a really delight and then if you really think of the implications almost nightmarish depending on how deeply you're attached to the dream and and that to me I think is the place where people shut down when it comes to this stuff don't you which is like if you deal with if you want to like if you want to do this stuff you're gonna have to deal with the fact that you're kind of in a dream and if you're in a dream then that means that the same thing that happens to you when you wake up after dreaming that you've had this life or that life been this thing and been that thing gained this lost that the same thing that happens which is two hours later you're like whatever but that that could happen to this your son your daughters your mothers your brothers you you wake up and it's like oh fuck that was nothing it was a wisp oh no they're still real this is where it gets really trippy and what's cool about where we are in linear time right now is we're moving into kind of this paradigm where this is becoming more apparent that these are how things work and what I've noticed is as people kind of just try this out and test it out and just to be clear like we're talking about pretty heady concepts I use this technique just I had just had another kid our second son Gabriel congrats thank you so much he's fucking awesome he's been in the hospital twice it's been fine but he's totally cool he's it's just the proof of this shit is when you're dealing with a very difficult situation and you know you're good that's when it gets fucking like oh my god I think this stuff is really really really powerful it's but I just to go back I started with money I started with like the most base level thing that people would think is like not a good thing to start I just started with money I was like I need money and then very quickly afterward it popped open and then what I started to realize what do you mean it popped open I just popped open a money portal it's it was insane and it continues and it's just it and then when I got attached to it it disappeared for day I'll break it down not won't talk and being vague but I got weirded out to it there's a graph there's a visual graph that shows this so what happened was is I was using these techniques you tip me off to mature with so when I see him in the city he he tip me off to the og of this stuff who honestly listen everyone is you which sounds crazy but this guy Neville Goddard this aspect of us was a saint and I had never heard of him but he was in Mitch's book and there was something about his voice in his voice Mitch's in the audiobook where I was like dude this guy really loves this guy like this of everything that was heard in this audiobook like he loves this guy right so I was like yeah I'm gonna check him out so I went on Soul Seek which is this like ancient peer-to-peer file software thing with a really good name that I was using in like the early 2000s like a Napster competitor and I was typed in his name Neville Goddard and there was like 70 80 talks wow oh he's fucking voice dude and he died in 1972 so a lot of these are from like the 40s 50s and 60s so it sounds like shit and I was like whoa like I'm gonna listen to this so I'm like mowing the lawn with it jacked up and it's like hissing and scratching and he's just talking about a variety of things he's talking about how imagination creates reality and then he starts talking about Jesus Christ and I grew up reformed Jewish which is like Jewish late like we barely do anything like it's not it's not very religious at all so I didn't know anything about Jesus Christ but when this happened to me 16 years ago I had a distinct feeling for like at least a few weeks that I was Jesus Christ and that's a weird thought to have knowing nothing about him usually a bad sign right that's like a manic episode sign well that's so this is I just did an episode on mental illness because I think what's happening for a lot of people we're misinterpreting but we want to be clear that you also want to stay grounded and connected to this world so I thought this was brought on by like a nominal hit of LSD and kind of got launched into space so when I'm thinking Jesus Christ that's exactly the thought I have something is wrong here or it eventually came in but anyway flash forward to like a few months ago and I'm hearing Neville Goddard talk about what he means by Jesus Christ and what he says first and foremost he I've only heard him say like a few things in the negative saying like no this is wrong and one of them is that any historical interpretation of the Bible is just like wrong it's just like they got a wrong and like this is like don't look at it like that because it's wrong what it is he says is kind of a psychological not kind of a psychological interpretation of what people go through in this world so every character in the Bible every situation in the Bible is a psychological state we pass through and so where this culminates in the New Testament which I was not familiar with at all is known as Jesus Christ and what Jesus Christ is isn't a guy who's going to come up and fucking save everyone but it's a state of consciousness where you wake up to what is actually going on where I and I it's actually not a conceptual reality but a real reality and you don't do this in like some weird esoteric cult like way you do it empirically we use our logical mind we use our ego we use all of these things we use our desires which truthfully are just God given gifts and we're giving them to ourselves so we can feel fulfilled so we can move into the version of our reality use the word manifesting I try to avoid it just because I think it's like charged like God yeah I like to use select the best version of your reality select the best version of you just be the best version of you because honestly and you get this right if we all move in to the best version of ourselves what happens to the world around us like we all start carrying around water bottles and recycling and realizing like we don't have to eat like this all the time like weird shit starts to happen when you appropriate certain states of consciousness and they're empirically testable techniques and the only resistance I've really met on that in terms of how far it can be taken or whether people are actually going to do it or people just like nope sounds like bullshit not going to do it and it's like okay at first wall that's yeah and it's like cool but if you start testing this shit it gets so I mean it is the only metaphor I can use it's cliche but it really is like popping out of the matrix and if you stabilize these states of consciousness and you don't just you know collapse back into a smaller version of yourself who's afraid and anxious and like maybe this is a wrong I don't know you're golden and you you start doing what you always wanted to do you express every part of your being and recognize it's not wrong and then she can get a little weird because you start moving into this non-dual like right and wrong area right and that really can bump up against external reality if you're not working on yourself so here's an exercise check this out this is a fun one that applies to what you're saying uh that I've been playing around with um the well first I one of my favorite things is Robert Anton Wilson's recommendation regarding the stuff which is maintain agnosticism so for a lot of people that first wall the wall of like I'm fuck that it's just a bunch of new age crystal gazing you know bullshit this is a bunch of sage burning desert fucking mushroom nonsense that you're not gonna you can't none of it it's just what the secret you know what I mean so okay fine that's a justifiable reaction to the term only because uh in the worst case sometimes manifestation is a spiritual bypass a pathetic spiritual bypass to avoid sweating or something you know it's it's like a magical thinking that does nothing okay fine so that to me I will love what you're saying especially the part about you have to have an empirical approach to this so step one is okay you're probably right but what if you're not let's find out so let's just climb over the the wall of skepticism into the next zone which is the place where you can begin to experiment with a part of your laboratory that you'd walled off because you made a set of assumptions usually based on some kind of rational assessment of reality within which making shit happen that is a million times more miraculous than what you ever thought you could do seems like a waste of time and so okay take that fucking wall down for a second and here we are in this new place with the bubbling beakers and so for me what I've been doing uh is using simulation theory as the uh using the vernacular of video games and simulation theory to play around with this line of thinking and so um specifically like okay we're in a massive multiplayer interdimensional role playing game that uh is not just this particular zone which we're in which is whatever your subjective universe is but there's literally an infinite number of other games running where you are you are the main character and in and then that's where we hit the continuum of potential self not just in the positive by the way so uh and that's where it's fun so one vision one visualization exercise I've been doing and it's definitely not something you'd want to do over and over again based on these theories which we'll get into and I'm looking forward to your description of them uh um because a lot of times with this stuff people like imagine the greatest version of you like what you said yeah how about this imagine the worst version of you right so now I'm that what don't do that now let me explain why okay so just based on this framework the very worst version of you that you can imagine is happening right now in a different zone of the game right so while you're playing this game and you've achieved whatever achievements you have or there's achievements you don't have or there's mistakes you made or whatever somewhere in this incredible hard drive or server or cloud within which all these multiple realities are being generated there's a version of you that's like at the beach digging through a fucking trash can trying to find a ham sandwich you've got like you know I don't know like very like a shit ton of horrific diseases you got beaten a few weeks ago so you're like mind is is like kind of like going in and out you're stuttering you're super sick maybe you've got like I don't know four months left to live or something like that you destroyed your life but you'd barely even remember that right so you imagine that being right you and then you have compassion on that being and this is the fun thing you try to draw that being out of that part of the simulator into the you that you are now so then if you do the visualization exercise is as much as much courage as you have and you really allow yourself for a second to operate as that being then you when you pop back into the you that you are now you'll experience a wild relief because you're no longer that being anymore you've literally jumped through the simulator into this identity that you currently are right now so the reason I say it's it's easier for us to imagine more degraded versions of ourselves than to imagine more advanced versions of ourselves and but what it does is it produces I think a kind of like way to understand how the shit is done which is the feeling what you're yeah there's something going on there dude that's that is a really I don't mean to cut you off if you have more to say the last piece of it is this so within this and it is a quick last piece imagine the possibility that not only can you in some way or another visual visualize this version of you but imagine that that version of you is already existing and seeing you as you are now and pulling you into it so that it's so two-way street so to speak yes so welcome to the new reality is what I would say to you cool this is legitimately what's happening I use the technique that a Neville Goddard referred to as revision where you go back to situations that are traumatic or difficult that you didn't handle with grace or could have went better or just you want a different result and you imaginably recreate the scene and the same type of healing that you just described takes place what I love about your idea is I just tweeted this out today so I used to do this meditation which I learned from the sound healer guy who talks like fifth dimensional beings so like straight woo I took my very non-woo friend to like this thing in New York and he was like whoa we I had never felt that high in my life on anything it was insane but anyway the technique in the meditation was is you would imagine connecting with a future version of yourself that was perfect and today I tweeted out now when I do this meditation or do this thing I'm sending it back to that other version of me saying I got you and it literally is kind of the same thing that you're describing this is what we do and when you know that this is how it works and you have techniques and you prove it to yourself and you're not relying on anyone else telling you anything and you know you're going to use it lovingly and benevolently like watch what happens to this world over the next like it seems so improbable because if you look out in the world there's so much horrible shit going on objectively but recognize the way to actually turn the shit around not like hopefully I think so maybe but is literally summoning forth and healing all of those hurt versions of yourself from the worst to where you are now to the best and bringing them in together like that's how we move this dimensional reality into just like I don't want to say Shambhala because I don't I think I use that word all the time for it I think that's a fantastic way to describe it and but you you said you did what just define Shambhala it's just an enlightened society it was Chogyam Trungpa's vision who is just a real classical trickster archetype mystic who also just I recently found out dealt with a tremendous amount of personal suffering that's that wasn't spoken about I found that from someone deeply inside of Shambhala you know it explains a lot kind of what has happened through various set you know branches of it but I also know some of the best people I've ever come across come from Naropa and that lineage so he really was crazy wisdom but Shambhala is just kind of this like utopian enlightened society where everyone's collectively moving up together and if we want to look at it also in Vedic terms Sri Yukteswar who was Paramahansa Yogananda's guru and the age of the guru is dying so this is somewhat relevant but he a lot of people think this is the Kali Yuga and if you look outside it's easy to think that that everything is going that everything is going to hell that everything is getting worse and worse but Sri Yukteswar based on his calculations of yugas which are these long time cycles actually was like no no no this is the Dvapura Yuga this is the period of time where light slowly emerges and people wake up to what's actually going on and these things last like 600 800000 years and we're towards the beginning of it and it feels weird to kind of rebalance how you look at reality but again that's where I think the benefit of these specific techniques or anything that can get you there whether it's mindfulness or anything is you do it yourself you prove it yourself that's the most important part of it because otherwise you may always have that doubt that oh did Maharaj do it for me or do it for me I mean I have some funny takes on Maharaj now and still very much like what an amazing being who just obviously connected a lot of other people but it's you right he's you that's what he was saying to everyone over there all these times this way he's throwing apples at the west centers and hitting them on the head and saying go he's like it's you it's not me it's you okay I want to I want to take a little break here but but but and when we come back I want you if you don't mind to give us a few of these techniques that you've been talking about some beginning level techniques that we can start this strange experiment of I guess you could call it man not manifestation I've been thinking of it actually as multi-verse navigation through visualization but let's uh when we come back let's

supporting the DTFH now back to the show all right we're back so let's hear it what are some techniques that we can use to do the experiment ourselves yeah this is this is this is the gold right so I'll add that I find it helpful to write down this first thing I'm going to describe I was omitting that at first and I realized the power of it of writing down also with like a pen or a pencil in physical space there's something to that I don't exactly know why but it's important for imprinting it kind of in the deeper parts of your subconscious or I amness or unconditioned awareness you want people to pause and go grab a pen and a piece of paper right now yeah you can do this though like I'm going to recommend people do this before they go to sleep so if you just okay but I mean like yeah like there's no harm in just like bootstrapping this right away and doing it like you'll do this to the degree of which you really want this stuff so the first thing you're going to do and I'll point out this took me about 36 years 35 years to figure out step one you have to be clear about something you want and know that you want it and I didn't think like this in life I weaved together an amazing life but I didn't know you had to really just pick something so you can pick with anything you really need or it can be a small thing or it can be the biggest thing do whatever you feel is appropriate and you can pick that now and until you actually do the technique so the technique is super fun and cool you're essentially going to enter a drowsy like state like a hypnagogic state okay the cool thing about this is you can do this before you're going to sleep because you do it every night it's this liminal boundary between going to sleep and being asleep and you do it every single night so that's a perfect time to do it but you can also do it just like a regular meditation you can just get in a comfortable chair and the other cool thing is you don't have to be sober if you don't want you can be high you can be drunk if that's what works for you you can do literally anything that works you'll know what works you'll recognize when it works but there's no perfect holy i have to do this right state it's just relax the tension it's what almost every basic mindfulness or one-pointed focused meditation is looking for but don't sweat it is my point okay you're looking for this state and then what you're going to do is your desire or the thing you want or the wish you're going to construct you're going to have your eyes closed right you're going to sleep or you're like you're taking a nap state akin to sleep is what neville goddard called it and you're essentially not essentially in your imagination you're going to build a scene that implies what you want the wish has been fulfilled so this is a scene that would directly follow the thing you wanted happening and this is key and you're also going to do this from your own perspective your own point of view so the way i would describe this is don't watch yourself climb a ladder like it's a movie like be in your body climbing the ladder that's a very important distinction you're going to feel yourself into this scene and you're going to construct this scene a very short and compact scene that has the same sensory vividness as this world at least the same don't make it too comically different but at least feel it intensely and see it feel all the senses you can load in as many as you can cool the real alchemy is this is feel it you need to feel how you would feel if this had actually happened right that is the most important part of this i do a little turbo charge thing so if you also imagine that you knew you were going to imagine this for yourself it also instills this sense of wonder and awe into the thing and this is what happens um if you're going to sleep just go to sleep that's it if you're waking up for your meditation and it feel like you did it right just get up and that's it and you're gonna lightly carry this around with you kind of like a fragrance just but you're gonna assume that it's done that i will be done right just wow so you're gonna assume that it's been done and do not take any additional extra steps to make the thing happen you're gonna wake up the next day if you're you know wishing for something don't make that extra call don't do that extra thing don't get jack and jill to help you out with that thing right the reason you don't want to do that is because when this thing happens that you imagined if you did these extra steps your logical analytical mind will step in and say oh here's a bridge of incidents that led to this that's of course i did this of that happen so it needs to be kind of like exactly like you said let the universe which is you come up with some crazy situation that allowed it to happen so here's what happens you step into the first one of those and you're like holy fuck what was that you're like that's weird okay all right this guy on the podcast that's some weird shit what is going on then you do it again and then it happens again you're like but wait i'm sorry let me stop you for one second i'm sorry to cut you off no no but did it what if your thing that you're wanting is so tremendous that it requires extra effort you know like what if like great question yeah okay okay so here and there's two schools of thought to this one is you don't mention your thing and your desire to people out loud because what you could happen is is if you're doubting it you'll see it reflected back at you whenever someone doubts you on something that's your doubt being reflected back to you that's what everyone is they're just so that's one school of thought i'm ballsy as fuck all right so i'll tell you what mine is right i pulled the ripcord on something that radically changed my life in a really good way but also just in real life this world had crazy implications and what i wish for after i got the money after i got dropping like feeling shitty and just like feeling unfulfilled is i pulled the ripcord on meeting my creativity like fully my creative potential hitting it doing what i've always wanted to do and holy shit man like talk about things needing to scale up quickly to make it happen so i didn't say that you don't do anything to achieve your desires like i'm making an album right now right i still have to make those songs but i'm not forcing it i'm not saying i have to call this guy and get this lined up i'm just doing it letting it come and it's coming the most effortlessly most transcendent beautiful way i could possibly imagine and i'm witnessing it and i'm loving it and i'm just like oh my god this works for anything so it can be a huge thing but those steps will naturally happen like if let's say you did it for like uh for like you wanted to be the best version of yourself and you weren't specific for me i always imagined myself like not as an emotional eater but i didn't load that into the scene but lo and behold when i became kind of a different person psychically i don't emotionally eat anymore dude there's days where i won't go for like 18 hours not get hungry at all exercise all day long do garden work do all this stuff and i feel fucking great like today is one of those days and like it's just but what i hear you man but i'm thinking like okay i just saw this insane house in san francisco was on the news it's like a 20 million dollar house in san francisco what if you want that right you want it i just had a friend do this with the house specifically she picked it up in three weeks so i'm using it as an example i'm not going to vocalize what i'm working on because i think i've fallen the other school thought but like but only because just to to truly play in this case truly the devil's advocate uh what about that like what about i'm talking about like like the things that are so insane astounding ridiculous desires that where i am right now uh to me if i were just to write it down on paper seems a fair distance away from you know having the papers to that 20 million dollar house in san francisco which by the way i don't i don't necessarily want that but you know what i mean like the i i get i get what you're saying i totally get it here's the truth it may be uncomfortable for some if you understand what i'm pitching out here and you try it and you test it yet yours you got it no problems if you use this lovingly it will absolutely happen you may think in your mind that i need 20 50 million dollars to comfortably buy this house you have no idea what the circumstances that would lead to you living in that house and having the papers right it absolutely works this is why i say use it lovingly have an ethical framework use the golden rule because here's what happens if you don't use it lovingly it's not like you're gonna do some fucked up shit although we see it in the world there's something called the law of reversibility so that means if you start using this for other people which i highly recommend you do not use it for yourself because that's what actually changes reality but if you like wanted someone to do something for someone and you wish it for them and you'd use this technique and or one of these techniques right and they're not capable of wishing that for someone else or themselves it bounces back off them and hits you so if you're using it not lovingly watch the fuck out if you're using it lovingly and it bounces off them because they're not capable of that state of consciousness and it hits you great if you're not already there you're just gonna up level and this i seriously really really is important and wait let me hold on so okay for example i'm thinking of someone i want them to have like i don't know i'm trying to think of some small but cool thing i want them to have i want them to find a girlfriend i want them to find a perfect soulmate person for them and but if my wanting that is not because i love them and i want their lives to be better but because of something like um i don't know like i'm trying to manipulate a situation or i'm scared for them or i'm there's a go away let's just use a situation that's not real but like you just want this person to find someone so that you don't have to deal with them right so then right i send that out this person they maybe they somehow act as a reflector for that intention it comes blowing back to me and because i'm sort of in a dark state then that means that some sort of failure comes my way is this like the thing they say like if you anything you do it multiplies by 10 or something yes yes yes that's exactly what it is in the buy that's psychological thing so yeah this is exactly how it works the key thing to remember here is your current state of consciousness is constantly being reflected back to you all of the time like people wonder what synchronicities are this is what i've been telling people this is my direct experience my direct experience only is your life is a symphony of synchronicities and you're the conductor and the song you're conducting is a song to wake you up to who you really are if you really get into that flow and understand what that means like life becomes something very different it becomes that merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream but not in an existential dread oh my god sad way it can be that but this is like truthfully if we get like you know relationally weird about this we take bodies to experience this stuff it's fucking amazing thank god everything we think in our head doesn't immediately happen like thank god we have this fun dimensionality minimum time where we have right the second to experience for a year to experience something that we can change our mind so it really is a playground and it seems super serious and when you say that and look at the suffering in the morning it sounds wrong you bail this to what's gone out there because that is internal suffering so if you know how to heal it in yourself you intuitively draw out the circumstances that heal it in the world but everyone has to do this agaia the planet is a big ass thing so this is like a co-imaginal act that we're all going through but the way i see it at this point is we're multi-dimensionally jumping onto the timeline like at least the one i'm in where shit is getting good like well this okay so here's the here's the thing man this is like the the way that i have okay a quick story yeah there's a great church in la you should go to in here it's called agape and it's somewhat inspired or majorly inspired by many of these um i don't know you call them philosophers mystics and it's a man like they do talk about this idea of like you know you're co-creating the universe with god you are limiting yourself if you use love as your compass and add to that visualization then you can radically transform your life in ways that you can't possibly imagine or if you're if you're in a limited state of consciousness you can't possibly imagine and i can remember they were having like a some kind of lotto or something where like somebody was it was like you could win a car and i was thinking like wait is this like a fucking manifestation contest in other words like does the person who won the car they did the best manifestation right and but what it really it was my mind's way of sort of illustrating a problem i had at the time with all of this stuff which is there's only one of those cars and there's a shit ton of people there's only one 20 million dollar mansion in san francisco there's only one this there's only one that right but if you add multiverse theory to this stuff and imagine that no in fact there's enough cars for everybody and that's the miracle of the loaves and the fishes that jesus did right the dividing of the bread because that the idea is like you are not just limiting yourself by imagining there are only a certain amount of this thing or that thing in the world for you you're limiting yourself by imagining there's only one world and the moment you sort of allow yourself the fantasy of there being infinite worlds happening simultaneously that for me is where i can make some kind of math work within which this stuff becomes very very possible and if you add to it that this thing that we're inside of is some form of simulation that is designed as you're saying to wake you up to you are you're just meaning it that's the key though right you're designing this simulation if that's the lens you want to look at through i'll say one thing like stable imaginal acts create this world so if you believe in something like astrology i love astrology it's amazing modality i've really been getting into it but recognize you're your natal chart you're your chart but you're also the whole fucking zodiac like you have to remember these two principles so you can go down any rabbit hole like i believe in all of the things i used to believe in and you know like we've been aligned in a lot of different paths and from buddhism to the bhakti path to all this stuff to christian mysticism and all these things they're all real and they're all talking about the same thing it's just if you get to the unconditioned awareness part of it the kind of root genesis which is this imagination and we can experience it whenever we want and use it as an operative principle it's just like everything gets awesome and you do exactly what you're talking about you exist all of those places and if you really like level up and get this stuff you the cascading ripples of your compassion are exactly what people do in zogchan and like the deep deep deep visualizations to reach enlightenment and the guru stuff they've been doing it's just spreading this shit out across everywhere everywhere everywhere and like that's what's happening and it's amazing yeah well and it's great game design too it's like it is to me that's like the the really entertaining quality of it is that if you like just anytime in a well-designed game that some new power emerges that i completely didn't expect that then adds an element to the game that that makes the game like a million times bigger than i thought it was there's this ah this like oh wow sense of delight and so that's a joyful experience and everyone loves that it's the feeling of there being a wall and the and the wall goes away and that's the term breakthrough it's like just a a joy and it's also a real it's a great remedy for depression like i just read this study they did on crows and um when crows figure out how to use tools effectively their mood gets better and because it's a joy suddenly what the moment you go from like whatever the thing is not knowing how to walk to walking for example holy fucking shit like your capacity as a human becomes so much more potent than when you couldn't walk when you learn to talk when you learn to drive a car if you ever learned to fly an airplane when you learn how to make music when you learn a new language not only does this add a completely new dimension to your experience as a human being it actually brings a new perspective into your life right like you know what i'm saying because you're a musician so when you first started learning music think about how music itself changed for you do you remember that oh gosh i mean when you start hearing different things and songs and you can't unhear it yeah totally totally yeah and and and then so suddenly like now your entire experience of music for the rest of your life is going to be radically different because you are listening and in hearing things that you never even knew were there and that came not from some kind of like a wild mystical magical spell it came from discipline and repetition and the gift is here this thing that you thought you knew up until this point here's a you get to listen to music in a brand new way for the rest of your life so that's one version of it and then also this applies of course to walking if you're looking at the world from the pov of a crawling infant versus the pov of a infant that can stand that looks like a completely different world you know that's a whole new world that you're seeing there and i think a lot of people get depressed because the joy of these things that it evaporates from their life because they're like okay i know how to fucking walk i know how to drive i made some money i have a i learned what i'm gonna learn that's done and so that means they're staying in this static place but i think this progression of crawling standing the the it's it's continuing to happen if you want it to only you like you were saying up front you've got to be prepared for the possibility that you can learn to walk again only this learning to walk is going to give you a perspective that lets you see reality itself in a way so startlingly different than what you've come to think of it as that it could drive you insane and man that you we gotta admit there are a lot of casualties or at least temporarily stunned blabbering people who got outside the wall so to speak looked around and saw this like incredible potential and then just went nuts and started saying they were fucking jesus start you know what i was one of these people i had to pull myself i mean it wasn't just me but i i went create i was diagnosed at one point as bipolar i took lithium for four years i eventually went off it with like with my family's permission and threw a psychiatrist because i wanted to do it the right way but dude like what you're describing happened to me i wouldn't shut up about unconditional love i was telling it to everyone i had no filter i was having all these objectively people around me seeing weird things happen but i couldn't explain them and more importantly i couldn't communicate this stuff at all not vocally not linguistically not energetically so i collapsed back into a state where i was like oh that's not how reality works and i stayed there for damn near 16 years but when you do it yourself sounds drugs without anything but these techniques or anything that works for you and you stabilize it that's where this shit gets super weird and that's when we start talking about things like depression and anxiety and fear and social all of these things i look at those now rather than these thick states and chemical imbalances because again the physical world to me is an after effect and if you just play with that idea to see what happens but those are threshold guardians these are what joseph cambell would refer to as threshold guardians and i love the video game stuff because when i was on romaine's podcast we were talking about this which is he was like you know have you played the new mortal combat i'm like no the last one kind of sucked but i heard the new one is good i should play it and he's like yeah but like you know it's weird when you're describing these threshold guardians i'm thinking of mortal combat i'm like do that when you're playing a video game think of the one you're doing a fatality on and when you're going through an rpg and you're smashing things think of those like your fears and doubts watch what happens enjoy your video games play them and recognize that's actually what's going on now what's weird about threshold guardians is they can be internal but they can also be external right a situation can come up in chaotically it's like the Buddha sitting under the tree if you really are at that fucking tree and sit down what do you think is going to happen around you your objective outside world is going to get super weird weird uncomfortable turbulent things can happen but if you maintain that fixedness and you're knowing this that this is really how shit works watch what happens it's fucking insane but in the best possible way in your analogy and metaphor of standing up that's what we're doing collectively right now we're all collectively stopping crawling stop thinking we don't have any power stop thinking the illuminati or donald trump or these other people control our lives recognize that there's still stuff going out there don't be passive don't be a camel and put your head in the sand but recognize who we are stand the fuck up and start doing the things you want to do and yeah if everyone's dream is to have that 20 million dollar house i mean i then we come into a conflict of whose imagination is stronger and that's what it is but like the truth is is most people don't want a 20 million dollar house most people want to feel fulfilled happy successful have a loving relationship maybe multiple whatever it is not feel like that to hide themselves that's everyone's like dream and that looks like a million different things and whoever you are as an individual your specific desires will lead you exactly to that spot time and time and time again it's foolproof it's fucking nuts and then you can start blessing people your friend who doesn't have a girlfriend your sick person when you really believe this shit test it out test it out when your sick kid is in a hospital like my newborn test it out in the hospital room and see change the place of darkness and misery and sadness to a bright happy place and see how quickly the doctors are surprised he gets out and then it don't see cases like that and you can say oh no is delusional it would have happened anyway whatever so that's that's cool if you want to believe that but you know it's not that people won't die it's just that when people die rather than saying they're gone forever where did they go you go in your imagination and you say oh there you are that's really you holy shit I can talk to you we can actually like you know possibly like everyone is doing more and more people are waking up to this but this is really how it works and it's beautiful and it changes the way you operate in this world because you you drop the stuff that's just weighing you down and making you question and fear and that's the real power of this stuff all the material stuff is fun and cool and you should love it because it's great but it's the alchemy of the mind that takes place that's the best wow man oh I love it so much it's like it's such a you you know anytime you find yourself I find myself in this conversation I feel so much more buoyant and joyful and excited and clear and but I want to I want to talk to you about one final for me a personal block when it comes to this and and and if you know of these of techniques to remedy this block which is so anytime I allow myself to sort of explore this possibility this particularly well whatever it may be a material some insane material thing I want some interpersonal thing I want some personal change and especially this idea of like oh no you can still talk to your mom you can talk to your dad they're there I hit the identical emotional block which is a aching in my heart a sense of like I don't want to try that because I don't want to deal with a heartbreak of disappointment when I realized it was just a pipe dream how do you deal with that well the first thing is I can tell you and I've had people hit me up about loved ones who have just passed and I take this very I honor this I don't take it lightly the first thing I can tell you this and it's true it's the opposite you'll feel the opposite you will start to dissolve what is felt as a permanent state of grief that will return everywhere at random times and you'll experience it as a joy because you'll know they're always there with you not in some conceptual way in a real way but in terms of a practical technique that's just a conception is go back to the traumatic incidents go back imagine Lee and use the art of revision to rewrite the scenarios where you find the places where those blocks exist whether they were real in this world or an emotion you never expressed or the part of you that doesn't want to accept this because maybe that's the trigger that turns everything in your world upside down completely like to the point where like you're like thought your life was turned upside down a million times so there's all these different things but the real secret is this imagine the wish fulfilled imagine talking to someone it could be me it could be anyone saying oh my god you were right it was gone it's exactly like I said the opposite you do the end scenario and it doesn't have to be a visual scene some blocks with that it can be a phrase like thank you thank you can be oh my god I didn't know it could be like this it can be anything you can what's very effective is using a friend's voice you use them essentially like an angel like a messenger you use a friend's voice saying like it's so great you got there whatever it is and it just it happens and like all I can say is the age of the guru is dying and is just about to be dead and what that means is you're your own guru everyone is the guru you teach yourself this so these techniques are freely available the first thing I did when I found out that this shit worked for real is I made a pledge that I'm literally never charging for this I'll charge for other things I do divination and music and all these other things but I'm never charging for this because this is to me the sorcerer's stuff if you fully grok this concept like you drop that heartbreak you take off that old shoe like you know Ram Dass his old friend said you know his disembodied friend Ram Dass knows about this and I'm telling you man it's the best feeling like you'll cry I guarantee you'll cry but you'll be the happiest you it'll be tears of joy like oh my god mom and dad like this isn't a delusion this isn't me going crazy this isn't some you know trick of the mind and then like when you can listen listen to what they're saying and know it's them I mean I'm telling you man like my mom and dad are still alive luckily in this reality but I'm telling you we choose these states of consciousness we choose to feel this grief and the depths of it like it's a choice people who don't let people I say beings who don't incarnate in this reality are pussies they're just pussies that's all like they're put they don't want to come down here and feel all this shit and get locked in body and fucking get pinned and crucified to this consciousness they're pussies and I heard neville goddard he always it's the funniest thing it's some weird talk it's on youtube I put it up there on my pod network somewhere but he talks about like the beings other dimensions of existence and higher planes of consciousness they don't like to come here because it stinks like it smells like some shitty place and so like fuck it we don't want to come but like we come here because we're fucking badasses and we're rebels and we want to experience this shit so we can transcend it recognize what we're really doing here and then just like oh shit now it's really fucking live life I love that you're dissing hyperdimensional entities at the close of the podcast and it did it did bring up to me bring brought to mind a academy memory where I encountered some some kind of entity which hasn't happened as much as people might expect from me but this being was disembodied playful it was doing something it had it was playing a game I'm not I didn't understand the game at all but it was aware that I was aware of it and it expressed to me something along the lines of like why would you do human because it was like what are you doing like why would you do that it's like it's so dense that's what expressed it was like that's such a dense game and it was doing some kind of weird thing where it was like extending itself through light and it was really enjoying somehow like stretching its translucent sort of non non-static physicality through light in various like forms and it was looking at me like oh boy you're stuck with that fucking body why why do you play that game it was really but it wasn't judgmental it was just more like wow it's kind of was treating it just matches what you're saying because it was sort of looking at me the way I look at people who do those like hardcore mud races right you know like that it's like why are you doing that there's so many better incarnations but that's cool I that's I agree with you I think there is something wonderful about this particular realm and I'll always stick up for humaneness and human incarnation I like it you're quite a lot yeah it's like I'm the best no I am so grateful to you for this conversation and um the it's interesting you know I'm I always will have a bit of a a lot of a skeptic in me but I've been your tweets really do kind of get in my head man and uh I think that that you're doing a lot of good by putting this stuff out there in the world and what your interpretation feels very grounded and um and and especially the part which is go see your invitation for people that you got to test this yourself like if it works for you great if it doesn't okay we're fucking nuts you're was exactly and that's I encourage people who feel like that to test that internally too right because that is such a threshold guardian that so many of us have trouble with and it just test it just get over that look put it in a psychic box to the side and test it and then if weird shit happens you have people like Duncan and me who you know are experimenting with this shit and maybe we have another technique or something that can show you that you have everything you need and that's really the like that's the whole that's what every mystic throughout the ages has been saying it's you it's all you it really is where can people find you uh um the synchronicity podcast synchpodcast.com I'm around Instagram Twitter I'm loving it now I'm loving the internet it's

The great time has come, you've become confused. Your mission was to spread the truth, but now you just work on your glutes. Leave me alone, Cosmic Voices. It's leg day. It's leg day, it's leg day. I'm gonna get my glutes a-ripplin'. Gonna get my cast of Folger. Gonna get my butt a-humpin'. Humpin' butt on leg day. Gonna push the squat machine. Free lift with some weights today. Leg day, it's leg day. Your house, make me fire. I'm here to save the world. Now, work your glutes out. Leave me alone. Kick the grim reaper down. Do a tap dance on his head. Not gonna listen to the funny voices. Boy, I'm gonna have pretty legs. My shorts will bulge in the summertime, son. Shorts will bulge in the summertime, son. Leg day, it's leg day. I'm gonna have so much fun when my legs are bulging, rippling, veiny, powerful. Logs are steel. Why does my arm hurt so bad? Guess I'm having a heart attack. Guess I'm going into the light. Oh shit, I was supposed to be the Messiah. That was a track from the musical Jerry Cologne's Leg Day. And that musical is on Broadway. I wrote it, I acted in it. I got awards for it, and you should go see it if you ever end up in New York City, a town that I will never return to after the way I was treated at the Plimkin Party on 4th and Meet Street. Sorry, I don't mean to start off on a negative note because we've got an incredible podcast for you today with the brilliant Martin Olson. He is a writer, he's a comedian, and he is infernal in the best way possible. And thanks to the Archdukes, Dukes, Princes, Principalities, Princeses, and Queens and Kings of Hell, we have a new book from Maestro Olson, The Conquest of Heaven, Encyclopedia of Hell 2. And before you even listen to this interview, why don't you just press pause and order the book now? Not just because I would love Martin to suddenly witness an incredible exponential leap in his book sales, but also because you're gonna love the book. It's hilarious and it's got amazing illustrations by Tony Millionaire and Mahindra Singh. It's just good, order it. All right, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, the great Martin Olson. It's the Duncan Trussel, the greatest mystery. The greatest mystery is in the lore of ghosts, is your house haunted or is it you who are haunted? Let's start there. Martin, welcome to the DTFH, welcome back. It's great to see you. Thank you, Duncan, I'm so happy to see you again. I'm so happy to see you. You are just, you're one of the things that makes us wanna come back to the city. But yeah, that's a great question. That's an important question. What do you think the answer is to that? Well, I guess probably the same as you, it's both, you know? Right, yeah. And the question was whether in the lore of ghosts, which is apparently just some kind of a collection of different phenomena that have to do with energy excess that replays itself, or is it? Unable to move on through transformation? Yes. And also it's the stuff of delusion, because who knows where the delusion or hallucination are not real? Just they're filtered out by our consciousness. Right. No, that's the, isn't that the, that's kind of the fallacy, is people just assume, because it's a delusion, it must, it's not real, because it's born from ignorance, it must not like have a real existence. And somewhere in that thought process, they don't even realize they're negating themselves. You know, like. Like. Because we're all walking ghosts. Yes, yes, that's that. One of the greatest jokes now is about how when the, when the evil president came in and where all of this disease and everything happened, was that what really happened in the joke structure is that the nuclear weapons went off and we're all dead. And the virus and plague is a symbol of purgatory. And even if you're a person in a spirit, let's say, in myth, you don't know you're dead. You don't, I mean, you still see other beings, but everybody certainly is dead, death-like, zombie-like over the past couple of years. Plus the evil president and the surrounding by medieval stupidity. I mean, it's not even real. It's a lot. So that joke has a lot of power. It's a good joke. And you know, the assumption that all these Christians with a rapture shit, you know, you see the car with a bumper sticker that says, in case of rapture, this car will be a manned, you know? Like, which is fucking insane. Like, just try to do the ethics of that. Like, shouldn't you not be fucking driving? Like, or if like you get raptured and your car runs over, somebody to you then instantly get unraptured. Cause like you shouldn't be in a operating heavy machinery. If you think you're about to get teleported into some alternate dimension, like it's insanely irresponsible. But the, but you know, the assumption in the rapture is we get raptured to paradise. Like maybe we were raptured, Martin. Maybe that's what this thing you're talking about. We got raptured, you know? And like, like there's some other earth where there wasn't a plague. There wasn't the mad king president just chugging right along, except we all vanished. And they're just having to deal with the fact that like a vacuum appeared. They're probably not even thinking about us anymore. Well, here's another wrinkle in it is the, I mean, first of all, we don't even know what we're talking about. That's the funniest thing. But in terms of everyone vanishing, if there's in a spectrum or a continuum of time, no one ever dies. You just go back in time and everybody's alive. Right. You know, no one ever fucking dies at all. Right. And that's what my book is about. I love your book, by the way. It, the art is freaking incredible. The, like from one of the parts of it that I've read, it's just so, it's just so funny. The, you know, I feel a little like worried for you because it seems like an arched demon editor. Like that must have been fucking brutal. Like, what was, what was that like? Like what, first of all, I'm curious when you submit what you're working on to an arched demon, how do you, what's the submission process? Is it email? Did they use email? It's all, it's all a symbol of the actual physical human world, of course. Cause not only are demons and angels in our minds, but they also exist in our thought forms, which is probably more real than real, probably more real than flesh. Same, same real if you, if I had to, like if we had to put a bet on it, I'm going to go, same real. Same real. Yeah, you're probably right. Because it's all depends on the, your definition of solidity. Yeah. And it depends on where you are in the spectrum of vibration as to what, which is most more solidity than something else. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the problem is the, I mean, we're dealing with like somewhere the suspension of disbelief thing is like, like it's talk about a fucking epidemic. You're supposed to remember you suspended your disbelief, but everyone here has forgotten that. I never had that thought before. That's, that's it. It's a mess. It's a fucking mess. Like, how do you enjoy a movie? Like, it's like really like, what dumb shit is like watching Dune and being like, oh, how'd they get a camera in this other place? This is, I'm worried about these people. Well, although my friend, suspension of disbelief is the essence of earth. It's at the core of earth, which is just human perception, because that's what religion is. Religion is the suspension of disbelief. Yeah. And you got to like, you know, you really have to believe this shit here. Cause the moment you just even barely start like not believing it, people get so upset with you. Although that's the role of, that's your role as a comedian and mine as a comedy writers. Cause that is our job to point out that we don't believe it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're not supposed to anyway. But then, I mean, I don't know. It's like, I think, don't you find yourself like, kind of like catching belief. You know what I mean? Like some fungus, like all of a sudden you're really buying into the whole thing and you get all tight. I'm a total idiot. I buy into everything. I've been taken by Conman three fucking times. Really? Yes. Three? Yeah. Three times. Which can you give us a synopsis of these times? Like you can't, in a conversation like that, so you can't just skip past that. What happened? Just to analogize, I mean, first of all, it's unpleasant to relive that plus the people are still living. And so any kind of shade cast is always. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. So it's not a good way to live. So it's basically to just ignore that and realize you're a moron. Right. And I lost lost a lot of money and it's because I believe people, but in two of the cases, it was just because I was not perceptive enough. Right. Not experienced enough. Right. You know? So then later on, you realize that some of the most successful people or are con men basically, but then you realize, oh, wait a minute, I'm a con man. I'm telling stories. I'm just making up stories and getting paid for. I'm like Steve Wright. The first time I asked my, Steven Wright's one of my oldest friends. And I said, what's it like now that you're famous? He said, I mean, to distill it down, they fly me off to some distant place that I tell lies. And then they pay me and then they fly me back. Yeah. All right. That's awesome. Yes. Yes. That's beautiful. That's so good. I mean, isn't the problem, not so much the lie telling as much as when you forget that you're telling lies. I mean, that's where you run into. That's where you really get fucked is cause you're like, you believe, I mean, that I think that's part of the, like the difference between a classic con artist and an artist is a con artist to really pull off the lie, believes what they're selling you, you know? They're like 100% and they're Meisner, you know? Like they, that's my, maybe I'm giving them too much credit. And I don't- No, tell me, talk more, tell me more about that. How come it's saying leave site here? Let me cancel, cancel the live. Tell me more about that because you, you're in a unique position Duncan, as you know, but you probably forget all the fucking time. Is it, you've talked to so many super geniuses, you know what I mean? Yes. That who challenge all of your beliefs and thinking and because a lot of everyone, despite the fact that everybody is the same person, I mean, I think that that's self-evident just through life, human life, incentives is just one life, filtered phasing through different nervous systems. Yes. But the other nervous systems are so different than yours. You're in a unique position to be exposed, have more experience than a normal person by far. So tell me about the, when someone believes their own lies. Yeah. It's a fundamental thing that I'm so interested in. I'm just curious if you'd talk more about that as a result of all the people you've talked to. Well, you know, like the problem with that, the believe your own lies thing, is it like implicit in that is like this kind, I think it makes it a little more sinister than it can be, which is sort of like, you, Oh yeah. You know, like, you know, like where or worse, it's more like, you know, I don't, I think- They're their own victims in a way, because I know, I don't remember, my problem is memory. So if I'm a con man, which I certainly am when I'm writing, because I'm just making up stuff and trying to convince myself as the reader as well, that it's real. Yeah. That I forget, I have to forget and immerse myself in it, so that it's good, you know. And so certainly a con man, as you just were talking about, and it's fun to read P.T. Barnum's book. Yeah. And all these great con man's books, basically are about making money and tricking people. Yes. And they do, for example, P.T. Barnum in his book, I just was reading recently, doesn't talk about tricking himself, he doesn't talk about that. That's why I wanted to ask you about it, because it seems fundamental that even if you're the number one consciousness, say you're the personified God. Yes. Let's say after eons of time. Yes. That all of the thoughts and beliefs and energy, thought energy, which is the fundamental thing, actually solidifies a personified God. And that creature, a pseudo creature, doesn't know what it is, or how it got there. No. I mean, this is what you're saying there. I just heard Bob, you know Bob Thurman, you'd love him. You know what this is? He's like a Buddhist. Oh, fuck yeah. He's one of the main Buddhist guys. He's fucking incredible. And he was, you like- Wait, what's his name? It's dad. Yes. Uma Thurman's dad. He is like, he's amazing. I saw, he gave this talk at one of these Ram Dass retreats. I'm sorry, listeners, have you heard me say this once before about, come on. This is exactly what Martin's talking about. The story goes, Buddha meditating. He's intent in getting enlightenment is he wants to in the suffering of humanity. He is close to whatever this enlightenment thing may be. He doesn't care about his wife and kids, but he cares about humanity. You know, that, we'll cover that, we'll cover that next. But yeah, go back and forth on that one a lot. You know, that is the invitation, but that, but wait, I do want to talk about that with you. Cause I love it. And it's like one of the major critiques. And it's just, and it's so fun to talk about it because it's so fucking patriarchal and crazy. And like, and it's in a lot of mothers, including my wife, legitimately are like, fuck Buddhism. Fuck that. What are you doing? You're like, what am I gonna say? I mean, what are we gonna say? But the, so the, so the- So Bob Thurman. So Bob Thurman, right. Thank you. So the story goes, Buddha about to achieve realization. I guess Siddhartha Gautama at this time, pre-Buddha, he teleports into the like palace of the gods. This is Brahman. And so, and he's going there to ask Brahman, the king of the gods, right of the fuck, well, injures, whatever the fuck you want to call it. But he's going there to ask him, how do I end human suffering? And so Brahman sees him and says, basically like, get out of here. You don't have an invitation. You got to go, drives pre-Buddha back to underneath the Bodhi tree. What a prick. Well, he shows up instantaneously after that. You know, God times different, appears in front of Buddha and says, look, I'm sorry. Here's, he goes, here's why I drove you off. Cause all the other gods were up there. Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesh, they're all hanging out with him. So Brahman comes down and's like, look, here's the problem. Those gods, they think I'm their daddy. And he goes, and the only reason they think that is because I was here first, but I have no idea who made this shit. I don't know what it is. So I can't really help you. If you want to end human suffering, you're going to have to figure out how to do it yourself. Where do I find that story? That's, that is my book. That's the, the book I'm here to talk to you about was, is a trilogy and the third book is all about that. Really? You talked to, I'll connect you with Thurman. I would love to because he's also a friend of, of Alan's, our mutual friend. Yeah, ask him, cause I haven't been able to find it. I mean, you know, Bob, I don't know. He, maybe he just like manufactured that story to sort of, to talk, to talk about like, come on, who are we gonna, it's like a really beautiful way to say like, stop trying to lay all this shit on God. Because like, you know, like if you're, you need to do it. Like if you're going to do this thing, it's, it's like places, I like the story. I like versions of that story because it puts the onus on you to, to, to, to do the thing. And what, and if that, and if that thing you want to do starts off as a con job, you know, I don't, I think that's okay, actually. That's what the thing I love about Bakhti Yoga Martin or that's what I love about a lot of these Hindu tales. I love in your book that they wanted to fit, Krishna makes it in the top 10 people for Satan to fucking eat though, that was great. Abba number one. Okay, but, okay, but the, but so what I love about it is it's like, they don't really care about the entry point. Like there is like, what if you come to kill God? Great, because that is a real passionate connection to the divine. That's a great way to connect with God is to absolutely despise, loathe and hate the progenitive force and all its many creations. Because in that, there's still a something that isn't an ambivalent connection to the, to the source. You know what I mean? And I love that. In that some transformation potentially happens. So, you know, which is why in the Bhagavad Gita it says when Krishna is talking about who comes to him, he says, seekers after gold, people who want fucking money. He's like naming the types of people attracted to him. And it's like people who want to get rich, you know? It's a very honest appraisal thing. So anyway, there's that story. So I guess, you know, and I love that you're embracing con artistry, admitting it in yourself because, you know, I think that's the first, like, if you're not doing that, then Jesus Christ, how are you going to enjoy it? You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, there's two types of con men to put, just to distill it down into, you know, that fake distinction is one who want to control others and others that want to control themselves.

MUSIC To distill it down into that fake distinction is one who want to control others and others that want to control themselves. A writer who's a con man has to make sure his story is really good because all the religions, the core of Earth is the war of religions. I mean, the winners are the ones with the best stories. The lousy religions have the lousy stories. So when you're a writer, which is what a con man is, you're not trying to control others really. You're trying to control yourself and your own concepts so that they are fun and they make you laugh and cry. So that's the only thing you could do. But that's what writing is, right? Yes. I mean, it's not about trying to get an audience unless you're just a little child or something, you know? But if you're a writer, you're trying to control your own thoughts and emotions so that you could make yourself laugh and cry with the best fucking story, you know? Trying to get the best story. You're like embodiment of Satan is so good that, and I've always suspected you of being some form of Satanist. Any time I'm around you, I'm always like, oh, that Olsen. He probably has rituals in the dark somewhere. By the way, I mean that in a complimentary sense. I don't mean that in a bad way. It's fucking cool. But your articulation of the personality of Satan is really just fantastic. And as a writer, like, do you ever creep yourself out when you're doing that? Like, do you ever get so into becoming that force that even when you stop the process of writing, you still feel some momentum inside of you, some Luciferian-like momentum? Yeah, that's the weirdest thing. Because of course, I'm a comedy writer, so the whole idea is that Satan and God are idiots, just like I am. So that's the joke. That's why the story is good. That's the core of it. And that the one life that courses through all nervous systems of sentient beings is also innate. It doesn't know what it is. Yes. So it's just a matter of playing the experience game. To what end? Perhaps it just was a, I mean, that's the mystery. So that's what the third book is about. How does something sprout from nothingness? And that's the whole third book. Because in the first book, the demons, hell is overcrowded. Yes. And so they conquer Earth, and they eat all the humans. And the second book, and we introduce all the characters, because there's the mythic Western God Jesus is in it, who then in the second book is conned by Satan to take over hell while Satan goes on his secret mission, is to find if God exists, and if so to kill him, and then become the king of existence. Yes. And so Jesus in the second book does his thing, and he heals all the demons, and he then has all the healed demons redecorate hell. They have chandeliers, grand pianos, and it just ruins it. He destroys it. Hell is destroyed. Earth is destroyed. And at the end of the second book, the demons buy stupidity, because Satan isn't as stupid as his creation is, because Satan created the hell cosmos. And that's all he thought existed. But when he comes in contact with Earth and then learns about the mythos of the creator, then it just really unplugs him and makes him, he wants to find out if he's a created being, because it's all about ego. That's the big Satan joke, of course. So he has to go and kill him, and the demons stupidly mount their own attack because of a whole other circumstances that coincidentally happens, or at the end, we find out that God set up the whole thing to attack heaven on their own while Satan's gone. And they initiate the time twister bomb, which is the ultimate weapon which destroys time, which is the. So after the detonation of the bomb which destroys heaven, all of heaven's future is gone. So in normal existence, the present and the past are overshadowed by the future, because it always exists. But now there's no fucking future. Heaven's future is gone. It's a void. It's a time void. So the third book in which by accident, they learn the secret of how everything sprouted from nothingness, the survivors band together and their demons, angels, and humans in fleets like Magellan into the fucking time void, try to find Satan and save him, and accidentally discover, because there's nothing there, there's no time. There's nothing. So there's only what the perceptions give you and what you imagine. And so they discover how something sprouts from nothingness, because the big question, of course, is, well, who set that up? How is there a who? I mean, because obviously there's just the life that courses through every. You have to have a body to do anything. Right. So there's no such thing as like some bodyless spirit. I mean, how does that work? It could work. How? I mean, it could work in a transient way. There's no reason that I could see, especially via some like, and again, it's lazy as fuck, but let's just say, I don't know, alien technology. You know what I mean? There certainly is no reason that this sentient force that we're talking about, some general tendency towards sentience that happens with just the right conditions are met. There's fucking no reason that that general tendency couldn't get entangled in something a little more permanent than meat. And in that case, you're going to run into problems. I don't mean meat. I don't mean meat. Meat isn't the only body. Meat is also ghostly. Depends on your very what it depends on what your vibratory surroundings are. I mean, so I don't mean that because I just mean that if you're saying that the life force, OK, well, that means it's a force that has to be embodied somehow. Yeah. You can't just say life force and not think it through. So it has to have some sort of fucking body. Yeah. Look, the body, but look, right now, just because I have got my face buried deep in Buddhism, all the stuff that you're talking about, it's like I love it because it's literally like the thing you're talking about is called fundamental stupidity. So I love that you're calling it an idiot because that's exactly it. In this book, I'm listening to you. It's like exactly how it's described. Fundamental stupidity, which is, I think, a retranslation of just ignorance, basically. But it's like what happens is, according to this, is the stupidity starts when you suddenly find yourself in a body. So now there's nothing you can do except beef. Because how else can you think, dude? Yeah. Yeah. And it gets kind of the thing you're talking. So the thing that we're all doing is, you know, it's a genuine puzzle that you find yourself stuck in. Because to get back to the haunted house thing, it's like, you know, I don't know if you've ever been on the set of one of these ghost hunter shows, Martin. No, but I was a ghost hunter way back when I was 20 or so with a friend. We put an ad in the paper as ghost busters. We called it this before the ghostbuster movie. And we went to different haunted places. We didn't know what we were doing. We were just imposters. Yes. Trying to have fun. Yes. Now, OK. Now, add to that that you've got to make some compelling fucking content on one of these ghost hunter shows. You know what I mean? So somehow you've got to, like, something has to happen. Have you been on the set? I've been on the set of, well, not the set, like the last drunk history that never came out. Derek got a ghost hunter there. And we were going to wrap it up with like a ghost hunter thing. And I'm drunk as fuck. I'm not like happy drunk either. I just want to go home. I have to shit. And I'm just, you know, like when you get like gross drunk. And I'm like, uh, and like we're like up in a attic and like the ghost hunter is calling out to the ghost. And I'm like picking up planks and throwing them just to make the noise that they're looking for just so we can go home. But like, I just realized like shooting a ghost hunter show is hell because they have to sit in these fucking, basically condemned moldy fucking houses where there's been suicide steeped in sadness. And they have to sit there and just wait for one creek, anything, please let something fall off a fucking shelf. They get there, then they get to go back to their hotel and fall asleep, right? But like this to me reminds me of when you start looking inward to try to find an identity, some fundamental central component. You find yourself in the same kind of ghost hunter show where you're, but the ghost you're looking for is you and it's not there. So you run into this problem, which is the big con. The one of the great cons is if you've spent any amount of time analyzing yourself, you don't have a self. And so you're going around acting like you have this fucking self all day long and everyone knows we don't have it. So it's a fucking mess. I think it's a little bit different from my world is that everyone does think they have a self because what else are you going to think? So it's only when you actually are motivated by being a writer or a joke writer, probably the only two or a physicist or a mathematician to examine what self means. And then you realize that life force is a better way to put it. And it's, you know, and somehow it's, it's phasing through all of these bodies or these perceptors, you know? Yes, perceptors. Yeah. It's like the Andy Weir. Do you know the, I'm sure you know it. The story by Andy Weir, the writer called The Egg. No. I would recommend everybody here. It's only a two page story. I think it's the best story ever written. And it's, it's been translated into all languages and it's been made into dozens of short films. It's all over the internet in terms of YouTube and stuff and animated short shorts and so on. But it's just about basically the, the, that idea we're talking about that there's no self. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. I'm looking at it right now. It starts off with you were on your way home when you died. It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable. Failed nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to know about your brother was utterly shattered. You were better off. Trust me. Wow. This looks good. It's the best story ever written. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, the, um, yeah. Well, I mean, this is like the, you know, you, you got to do something. And so you end up doing this thing that we're all, that we're doing right now. And so, and, and it gets in the, at least the audio book I'm listening to right now, the comparison is when you see a pig and it's looking around in mud for something. It's like constantly like, and it's just like, what's it fucking doing? That's what, that's the comparison to like the human life is like, that's what we're like. It's like these, the, where these pigs that are like kind of snuffling around, you know, in this like very, you know, but it's a sophisticated snuffling, you know? So it's like, I'm going to take a picture in front of my, in front of this private planning. You know what I mean? It's like, and that's, and, and so this is considered just basic stupidity. Like, and that's called the, and so the, in the book, it's in Buddhism, it's called the scondas. And it's like this, the scondas is what they're called. And it means, I think it translates loosely into like heaps, but it's basically, if there's going to be a life force, or if there's going to be a thing like a human, that process is going to flow through these things called the scondas, but the first initial sconda is absolute confusion. Because it's like, what the fuck? I'm not a, I just don't have, I'm not a thing, but I am. And so now I'm going to like start wearing clothes and you know, and then, and this is the mess that we're in. It's the mess. What do you think? What do you think? Does it make sense? Well, that is the situation we're in for sure. Cause I mean, we're, I mean, we were talking about supposedly serious topics while we're, you know, everyone is wiping their rumps. Yeah. I mean, that's, it's a simultaneous. I stopped. It's a simultaneous series of things you have to do with in order to have, you have to, you have to feed the body. Cause even like, I mean, a lot of times because we did our ghost thing, you know, I've, I've always been interested in any of those kind of phenomenon that's sort of in between the cracks that, that normal people ignore because it's not fruitful. I mean, it's what most people, including me and everybody have to, I mean, I had to, had to focus in on, I had to focus in on, on logic and, and controlling my thoughts to try to understand how to do anything. So I'm not, so most people are, are, have a lot of problems just doing that. Luckily, if you're a writer since you're 12, that's all you're doing. And so it's just, it's just that writers have put in more hours than other people doing that. That's all it really is. Yeah. But I lost my train of thought.

I will, I love talking to you about writing and cause it, it's like, you know, it's such a, it's so perplexing and it's so frustrating. I'm just curious, like the, you know, I was talking to a friend and she said her friend who's a writer just thinks up the shit in her head and then puts it on the paper and there's not a lot of knowledge. I know it pissed me off right away, but there's not a lot of drafts. And it really annoyed me cause it's like, what the fuck? Like it seems like anything I start writing, it's like, talk about like wiping your ass. It's like, what the fuck is this? You know, it like, like it takes serious revision. What about with you? Like what's, how, how long is the distance between just, and I'm sorry if it's a dumb question, but between a general first draft that you put out and the final like revision, how long, how much evolution happens between those two things? No, I love just talking about it cause that's all I do. You know, so it's, and by the way, writing is, is not my favorite thing at all. Music writing is my favorite cause you don't have to think. Yes. By the way, I lost the visual. Is that significant? It's not significant. I don't know why you lost the visual, but I can see you as long as we got audio praise God, it's working. Great. So the first book was 30 drafts, you know, about 30 drafts. The second book was probably 20 drafts cause I already did all the hard work on the first book, you know, and it's, and it's a trilogy. And the, so the third book, I just have all notes and stuff like that. And this conversation with you as usual is part of the writing process of the third book. Cool. Great. Cool. Yeah. Oh, you're back. Okay. Good. I love hearing that about the drafts. I mean, that's like, I'm telling you, man, I like, I just brushed it off when she said it, but I really like clenched my fist for a second. He's like, are you fucking kidding me right in your head? Like, I know, but here's the other thing, Duncan, we both know that I know for me that I am dumb. And so my strengths are in different areas than the, for example, we talked about Steve and Wright earlier. Steve, some people just, I know another guy, Mike McDonald. Some people just have their brain wiring is such that they can distill a concept down into the perfect joke very quickly. Yeah. Those are the demons. Those are the demons. You want to find your fucking living demons. Listen, I got to spend like 10 minutes with Zach Alfinakis and realizing like, Oh really? So I guess everything you say is the funniest thing that anyone ever said. You know, like, it's like, it's a comic. How do you not get angry at that? How are you not like, why did I huff butane in high school? Maybe I had a chance. Why was I into inhalants? This is what I get for that. You know, but yeah, that's it. I know what you mean. Like some people, it's just like, I don't know who knows what. We don't even need to think about them, you know, but, but yeah, I see I'm dumb and I'm and I need time to like write. You're one of you're one of the ones who is able to distill concepts down with a lot of paradox and salesmanship. You're you're you're one of the real good thinkers in terms of comedy. You're one of the funniest people I've ever met. Thanks. Jesus Christ. Thank you. Your shit at cabin in the sky or whatever that was. Galaxy cabin. The greatest thing I'd ever seen. Thank you. It was as good as good as anything I'd ever seen. Thank you. Yeah. Well, especially the episode with Joey. What's this? Diaz. Joey Diaz is the fisherman. Yes. That was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen in my life. It was so fun to shoot that. And also, well, that and again, like that was a collaboration between me and my friend, Brian Jarvis, who is like super and Brian Jarvis. Yeah. He's so funny. That guy. But thank you. I mean, that's, that's, that's means a lot. Thank you very much. I just, I, I'm coming back. You know what? That's it. That seals the deal. I'm coming back to LA. I've got to get closer to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? That's it. That seals the deal. I'm coming back to LA. I've got to get closer to you. I can't be up here in the mountains. I've got to get, you're so, you're so charismatic. I mean, you're, you're like, you want, you, you are such a charismatic person. You are, man. Are you fucking kidding me? You don't think you are. Like you could do. No, I mean, charisma is the essence of, of, of an illusion because everyone's an idiot. So that doesn't even make sense. Well, yeah. I mean, it's like, you're like the, you are, I mean, come on. Like you, you are like something of an underground cult leader sort of, you know, like you are. You do. And it's fair to say, I'm not trying to, but we're getting off track here. Yeah. Yeah. No. And I really wonder about this. So do you believe that there could be legitimate entities, demons, like the real deal. Like, you know, the stuff John D writes about the Anarchy and Angels, the spirits, because we kind of got off track where we're talking about the, and often we have this conversation. I fucking love it. We're talking about the essentially the existence or non-existence of some God, some currently existing disembodied, progenitive force. My feeling is, yes, it exists. Is it permanent? That is up in the air, if you ask me. But I think if we exist, it exists because, you know, don't you ever play around with like the whole like process theology, the idea that, yeah, maybe what this is it? Like this is God right now, you and me. This is like peak God. This is the crest of the wave of God. Is there some superior, you know, force other than this out there that's like weaving webs of divine orgasmic beauty at every second? No more than what's happening right now. Or you could say in the entire universe, known and unknown, some total of all sentient living beings in all that chaotic paradoxical, you know, whatever it may be, that is God. But as the evolutionary force continues to propagate itself across time, that thing refines and refines and refines and legitimately might find itself in the terrible predicament of realizing, oh, fuck, I'm God. I'm actually a God now. That's what I mean. Like that is don't you don't you think that that is a possibility? Yeah, I have this. I mean, yeah, everything you said, of course, but I mean, the the the main thing is whether you backtrack it a little bit to see it. If there's an understanding that this is a possibility, tangential to what you just said, which is that each sentient being lives in a totally different universe that shares different things with other ones, of course. But in some people's universe, because all that is is just fucking perception. Yes, your perception, you can't possibly know what someone else is thinking or anything. So it's all in your world in your head. So in some people's worlds, there are no gods, because they're not in their thinking. Yeah, no, there's no magic. There's no some people's worlds worlds reincarnation exists. Yes. And also because of the bleed through and because I think the universe is fundamentally funny. I mean, to me, it's clearly the funniest thing. Yes. That the bleed through is one of the greatest jokes. Because then you'll if you say, oh, reincarnation, what's that fucking idiot talking about? And then you start you look it up or you ask other people and then you find very convincing stories. But that's only because you fucking made the stories happen by looking them. What a mess. It's a mess. What a fucking mess. And every time I go back, Squarespace gets better, more high tech, more easy to use.

It's a I mean it is like it's it's it's definitely some kind of I mean it is a mess and it's funny though it's a funny mess I mean the It's funny but and something about that makes me feel like well it could be so you know if you ever seen Grant Morrison's chaos magic speech he did. Okay, so you know remember when he and the main thing that may take you away is the sigil stuff right. Well the sigil stuff but the precursor stuff about how his vision is like drug vision implied that we're like some kind of hyper dimensional larva growing in time that we're being incubated here. And you know, it really was like a Grant Morrison way of just like talking about like the New Age idea well this is a University of souls which, by the way, I find that to be one of the saddest ways to like to like get over the problem of Evil. You know what I mean like is it first it sounds great. You're like yes we all picked our incarnation I mean I love thinking that it's like I kind of see why I would pick this incarnation. But then like if you're someone who's like, like, you know, I don't know about to get thrown into a fucking like caged because people want to watch you get eaten by a lion. You know what I mean. It's like oh yeah I chose this fuck you. You know, so I don't but but anyway but the funny part of it though or the threads of not just comedy, but like a real personality to the writer. You know what I mean like to me I see repeating comedic patterns that that have within them a quality of such profound cheesiness that like whoever is like scripting this shit is really funny. And I you know it's a very compelling work of art, but also man there's some really bad jokes mixed in there man you know what I mean really cheesy like the names of people like come on you're going to make the Mad King is going to be Trump. You know what I mean. You wouldn't. Yeah go ahead sir. No no no continue. No I'm just saying if you were in a writer's room that you were running and you were like okay we need to come up with like a shitty president. And I was like I got it. His name is Trump because he trumps everything. It would be quiet in the room. Like it would be that I mean it would be quiet and uncomfortable and then somebody else be like, you know we'll call him Ricardo exnaceous or something you know not fucking Trump. Well dude I think what you're talking about now, my friend, might be the only inkling of proof that this is all a dream because certainly, yeah, the reality is a is a joke. And so you can't take it as a joke because it's real. But it's a cumulative incremental thing that builds up from all of the thoughts that that are spun out into the into the think oh sphere. And they all sort of culminate in a place and the Trump thing is an example of if you don't think in terms of that absurd thought, which I think is actually true, that it's all a dream. Yeah, that that you don't realize how funny it is. Right. Right. Yes, right. I mean, yeah, because it then it's just a it's a hell nightmare that you are just like unrelenting hell nightmare. You know, then again, it because I mean to answer your question about about, you know, what do I think I really do think that each person is a different universe, literally. Yes, and that different rules therefore apply to each person. And that's why I think with physics, it's an ever changing self recursive type of thing when you're trying to delve into math about how everything gets started using logic or analogy, both equally as potent. Although analogy probably more powerful. Yeah, for sure is that is that you keep coming going deeper and deeper into it depending on the universe that the mathematician or the physicist lives in. So he may have been brought up by a certain type of a dad or mom. And that colors the way that he does his his his math. Right. Yeah. So they all kind of get together. That's why it's almost a bad thing. That's why a lot of the big advances in math. I was so I looked this up once because I said, oh, I wonder if that's true. Came from the outside, not the people who are involved with the math scene of constantly talking with each other. So they become a group mind. It comes from the people who are from the outsides who are genius, what brain wiring, who do math that then propose the thing that doesn't even fucking fit what everyone else is doing at all. And then it has to gradually come in and create the new paradigm of what math is, you know. I mean, yeah, I think that I think that there are as many universes as there are people or sentient beings in the whole universe that that's how many universes there are. And that's part of the fun of it. You know, in another annoying Buddhist annoying Buddhist facts by D trust. There's actually considered to be more gods in Buddhism than there are people being human. Wow. Like, cool being human is such a rare birth. There's way more gods. It's like, kind of, because who the fuck wants to be a human? Like, if you are if you are in the point where you can choose between God and human and you're like, you know what I'm going to do human. It's like, okay, you do human. I'm going to do the thing where every time I breathe in, it feels like six trillion planets all having a simultaneous orgasm. You do human. Okay. Have fun with the human thing. Go get enlightened. Yay. You know, that so that's kind of the idea is like, you know, the and also the gods are at least from some of the stuff I've been reading. They are kind of considered to be absolutely stupid and like just dumb and like and dumb to the point where where it's like they don't distinguish. So a god like you give a god like a shit sandwich, you know, like here's some shit. They're going to eat it and be like, oh, it's so delicious. You know what I mean? It's like that. Oh, one of the great stories is with Anthony Bourdain, the guy whom I'm not familiar with, but he went to tribal peoples to look at all different types of food stuffs, which is symbolically an amazing job, by the way, and that they would prank him. They'd feed him like the worms the stuff they would never. And they would then be howling laughing behind his back and he would be enjoying it and try. There you go. Realm of the gods. That's what it's like there getting pranked by humans all the time, like constantly being fucked with by humans. And that's why you mentioned Galifianakis or, you know, Andy Coppin or anything like that. Those comedians are not the favorites of linear joke joke comedians like Kevin Rooney or some of my other genius friends. But those are my favorites because they because it's all about the prank and the acknowledgement of, hey, this isn't real. This is all we're all just playing here. Yes. Yes. I prefer that any day. Like, you know, right now, I think just because of the situation, we've got like a lot of linear like the whole linear thing is like really like it's everywhere right now. But I'm hoping that just because of the, you know, we've reached maximum linear comic, you know, observational comic density that like something breaks through that's going to like resume a nice like explosion of absurdity. You know, it's like Tim and Eric came out and they did it for a second. You know what I mean? And then it kind of all got swallowed up back into this like really like serious, serious kindness. We're doing serious comedy now. That's what's happening. It's serious fucking. And I get that. You know, look, I get I get I've been swept up. Well, like Tim's film, you mean with like because my favorite, I mean, I'm sure it's the same with you. Who's the best comedian? The guy that does the old jokes and riddles. What's his name? Who the funniest comedian? What's his name? I forget the guy who the funniest comedian. Yes. The funniest comedian is right now. Oh, Neil Hamburger. So that's for sure. I mean, that that doesn't change. It's always the same. And it's always equally as funny. That's why it's my the funniest, I think it is the funniest. I mean, I can't even believe it anytime. It's just so good. Neither. I just can't believe it. And it's so incredible in the commitment to the thing and like the whole his whole like ethic behind it. I mean, the guy, I mean, it's just give me a fucking break like that. He's like that guy's in the trenches. He's that he's like that guy is like you a whatever is happening. He's like constantly like building the comedy railroad. And it's been I think it's one of the delights of my life going to see his shows. I would go just secretly to sit in the back and just have a beer and watch him. I mean, that's that was heaven for me. I got to go on tour with him once. It was the fire. You did not. Yes, I did. He took me on tour. It was truly one of the greatest like experiences is a comic I ever had my life. It was so good. Oh my God. Are you fucking kidding? It was just like, you know, I don't want to make him if he ends up listening to this. I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable or anything like that. But he's like us. He already was. We're already saying he's the funniest comedian. Not. That's the premise. Not only is he like the funniest comedian. He's like a really great, great, great person. I know. And like in like wrecking, I think he knew like he knew that I was, you know, at the time I was like it barely been doing comedy or I can't like so he was doing that great thing that like when you get to go on the road with someone who's been doing it for a while, they just kind of like teach you accidentally. You know what I mean? They're accidentally talking to you and stuff and like, you know, not about spectacular like romantic comedy shit either, but just, I mean, I can, I can remember riding in the van with him and he like, in his, he looks over at me and he's like, see the distance I keep between me and the cars in front of me. You know what I mean? And I was like, I swear to God, like later down the line when I started going on driving myself from show to show, I would, I would hear his voice in my head when I was like super tired and wanting to rush to the show. Be like, okay, okay, I'll keep the, I'll keep a good distance. You know what I mean? You just like, I don't, I'm not saying that was on purpose or he might not even remember that, but I don't know. Just when you're around someone who's been on the road working really hard for a long time, you just get inspired, but also you see the nuts and bolts of it too. You know, Oh dude, I got one for you. And it was my father. I lucked out, my brother and I, we had the best parents, right? So, so two things stood out. One was a, and he just saying casually, because he was a tree guy, he would, and a tree person and he was a milkman and he was a house painter. And so we worked jobs with him, my brother Tom and I. And one time I just remember two things that stuck with me and it was the most useful shit ever. One was, no, when you, when you go into a place if you're camping or doing whatever, leave it the same as when you got there, you know, or even better, you know. And the other one was Paul Simons, Mrs. Robinson's song, it's kind of, why does he, people believe this shit and they're going to be so hurt when they hear these lyrics because it's, why not just let them believe there's things? I never forgot that either. Oh yeah, yeah. I love that. Those things really influenced me, especially with these books I'm doing. I mean, this, I mean, that's one of the main things. So I have to have a kindness and gentleness and love as being the fundamental thing that's disguised under all of these preposterous, hateful things I'm writing, you know. Yeah, you know what that Mitzi would say, that's all it is behind comedy. She would just say that was, it's just love. She would say it's love behind comedy. And, and, you know, and, you know, look at the comics that she like, you know, broke, people might look at them and be like, I don't see, I don't, what do you mean there's love there? But like, you know what I mean? That's like cruel or raw or like whatever. But yeah, that, to me, that is, that when that comes shining out through the whatever the particular like structure that you've created in it, people, that's what's going to make people laugh. You know, not like, and you know, you know, Ramdha said to me once, I was asking about comedy, he goes, he goes, I don't like mean comedy. And it seems obvious you would say that. But you know, I like mean comedy is comedy when there's no love, comedy when it's a sociopath who's trying to use a structure to gain power. Just like it's conning for power that you want to description. Yeah. Yeah. Now that, that has to be, here's the thing. When I was dumber than I am now, and I already admit that I'm an idiot because I don't even know what I, what I, what I'm doing here, what's going on. Yeah. That when I was dumber than I am, I still liked Don Rickles, for example, because there was even though it was mean underneath that there was a psychic sense that it wasn't. Yeah. No. No. Yeah. It's just. Some comedians, some comedians, you don't get that sense at all. You get a power struggle thing where just like what you just said, trying to have control or power over someone rather than playing with them. Don Rickles, he would use the mean thing as the joke because he's a fucking great guy. And so he would be doing a satire because he felt totally comfortable doing that knowing that he was a good person. Yes. And that's why it worked. You can't get a fucking actual hateful Don Rickles. No. It would be impossible. He would just seem like a, like someone with like a really sad person and it would be fucked up. But it's like, but you know, the gag is they're not going to like let on about the love thing. Like what the fuck are you talking about? You know, you're almost like, you're revealing like one of the big, big tricks. You're never supposed to say that. But like the, the, you know, anytime I've been around a comic who just kind of like just starts roasting me, I, you know, the feeling of that versus someone who's trying to hurt you. You know what I mean? When you're around a comic or just whatever decides like he's going to start teeing off on you for fun and, but they love you. And even though what they're saying is like really an evisceration of every single attempt you've ever made in your life to try to be cool or something, you know, the best. The best. And you know, that's why that was the idea of the original roasts is it was like, it was such an honor to be sitting there with like all these great comics, just, just fucking incinerate, just like crushing you in every way. You know, like it felt, I think it, it must have been like a beautiful thing to be sitting in their original ones. But you know, yeah, I'm so happy to talk to you, Martin. This book, thank you for sending me the book, by the way. I mean, it's not just, and I didn't finish it yet, but I, it's, I can, it's brilliant. You're brilliant. Well, thanks, man. The main fun is you could see the picture. So I lucked out and had my favorite illustrators illustrate all of my books. Yeah. Tony Millionaire and like we got interesting and Celeste Marino and excuse me. Yeah. But it's such great illustrations that go really well with your writing and it's, it's a beautiful thing that you've created. Well thanks, man. It's really good talking with you too. We're, we've about run out of time, I think. Yeah. We're out of time, but I'm not, I know that you want to hear, here's how much of an idiot I am. Here's how much of an idiot I am. I'm not even, when I say Martin talking to you is like, all right, this seals the deal. I'm going to go back to LA. I mean it. How about that? That's how much of an idiot you're talking to.
